The House met at 10 a.m. 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand:
Mr. Speaker, there does not seem to be a quorum in the House.  
And the count having been taken: 
And the bells having rung: 
I see a quorum.  
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
Mr. Speaker, additionally, if the House gives its consent, I move: 
Scott Brison, Tony Ianno, Benoit Sauvageau, Paul Szabo and John Williams.  
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):
The first petition deals with child pornography. 
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, the second petition has to do with the definition of marriage.  
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
CANADIAN TOURISM COMMISSION ACT 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
He is one of the most dynamic members of our party.  
All excuses are good for this government which is looking for visibility. 
Fortunately, within the caucus, some ministers are not following the flock. 
At that time, Hochelaga-Maisonneuve went through a process of industrial dequalification. 
We benefited from the presence of the Olympic stadium. 
We will recall that in 1976 the Olympic Games were held in Montreal. 
Of course there is also the Old Montreal. 
That is a very important tourism centre. 
In the 1990s, I was personally involved in my community. 
The Olympic Stadium is located on Pierre-de-Coubertin Street. 
That strategy has been adopted by the economic decision makers.  
Why do I talk about that? 
The roaring twenties brought us the wonderful Bolduc. 
One cannot imagine the impact this singer had on our folklore. 
She was one of the first artist to penetrate the American market. 
Mr. Speaker, you are indicating that I have only a minute left. 
I do not know if any of you saw the report on RDI yesterday. 
Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Quebec East, BQ):
In Quebec, the agency known as Tourisme Quebec was established and is working very well. 
We have considerable attractions.  
These actions were successful. 
I must say that Tourisme Quebec has consolidated the efforts. 
Why bother an agency that is working well? 
That is all this commission is. 
I would like to make two quotations, including one by Pierre Elliott Trudeau. 
There are huge amounts of money sent back through programs. 
In addition to this, there are also a series of agencies and offices. 
This money is being spent by agencies close to this government. 
For instance, what does Attraction Canada do? 
The list goes on and on. 
The amounts are huge. 
There is also Operation Unity. 
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
It is an instrument that pulls us all together. 
It is an instrument that helps us to understand each other in a better way. 
It would work against the separatist ideology.  
We are going through a massive renewal of the waterfront in downtown Toronto. 
Gateway to the New Canada''. 
It is a tourism destination which economically benefits the entire country.  
It was a benefit to every part of our country.  
This would do a number of things. 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
As we know, tourism is a rapidly expanding industry all over the world. 
People around the world are increasingly aware of this.  
Tourism can be seen from different angles.  
They will be stunned by their beauty. 
The federal riding of Charlesbourg is exceptional for tourism. 
The backdrop to all this is an incredible fiscal imbalance.  
I must wrap up my remarks because time is unfortunately running out. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Adventure is now an important tourist attraction. 
The bill is rather odd. 
I worked there for a few years. 
Another important element is to promote awareness of tourist products and knowledge of tourist clienteles. 
That is the role of Tourisme Quebec.  
This is another important element in the mandate of Tourisme Quebec. 
Tourisme Quebec has a very clear mandate. 
For Montreal, where my riding is, the situation is somewhat different. 
Big cities have an office du tourisme to promote them.  
In conclusion, I have to say that I am rather worried. 
The commission's goal also worries me. 
That also worries me.  
Why fix what is working in Quebec? 
Tourism in Quebec is doing well. 
Is the House ready for the question?  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
And the bells having rung: 
SALES TAX AND EXCISE TAX AMENDMENTS ACT, 1999 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
This bill does just that.  
This bill builds on the spirit of that initiative.  
These provinces are also increasing their taxes on cigarettes by comparable amounts.  
These changes will help to ensure that Canadian businesses remain competitive in the international marketplace. 
In consultation with the tourism industry the visitors rebate program was reviewed. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):
Bill C-24 is actually a budget implementation act. 
All the media come and set up their big tractor trailer units with their dishes. 
It is called budget day. 
That is the big picture of the budget. 
I think most of the members in the House presently would probably be silent.  
I would however point out that this really is a very one-sided affair. 
When it is announced in the House of Commons instantly becomes de facto law. 
These decisions are made behind closed doors and then it becomes de facto law.  
In other words, what he says is then law. 
We have new rules imposed on Canadians without any real input.  
We are then asked to vote, usually on its entirety.  
We thought that was an important first step. 
I believe that every Liberal member at that time voted against our motion. 
There is another reason that it is very difficult to hold the government accountable. 
Up until now campgrounds were not included in this.  
That is how it starts. 
``camping accommodation'' means a campsite at a recreational trailer park or campground- 
And then we have this parenthetical phrase: 
That is how this thing starts but then it becomes convoluted. 
Mr. Speaker, do you know what I said? 
Do you understand what I just read? 
I defy them to read it.  
I would like to meet that person. 
That is only one example. 
It goes on and on. 
These are really strange things. 
It goes on and on for four or five pages.  
Subparagraph 252.1(13) 
For example, the top of page 98 states: 
(5) Subsection (2) is deemed to have come into force on November 26, 1997''.  
(6) Subsection (3) is deemed to have come into force on April 1, 1997.  
(7) Subsection (4) is deemed to have come into force on December 17, 1990.  
That is over 10 years ago. 
The whole bill is full of this.  
I resent the tax exemption on camping facilities. 
If the space is worth it, we should all pay the same amount. 
They are priced right out of it. 
I do not know if you were one of those, Mr. Speaker. 
However, I think of all those other Liberals. 
Should I call them the green foreheaded Liberals over there? 
At least I see a lot of green, so that must reflect their foreheads.  
It will be gone''. 
They paid for the election campaign.  
The point I making is this. 
The GST is a very much hated tax. 
That is why Canadians voted for them. 
I would like to share this with hon. members. 
We recently had a funeral in our family. 
However, there are some revisions.  
The GST is everywhere. 
The government has no intention of reducing or removing it. 
It loves the revenue. 
There is nothing that the government does not like to tax.  
Here is an interesting one. 
I want to say a bit about the tax on cigarettes. 
The government tells us that this has had some effect. 
Bill C-24 will once again increase cigarette taxes. 
I think that is something the government should think about.  
The bill also provides for a tax rebate for charities. 
I would like to see the Liberals actually implement their election promise. 
I would ask for that. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Elk Island has requested unanimous consent to move a motion. 
Mr. Speaker, I am surprised. 
I am really surprised. 
They ran on that election promise. 
It is illustrative of the things the government does. 
Canadians felt so good about that. 
That is the messaging the Liberals do. 
Why did it not do that? 
Way back in 1997 there was the announcement of the millennium scholarship fund. 
But they did not. 
The Liberals' mandate ends in the next year or two. 
It is very presumptuous of him to make promises of accumulated tax cuts. 
Unfortunately, feeling good does not affect our economy. 
That only happens when they actually get the tax cut.  
Finally we are implementing the things that they promised three years ago.  
The conclusion is simply that Bill C-24 is not good enough. 
It is a bill that has one or two good provisions as I said. 
It has not happened. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
We do not normally resort to this sort of vocabulary over nothing.  
I remind the House of what the Minister of Finance was saying at that time. 
He said he was anticipating a $14 billion deficit for 1997. 
Guess what he got at the end of the fiscal year. 
We will wait till next year''.  
They said that they had to be re-elected.  
The EI surpluses were generated by the contributions of employers and workers.  
He had told us in this House ``Wait. 
We expected the Minister of Finance to come up with something in the 1997 budget. 
Why did we say that?  
The Prime Minister's ego is gigantic. 
He wanted to leave his mark. 
Negotiations with the Quebec government lasted several months. 
The quarrelling lasted several months. 
They have been hunted down. 
They have been hunted down like criminals.  
It would be a shame and we would lose sleep over it. 
Why such a severe judgment once again? 
As we said back in 1999, the Liberals do not keep their word. 
This is what lies behind the three budgets of the Minister of Finance. 
He could have corrected this injustice. 
He could have had the tax thresholds raised. 
He did not do so. Why? 
This does not make any sense.  
I can already tell you that there will be tax cuts''. 
Yes, but what exactly are these tax cuts? 
This is what we have to look at.  
He told us he would eliminate the 5% surtax on personal income. 
But those who have more leeway are not the taxpayers who are experiencing real problems. 
That is how the country's finances were put back on an even footing.  
It was not his talent or intelligence. 
A puppet could have done the same thing. 
No one is to be congratulated on these three budgets. 
We certainly do not have to support them. 
I wonder how they manage.  
It represents $2 billion for Quebec. 
Admittedly, this is a political decision. 
In short, there were all sorts of good reasons.  
But when it did so, it had to adjust its tax structure. 
How did the Government of Quebec do that? 
By increasing certain taxes payable by businesses in Quebec. Let me give an example.  
Taxes on the profits of these businesses had to be adjusted. 
That was a necessary measure to maintain a stable tax base.  
Taxes on gasoline and cigarettes also had to be adjusted. 
This is where the fundamental difference lies. 
At the 1996 summit in Quebec, there was unanimity. 
This led to another problem. 
I want to say a word on the year 2000 budget. 
That budget did not solve any of the problems that I mentioned. 
In the year 2000 budget, the government announced the elimination of certain cuts. 
We have good reasons for doing so. 
I keep thinking about Mr. Monty and I do not know why. 
Probably for a number of reasons, but for that one in particular.  
That $2 billion is precisely what it took to acquire CTV. 
The minimum taxation levels are unfair. 
The Government of Quebec did an excellent job in this area. 
The federal cutoff is $13,700.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
What we have here is another example of a broken Liberal promise. 
The Economist magazine went on to list them. 
The current government has utilized those policies to eliminate the deficit.  
In fact I am quite pleased that it maintained them. 
Unfortunately its original ideas are seldom sound and its sound ideas are never original.  
I think that is a sad state of affairs.  
We need a significant level of corporate tax reduction.  
The most recent budget reduced corporate taxes somewhat over a period of years. 
The taxation of capital in itself is of dubious benefit. 
Some 7.5 million Canadians are shareholders of those banks directly or indirectly.  
The capital gains tax issue needs to be addressed. 
That better country may not be Canada. 
These measures were announced on March 20, 1997. 
Most of them relate directly to Atlantic Canada and Nova Scotia in particular. 
By and large the measures are revenue neutral changes. 
It is time to significantly raise the basic personal exemption in Canada. 
It is absolutely atrocious how much people are being taxed. 
Canada needs to redefine its middle class. 
Clearly that is unacceptable and that is part of the problem.  
What we have seen develop in Canada is a fairly mediocre system for everybody. 
While it is egalitarian, it is a poor system. 
Economic performance is more important than economic symbolism.  
We have to get our fundamentals right. 
We also need a more effective health care system which recognizes the current realities.  
The fact is that Canada already has a two tier health care system. 
We need significant levels of economic reform on the fiscal front. 
We need sound and firm debt reduction targets. 
That is only going to be accomplished with a more visionary, courageous government. 
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
Like him, I am worried.  
I cannot understand this talk about inventing tax reform. 
This is another given. 
That was the last, as far as I recall. 
Of course, there was the GST, which was introduced in 1984, I believe.  
So perhaps the government has to decide to take an approach other than tax reform. 
I do not know what. 
It must not come to that. 
I ask the member to tell me what the magic formula is.  
I cannot imagine anything other than what we have now. 
I am not a tax expert and I humbly ask him to enlighten me. 
I am open to his comments.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his excellent points and questions. 
He has raised a couple of very important issues.  
Since then we have seen amazing changes in the Canadian economy. 
It is clear that we do need some level of reform.  
The GST was a significant change as well. 
There was a consensus on the GST. 
I can point to a few examples. 
There are examples closer to home. 
I would argue that we can reduce some types of taxes without reducing revenue overall. 
Another example of that is capital gains taxes. 
Unfortunately tax reform is usually based on political criteria as opposed to economic criteria. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
In reflecting upon that, I looked at the growth in the deficits. 
There had been no action on the deficit whatsoever. 
The public debt had increased significantly. 
Taxes had been increased, the EI premiums to name one, and other taxes.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
That was indeed a softball question.  
I would not be so audacious as to say that myself. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
It is just a few short lines so I will read it. 
The majority report of the finance committee states: 
That should not give Canadians any comfort. 
That is a myth that has been perpetrated. 
Frankly, ordinary working Canadians are used to being trickled on. 
These trickle-down economics are a continuation of the same line of thinking.  
That would be a laudable pursuit. 
That would be a laudable concept. 
It is an emergency in our criminal justice system. 
That is not a priority. 
We have not heard it expressed here. 
Frankly, there is nothing contradictory to the NDP talking about tax fairness. 
It is an unelected body. 
People call Thomas d'Aquino the unofficial prime minister. 
The NDP caucus rejects the committee's unbalanced approach. 
It will make that rift even wider. 
We believe that society moves forward genuinely when we all move forward together.  
We have a surplus budget situation. 
Is there money budgeted and allocated to clean up, finally, the Sydney tar ponds? 
Or, are we satisfied to have a Cape Breton version of the Love Canal? 
I do not think so. 
It is useful to look at where the government's budget surplus actually came from. 
The employment insurance system is broken. 
It is completely defunct. 
It is only a cash cow for the government. 
What kind of an insurance fund is that? 
You would think you had been cheated. 
You would think you had been robbed. 
You would be outraged. 
That is exactly the situation in which working people find themselves.  
In fact, the figures are worse than that. 
No wonder there is a surplus. 
That surplus is $600 million per month; not per year, per month. 
At the very worst it is fraudulent. 
Tonight there will be a vote on this issue. 
We know where the money came from that gave this budget its surplus. 
It came out of the pockets of working people. 
The whole issue of tax reform is a necessary debate. 
We are very concerned about it. 
I can give an example of what a difference fair taxation can make. 
After taxes and transfers, that ratio falls to 8:1. 
We believe that changes should be made in that direction.  
Yet we have chosen to go in the opposite direction. 
They are so marginalized and disenfranchised that they do not vote at election time. 
I want to voice our strong opposition to Bill C-24. 
It takes us further away from the idea of tax fairness. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The member talks about tax relief for rich or wealthy Canadians. 
The facts do not support that. 
The EI fund was in deficit. 
The total accumulated surplus will exceed $39 billion at the end of this year. 
The member is absolutely right again. 
There is no separate EI fund. 
All the money goes into general revenues. 
In the worst case scenario it is out and out fraudulence. 
Who is this benefiting the most? 
Obviously the high income earner.  
She pays $600 per quarter in taxes every year. 
At the end of the year she owes $1,500. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Canadian Alliance):
It is a tax and it goes into the federal coffers.  
It should be corrected. 
I would like the hon. member to comment on that.  
Mr. Speaker, I could not agree more with the hon. member. 
They have to pay into it. 
They have no choice. 
They would think they had been cheated, that they had been robbed. 
That is fundamentally wrong.  
The hon. member pointed out some kind of geographical discrimination in a sense. 
There are other inequities in the program which are just as glaring. 
The hon. member is right. 
It ceases to become an insurance program. 
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
For example, we do not ever talk about the real cost of production. 
I think there are questionable ways in terms of how the government measures growth.  
We can tie GDP to disasters, for heaven's sake.  
Productivity is not the issue. 
Canadian workers are some of the most productive in the world. 
It is misleading and I would say intellectually dishonest.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance):
It was mentioned by the previous speaker. 
Here we are some seven years later and we are still looking at the GST. 
They voted often on that basis. 
It is not surprising that Canadians feel overburdened by taxes from the government. 
The GST is a good example. 
The member has 16 minutes remaining when the debate continues later.  
ORGANIZATION OF AMERICAN STATES

Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Canadian Alliance):
They are sick and tired of the games that the Liberals and Tories play.

PUBLIC SERVICE ALLIANCE OF CANADA 
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, the veterans affairs minister's worst fears have been realized. 
ACOA has already become the Atlantic Canada overblown agency.  
These are not exactly small fries.  
Why is taxpayer money being used to subsidize these massively profitable corporations?  
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, let me make it clear. 
This government confiscates Canadians' money through high taxation. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
It seems that the federal government would like to spread the cash around. 
It is not just limited to huge corporations and more government.  
Jimmy Hoffa would be proud of that.  
They are opposed to any assistance at all to our fishermen. 
They are opposed to assistance to our farmers in western Canada, not one penny.  
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):
Does the minister not know the difference between a grant and a loan? 
The grants were given under the Tories.  
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, that is very interesting. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we had allegations about this project and it was investigated by officials. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):

Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the reports are disturbing. 
The violence that is talked about in these reports is unacceptable. 
However, we must ensure that these particular cases are dealt with.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is no such policy of concealment. 
The boards of directors of these family resources are controlled by the spouses. 
We put some $17 million a year into these 42 resource centres.

Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Three minutes ago, Paris Star was still in business. 
We phoned Economic Development Canada. 
Everyone is assuring us that Paris Star never went bankrupt.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Perhaps it was that those workers were laid off. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
What does the government have to say to justify the $700,000?  
You will remain under the authority of the joint board. 
Your seniority at Paris Star will be transferred to the new partnership''.  
And we are told- 
The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, it looks like the Liberal government has been hit by the love bug. 
You know what the love bug is. 
Need I say more? 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
KPMG provided an independent assessment of the criteria. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):
What kind of compatible culture is this spokesperson talking about? 
Is it the culture of ``You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours''? 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are talking about a strategic alliance. 
This has been in the air for six weeks. 
It was in the March 29 press release of the EDC.  
I knew that Conrad Black owned a lot of newspapers in this country. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, really, there are some limits.  
The government representative says things are being concealed. 
The two letters: the president of one company and the president of the other. 
I want to know who is hiding what here? 
Who is hiding invoices here? 
Who is hiding the truth? 
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the letters were made public yesterday. 
They should wake up.  
Does golf and grants not ring a bell with the Prime Minister? 
He should know about that; it is close to home.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, actions speak louder than words. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, the health minister says that he cares. 
Two years ago the federal government announced that it would send out compensation. 
The only people who have been paid to this point are the lawyers. 
The forms just went out last week to the actual victims.  
This minister and his government have no conscience. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
That is not only sensible, that is compassionate.  
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
At this time it is especially true for marina operators.  
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
I think this is good news for Ontario. 
It could not have been done without the strong effort of Ontario members of parliament.  
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Canadian Alliance):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
I suggest the hon. member engage in the debate rather than ask spurious questions.  
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, as a matter of fact I am paying attention. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
They all have different points of view. 
We listen to Canadians.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, we will see about that. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
I am now informed there are no active TB cases in Cold Lake.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Mr. Speaker, that is strange. 
We have a mother calling saying that her son has it. 
These diseases have been kind of forgotten by Canadians. 
Therefore they are not being immunized for them.  
Our soldiers on the ground in Kosovo are being exposed to these diseases. 
What exactly has been done to protect them in theatre?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Full medical services are provided for them.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):
The report obviously is based on specific cases of abuse.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
The short answer is yes, Mr. Speaker. 
This report raises some disturbing incidents. 
We do not find them acceptable. 
We will not tolerate violence. 
We will not tolerate domestic abuse.  
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the information is not accurate.  
Many applications have not been fully completed and filled out as they should be. 
A number of requests are under consideration at this time.  
The hon. member for Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar.  
Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
That came from the members of the committee.  
These are things that parliament is doing to regulate the airline industry.  
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the minister of fisheries. 
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
This is an area we are looking at very closely.  
We do not want to increase the capacity. 
Safety is an important concern. 
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale, Lib.):
Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his interest in this matter.  
It is the policy of the government to see an expansion in the family class. 
However, immigration is a shared jurisdiction with the provinces. 
It is important that all of the provinces participate with us.  
AMENDMENTS TO BILL C-3 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
I have a series of questions but no answers. 
I hope you are going to be able to enlighten me, Mr. Speaker. 
Once again, these questions involve the confidential nature of the work of the legislative counsel. 
This will not take long, and I know it will be of interest to you.  
The bill in question is Bill C-3, the Young Offenders Act. 
In late April, legislative counsel Richard Dupuis- 
I would like to hear what the point of order is.  
One thing is sure, he has them, because he faxed them to me. 
This is what I would like you to answer, Mr. Speaker. 
It is now before the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. 
All the members will hear the same response.  
SALES TAX AND EXCISE TAX AMENDMENTS ACT, 1999 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Ottawa and the provinces have needs to meet. 
What is the result of these cuts? 
The result is that the provinces are feeling the crunch. 
But the primary source of the problems in health is the federal government. 
We could go on like this in several areas. 
Unfortunately for them, they have been bought off. 
That is what has happened. 
For example, there is the harmonization of the GST with the QST. 
This aid represents $423 per inhabitant. 
This is not what Quebec is asking. 
The Government of Quebec asked for $2 billion in compensation. 
It is utterly surrealistic, but it is the way Canadian federalism works. 
We think we are, but we are prepared to submit the dispute to arbitration''. 
It was reasonable and it was right.  
I am delighted to see the Liberal member nodding his approval. 
It was circulated to gas stations, community groups and several people. 
Why give tax breaks when they do not mean anything? 
That quorum should be made up of Liberal members. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Charlesbourg has called quorum.  
And the count having been taken: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We do not have quorum. 
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We now have quorum.  
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Canadian Alliance):
Maybe I should call quorum.  
Somebody is calling ``stand up''. 
Members on that side of the House claim to have the world monopoly on tolerance. 
Listen to them calling things like that. 
They really need to rethink their approach entirely.  
This is a place of the parties. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The pot should not call the kettle black.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
What a testy group we are today.  
They are not true debates. 
The things that are being said here today have no impact on the final vote. 
This place is almost a joke. 
It also increases the excise tax on cigarettes.  
Will he stand in his place right now and answer that question? 
I can see that he just sits there and does absolutely nothing.  
I want to mention to him that in late December 1998 an affiliate- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sorry but I need to interrupt the member. 
I know the hon. member for North Vancouver would not want to do that.  
Is it that the RCMP are incompetent? 
I just hope the Deputy Prime Minister can give us an answer to that question.  
One of the questions had to do with cigarette taxes.  
That was passed strongly with about a 75% or 80% pass rate.  
It actually has to spend it on education.  
That passed by 65%. 
They got tough on juvenile crime. 
It appears to be doing its job down there.  
He is still supporting it after all these years.  
It is a shame he did not put a date on it at the time. 
Unfortunately, again no date was given. 
It is about Canada's debt. 
The title on it is ``Budget '89''. 
That was 11 years ago. 
Here is the real kicker. 
As we all know, he did an abysmal job. 
The debt continued to mushroom. 
It also mushroomed under this government. 
We could probably build 100 brand new ones. 
It is all because of this terrible debt. 
Because of that our social programs are under stress. 
It is almost hypocrisy what goes on here with the attacks. 
It is the taxpayer who pays. 
Certainly I will be voting against Bill C-24. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
That is the danger of referenda, as we see in the United States.  
The member is perfectly correct. 
The Americans love referenda. 
Governments controlled all of the means of distribution of information.  
Sometimes they make decisions that the politicians are unwilling to face. 
In Canada that is a hot potato that we do not want to touch. 
We would rather it just went away. 
But the people of California have every opportunity to reverse that. 
I believe that is roughly the right figure.  
What do the citizens of Canada get out of that? 
They get the will of the Prime Minister's office imposed upon them. 
That is what happens from this place. 
I am not referring to him as a demagogue. 
I am not disparaging his remarks.  
It led to terrible results.  
The very point of all this is that demagoguery is a real thing. 
It was exercised in ancient Greece. 
The ancient Greeks recognized it for what it was. 
I think we have advanced beyond that. 
We cannot do that by referenda.  
He keeps hearkening back to history. 
He even went back as far as the Greeks this time. 
We live in a totally different era. 
He mentions that some of the people are poorly informed. 
I will give him an example. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEE PROTECTION ACT 
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
According to the minister, the legislation will be tougher on criminals. 
I have my doubts. 
The provisions of Bill C-31 on security are inadequate. 
This is hardly a surprise. 
When danger arose, we took action.  
Clause 31 deals with those inadmissible on the grounds of having violated human rights. 
Clause 31(1)(c) reads: 
Perhaps the minister could clarify ``a representative''. 
Is a representative a government official or is it a national of that country?  
What does she mean by serious criminality? 
How many criminals are passing through? 
How many are there and where are they? 
As a national party, we are concerned about these potential criminals.  
What is the hon. member talking about? 
That is why identifying these individuals at first contact is of prime importance. 
The recommendation passed unopposed at committee. 
Members were supportive that it be included in the bill. 
Fingerprints and photographs must be provided for in the new bill. 
It must be law. 
Our party's second proposal at committee involved safe third countries. 
These individuals would have a safe haven in a safe third country.  
The thinking behind the safe third country provision is that it is mutually beneficial. 
Allow me to explain these serious issues.  
Approved doctors carry out examinations and forward their advice to the officers. 
What new diseases are routinely transported to Canada? 
We are not satisfied that sufficient preventive measures are taken in the new bill.  
When will the criteria for medical admissibility be updated? 
What health conditions does the minister consider to be dangerous to public health? 
What diseases will excessively burden the health care system? 
The auditor general also addressed the department's computer systems. 
Simply put, the systems are inadequate.  
Have you read this speech?  
The systems are outdated and are not integrated. 
This new funding will be eaten up very quickly. 
This is a preposterous means to deal with criminal admissibility to Canada. 
That is not all. 
What kinds of people are routinely coming to this country?  
We need to have better detection strategies in place abroad to screen criminals. 
This party supports parts of the bill. 
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Canadian Alliance):
They aspire to a better life for their families and for themselves. 
There are those who would pay no regard to the laws of Canada. 
What a sad commentary on the state of mankind that is.  
The issues surrounding immigration and refugees have been around for a long time. 
Unfortunately that is what I see with most of this new legislation. 
Unfortunately I do not see new enforcement guidelines written into the new legislation.  
Let us be realistic for a moment. 
They are seldom caught and rarely convicted for their crimes.  
It simply will not happen.  
They made a horrendous journey under appalling conditions. 
Some died and others suffered serious illnesses while en route.  
The future does not look any brighter. 
Unfortunately all I can see is more disappointing news.  
The new legislation appears to do nothing to mitigate this lengthy waiting time. 
This inaction drew the ire of all Canadians right across Canada. 
To them the situation was very clear. 
They had applied and waited their turn to come to Canada. 
What they really want to do is be reunited with family members. 
Are we not then creating a double standard?  
This issue has been ongoing for far too long. 
Canada's citizens demand to be safe from undue risks.  
Offers of bonds have been made and rejected. 
He is currently living here and would like to upgrade his skills. 
However he is not able to do this until he receives his landed status.  
We ask the question why.  
In another case a Canadian citizens married a Filipino. 
Through inquiry after inquiry no full answers were received. 
When visas were promised, applications were received. 
When time lines were committed to, they were broken in short order. 
Mrs. Jaswant Sekhon had six children. 
Her last child, a son, Santokh Sekhon, was still living in Punjab, India. 
The two of them had not seen each other in nine years. 
Last fall Mrs. Sekhon became too ill to travel. 
Unfortunately the mother and son were never able to see each other again. 
Mr. Sekhon only asked to be in Canada for one week. 
Does this sound like an unreasonable request? 
It certainly does not to me. 
Yet the answer was certainly unreasonable.  
They have lived as productive participants in Canada for 10 years. 
Yet this is not the only family to endure this type of hardship.  
Thankfully there is a somewhat happier ending to this story. 
Imagine what those nine days must have been like. 
What a horrifying thought, what a tragic thing.  
I must raise the question of regulations again. 
This is not new. 
The proposed legislation will not resolve the big issues before us. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Canadian Alliance):
That is something the hon. member made reference to in his speech. 
I would like the hon. member to address that.  
Because of this they will, of course, get more business. 
The storms are getting less frequent on the coast. 
We will have to see what happens.  
ANZUS, I believe, is the title of that organization. 
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Canadian Alliance):
How do they get in? 
Mr. Speaker, we have this scenario whereby people would like to come to this country. 
Mr. Speaker, I think that is a very interesting suggestion. 
I am just wondering if the government has ever taken it under consideration. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
This is a considerable effort. 
Quebec accepts between 50,000 and 65,000 immigrants every year. 
Having children is something that one plans for in one's life. 
She planned to have a child. 
I am talking about the information, not the partner of our colleague from Longueuil.  
We know how immigration works. 
Their number is between 200,000 and 250,000. 
These newcomers, who will ultimately become Canadian citizens, are divided into three main categories.  
There are, of course, those who immigrate for humanitarian considerations. 
These people are persecuted in their own country. 
There is reason to fear for their bodily security. 
I will come back to this category.  
These cases are in the category of sponsoring. 
This is the family reunification category.  
There is also a more economic type of immigration. 
There again, members know about the handicap created by Quebec's constitutional status. 
I would not want to digress too much from the subject at hand. 
We support the principle of the bill. 
I have pleasant memories of those days. 
This is a positive goal. 
The government deserves our congratulations for this.  
As we can all see, a new person has taken over the chair. 
Well, here I go. 
However, I repeat, the bill is far from complete. 
It can be greatly improved.  
So much for the positive aspects of the bill. 
They are detained far too long in prison. 
I will come back to this point at a later time.  
The question of detaining young people is a problem for us. 
I trust the government will be open to the amendments by the Bloc Quebecois. 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEE PROTECTION ACT 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):
Who are we talking about? 
We are talking about people. 
Like any other issue that deals with human beings it has an emotional aspect. 
It deals with relationships, with aspirations and all such things.  
We recognize what is happening. 
At the end of the day Canada is the loser when this happens.  
We see what every MP knows, I would presume. 
There is something seriously wrong with our immigration system. 
It creates horror stories.  
It is inconsistent in terms of what is going on in the country. 
Anyone can be a consultant in this country. 
They just have to open up an office and say they are immigration consultants. 
Do they know about immigration rules? 
No. All they care about is money. 
This is happening in my own riding. 
Our staffs are better consultants.  
My colleague is absolutely right. 
Yes, they are experts. 
They could become immigration consultants and do a better job.  
I am not putting down all immigration lawyers. 
Who takes advantage of those loopholes? 
We all know that. 
All we have to do is look at the stories in the newspapers.  
The minister of immigration has said that she would be very tough on human smugglers. 
No, they would not. 
The auditor general said it was mismanaged and backlogged. 
We do not keep track of what is going on, and that is absolutely true. 
From the experience in my office I can say that is absolutely true.  
Let us talk about spousal applications. 
The minister says that it takes six months for a spousal application. 
I am saying that it does not take six months. 
Everything takes time, time, time. 
The minister of immigration says she will bring in 300,000 people. 
She says that is our new target. 
We are only at 178,000 because there are no resources. 
Because there are no resources immigration officers cannot do their jobs. 
Haphazard decisions are made. 
People fall through the cracks. 
Any immigration officer will tell us that. 
I have visited New Delhi. 
There is an inconsistency. 
We should tell them that we need immigration and that we need professional people. 
We should ask them how many they can accommodate. 
Then we should go ahead and do it. 
Let us talk about visitor visas. 
Naturally they have ties outside the country. 
It is a common sense situation. 
There is nothing wrong with that. 
We cannot trust him to go back. 
We do not know whether he will go back based on our past experience.  
Where did the problem originate? 
The problem originates here. 
We allow them to stay here. 
Where did the problem originate? 
The problem originates here.  
Genuine visitors who want to come here pay the price for it. 
Why is there not a faster process?  
We are proud of that tradition. 
There is nothing wrong with that tradition. 
That is not the problem. 
His wife and child are overseas. 
His wife suffered a heart attack. 
He cannot go back home because he fears being persecuted there. 
He cannot go back home but his wife has had a heart attack. 
Why can we not have a faster process? 
Let us talk about some of our immigration officers. 
There is no consistency. 
And we do not know when the IRB will hold its hearings. 
It could take six or eight months. 
We have started to hire local officers. 
That is because the government cut the funding. 
They are local personnel.  
What is Canada's desire? 
What do Canadians feel about how our system is run? 
I have encountered local immigration officers. 
We write to them and they ignore the missives of members of parliament. 
These people do not understand. 
They do not know what is Canada's desire and who wants to come here. 
This did not happen before, but it is becoming more and more common. 
The delays are becoming more and more common. 
But there is no problem for the guys who want to abuse our system. 
They do it and they do it fast. 
They are in the country. 
What was the reason behind those calls? 
That our laws were being abused. 
It bothered Canadians that our laws were being abused. 
Have we tightened up the law? 
Have we even improved it? 
I do not think anything has been improved. 
We are back to the same old system. 
I will be back out there listening to the cries of Canadians.  
There needs to be sincerity. 
Has the bill cleaned up anything? 
Has it done anything to fix the old system? 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):
If I get a chance I will certainly come back and ask another.  
My colleague brought up the issue of visitors visas. 
It has caused huge backlogs which the system cannot handle. 
Immigration officials know it is happening. 
He is also right to point the finger at the visitors visa issue. 
He is absolutely right. 
This is where the danger lies. 
Are they going to deny entry to more people? 
My colleague is absolutely right. 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his comments.  
Mr. Speaker, my colleague underlined a very basic point on the issue of bonds. 
That is not the most important issue. 
The more important issue is the process in Canada. 
That is what this legislation should aim to do.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
The motion reads as follows: 
The question would have to be asked:
One would think that it may have learned somewhat of a lesson.  
The amendment to the motion would make it read as follows: 
We do not need a review. 
The people of Atlantic Canada do not need a review. 
In terms of the Liberal amendment, the review has taken place.  
The working group found some interesting statistics and reports. 
We refer to seasonal workers, but it is the jobs that are seasonal. 
There are certain realities in this country. 
We live in a harsh climate. 
There are tourist seasons that are not year round. 
It is not the workers who are seasonal. 
I have already commented on that. 
It is clear that it did.  
This to me sounds like an election ploy. 
A review can mean anything. 
Let us have a show of faith here this evening on this member's motion. 
I do not think it will happen. 
I would be readily surprised if it did, but one never knows. 
We have been surprised in the House before.  
Let me also comment on the value of seasonal work to the economy. 
It says that tourism is the answer. 
That is only natural. 
They pay into an insurance fund. 
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Canadian Alliance):
My own riding of Nanaimo-Cowichan has its share of seasonal workers. 
The forest industry actually is no different. 
Tourism is fast becoming the number one source of new jobs in Canada today. 
Indeed, tourism is truly seasonal employment. 
Why would they do that, one may ask. 
Why do I talk about these three industries today? 
I know that seasonal workers are found in each one of these industries. 
I also know that each one of our ridings has its share of seasonal workers. 
We may have different solutions however. 
Those who are frequent users of EI have their benefits reduced. 
Rather, it will perpetuate them.  
I would question what has changed since that time. 
Is the data all relevant? 
Do the assumptions and conclusions in that report remain true today?  
If it is not working, what are the options to fix the system? 
Does this place an unfair burden on some businesses but not on others?  
They already know that when they begin. 
Employment insurance should not be used as a wage subsidy program. 
Canadians are wise people and know when they are being taken advantage of. 
Currently they know they are being overtaxed. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
They are categorized as seasonal workers.  
What is this pilot project that was submitted to the minister all about?  
Seasonal workers are greatly affected by the intensity rule. 
In December 1999, 17,983 unemployed workers applied for benefits. 
How would that pilot project to give a special status to seasonal workers work? 
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
First, let me make one thing absolutely crystal clear. 
In 1989, 87% of Canada's unemployed qualified for benefits. 
It is no longer workers' insurance against becoming unemployed. 
If work is not available, then they have to go on social assistance. 
Most of the work which is available is seasonal work. 
Let me remind hon. members that it is not a crime to be a fisherman. 
It is not a crime to be a logger. 
It is not a crime to be a construction worker. 
They should be recognized that way, but it has all changed.  
People will live part of the year with no income at all. 
If that option is not available, they have to go on social assistance.  
The system is not broke, it is broken. 
Their plan proved to be quite effective. 
Let us look at the riding of Burin-St. 
It is costing them $81.7 million a year.  
These are not numbers to which only accountants can relate.  
For the most part there was no new work in the area.  
This money has simply gone from the local scene. 
I have a feeling that is the way it will remain.  
Seasonal work is not a crime. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
I reject the premise that EI benefits have been taken away from these workers. 
I would support, however, the amendment proposed by the member for Miramichi. 
I think this is important for everyone. 
Canadians and seasonal work remain an important factor in government social and economic planning. 
In other words, employment fluctuates more with the seasons.  
Why was the EI system introduced in 1996? 
We had to make the system fairer. 
There had to be greater incentives to work. 
Concern for unemployed workers has always been a priority of the government. 
Keep in mind as well that we are attentive to working families with low incomes. 
Data for these groups are often very similar.  
This is what we are doing. 
The government certainly will support the amendment.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
This motion specifically concerne rural areas in this country. 
This is a huge sum for this rural area.  
Doug Young's reform.  
That said, the Liberals recognize that the law must be revised.  
We have heard the comments of the members of all parties in this House. 
Let us take the case of the loggers at home. 
What message do the Liberals want to send to the loggers? 
These are some of the seasonal jobs in the rural regions.  
Have members seen the fish biting in Caraquet when the bay is frozen over? 
This is the problem we have with seasonal jobs. 
This is what the government has to understand. 
I hope that this evening they will act in all good faith.  
Real changes have to be made for workers.  
This is what the black hole the Liberals created in 1996 is all about. 
This has to change.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It being 6.23 p.m., the time provided for debate has expired.  
The question is on the amendment to the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment to the amendment?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the amendment to the amendment will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I declare the amendment to the amendment lost.  
The next question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the amendment, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I declare the amendment carried.  
The next question is on the main motion, as amended. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I declare the motion, as amended, carried.  
(Motion, as amended, agreed to) 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
The issue has become a real problem throughout the country. 
We can see the gap, once more, between the rich and the poor. 
It is now turning it back on them and forcing them to get into debt. 
It does not even help them repay their school debt. 
The government could exempt them from paying interest. 
In fact, he is doing that on the backs of students. 
This is what the government has done to the youth of our country. 
It is driving them into debt and continues to do so. 
The poor are falling on hard luck.  
The poor will not receive the education they need.

The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 7.17 p.m.)
