EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 63 
Monday, March 13, 2000 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
The House resumed from March 3 consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
I remember it well. 
I was the member of parliament for Cumberland-Colchester at the time. 
This motion is very dear to my heart.  
We will be voting on this motion. 
The draegermen were bringing up the bodies. 
It was such a sad thing and to think it could have been avoided.  
I would like to take a moment this morning to read the motion. 
Motion No. 79 states: 
What could make more sense than that? 
His motion stems from that study.  
There can be no double standards.  
This is often proven blatantly untrue.  
However there are still some who do not. 
As an investment it is good business and cost justified to protect Canadian employees. 
History certainly has repeated itself there.  
This is a very dangerous scenario. 
We must be mindful of it and do everything we can to prevent it.  
That is why this is so timely. 
The economic impact of having to shut down a corporation affects everyone in that company. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
I am torn by conflicting emotions as we discuss this motion. 
Motion No. 79 is just that, it is a motion. 
It has no legislative implications. 
Unfortunately, the government appears determined to send a very different message.  
What did the Minister of Labour say? 
She said that it falls under the jurisdiction of the justice department. 
officials are giving this recommendation every consideration.  
I think the clincher comes from the Prime Minister's office: 
Whether to stand for those working Canadians is not a choice. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
I was running in Central Park when I heard the news. 
The government ignores even the accountability of ministers in its own cabinet. 
We cannot put a price on life. 
Part of the issue as well is temptation. 
That very short term focus is going to have some very negative long term results.  
I encourage all members of the House to support Motion No. 79. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
I would like to give the House my particular take on this disaster.  
He did not use those words but I will use them. 
There was definitely a recommendation that the mine not be developed. 
They had the advantage of having the mine inspectors behind them. 
We are perhaps shooting at the wrong target here. 
The problem at Westray was safety enforcement. 
That is the law which exempts directors. 
I am not talking about executives or line management; I am talking about directors. 
The directors do not make managerial decisions. 
They have nothing to do with it.  
They get paid so much a meeting and that is it. 
Who would take on a position like that? 
A group of miners was unnecessarily killed because the inspection system did not work. 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Recommendation 73 of the Richard report reads as follows: 
I therefore move this amendment.  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there unanimous consent of the House to proceed in such a manner?  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
What happened at Westray did not have to happen. 
We simply cannot allow this to happen any longer.  
What has the government done? 
I wonder if it is waiting for the next mine disaster before doing something. 
Is it waiting for an election to be called before it enacts legislation? 
It seems that is the only thing that will make the federal Liberals move.  
Our party was founded on the principles of workers' safety and workers' rights. 
On average, three workers lose their lives on a daily basis. 
Three workers is three workers too many.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The amendment moved by the hon. member for Berthier-Montcalm is in order.  
It being 11.50 a.m., the time provided for debate has expired. 
Accordingly, the question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
If these are new questions of privilege, I will hear them. 
If there are new facts, I will hear them.  
AMENDMENTS TO BILL C-20 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Yet they were again deemed to be out of order.  
Do not treat this point of privilege lightly. 
The gravity of the situation imposes a duty to exercise diligence. 
The credibility of the institution that is the House of Commons is at stake.  
I have heard no new facts at this point. 
I ask the members again, if they wish to intervene, to keep to the facts. 
The hon. leader of the Bloc Quebecois.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
What the hon. leader of the Bloc Quebecois has just said is very serious. 
It questions the position of the Speaker of the House. 
We must absolutely be impartial. 
We must manage as the rules we have here require. 
I want to know whether the ruling will be given before we vote.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
This creates two problems. 
We went back to the drawing board. 
I want to stress what the Bloc Quebecois leader just said. 
You are facing me with a dilemma. 
It is my intention to bring down my rulings before today's voting. 
If that is what the hon. member wanted to know, that is my intention.  
BILL C-20-TIME ALLOCATION MOTION 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.) moved: 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
MOTIONS IN AMENDMENTTO BILL C-20-SPEAKER'S RULING 
It is a responsibility that I take very seriously.  
It was made in accordance with the traditions and practices of this House.  
A revised voting table is available from the table. 
I regret any inconvenience this may have caused the hon. members.

It adheres very closely to the decision of the supreme court.  
I am sorry that we are here, but we are here. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
However, we disagree with the haste of this process. 
We disagree with the imposition of time allocation. 
We believe that a well informed public is better than a confused public. 
I give him credit for that. 
He has been castigated in his home province. 
He has been called unpleasant things. 
He has been made fun of in caricatures. 
I think he has been at least honourable on this subject.  
They have reasons which I think are debatable and arguable. 
However, those two senior politicians both oppose Bill C-20. 
I will list four of them:
I had the opportunity to poll Reformers. 
This bill does not do that. 
I posed to the pollsters what kind of question they would ask. 
To that question there would be a response, yes or no.  
Bill C-20 is imperfect. 
It could have been improved. 
It is a step in the right direction. 
In principle it is supportable. 
The official opposition will be supporting the bill unamended. 
I think it literally will not be amended, unless there is some surprise awaiting us.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
We were not able to hear from as many people as we should have. 
I see the minister in the House today and I am glad he is here. 
I have been part of this process before. 
That had been left out. 
What did Pierre Trudeau do? 
That is why we have section 35 today.  
But nothing was learned. 
Frankly, he has made it very difficult. 
Maybe that is what he wanted all along.  
All of these things we have supported.  
Those are the two easiest amendments for the government. 
The government will not do that. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I believe that is unduly provocative and unparliamentary. 
I think it is uncalled for and the member should withdraw what he just said.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I believe that the member has gone overboard slightly this time. 
I will ask him to resume debate but to please choose his words more carefully.  
All I did was speak the truth.  
They should be concerned about the way their own government is acting.  
Now we have this process. 
That is what this bill does. 
That is what makes it so fundamentally unacceptable and regrettable.  
I am here not just in sorrow but also in anger. 
I feel we could have done much better as a parliament. 
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Having three gag orders on one bill is absolutely incredible. 
That is how the present government operates.  
That is how things are going at this time.  
I would like to make two or three brief comments. 
First of all, one to my caucus. 
I am addressing them. 
I trust that my colleagues are going to see what is going on.  
I heard what the Reform Party critic had to say. 
The signs says ``kick me''. 
That is the problem with the Reform Party. 
I will love you anyway. 
I am going to support the bill anyway''.  
There has been closure three times. 
It makes no sense. 
Such principles are not exactly cast in stone.  
He is right, but his party will support the bill in any case.  
It will be like the provinces. 
But, what happens if the government does not support the amendment? 
But, in addition to that, what is happening with the New Democratic Party's opposition?  
Our amendments were rejected for the most part, in any case. 
We wanted clarity amendments. 
Do you know what amendments we moved? 
The government says ``This bill is about clarity''. 
We want to help it make things even clearer. 
The word Quebec does not appear one single time in the text of the bill. 
Because they were too afraid. 
The sensitivities of Quebecers could put the federal government at risk in the future. 
As a principle, it is rather feeble.  
One does not run a country with a baseball bat. 
That is not the way this country should function. 
I believe there should be much more openness. 
So that the Prime Minister may say next weekend ``We got it. 
It is a rather feeble excuse. 
They are happy, the country is saved. 
It prevents us from finding solutions or alternatives. 
We are stuck with a table of contents, a modus operandi. 
And they call that flexibility.  
Now that is ambiguity. 
As far as flexibility is concerned, it remains to be seen.  
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
Instead, the bill before us creates confusion. 
It is unreasonable and undemocratic. 
You will understand later: 
The people on the other side won last time. 
But they are scared of the results, perhaps because the results were tight that time.  
What did the government promise to us before the referendum? 
That it would recognize the distinctiveness of Quebecers. 
That was in the speech delivered in Verdun. 
We have already gone further. 
What about this declaration? 
You are the Chair. 
A motion is not as powerful as legislation. 
When they want to tell Quebecers that they love them, they use a motion. 
It is barely worth the paper it is written on. 
When they want to clobber Quebecers, they use legislation. 
I am not inventing this. 
We have a bill before us.  
He wants to reserve the right to decide whether the question is clear.  
For example, there is one we often use in Quebec when it rains. 
If even he could understand the question, it means that the question was clear. 
During this time, the economic issues in this country are being ignored. 
What they need is money to boost their economy. 
However, we never talk about that in the House. 
When we joined confederation, there was no referendum. 
The fathers of confederation made that decision among themselves. 
We are nice chaps, we did not object in any way.  
People in my riding are fed up with such a government. 
Every time we want to improve on things, we are gagged.  
It is our future. 
Let us decide by ourselves what we want. 
It is not normal that we were given only 10 minutes. 
I understand that this is not the Chair's fault. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
What we are discussing is very important. 
Really what he did was quite trite. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
That is not a point of order.  
Madam Speaker, I will tell you what I am saying. 
Those were exactly her words. 
It is absolutely disgraceful.  
Imagine having to bring in an amendment to an amendment. 
Imagine threatening, as Bloc members have now done, a thousand amendments on three clauses. 
They say they represent the democrats when in fact it is quite the opposite. 
But what do they do? 
Imagine the disgrace and the shame. 
I cannot believe that they- 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
A National Post editorial notes: 
What is missing is media and political outrage. 
Anti-Christian hostility is one of the last acceptable bigotries in Canada. 
Where is the outrage?  
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
Police and public alike are calling Mr. Doyle a hero. 
I am proud to acknowledge the heroism of Dan Doyle. 
Thank you, Dan, for your heroic example.  
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
She won 17 international medals.  
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
We must lead the fight against racism on an individual and collective level.  
However, the fight against racism is far from over. 
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
Most of these could have been prevented. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Congratulations and good luck to all at the world championships.  
Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam, Lib.):
I knew Chief Mathias personally. 
He was a man greatly respected by his people, myself and many other people. 
Our blessings are with him and his family.  
Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
THE LATE MARCEL PEPIN 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, on March 6, we lost Marcel Pepin.  
JOB CREATION IN CANADA 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Each came with suggested advantages and disadvantages.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
It was prepared before the audit was even complete. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, let us be clear. 
We have a copy finally of this communications brief. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, again let me say that this was a draft report.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, let us go over it again. 
The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we came clean with the Canadian public. 
We made the internal audit public. 
We presented to the House 10,000 pages of projects. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
It will be surprising how much money they actually do come up with.  
Why did the minister choose a ``let us not get caught'' strategy?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will tell you where this party has been. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
In the light of these facts, the minister said job creation was important.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
A trust was set up, contrary to the opinion of Treasury Board. 
He is a friend of the Prime Minister and this must be why. 
It is also contrary to Treasury Board directives. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I want to continue with the Placeteco affair.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I am not all that surprised at the minister's response. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health.  
What is he waiting for?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is unbelievable. 
Rome is burning, health is in crisis, and the minister continues to fiddle.  
Canadians do not want a two tier health system. 
Nor do they want Americans to play doctor with their health. 
Is the minister going to follow the advice of his predecessors? 
Is he going to clearly oppose privatization in Alberta?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Almost daily now we have been advised of more RCMP investigations. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
INDIAN AFFAIRS AND NORTHERN DEVELOPMENT 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
In 1971 the Prime Minister was the minister of Indian affairs and he stated: 
Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
I made the report public''.  
But new documents show the truth. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I counter it with fact.  
The fact is, it is our department that made the audit public. 
Quite frankly, that was only a draft report.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I reject everything that the hon. member has said. 
Her thesis is completely wrong.  
The hon. member for Quebec.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have reviewed these projects on a number of occasions in the House.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Those trust funds were closed. 
The programs are still functioning and people are working.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Now this rot has spread to ACOA, Indian affairs and CIDA. 
That is the government's story. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
There are now 19- 
The hon. member for Medicine Hat.  
The minister says she wants to be transparent. 
My question for the minister is:
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
As suggested by its title, disclosure must be voluntary. 
They will find out.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
I will therefore direct my supplementary to the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
It was dated August 30, 1999. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, because our story is the truth.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let us review the facts again. 
This was a draft communications plan. 
This was being prepared and the audit was not even completed. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member makes reference to the Rosemont files. 
As such, the questions would be presented to them.  
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
We have been giving the minister the benefit of the doubt. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Will he do that?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We do not believe that private for profit hospitals are going to help. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Will the minister do it?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is unalloyed nonsense. 
There is no deal between governments. 
There are principles that the Alberta government proclaimed. 
They will not stand in the way of the enforcement of the Canada Health Act. 
The real issue is why is the NDP the defender of the status quo? 
We want to work to renew medicare. 
Why does it not join with us toward constructive change?  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Many of them are not being very successful.  
The AIDA program has been like a mirage to a dying person. 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the slow learners come from that side of the House. 
Only $500 million has found its way to farmers' pockets. 
The crop has to go in this spring.  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Some $20 billion of $60 billion is from Ottawa.  
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let me again give the hon. member the real facts. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
So the situation needs to be reassessed, but already good- 
The member for Acadie-Bathurst.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
How does this square with the facts?  
The interim audit was available in June. 
The Liberals breathed not a word of its explosive contents. 
The audit was formally signed off in October. 
She asked the PCs to destroy that evidence. 
We asked for the audit in January and finally she becomes transparent. 
How can she stand and tell Canadians- 
The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, again I must categorically reject the assertions of the hon. member. 
They would see that we have a plan of action that is working. 
We are training our employees. 
The hon. member for Davenport.  
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Last week, the Prime Minister was in his riding. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I look forward to his recommendations.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Students are cheering that news. 
Will the minister do that?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
How does that square with her claim of transparency? 
I invite the minister to explain that.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I read what he sent to me today. 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
Yes, I did, Mr. Speaker. 
Are you still going to raise a question of privilege?  
First, I will relate the facts of the case. 
The drafting of legislation is one of the most important aspects of this place. 
I do not know who else will have access to this work. 
I denied him the permission to release them to anyone.  
We become disempowered from carrying out our duties.  
Legislative counsel come under the precinct of the Speaker of the House of Commons. 
It must be addressed. 
I invite the hon. member to review my ruling of this morning. 
I would like to review everything the hon. member has said today. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
The point is solicitor-client privilege. 
In other words, these legislative counsel do not work for us.  
This is very serious, Mr. Speaker. 
The hon. member reiterates a point that was brought up earlier. 
It has been our tradition since the beginning. 
SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, Bloc Quebecois):
It is a matter of confidence. 
I shall be tabling this motion in the next few minutes. 
I would have preferred not to have had to do so. 
The motion is out of order at this time. 
The hon. member must give notice. 
He may do so at his leisure.  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Gar Knutson (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):
PARLIAMENT OF CANADA ACT 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the second petition is one that I can wholly support. 
Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam, Lib.):
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to present four petitions today.  
I sense that we are hearing it read.  
Mr. Richard M. Harris:
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
It destroys the morale, the work ethic and confidence in the government.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
I therefore table this petition.  
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have three petitions for you. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale, Lib.):
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale, Lib.):
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale, Lib.):
One in five Canadian children live in poverty. 
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale, Lib.):
Mr. Gar Knutson (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
Question No. 76- Mr. Leon E. Benoit: 
Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Organizations in Quebec do not receive contribution funds from CIC. 
The question enumerated by the hon. parliamentary secretary has been answered.  
Mr. Gar Knutson (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
*Question No. 49- Mr. Guy St-Julien: 
Mr. Gar Knutson (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
I ask, Mr. Speaker, that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
He has five minutes remaining in his allotted time.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
I do not think it is appropriate. 
I think it is quite unparliamentary.  
It really is undemocratic.  
That really is shameful. 
That is not what democracy in Canada is all about.  
I can tell you that it's going to be a long process...very, 
record was 471?....more 
That is unacceptable and that is not the Canadian way. 
It is simply outright rubbish.  
We on the government side will not allow them to get away with it. 
We on this side of the House will ensure that does not happen.  
It is very simple, very straightforward and very uncomplicated. 
Each of the preambular clauses is drawn from elements of the court's judgment. 
That is what we on the government side are doing. 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Some of the statements made by members opposite I find rather interesting. 
He has been around a long time. 
He knows that he could check the supreme court decision with regard to this. 
I will share this with members opposite.  
That is in the supreme court decision. 
I wonder what has happened. 
I think I know. 
They are digging a little deep. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
That is absolute nonsense. 
But I do not know where he would be coming from. 
What is the point of that debate?  
The members look at it and say ``Holy smoke, they might have something here. 
We saw that in Charlottetown and in Meech. 
I do not understand where the responsibility lies for a Canadian parliamentarian to do that. 
I do not mind that someone disagrees with the bill. 
In fact I understand the Bloc members disagreeing with it. 
It is their raison d'etre to separate.  
I found some of the statements of Bloc members really interesting. 
Let me share one with the House. 
Is that not an interesting situation.  
Where is the language difference? 
Where is the problem?  
Members opposite do not like that question. 
We will see if we can get more money out of them. 
Maybe we will get you some HRD grants, or maybe we will not. 
That is what he said. 
They want money for economic development and jobs. 
That is not the reason it is done. 
Presumably the member was referring to Newfoundland. 
I do not understand that. 
Does the ROC, the rest of Canada, not have something to say?  
I think they do and they want a clear answer.  
That is what this bill does.  
The House should pass this bill, and quickly. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
The first whereas that I would like to delete reads, and I quote: 
This is not the way the supreme court worded its opinion. 
In the 1995 referendum, the question was simple. 
The issue was debated even before I was born. 
Everyone knows what is at stake.  
We do not have the right to do so. 
But there is even worse.  
Through this bill, the House also wants to give itself the right. 
This is the basic principle of democracy. 
Something this bill is seriously lacking. 
The question is now on the amendment.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
This is very surprising. 
There was no right at all.  
The federal government had several options. 
We want to be sure this is what people want. 
Now they are down to 400.  
Why should the business of the House be held up by this sort of activity?  
People cite the parliament in Great Britain. 
Go, for the sake of God, go''. 
It can in my view be dangerous to the constitutional system that we all respect.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
That is stupid, but that is fine. 
If that is what they want, I have no problem with that.  
I would like to explain why.  
The rest is only cosmetic. 
Paragraph 1(6) reads as follows: 
The other paragraph says the same thing, and I quote: 
I am a strong federalist. 
I believe this because I firmly believe in a united Canada. 
Fifty per cent plus one, like Mr. Mills.  
No. The situation with this bill is very simple.  
I do not think all members of the Bloc are separatists. 
Most are sovereignists or perhaps independantistes, but they are not separatists.  
In Quebec, some separatists are looking for winning conditions. 
The Liberal government will not last forever, and it is unfortunate. 
Perhaps the Conservative leader would accept an unclear question to get negotiations underway- 
Mr. Richard M. Harris:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am sure he would not mind. 
Excuse me, Mr. Speaker. 
I was under the impression that the Reform leader had resigned his position.  
These are winning conditions for the separatists.  
It confers such power to all members of the House of Commons. 
I think this is true democracy.  
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
The first question I asked myself was why? 
Why want to trap Quebecers in the status quo? 
At least I believe this is what the government is trying to do.  
And the federal government stubbornly said ``No, you are not entitled to this''. 
We can compensate the other provinces, but let us forget about Quebec''.  
Other examples come to mind, such as the Canada social transfer. 
The government changed all that. 
This is what we want, because it is to our advantage''. 
Another example is Public Works Canada. 
They have to be imprisoned in Canada.  
There is an annual $2 billion shortfall in Quebec. 
Some even talk about a shortfall of 5,000 Quebecers in the military. 
These days, we hear a lot about the price of gas. 
The hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve is well aware of this. 
It happened almost in his riding.  
In the riding of Mercier.  
Canada wants to create health research institutes. 
Let us talk about research institutes. 
Research institutes are important. 
But no ``Let us keep Quebec a prisoner within Canada. 
At one point, Quebecers told themselves ``Let us try to correct things. 
In 1982, the Constitution was unilaterally imposed by Ottawa. 
Now what is this bill trying to do? 
It is trying to trap Quebec within the Canadian federation. 
There is a limit. 
And it is not a question of money. 
The bill is quite undemocratic. 
Since when is 50% plus one not acceptable? 
Now, the government tells us ``No, there will not be any partnership. 
I want to say one thing. 
I also hope that Canada will be open to this idea at that time. 
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
I have just spent a week in my riding, as did all members. 
What I heard were issues around Bill C-23. 
Health care is a significant issue to my constituents. 
I think those are probably the top three issues. 
Finally the Government of Canada was getting on with it. 
First, they liked it. 
I cannot phrase it any more bluntly than that. 
The message was, bring clarity to this debate. 
The tactics in this debate are hugely ironic. 
I have listened to the members opposite. 
I have some understanding of their issue. 
That position has been debated and frankly they have lost the debate. 
After that there has been nothing of substance added to the debate.  
The position of the Bloc to my mind is unfathomable. 
I do not understand. 
It does seem to me that this has become a discredited political philosophy. 
I cannot quite fathom what they are against. 
I looked up the speech of the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
I find the tactics of the Bloc to be quite disappointing. 
They simply will not accept it. 
Again I go back to the speech of the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
In summary, my constituents want this bill to pass. 
My constituents believe that the time has passed for this endless discussion. 
My constituents want clarity.  
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
The inaugural magic of great moments is difficult to conjure up for the humanity. 
It was even said ``Peace and goodwill to all''.  
People on the other side should have a hand dog look tonight. 
Yes, they are poisoned. 
We must judge a government, and especially the minister, by its legislation. 
This minister is arrogant and his legislation is provocative. 
Mr. Bouchard, Mr. Charest, Mr. Dumont, you are three minus habens. 
That is what Trudeau said.  
Moreover, it is an insult to and a crime against freedom. 
My adolescent students used to say ``We are free''. 
I imagine that Quebecers are quite capable of freely making their own choices. 
Bill C-20 says the question must meet such and such requirements. 
Any other question will be considered as ambiguous. 
Is that the extent to which freedom can be exercised in this Parliament?  
The federal government's judgment can supersede Quebec's judgment. 
According to the Prime Minister, such a result could not be recognized. 
The rules have changed somehow.  
He is a remarkable man. 
He said he would recognize these rules. 
Ottawa's bill is not only abusive, it is unjust. 
Its proponents are acting with the arrogance of conquerors. 
Those who support them are serving a cause or purpose. 
What cause or purpose? 
This government dares to dictate our conduct. 
That is something that no one can or will accept. 
We find the dirty tricks of the present Liberal government pretty tiring. 
After the next election, he will no longer be around. 
We would be just like the domestic animals on the farm to serve humans. 
We are worthwhile from the financial point of view.  
We must be very much worthwhile financially. 
I have been fighting for sovereignty for the past thirty years at least. 
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
We have just established Nunavut within Canada, an Inuit territory. 
We have the Acadians in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.  
That is not so. 
Lots of people feel disadvantaged.  
That is not so. 
Finally they were being paid at the same rate as Quebecers.  
There is an easy way to cure that. 
They could withdraw the unnecessary amendments. 
That is what a federation is. 
It is a partnership among equal partners. 
That is what we have in this country and we want to maintain it.  
I agree also with the member for Scarborough East. 
My constituents support this bill. 
They think it is long overdue. 
However, that does not hold for constitutional amendments. 
Because it makes awfully good sense.  
We have two founding nations. 
We have two official languages. 
We have French immersion in our public schools. 
We have French immersion in a high school. 
Our children know the value of the federation and their Canada includes Quebec. 
Our young people know that Canada is respected around the globe. 
We will not have it broken up by frivolous and unworthy claims.  
The last clause in the bill states: 
This sounds like a divorce to me. 
They have been freely interchanging for years.  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this debate. 
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
You are right, Mr. Speaker. 
Quite frankly this bill is a crafted jewel. 
I say that because I listen to my constituents. 
It was very interesting when we listened to witnesses. 
Some members said that maybe they would challenge the process. 
Maybe they would like us to take a little longer and debate it. 
That is a fair comment but we are elected to lead. 
We are elected to govern. 
It has three clauses. 
Let us get on with it and we will be accountable for it.  
He did not support the legislation. 
That is one of the special features of this bill. 
That is one of the genius components of the bill. 
One could argue it actually enshrines ambiguity. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
One cannot speak out of both sides of one's mouth. 
Do you know why? 
From time to time, we have had the courage to submit our option to voters. 
Periodically, we have had referendums too. 
We have submitted our option to the referendum test. 
They took part in the 1980 campaign, and the one in 1995. 
The rule was 50% plus one.  
What did the Premier of Quebec say? 
His behaviour was that of a democrat. 
We accept that rule. 
Here in the House of Commons something rather dramatic is going on. 
He is a self-confessed devout federalist, a militant federalist. 
I quote what he said: 
That is what is bad about the bill. 
We accept that there is a split in Quebec between federalists and sovereignists. 
But this is not what we should be talking about today.  
And that is unacceptable.  
Who are the allies of the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs? 
I could say that the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is not a democrat. 
I will refrain from passing personal judgement on the minister. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there unanimous consent?  
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
There was a recent poll done around December 9 to 17. 
It is democracy and good governance.  
The title of the bill speaks to that clarity. 
I call on everyone of us to join in ensuring that the bill is passed.  
Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):
How naive I was.  
It refused to be enlightened.  
This past February 7, Parliament began its first sitting in this new millennium. 
We are all aware of several viruses affecting the Liberal government. 
Ideally, we would have Bill C-20 withdrawn. 
There are three good reasons for this.  
And the reason for this is clear. 
It is supremely wrong.  
We have the sacred right to make our own decisions''.  
All over the world, the 50% plus one rule is the accepted majority. 
This is called controlling democracy.  
We can do it one day, but not the next day. 
The Liberal government is playing with democracy as if it were a yoyo.  
The universal majority rule, 50% plus one, applied. 
We respected the public's decision.  
If Quebec were sovereign, nobody would tell us what to do or what to think. 
We would not be in a federal yoke. 
With sovereignty, it is Quebec as a whole that will be successful internationally.  
The time when they played tricks on us and decided for us is over. 
We are a great people capable of taking its destiny into its own hands. 
That, at least, is clear.  
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
In a word I would describe the bill as brilliant.  
While I agree with this sentiment these are not my words. 
The clarity bill is a reasonable bill. 
It is made up of three clauses. 
They range from 50 days to 250 days. 
They are not constructive and they do not improve this piece of legislation.  
In 1995 the referendum question asked by the Quebec government was confusing. 
This has results that could not go back four years and be reversed. 
In reaching the assessment the House would take into account matters it considered relevant. 
These kinds of issues need to be dealt with in context. 
Secession would require an amendment to our constitution. 
One does not break up a country with 50% plus one.  
How many times is enough? 
Is it three out of five? 
Is it five out of seven? 
Is it seven out of twelve? 
How many times will we deal with this issue?  
No means no now but yes means maybe later. 
That was supported 55% versus 36%.  
They are proud Quebecers and proud Canadians.  
The clarity bill defines the real stakes in a referendum. 
The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, when he appeared before the legislative committee, said: 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I wish to designate Thursday, March 16, an opposition day.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
I was born in a French town. 
Having said that, I am not about to leave the west out of this picture. 
They are losing their farms. 
Let us take a look at what was handed to Quebec with confederation. 
It was guaranteed 24 senators. 
To westerners a sovereign nation is a separate entity unto itself. 
It is indeed a separate nation.  
It will not be some sort of association. 
It is one or the other. 
They cannot have it both ways.  
We do not ask for separate identities. 
Quebec would have to have a separate agreement entirely. 
Otherwise, B.C. would want to go. 
Not too long ago it was the four western provinces. 
That is what it actually wanted. 
Its separation was based on a financial barrier, for obvious purposes.  
That could be proven.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
We are not the ones saying that. 
This is what David Jones said.  
What else does Mr. Jones say? 
This is very serious. 
It comes back to the explanation given by David Jones. 
Moreover, a question will not be considered clear if it: 
This was in 1967.  
It is amazing, but no one talked about the will to negotiate. 
He does not say that he will not have the means to object.  
You will not be able to resist the people's pressure. 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
I would like to speak to the motions in Group No. 1.  
Group No. 1 deals with the preamble of the bill. 
The preamble itself contains eight clauses. 
In addition to the preamble the clarity bill itself is actually very clear and straightforward. 
It contains three operating clauses.  
Each of the preamble clauses is drawn from elements of the court's judgment. 
What does Motion No. 9 say? 
Let us look at clause 4 of the preamble. 
It is important for Canadians to know what we are talking about. 
We are talking about proposing frivolous and vexatious motions.  
Let us look at what clause 4 says: 
What part of that section of the preamble has been moved to be changed? 
Are we amending ambiguity? 
Are we amending that there is an obligation that negotiations be entered into? 
Are we amending anything substantial?  
The word this time is not ``confirmed''. 
Those are the substantial democratic amendments the members of the Bloc have proposed. 
Is it so substantive that we change the word ``confirmed'' to ``determine''? 
What is wrong with those words?  
Is this a question of semantics or is this a question of substance?  
What in substance is talked about in the preamble?  
We could do that as well.  
Sometimes people just say things for the sake of saying things. 
I would submit that Motion No. 2 is exactly that.  
I say to all Canadians, is what we are seeing here substantive amendments? 
I would submit that that is not the case. 
Why is the federal government taking this action in the face of such strong opposition? 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
It should have gone through the House without any debate at all.  
That is what this bill is all about.  
There has been more than one occasion of this so far. 
The question is when is this debate going to end?  
When would the separatists say enough is enough? 
They lost the first time. 
They lost the second time. 
The bottom line is that the Supreme Court of Canada has rendered a ruling. 
The people have to be asked a very clear question. 
That is fair and none of my colleagues will dispute that.  
Second, there has to be an absolute majority, a clear majority. 
I do not think any one of my colleagues would object to that. 
It is the best country on earth. 
The question is on Motion No. 1. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The recorded division on Motion No. 1 stands deferred.  
All those in favour will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen:

Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The recorded division on Motion No.3 stands deferred.
