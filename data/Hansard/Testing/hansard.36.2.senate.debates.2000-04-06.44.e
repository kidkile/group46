Thursday, April 6, 2000 
The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
They are visiting Ottawa in connection with their course. 
Fortunately, they have decided to include the Senate in their visit. 
I welcome them on behalf of all honourable senators.  
Honourable senators, I wish to make an announcement. 
I was in Iqaluit last Friday through Sunday. 
She was scheduled to be in Iqaluit for the anniversary day.  
One of our former commissioners, Helen Maksagak, attended. 
At the same time we were celebrating our winter carnival, Toonik Tyme, in Iqaluit.  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
In fact, honourable senators, these students will be occupying your seats. 
I hope that many honourable senators will be able to attend this important ceremony.  
Speech on Nisga'a Final Agreement 
One of the correspondents was a P.J. Brabazon. 
Today I received another message from this correspondent, which said simply "Thank you." 
The Late Sir Stanley Mathews 
Hon. Francis William Mahovlich :
Sir Stanley was 70 years old at the time - 23 years my senior. 
What happened still to this day amazes me. 
He was a perfect example of self-discipline. 
His Canadian friends will always remember Sir Stanley Mathews.  
Refusal of Commemorative Stamp on Seventy-fifth Anniversary of United Church 
Hon. Lois M. Wilson :
This Canadian church relates internationally in a very unique way. 
It fosters unity, not division.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Canadian Institutes of Health Research Bill 
Thursday, April 6, 2000 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, we will sit tomorrow, Friday, which is a little unusual for us. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
If that takes place, notice will likely be given early in the week. 
Honourable senators, that is my only purpose in rising. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
However, I should like to correct one point for the record. 
The government does not run the Senate. 
The honourable senators run the Senate.  
They represent a group that has seats in both Houses. 
I do not want anyone to be disabused here. 
He wants to go to the House of Commons.  
Canada-Europe Parliamentary Association 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Omission of Notification on Canadian Calendar 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
Given his Acadian origins, Minister Boudreau ought to be offended by this omission. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
It is a sentiment that I will convey to the appropriate authorities.  
I assure you that the Acadians exist and are here to stay. 
Growth of Employment Insurance Fund-Disbursement of Surplus Funds 
Honourable senators, my question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Can the Leader of the Government in the Senate verify those numbers? 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Obviously, there is a surplus. 
That is good news. 
It is not sitting in a reserve. 
In fact, that occurred. 
That is $35 billion. 
That is not your money. 
Unfortunately, it is not. 
We are now required to pay that debt. 
We have simply accumulated this debt and have left a burden on future generations. 
We have left that bill for our children and our grandchildren to pay. 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
What about Nova Scotia? 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I will try to be fair and balanced about this question. 
There is no question that there are other factors involved. 
I did a wonderful job. 
I worked hard and look at my results." 
Remember that the Lord was there helping you with that garden." 
No one asked that question a few years ago. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, to be very blunt, I do not know. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Will Canada continue to support that policy?  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Nova Scotia-Effect of Proposed Cutbacks on Employees in Halifax 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, my question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
One of the cities to be included in these job cuts is Halifax. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I thank the Honourable Senator Oliver for that question. 
The quality of those operations has been without parallel in the country. 
I would very much regret seeing significant changes in the present structure.  
It continues to show signs of robust growth. 
For that, we should be very grateful.  
Proposed Increase in Number of Driving Hours for Truck Drivers 
As I understand it, Transport Canada will not be holding consultations on this process. 
They are leaving that to the provinces.  
Why is the Government of Canada backing an 84-hour work week for truckers? 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Draft options for changes will be coming forward. 
I will convey those concerns to the minister and, through him, to the relevant officials.  
Honourable senators, this "work in progress" is being codified under regulations. 
The federal government is not even holding public consultations.  
It is not sufficient that the honourable leader consults his notes. 
I apologize for not letting your office know about this question. 
I did not expect you to know the details of the regulations. 
In a case like this, I think we need to say, "Whoa, hang on." 
This looks, on the face of it, quite Draconian.  
I will certainly check that avenue of it as well.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Perhaps the leader would like to venture a response.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted for the honourable deputy leader to respond?  
If one committee is meeting, I suspect that that is tolerable. 
We must be very careful. 
However, Monday is available, for instance, for committee meetings. 
Hopefully meetings can be rescheduled. 
Monday might be a day available for committees, and perhaps tomorrow. 
In any event, that is the best answer I can give.  
If so, on what basis will he select the lucky committee?  
Honourable senators, normally we see these as requests for leave. 
They can be requested pursuant to motions. 
That would be a debatable motion, as I read the rules. 
That is why I suggested one, or perhaps two. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
There are witnesses waiting to testify next Wednesday, I assume. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
We simply do not agree with him. 
We think he is wrong. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the situation set out by the honourable senator is hypothetical in the extreme. 
I say that with the greatest of confidence. 
Comments by Premier of Quebec During Visit to France 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Ucluelet-Tofino, British Columbia-Request for Replacement of Leasehold Fish Licensing System 
Honourable senators, my question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
They have been unable to get any response from the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. 
I would ask the minister to expedite his response.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I thank the honourable senator for her question. 
However, I am familiar with the particular area to which the honourable senator refers. 
I have been there, and it is absolutely magnificent.  
I will convey to the honourable senator the reply.  
Delayed Answer to Oral Question 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Possibility of Lowering Threshold for Cities to Achieve Metropolitan Status 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Brenda M. Robertson on March 28, 2000) 
Moncton would be one such area under either definition.  
We already make available all data we have about all urban centres. 
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
I submit that the same principle applies to committees. 
Honourable senators, this side would have a great deal of difficulty in granting leave. 
We have recognized the scheduling problems of ministers as an exceptional circumstance.  
Several committees next week have ordinary, regular important business. 
There will be a debate on that motion. 
My understanding, according to the rules, is that negotiations take place. 
Indeed, they have been ongoing between the two sides. 
I am of the view that I left the discussions with a counter-proposal. 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Each of us must interpret the status of the negotiation in which we find ourselves. 
I will not refer to the government.  
However, I must interpret where I am at in terms of our objectives.  
Hopefully our negotiation will continue. 
We have had a good relationship and I hope it continues. 
Hopefully I am wrong and an agreement will be come out of our negotiation. 
Honourable senators, I thank the honourable senator for that. 
It assists all honourable senators if they know the state of play.  
Honourable senators, we will see how it goes. 
I am suggesting what I think will happen, not what will happen. 
In any event, we must wait and see what plays out.  
Canada Business Corporations Act 
Bill to Amend-Second Reading 
I was supposed to give this speech a week ago Thursday. 
Much has happened in the last week and a half.  
I listened with great interest to Senator Kirby's fine speech last Tuesday. 
Business will not locate here in the hope that, one day, taxes will come down.  
The recent budget did not go far enough to cut taxes.  
There remain other challenges to be met if we are to become more competitive. 
A third example is the regulatory environment. 
Perhaps it is just the way this government thinks. 
An example is what happened today. 
There is no national emergency awaiting us.  
Honourable senators, we are being bypassed by the Langevin Block. 
We are told that it must be out of here on Wednesday. 
However, we are given no good reason as to why it must pass on Wednesday. 
We should all be concerned about that.  
How else will anyone find out who talked to whom? 
Bill S-19 is a testament to this fact. 
In conclusion, I look forward to dealing with this legislation in committee. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
It is an intriguing idea that I hope the committee will look at seriously.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Nisga'a Final Agreement Bill 
Third Reading-Debate Continued 
Honourable senators, I rise on a point of order. 
Senator Austin is not in his seat. 
He has been in the habit of answering questions raised in debate. 
Yesterday, I asked questions related to the issue of the rights of native women. 
Will they be answered by the government today?  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
He will be back next week. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, Senator Sibbeston will resume his speech from yesterday.  
Hon. Nick G. Sibbeston :
The Nisga'a have waited a long time. 
Delegated powers, however, have never been acceptable to aboriginal peoples. 
The Charlottetown accord was rejected by Canadians in a national referendum. 
The Nisga'a treaty is a culmination of this process. 
The agreements are in various stages of implementation and development.  
They have used their monies in appropriate investments and business opportunities. 
They have spread their investment tentacles throughout Western Canada. 
They have invested in all kinds of projects and businesses. 
They own office buildings. 
From experience, I know what self-government is. 
They must fight and win responsible government. 
The executive was made up of the commissioner, the deputy commissioner and the assistant commissioner. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I regret to interrupt you again, Honourable Senator Sibbeston. 
Your 15 minutes of speaking time has expired. 
Are you asking leave to continue?  
This is too important a debate.  
I have two more pages.  
Either leave is granted or leave is not granted. 
I do not think he found it in the rules.  
The rules provide for 15 minutes. 
Also, it depends upon which order we are dealing with. 
Honourable senators, I do not really care how long the good senator speaks. 
We could extend it to an hour by unanimous agreement. 
Will we all get half an hour to speak? 
This is highly irregular. 
If we were all given an hour, that would be good.  
It may well be that the motion for time allocation will be refused. 
It will depend on the will of this chamber, which I cannot prejudge. 
I assume that our side will carry the day, but it may not.  
They provide for 45 minutes for the sponsors of bills. 
However, the rules provide for only 15 minutes for other speakers. 
I think that is too short a time. 
I do not think that unlimited time should be granted. 
Hon. Herbert O. Sparrow :
We have used up a great deal of time on this discussion. 
We need only ask the honourable senator how many minutes he requires. 
If there is no abuse, why are we so concerned about this? 
Why are we making such a big issue of this? 
Let Senator Sibbeston speak. 
It is an important subject. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
I have been interested in the quotations he has read from certain reports. 
I, along with others, am gaining much from his contribution. 
Leave is requested to ignore the rule. 
It is the simple logic of A versus non-A.  
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
Why did they bring forward the 15-minute rule in the first place? 
It was to prevent abuse. 
It was to keep control of the house in tense situations. 
I can feel tension building up. 
We should take the consequences of our actions. 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, 15 minutes for an important speech is simply insufficient. 
Doubling the time provided of what is in the rules falls into that category.  
I fail to follow Senator Kinsella's logic. 
I do not follow that line of reasoning.  
I agree with Senator Cools that we should change the rules. 
The sooner we do it, the better. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
The deputy leader is opening up an interesting debate about revising the rules. 
Some of us have not given up. 
I have a multiplicity of suggestions. 
However, the deputy leader opened the door. 
I suggest that he not answer me, because it will become a debate.  
Hon. Francis William Mahovlich :
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable Senator Sibbeston, are you asking for leave to continue your speech?  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Senators opposite agreed that leave be granted to Senator Sibbeston to continue.  
On the point of leave being granted with condition, that would be out of order.  
Let us give Senator Sibbeston a chance to finish what he has to say. 
That is the least this chamber can do. 
Perhaps he only needs five more minutes. 
Senator Lynch-Staunton said "we". 
However, I see an impossible position here. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
I do not see unanimous consent to grant leave. 
I am sorry that I caused such a delay.  
These are all matters of local concern. 
I have no doubt that this will happen with the Nisga'a people.  
Now, 20 years later, they are much better prepared to handle such development. 
They have problems because it is a difficult area of the country to govern. 
They do not have trees or resources. 
Yet, they have a sense of optimism and spirit. 
Their culture is coming alive, and their language is strong. 
The people feel good about what has happened there.  
I believe that right is contained in section 35 of the Constitution. 
The Nisga'a bill gives expression and detail to precisely what those rights are.  
The status quo is not working. 
This Nisga'a bill is a turn for the positive. 
I looked at their justice system when I was working in that area. 
Their society is growing and beginning to flourish.  
That was a proud moment for Canada. 
I stand proudly today in support of it. 
I trust that all honourable senators will support it.  
He has been closely involved in this matter. 
It gives me great pleasure to hear what is going on.  
We all share the lands of our aboriginal people. 
Do they fall under our Charter, given the documents that have been signed?  
I appreciate the question posed by Senator Finestone. 
Section 25 of the Charter will apply. 
Honourable senators, I should also like to congratulate Senator Sibbeston on his speech.  
There is no mention of that in the treaty. 
Native society is no different.  
It would be distressing if we were to enshrine that concept in this bill.  
I want to ask the honourable senator if he agrees with me. 
A government that I supported promoted the inherent right of self-government. 
Thus, the senator knows where I come from on that topic. 
The arguments on both sides are very strong. 
I read Mr. Molloy's testimony. 
Still, there is an argument on the other side that is also strong.  
Witnesses from both sides appeared before us. 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
I was a bit troubled by the senator's last remark. 
The aboriginal people that I know have always relied on the rule of law. 
That has been their mainstay - to prove that they have these rights.  
If it is not within constitutional bounds, we are back to the bargaining table. 
That is my worry. 
They followed the rules within their own nation to come up with this agreement. 
I appreciate the honourable senator's question. 
That is a technicality with which the federal government would deal.  
The Nisga'a would carry on and implement the agreement as best as possible. 
There may be certain aspects of it that the court finds to be unconstitutional. 
The federal will need to deal with that.  
The Charter of Rights and Freedoms applies here. 
Will you make us fight for another 100 years to gain back our rights?" 
Unfortunately, I do not know the Nisga'a society. 
They are very much respected as the giver of life to society. 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
As for myself, I fear most reluctantly that I share those concerns. 
I regretfully say, Senator Sibbeston, that I do not believe that was the case.  
Let me point to another substantive issue that gives me deep concern. 
They are a minority. 
I responded by saying we have a five-year rule in Canada. 
It gives me deep regret to differ with him. 
Let me quote what he says in full: 
I shall now turn to the subject of minority rights. 
This is a question of minority rights.  
Mr. Chairman, my views differ from Senator Grafstein's. 
We are completely overwhelmed in our own country. 
We have paid a terrible price for that.  
Why have we not gone the extra distance the honourable senator indicated? 
I just indicated to you one of my views. 
This is the problem that faces us. 
I ask you the same thing. 
If you were in our shoes, would you do that? 
Would you allow someone to handle your family's personal assets? 
I do not think so. 
Dr. Gosnell continued on women's and minority rights: 
I cannot make that determination. 
I am sure there may be further questions.  
That is the very heart and soul of all minority rights. 
Abstaining, while it is permitted under our rules, does not solve very much. 
The honourable senator raises a number of issues. 
Let me start with the conservative amendment.  
I do not believe a hoist of six months will do anything. 
I do not believe that there will be time to correct this. 
There is a failsafe within the bill. 
The treaty will not go down. 
They cannot participate in a constitutional offence, but they can defend it. 
I leave that aside. 
It is regrettable, but I leave it aside.  
I have made my view clear in this respect. 
The sooner the law exists, the better.  
I do not believe in advisories. 
That is why I do not believe in advisories. 
We face a conundrum. 
Honourable senators, this is where he and I fairly part company. 
There is a difference.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, time for questions and comments has expired. 
Is there unanimous consent to continue?  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Many senators have indicated a desire to speak.  
I will try to be brief.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is there unanimous consent for leave to continue?  
The question is whether this is extraordinary enough to warrant the reference.  
The honourable senator says, "Let the bill become law but I will abstain." 
Honourable senators, I am not very happy with my position. 
I think it is colourable, to say the least. 
Let me be candid. 
I started out in my exploration wanting to support this bill. 
That was my original premise. 
Quite frankly, I am not being fair to myself by merely abstaining. 
My own position is somewhat colourable.  
He made that statement without developing it.  
Again, the honourable senator has the better of me in this but let me answer. 
Under the Constitution, unlike other senators, there is a doctrine of the living tree. 
What was the intent of the signatories to the Constitution at the time?  
I looked at those debates. 
I read some of the material, but not all. 
I was a second-hand observer of all those debates. 
I do not think one would have come to that conclusion.  
I agree wholeheartedly with everything Senator Sibbeston said. 
Let us hear from others. 
Senator Sibbeston was very fair. 
It is a fundamental issue. 
I wish to ask Senator Grafstein about the amendment that he does not support. 
I believe that he is absolutely right, that we need to clarify section 35. 
That would put this argument to rest. 
There seem to be good opinions on both sides. 
That will create winners and losers. 
I thought no one disagreed that the best result was negotiated settlement. 
It is a conundrum. 
I have explained myself as best I can.  
Senator Grafstein tried to explain to Senator Murray his reason for abstaining. 
He said that the Senate has a responsibility. 
It is not clear to me what he deems that responsibility to be. 
If the bill is passed, of course there will be court challenges to it.  
Each senator must answer to his own conscience. 
The best that I can do for my conscience is to clearly express my reservations. 
I have raised them as concerns. 
If I were wholly satisfied with my views, I would go all the way. 
However, there is a deep divide in constitutional opinion. 
I have opted for one side of the equation. 
You can lacerate me all you want. 
We had very good committee hearings. 
After that, honourable senators, we are left to God's mercy.  
I do not think that is accurate. 
Did I misunderstand what the senator said? 
I looked at it before. 
It took me some weeks to read it and understand it. 
I remain in exactly the same place now as I was on second reading.  
You are right, honourable senators. 
I found written words that included, "We are talking about municipal government." 
I have a problem similar to Senator Murray's. 
The Crown is seeking our consent on this matter.  
Once again, let us be factual. 
They have said that. 
That is a fact. 
The government has said that it will not countenance amendments. 
They have said that. 
Although they allowed one amendment, they did say that. 
Let us be fair to the Nisga'a and fair to the process. 
The government has said that.  
The question of the advisory opinion is another matter.  
We are dealing with powers. 
Some powers are exclusive; some others are concurrent. 
I have the greatest respect for both opinions. 
I agree that it is severable. 
Interesting questions were raised on both sides of the committee by senators. 
It is a very difficult point of law. 
I regret that, but they have not said it. 
They may say that in the future, but they have not done it yet. 
Of course we can do that by a constitutional amendment. 
We can amend any section of our Constitution by a constitutional amendment. 
The work of the Supreme Court is impressive. 
I think they are very important. 
I think that reference cases are useful.  
Some people have proposed a reference to the Supreme Court. 
Bill C-9 will constitute a precedent of vital importance. 
Many other accords will take place in the years to come. 
I am glad to see that. 
That is something on which I agree. 
This has no effect on the division of powers. 
That does not change the division of powers. 
That is of a fundamental importance.  
A smile is wise and there is no point in getting upset. 
You should know, too, that the smile is dear to the heart of the Indian. 
All too often in history, that is all we were left with.  
It is restoring, confirming and updating an act of law.  
These people want a simple delegation of powers, nothing more. 
They need to be better informed. 
This year, we are celebrating the 25th anniversary of that agreement.  
The history of British Columbia is short. 
I heard that comment. 
As I said, I smiled. 
Remember the concept of Canada as two nations.  
The first confederation had a minor flaw in that it buried the First Nations. 
Was it a perfect law?  
Where do you get the idea that our Canadian political system is without flaws? 
What is more, the First Nations should not be entitled to make mistakes. 
Progress is a gradual process.  
Some would like to see this and are making a big thing of it. 
There are also disputes between provinces and within provinces. 
There are some in Quebec between the Innu and the Cree. 
In the Northwest Territories, there are some between the Dene and the Inuit. 
Why should we be surprised at it? 
We have found solutions in the past, and we can do the same in future. 
We are updating our ancestral geography. 
Let the First Nations clarify these matters. 
Just give things time.  
Yes, the Nisga'a treaty sets a precedent: it restores collective pride. 
Debate is important and democracy requires it. 
Words count, as we know. 
We also know that the written word shapes our relations. 
This is why we have fora, committees, parliaments and commissions. 
We sign agreements and treaties, laws and social contracts. 
The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms protects us. 
Canada was certainly less violent in its history. 
That is why we have traditionally been betrayed. 
It is time to move from words to action - and generous action, too. 
There are others that are outdated. 
Stop keeping us in insufferable dead ends with your legal quibbling and bad faith. 
They are not new rights invented to suit current circumstances. 
They have nothing to do with political opportunism. 
We are talking about the updating of ancient rights long trampled on. 
How can we cite the Constitution and then deny what the Constitution affirms?  
On motion of Senator DeWare, for Senator Comeau, debate adjourned.  
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, I am pleased to join the debate on this important matter.  
I should like to briefly discuss each of these four.  
The Court goes on to explain the rationale for its restraint in these matters. 
To be accorded legitimacy, democratic institutions must rest, ultimately, on a legal foundation. 
...through public institutions created under the Constitution.  
The following passage from the decision proves this point: 
The court says later on: 
I go now to protection of minorities and the role of the Senate. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Are you requesting leave to continue?  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
I will be eight or nine more minutes.  
Honourable senators, I also notice it is five minutes before six o'clock. 
Senator Oliver will take us beyond that. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted for the Honourable Senator Oliver to continue?  
The following passage from the 1980 authority reads as follows: 
Sir John A. Macdonald: 
There are three great sections, having different interests, in this proposed Confederation. 
George Brown also made a similar quote at pages 35 and 38.  
I quote from Professor Monahan in his book Essentials of Canadian Law:
On what would constitute a clear question, we have little guidance from the Court. 
If one question is asked, negotiations would not be mandated for another question. 
Hon. Marie P. Poulin :
Honourable senators, how many times will Quebecers have to say no to the separatists?  
This reminds me of the days when I was in primary school. 
The Supreme Court of Canada gave Parliament the responsibility of defining the rules. 
There are enough of those in the other place. 
The government has committed itself to taking our views into account. 
This is what we should be concentrating our efforts on.  
My view is quite the contrary. 
What shall I do?  
As an independent senator, I cannot hide. 
Therefore, they oppose the principle of the bill.  
That is, in effect, what the Supreme Court said. 
Thus, I recognize the objective of the bill.  
Their trust in them has weakened. 
The bill does not establish a framework for a referendum. 
Rather, it sets a framework for the federal government in entering negotiations. 
No province can secede unilaterally; an amendment to the Constitution would be required. 
I do not accept this. 
All Canadians naturally have a stake in the future of the country. 
Their interests must be effectively voiced by their representatives in Ottawa.  
Honourable senators, I now come to the role of the Senate. 
Yes, the House of Commons "shall take into account" such views. 
Well, the Senate is a constitutionally based political actor.  
Let us be very clear on what the Senate can and cannot do. 
It will be a political judgment whether a question and a majority vote possess clarity. 
The Senate must be inextricably involved in such a political decision. 
However, the Senate cannot exercise a permanent veto in constitutional questions. 
The need for clarity is uppermost. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I am on the last page of my speech, honourable senators.  
Could I ask Senator Roche how long he thinks he will be?  
He just told us - one page.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Senator Roche advises he is on his last page.  
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
I want to see this sentiment extended to the entire country. 
Hon. Jean-Claude Rivest :
This unacceptable action by the Government of Canada is deceiving the people of Canada. 
A number of senators have expressed similar opinions. 
If there is a referendum at some point, that is what its focus will be.  
What will the reaction of Canadians be? 
If so, I will support the bill. 
However, you are unable to guarantee that. 
Canadians understood that, as evidenced by the polls.  
Forget it, it will not happen! 
They did not vote yes by accident or because they did not understand the question. 
Because the electoral issue is not clear?  
Minister Dion has said so, and I think he is right. 
It is his policy, he answers the PQ. 
All the prime ministers, from Macdonald to Laurier, have talked about national unity. 
National unity will be a constant element of the Canadian reality. 
Mr. Pearson set up the Laurendeau-Dunton commission. 
He organized the Canada Tomorrow Conference. 
He gave Canada its own flag. 
He had a national unity policy. 
It was a necessary solidarity. 
He proposed the Meech Lake Accord, which was a decisive document. 
Those who sabotaged it committed an historic and catastrophic error. 
They are not sitting on this side of the house.  
It is an almost permanent problem in this country's very structure. 
Whatever one may think, these prime ministers had a national unity policy. 
I have great respect for him on this topic. 
He will give them guarantees he is not in a position to deliver on. 
The way this bill will work is not ideal. 
The question will be on sovereignty-association. 
You thus weaken federalist forces in Quebec. 
That is what the bill says. 
What will this have solved? 
The three or four million people who have voted are not going anywhere. 
They cannot be made to disappear with pepper spray!  
I do not want to see it ever applied. 
I, like everyone else in the Senate, do not want to see any referendum. 
It will have the opposite of its desired effect. 
Today, no one is particularly bothered about this bill. 
It is not getting people riled up. 
There will be referendum. 
No one wants it. 
It will be on sovereignty-association. 
It will be said that it is muddled, and the question is not clear. 
Naturally, they can say that. 
This bill provides no help at all. 
It will not change a single yes vote to a no. 
It will change absolutely nothing. 
It will not change its tune. 
This bill does not change anything on that score. 
The bill is useless.  
It is doubtless unintentional, but it is a fact. 
That is not true. 
As a Quebec and Canadian senator, I will vote against this bill.  
On motion of Senator Robichaud ( L'Acadie-Acadia ), debate adjourned.  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
This term provides its own legal condemnation. 
The instrument for creating these guidelines was regulations, what we call delegated legislation. 
These regulations were styled the child support guidelines. 
It intentionally ignored the custody and access question.  
Most Canadians are deeply indebted to him and to those senators who supported us. 
The expenditure model itself was inadequate to the task. 
A Guide to the Guidelines . 
" He said, at page 311: 
The department should have utilized an income-shares model.  
From 1968 to 1997, that age was 16 years. 
Honourable senators, support or maintenance of adult offspring bears some discussion. 
That is especially true in families. 
Financial exchange is a function of human and humane exchange.  
( a ) is under the age of sixteen years, or 
This scheme gave the advantage to women and maximized child support payments. 
Most adult offspring want that money paid to them directly. 
However, this was not to be. 
There is no accountability whatsoever. 
The backwardness is made manifest. 
It is not a matter of legal obligation.  
Honourable senators, I shall turn now to some case law. 
A father-child relationship is more than a simple economic dependency. 
The interim report continued: 
The interim report concluded: 
I believe that this will remedy the present problems. 
This economic enrichment is often a financial disadvantage to the adult offspring.  
On motion of Senator Sparrow, debate adjourned.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable Senator Prud'homme, P.C. ). 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Although it was delivered rapidly, it is a speech that must be read. 
She was elected recently to the executive of the Inter-Parliamentary Union. 
I campaigned for him in 1960. 
He may not even remember. 
It is not parochial. 
This is Canada at its best.  
I look at the diversity of Canada. 
Honourable senators know where I stand. 
I saved the day for the Honourable Senator Poulin. 
With her permission, I wish to adjourn the debate in the name of Senator Carstairs. 
That had been agreed to with Senator Poulin earlier.  
Leave having been given to revert to Government Notices of Motions: 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I give notice that tomorrow, April 7, 2000, I will move: 
Perhaps I should clarify. 
I am giving notice today of a motion that I will put tomorrow. 
That motion can be debated tomorrow.  
The Senate adjourned until Friday, April 7, 2000, at 9 a.m.
