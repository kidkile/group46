GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):
SPECIES AT RISK ACT 
It pertains specifically to the percentage of gifts that may be deducted from tax.  
The majority of Canadians contribute an average of $239 annually. 
I urge all members to consider supporting this very worthy piece of legislation.  
ENDANGERED SPECIES SANCTUARIES ACT 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):
RIGHTS OF THE UNBORN 
Mr. John O'Reilly (Haliburton-Victoria-Brock, Lib.):
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I also wish to present a petition. 
We have had petitions every day on this particular topic.  
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions to present today on two different subjects. 
The first petition is three separate ones.  
They would like the bill withdrawn.  
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):
These petitioners feel that Canadians are overtaxed. 
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):
They are from right across the country.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):
I ask, Mr. Speaker, that all questions be allowed to stand.  
MODERNIZATION OF BENEFITS AND OBLIGATIONS ACT 
Bill C-23 reflects this reality.  
The government agrees that this is an important issue which deserves further attention. 
The mandate of the parliamentary subcommittee will be to examine four broad categories of questions. 
Work on these broader, important questions is real and is progressing.  
Premature changes may have unexpected results. 
It is provincial law. 
The status quo is not an option. 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance):
Yes, we are thankful that that amendment was put in there.  
Why is that so important? 
Well, it is a term. 
The government has refused to do that. 
What kind of answer is that? 
Just think how inappropriate that is. 
Let me review some of those. 
That caused a big kerfuffle across the nation. 
Families from across the nation and those who care for children at home spoke out. 
It made recommendations that that should change.  
A few weeks ago we saw the budget. 
The recommendations in that report were not included. 
We went through the whole report process. 
Let us talk about another situation. 
We are approaching over half a million signatures. 
I think we may see one million on this before it is over. 
Petitions are still coming in to my office in stacks. 
Just the term turns your stomach. 
Unfortunately, only four of the members opposite stuck to their convictions. 
Do members know how long ago that was? 
Cases have been delayed. 
Prosecutions have not proceeded. 
It is a year and a half later and still nothing has been resolved.  
We had the tool in the House to resolve that. 
We had the tool in the notwithstanding clause. 
It is part of the charter, not separate. 
It is there to be used. 
That is not the end. 
Here is another one.  
The government spent about $600,000 to finance the committee.  
We travelled the country and heard from Canadians from coast to coast. 
Children were caught in the middle. 
Sometimes the testimony was painful. 
They could not interpret any more.  
Lots of money was spent and lots of testimony was heard. 
It was a year of hard work by a large committee. 
Our dissenting report was very short.  
What was the response of the Liberal government when it got the report? 
Was it going to implement the report? 
Was it a priority for the government? 
That tells Canadians it is not a priority to solve that issue.  
What can I tell them? 
Once in a while it mentions the word family. 
It does not deliver.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Speaker, you are exactly correct as usual. 
I am asking the member to consider that these policies need to be reversed.  
They are raising the next generation. 
Unfortunately the anti-family approach of the Liberal government is undermining that. 
The official opposition has asked for a shared parenting approach in custody and access. 
Whose money is funding that national daycare program? 
It is the dollars earned by mothers and fathers trying to rear their families. 
Why not just leave that money with the parents? 
If they choose to use daycare for their situation, fine. 
It is forcing families for financial need to spend less time with their children.  
Bill C-23 does deal with marriage. 
The union of a man and a woman is the foundation for the family. 
There are six million marriages in Canada today. 
We talk about the high divorce rate. 
The government refuses to do that. 
Those are two big flaws in the bill. 
If that is not discriminatory, I do not know what is. 
We play word games sometimes in the House. 
We all know it. 
Some members opposite are aware that we have brought forward legitimate concerns. 
They agree with some of the things we have brought forward. 
Ultimately they know what they are voting for is wrong. 
They know it does not work for families. 
They know it will not strengthen the Canadian family. 
It also troubles a lot of Canadians right across the country. 
This is the reason why Canadians are frustrated with politicians. 
These professions included lawyers, doctors and other types of professions. 
Do members know which profession has the lowest rating of public trust? 
Politicians are down near the bottom.  
It does not strengthen our nation. 
They have an obligation to send a message to Canadians that certain things are important. 
There are verifiable facts and empirical data that show that marriage works for kids. 
It is not too much more complicated than that.  
The Liberal government has forced closure on this bill. 
When members opposite vote tonight will they be sending the right message? 
It sends a very confusing message. 
I move, seconded by the hon. member for Elk Island, the following amendment: 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Those are the words of the amendment. 
The question is on the amendment.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Today, things have changed considerably. 
We have to be prepared to convince people.  
On that note of thanks, let us move to the heart of the debate.  
First, we had to stop discriminating on an individual basis. 
The charter is part of the Constitution; it is the supreme law of the land. 
Then came Bill C-33. 
Following that, a long series of cases were heard by various courts. 
Jim Egan and John Nesbit had lived together for more than 40 years. 
Public opinion is sometimes prejudiced. 
That is nothing to be sneezed at.  
Who was the Minister of Justice at the time? 
It was the current Prime Minister, who dismissed this entirely legitimate concern. 
That was discriminatory treatment.  
They also voted against my private member's bill.  
Today, they are opposing Bill C-23. 
These people openly wish to maintain discrimination. 
They talk out of both sides of their mouths. 
M. v H. was about two lesbians who had lived together for a few years. 
What was its finding? 
The court is referring here specifically to the decision in Nesbit. 
Indeed, it is desirable. 
We have seen this in the court decisions. 
We see it in political courage. 
Hours could be spent exploring the cause of homosexuality. 
I wanted for neither affection nor love.  
I am very happy to be so. 
I hope that Canadian Alliance members will reflect on what I am about to say. 
This is what Bill C-23 proposes to do. 
What is so threatening about it? 
I come from a traditional family. 
My twin brother has a traditional family. 
I believe the hon. members of the Canada Alliance need to review their position. 
They need to support this bill. 
Doing so will, in my opinion, enhance their status as a parliamentary group.  
There is nothing in this bill that changes this.  
But these types of interdependence do not constitute conjugal relations.  
It is to their great credit that people in our society look after others. 
This debate has been going on for ten years in Canada. 
Now, in the year 2000, we have a bill before us. 
However, the debate on the other forms of interdependency has not yet taken place. 
That is what this bill is about.  
That is why this bill is restorative.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
I would like to speak to what the bill is about. 
In June 1999 Quebec amended 28 statutes and 11 regulations. 
In Ontario we have seen 67 statutes amended. 
I have also heard- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Speaker, I think I used the term the former Reform Party. 
We cannot legislate equality any more than we can legislate morality''.  
We do legislate equality. 
Those members are trying to legislate morality in the House. 
Let us be very clear about that. 
Why is there only one definition of marriage in their minds?  
Why are they willing to do that?  
They make comments which divide our society.  
We in the New Democratic Party are absolutely appalled by that stand. 
We think it is outrageous. 
All people should be given the same treatment under the law.  
We have seen some of the very expensive legal challenges that have taken place. 
It is important for us as legislators to say that we have a clear ruling. 
This is about equality. 
It is about doing the right thing. 
We should stop this very expensive process of forcing people to go through litigation. 
We should be changing these laws. 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance):
It does not serve anybody's interests to revert to name-calling. 
I would ask her to speak to those two issues.  
I find that incredibly divisive. 
I find it incredibly biased and I find it hateful. 
I think that is hateful.  
That was the original intent of the bill. 
The original intent of the bill in terms of benefits and obligations was correct. 
I simply do not agree with that.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sorry, but we have to go to the response.  
Mr. Speaker, that is a very easy question to answer. 
We in the NDP believe in the self-determination of aboriginal people. 
For the Reform Party to impose that, we see through its agenda. 
Then all of a sudden it comes up with the idea of an ombudsperson. 
Methinks it doth protest too much. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Gay rights are the last great civil rights movement of our time. 
That was a civil rights movement. 
That is the only term I can use. 
Somehow they have been held back. 
The rest of us have moved forward and they have not. 
The Liberal Party should not be any more proud in one sense. 
For instance, two races were not allowed to marry. 
At that time interracial marriages were illegal. 
We have gone beyond that. 
There is a single mom with children, and that is a family. 
There are two moms with children, and that is a family too. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. 
That is absolutely absurd, but we have heard them put forward such arguments.  
We have seen it all through their comments since I have been here in 1997. 
There is nothing radical or revolutionary about the idea. 
Sooner or later we knew we would have to deal with the issue. 
It was useful for the country to finally wrestle with the issue. 
We have all benefited from having the debate of recent days. 
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Canadian Alliance):
Four years later and here we are.  
Do not give it more attributes than it has. 
I think it is wrong to even try to legislate morality. 
That has been made in argument before. 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance):
Those are labels which I think undermine the credibility of the House. 
I appreciate there are different opinions on issues. 
It is right in our policy document.  
I can respect that they have a different opinion.  
I guess I want clarity from the member. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
We border on doing that in the midst of this debate.  
This happened as well at the justice committee. 
It was moved by the parliamentary secretary that we now include this definition of marriage. 
That was one which the Conservative Party supported. 
By doing so, inevitably the fear is that we will leave something out. 
It is like layers of shingles on a roof. 
I fear that this trend has to be somehow stopped or stemmed. 
We should be re-examining what we are doing. 
A perfect example is the legislation with respect to gun registration. 
There are numerous examples that could be cited. 
A very simple principle was set out by that decision. 
This was not a moral judgment. 
Justice is supposed to be blind. 
The country has not been reduced to shambles and burning embers. 
This legislation maintains a clear definition between married and unmarried relationships. 
One is not exclusive of the other. 
This legislation does not undermine marriage. 
There is a correlation when it comes to oppression that has to be remedied.  
That is factually incorrect. 
Some MPs have expressed a great deal of concern about the definition. 
The supreme court held that it 
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, it is because there are two lines of thought. 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance):
It is always hard to sift it out.  
Maybe he can explain that. 
Maybe I have misinterpreted his actions.  
If he was paying close attention he would realize that was not the case.  
He was doing things yesterday that people are thinking about doing today. 
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Canadian Alliance):
It went from homophobia to tax phobia. 
That is not what I said at all. 
That is a mistruth.  
Mr. Speaker, that was what we heard in the House. 
That is our party policy. 
That is what the House endorsed nine months ago. 
Mr. Speaker, I will say it very slowly so the hon. member can understand.  
That is freedom, a concept which the Reform Party is not familiar with. 
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism) (Status of Women), Lib.):
I will be sharing my time with one of my colleagues.  
They have spoken, as national parties do, about human rights.  
I salute the hon. member.  
This is not only about the issue of marriage. 
There are a couple of very important pieces of stereotyping which are dangerous.  
The hon. member said: 
The things that had been considered improper went looking for a desperate legitimacy.  
That spreads hateful messages about other people. 
My father came from a single parent family led by his mother. 
My father and mother have been married for about 60 years. 
As a physician I have had many gay, lesbian and bisexual patients. 
Those young people are wondering if they may or may not be gay or lesbian. 
They are worried about whether or not they will be accepted.  
I cannot keep up with the name changes in that party. 
Those young people are being further marginalized. 
What does that do to the sense of self-worth of those young people? 
It is increasing the risk for them. 
Other bits of misinformation keep being circulated around here. 
One is that the vast majority of pedophiles are gay. 
I want to make one final point. 
Gay and lesbian families are strong families. 
Gays and lesbians are parents. 
Gays and lesbians are children. 
They are sisters and brothers. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to ask my colleague a couple of questions.  
There appears to be a number of meanings. 
I think we might profit from that definition. 
There seems to be a feeling that feminism exists only among women. 
I would like to be corrected if I am wrong.  
The first question had to do with whether feminism exists only among women. 
My father was the greatest feminist I know. 
That is really what feminism is about. 
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
To me it is very simple. 
This is a question of equality. 
This is a question of fairness. 
Since that decision came down a number of other actions have begun.  
The course in this legislature has not been as expeditious. 
Nevertheless, we have brought in this law and it will be passed.  
It has never been about marriage. 
That has been made abundantly clear. 
There were many in the House who felt the amendment was not necessary. 
The obligation to look after certain people has been recognized in law. 
I will give an example using old age security.  
I think that is the way to go.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance):
It limited committee study to three and a half days. 
These are benefits which have previously been given to married couples and families. 
She said no, not necessarily. 
I hear conflicting positions.  
Mr. Speaker, let me say two things. 
This issue has been before the House for a very long time. 
This has been before the House for a much longer time.  
Let us look at what has happened in terms of the evolution of the law.  
Heaven forbid, but it was progress. 
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):
I want to approach the issue in two separate ways. 
The first issue is the fiscal impact of the bill. 
It is a cost issue. 
We should know how many people will be affected. 
We do not know that. 
Who defines a conjugal relationship? 
Is that what we are saying? 
Is that what the bill means? 
Is there that aspect of responsibility? 
How will the government prove the conjugality of a relationship? 
Where is the definition? 
How are we ever going to pull that out?  
It should outline the rights and responsibilities associated with that definition. 
Are there additional responsibilities if one falls under the bill? 
What change will that have for society as a whole? 
We all know of such relationships. 
There is a lack of public input. 
We have not seen that happen. 
We talk about marriage. 
Is the bill about marriage? 
Is it about the definition of marriage? 
People have said that the definition of marriage needs to be reaffirmed. 
We did that last June in the House. 
The people have spoken.  
However, the bill was brought forward without a definition of marriage. 
Yesterday we put forward some amendments to do so but they were voted down. 
Another is the child pornography issue. 
It chose not to do so. 
The whole child pornography issue has affected my work as well. 
We wanted to have a registry of sex offenders. 
We need to strengthen families.  
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I wanted to make a comment and to ask a question.  
I would like to comment on it a bit.  
It is a series of criteria that has been in existence for over 40 years.  
Do we need to find out if people have sex?  
This is not the only part of a conjugal relationship. 
We hear about the erosion of the family. 
I would like to know if their families do not count. 
The issue of the family keeps being brought up. 
Are we only going to cherry-pick what we mean as a family? 
I would like to ask the hon. member that question.  
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to respond. 
The member just said that families were important, but. 
Families are very important. 
What does that mean? 
What are the other requirements? 
Where is the definition of conjugality?  
The minister says it is not about that. 
Mr. Julian Reed (Halton, Lib.):
He said that one of the issues involved in this bill was cost.  
Why would he continue to want to discriminate against them?  
The point is that Canadian taxpayers are concerned. 
I think he missed the point. 
Canadians have a right to know what this is going to cost.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Canadian Alliance):
I would like to begin by summarizing some of the points I made earlier. 
I have not heard that refuted by the government. 
That is what she is saying.  
That is the net effect of Bill C-23.  
The hon. member is a minister of the crown. 
She seems to be unaware of this fact. 
In fact, that is an argument and a tactic used to shut down debate. 
That is what we call intellectual bullyism. 
That is exactly what the minister and members of her government participate in. 
That is a tactic employed by this government. 
It is the same tactic that is being used here.  
It is imposing one's moral perspective on people. 
They are weak and flimsy arguments veiled with name calling. 
That is all they are.  
The effect of this bill is to equate all relationships as being the same. 
The minister talked about discriminatory practices. 
She is a minister of the crown that discriminates against certain arrangements. 
What if he is in an arrangement of three people? 
Let us call it a triad. 
The government discriminates against that. 
In our society we have always said that marriage is a very important institution. 
In fact, our society is built on it. 
That is a dangerous road to go down as a society. 
We have seen in this place what has happened in the past.  
It went way beyond the boundaries of what was intended by parliament. 
What was the government's action? 
It did not even put up a defence in 1997 when spouse was redefined.  
A group must be judged on its actions. 
Empty words and rhetoric do not hold water.  
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member. 
It is a very simple one. 
Mr. Speaker, I certainly did not indicate that in my speech. 
The minister continues not to realize that. 
That is quite surprising.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened with some interest to the member opposite. 
It struck me that he is talking about outrageous triads. 
There is a triad from which we certainly want to keep our distance.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
That is a little over the top. 
Is this a debate or a barroom brawl?  
We hope it is not a barroom brawl. 
I know the hon. member for Waterloo-Wellington will put his question directly.  
I remind those members opposite:
That is who those people are. 
Why did they vote in a block?  
Mr. Speaker, the member talks about being the party of hope. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We cannot refer to a member's absence or attendance in this House. 
However, for the record, I was here, and I listened with some- 
What the member says is outrageous. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
I begin by saying that I support this bill. 
I have great respect for my colleagues. 
I am one of the ones who promoted it originally. 
This has been a fear of mine for a very long time.  
Finally, this bill produces the definitions.  
Incidentally, Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with a colleague.  
Let me examine what happened yesterday. 
Why does he take that position? 
This is the bad news, and it is very unfortunate. 
I hope the justice minister and all Canadians are listening. 
There are many examples. 
Then, there are countless other examples since I have been a parliamentarian since 1993. 
The unfortunate thing that we have before us is legislation that is good. 
REPORT OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL 
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale, Lib.):
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Canadian Alliance):
This decision is based solely on reduced funding.  
We have all heard of the billion dollar boondoggle. 
That is the amount we are trying to shift to health care. 
The Liberal majority in the House voted the motion down.  
NATIONAL ORGAN DONOR REGISTRY 
Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam, Lib.):
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
Customs officers will, however, continue to carry out spot checks.  
Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):
First he upset the Palestinians by refusing to meet with them in east Jerusalem. 
Then he did not know what he said. 
This is not new.  
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, good news. 
This technological revolution is called the all new Honda Insight. 
As well, the Insight is designed to meet ultra-low emission standards.  
I am sure that this exciting new Insight will be well received by Canadian consumers.  
Congratulations to Honda and its entire team. 
A VISION FOR CANADA 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
These I believe are the first priorities of a healthy society. 
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):
This should never have happened.  
Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga Centre, Lib.):
It has taken place annually since 1995. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, poetry preserves the memory of our society. 
Today Ila Bussidor is the chief of the Sayisi Dene. 
She is leading her people in their fight for compensation. 
I dream of an eagle 
Forever coming to me with messages of strength 
Always in friendship and kindness.  
I touch the great sacred bird of spirit.  
He cares for me, each time I vision him.  
He lets me carry him.  
He gives me his sacred feathers.  
He walks with me.  
I am not afraid of him.  
I believe he is my guardian.  
The spirits of my father and mother 
Beside me in my times of pain.  
Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne-Blainville, BQ):
The Bloc Quebecois does not intend to stop there. 
Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre-Rosedale, Lib.):
Thirteen Jewish citizens of Iran stand accused of crimes against the state. 
PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
His advisers must be sorely disappointed. 
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
The riding of Burin-St. 
George's is losing $81.7 million annually and Humber-St. 
Barbe-Baie Verte is losing a further $74.7 million. 
What have the Liberals given back? 
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
In addition, they are responsible for over 65% of charitable giving.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
Revenue hands out more than $2 billion, mainly to large corporations. 
That generates $20 million to $55 million of benefit to the Canadian economy. 
It is another massive boondoggle. 
It is hardly a deal.  
Mr. Speaker, let me be clear from the outset. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
They should be calling their department ``Expenditure Canada''. 
Collect more in taxes this year? 
He was told, ``Do not worry about it. 
It will not happen again, we promise''. 
Then they were told, ``Keep the cash''.  
That is unbelievable from the government. 
Why does every single day see another government boondoggle?  
Discussions and appeal procedures were also used. 
It is impossible to discuss program management with them. 
They cannot understand what it is about. 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, try this one on for size.  
They say, ``Not tens of millions of dollars surely. 
Let's double that''.  
My question for the Minister of National Revenue is simple. 
Where were they when we were working on improving the system?  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):
They were paid three times. 
The taxpayers paid three times for the same work.  
The question is quite simple. 
Moreover, the auditor general describes the situation as an administrative nightmare. 
It was very difficult.  
Where were they when meetings were held with the business community in Montreal?  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
I suggest that governments working together can achieve it.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
The NDP Government of British Columbia takes the same position.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
That is his position at home. 
That is his position in the Middle East. 
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister should explain the Canadian position to the Prime Minister.  
The Prime Minister claims to like clarity, but he generates confusion. 
Is this a policy change?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, here in Canada, there is no occupied region. 
I wonder why the hon. Progressive Conservative member fails to see the difference.  
AUDITOR GENERAL'S REPORT 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I guess I will have to repeat over and over. 
At that time we received over 16,000 demands in four months.  
The hon. member for Medicine Hat.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):
Two billion dollars were mismanaged by finance and revenue. 
Mr. Speaker, I believe I have said it and I will keep saying it. 
I stand by that.  
Second, we have been facing an administrative nightmare. 
It would be a political nightmare to have the Reform Party in government.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
So far I have not heard from him.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
This is what Quebec has been asking for a long time.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
AUDITOR GENERAL'S REPORT 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Canadian Alliance):
The situation is complex and urgent. 
Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Canadian Alliance):
Why should we believe that Gathering Strength will make any difference? 
The auditor general has said so himself. 
How can the minister possibly defend this kind of shameful record?  
Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
That is not the way we are going to go. 
We are going to meet that challenge before we- 
The hon. member for Louis-Hebert.  
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I think the minister is badly informed.  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
AUDITOR GENERAL'S REPORT 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):
This report is almost a carbon copy of the 1990 report. 
The minister and her government have had seven years to fix the problem. 
Why should Canadians believe that she will fix the problem now? 
Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the health and security of Canadians is my number one priority.  
We will hear the minister.  
We are aware of the AG's concerns. 
We received additional funding in the recent budget and the legislative package. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):
Better management, better training and better auditing will.  
The common theme here is the mismanagement of the government. 
How can we believe that she will fix the problem now? 
Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
We have received those resources in the existing budget. 
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
That should go a long way toward responding to those needs.  
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we do take the auditor general's report very seriously. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, how can we believe that? 
Let us take a look at another example in the auditor general's report. 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is of course a serious issue. 
You should get your facts straight.  
I would remind members to please address their remarks always to the Chair.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
This year's federal budget did little to address the issue. 
Is the minister satisfied with that rate? 
Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
We have an interest in the Middle East and continue to have one. 
We want to be of help. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
We will continue to look at and assess this situation. 
We want to be of help, as we have traditionally been. 
We have less troops out there internationally now than we did a year ago. 
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the President of the Treasury Board.  
Today we are in the midst of National Volunteer Week. 
What has the Government of Canada done to fulfill this commitment?  
The Prime Minister has just set up that group of reference ministers. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, on the contrary, I welcome the work of the auditor general. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
This particular suggestion was made previously. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
It will be tabled when we get into clause by clause.  
MODERNIZATION OF BENEFITS AND OBLIGATIONS ACT 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciated the comments of the member for Wentworth-Burlington.  
I agree with him. 
I find that shocking. 
Certainly that was the tone of his comments.  
It appears at the front of the bill, but it is not in the statutes.  
I cannot do it.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise again on a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We are not going to get into this. 
Mr. Speaker, you are fair and even-handed, as always.  
For example, I listened prior to question period to the member for Dewdney-Alouette. 
This, according to him, has led to the rise in ``militant homosexuality''.  
Now it is a requirement to receive benefits from the federal government''.  
That is a direct quotation from those members. 
In fact, I want to do that right now. 
I have listened for the last couple of days to some of the speeches. 
Canadians see through their shenanigans, duplicity and hypocrisy.  
The bill is not about marriage. 
That is why we are proceeding with Bill C-23.  
We have repeated that in the bill to underscore the point. 
The proposed legislation is an omnibus bill. 
The bill goes on to modernize obsolete language. 
I believe Canadians ultimately respect this. 
Let me go into some detail with respect to these changes. 
In the French language its equivalent is conjoint de fait. 
I think Canadians understand them for what they are.  
We are making sure that it makes sense in all kinds of areas. 
We have put them into perspective. 
This is a bill that makes a great deal of sense. 
It accomplishes what the supreme court asked us to do. 
In Ontario, Mr. Harris did the very same thing within 48 hours. 
We in this great Parliament of Canada need to follow suit. 
We need to modernize and update the very legislation that is important in this area. 
That is precisely what we are doing. 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, thank you very much for the allowing me the opportunity to respond.  
This member speaks of name calling. 
But Canadians see through that. 
Let me get to the question that the hon. member asked. 
I do not know what it is about that the hon. member does not understand. 
They see through it every time.  
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Canadian Alliance):
I would like to ask the member this question. 
I do not see it in that light. 
That was said by the hon. member for Mississauga West, a Liberal. 
I will stand up and call him a racist and bigot.  
He talks about ingredients. 
What kind of ingredient does he have? 
I did not do so, but he did. 
Methinks he doth protest too much.  
It is really obvious who the people opposite are. 
They are the people who talk about free votes. 
It was because they were all whipped into voting the way they did. 
They are the people who talk about grassroots. 
They are the people who talk about free votes. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
This bill was passed in June 1993. 
The inclusion of sexual orientation in these personal characteristics generated a great deal of opposition. 
The bill was adopted by the Senate in April 1996.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's comments. 
I understand that he is a man with considerable academic credentials.  
The question of marriage and its definition is touched on in this bill. 
This debate will have to continue. 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Maybe he could explain that to our colleague from Calgary Centre.  
In my opinion, this is debate that is not over. 
There are others who wish to see marriage reserved for people of opposite sexes.  
The debate will progress as our society progresses. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
That is the essential purpose of this bill.  
It should be noted that the proposed amendments are not all one sided. 
Here are a few examples. 
These are obligations that did not exist. 
There is nothing unique or revolutionary about this bill. 
I was saying that it arose out of many supreme court decisions. 
We are confronted to fact and law.  
I think this reflects a realistic attitude.  
This is a reality that cannot be made to disappear.  
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
At its core, this bill is about ending discrimination. 
This omnibus bill is about benefits and obligations. 
The following are a few examples of some of the benefits and obligations. 
Bill C-23 will provide that in similar circumstances. 
That is something that all Canadians should support.  
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Let us look at the provisions of Bill C-23. 
A member opposite made a reference this morning to ``good families''. 
I ask the hon. member, what about lone parent families? 
Are these bad families by inference? 
I do not think so. 
The government recognizes that there are many types of families in this country. 
They will not take away pension provisions for children. 
It has finally put every child on the same footing in this society.  
How is amending that provision anti-family?  
I think that strengthens society.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I listened to the hon. member's comments with great interest. 
She made some valid points.  
There is one I would like her to address. 
The law is quite clear and has existed for 150 years in common law. 
As a good legislator I do not like to be redundant. 
The hon. member also referred to the study on children. 
We have to pay a lot more attention to young children in our communities. 
They are not getting enough support from their society.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):
I would like to quickly go through that.  
The government would not even listen to provincial ministers who had interests in the bill. 
Finally, this is a big issue. 
None of that broad policy debate took place. 
I am very disappointed the government chose not to have that discussion. 
This is such a poorly crafted bill that it should be rejected. 
I do not blame the courts. 
They will have to rule on this, as they should. 
That is a shame. 
Lawyers are going to have a heyday. 
However, it was strictly a public relations exercise. 
As far as the actual statutes are concerned, there is no change. 
There is no emphasis on marriage in those statutes. 
That is a serious error. 
Finally, there is the refusal to include amendments of substance. 
Instead of an answer from over there we get absolutely nothing from the government. 
That is a shame.  
The government is going to ask the courts to decide. 
That is a question we should ask today.  
It was not in any of their literature. 
It just came out of nowhere.  
What is going on? 
We had to say that health care should take priority over government grants. 
It does not matter what are the issues. 
The drunk driving bill is still lost in the black hole. 
Where are the priorities of government members coming from? 
I do not understand. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):
I am not saying to try to promote that ideal. 
I am just saying to try to accommodate it at least in law. 
Mr. Speaker, I will try to answer that question. 
It is not the only question we ask. 
We ask a series of questions as we do our analyses.  
Does it somehow strengthen the family? 
We have not been able to analyze how it will do that. 
What kind of a law is that?  
Surely parents have the best interest of their children in mind. 
They may choose to look after them at home.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to be able to participate in this debate. 
I have four wonderful grandchildren.  
Today is a very special day for our family. 
It is 65 years of wedded bliss, according to my dad. 
I am just kidding.  
It seems like much longer.  
Yes, it seems like longer. 
Anyway, I want to take a few seconds to thank my parents. 
I had to ask that man to forgive me for what I had done. 
He held me accountable and I thank him for that.  
It would have been impossible because we just saw the opposite so richly modelled.  
I have talked about her in the House too. 
The Lord granted that request, and for that my family is very grateful.  
I do not in any way apologize for that. 
We have families who are literally struggling financially. 
They cannot make ends meet. 
I would like to put that to rest.  
Nothing could be further from the truth. 
It is about family. 
It is about friends. 
I reject outright their accusations.  
There is nothing in this bill for them. 
There is nothing here about equality.  
I am thinking about two of my friends, two sisters who never married. 
Does the government recognize their need for sharing their benefits? 
That is what this bill is all about.  
That was before the amendment.  
The short title states: 
This Act may be cited as the Modernization of Benefits and Obligations Act. 
It goes on from there. 
The government says it is not about marriage. 
The very first word is ``marriage''. 
In fact, it is about marriage. 
It is about a relationship. 
That is what it is doing, in effect.  
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
I remember often discussing this topic. 
In every case the Liberals have added to the list. 
That is not what spells equality. 
I do not know why they insist on simply adding to the list. 
Why do they not come up with a policy that looks at needs?  
There are many examples. 
One example is the case of the natives in this country. 
The list will not be complete until everyone is on it. 
I might also add, parenthetically, even fat people.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed the speech of the member for Elk Island. 
As always, he brings a personal touch to it. 
I do not claim any expertise. 
That being said, marriage has been a wonderful institution for me. 
He mentioned relationships involving two sisters living together. 
Would those other relationships, though not marriage, be important?  
I could think of hundreds of them.  
I think of my own friendships before I was a married man. 
Of course that was in jest.  
Both of our sons were well on in years before they were married. 
In fact one of them is not yet married. 
They have very close friends. 
They live together, they share costs and expenses. 
That is the flaw of this legislation.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
This is an omnibus bill which will amend a number of acts. 
It was only that it would be a matter of time to implement it. 
I was given the assurance that at the most opportune time it would be done.  
I would say it is a happy day for all of them.  
What the government has done is in the best interests of the child. 
That is not always the case. 
With this legislation, the government has done what is right. 
We had a decision by a court. 
It was Pierre Elliot Trudeau, my idol. 
They have no business trying to tell people how to live their lives.  
The legislation that was introduced by the minister does just that.  
We already have legislation in place that governs people in common law relationships. 
Frankly, that is skirting the debate in the wrong direction. 
We must continue to focus on what is before us. 
The institution of marriage is not affected. 
Our government has to reflect the needs of society.  
Some of them felt terrible. 
These are good people and we have to treat them with dignity and respect. 
We have to do what is right for them.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Indeed, this is one of the reasons why I support it.  
It is true that this legislation is imperfect. 
Sex should in no way be involved in this legislation. 
It does appear to us far more natural to have opposite sex parents. 
I would appreciate it if my colleague would comment on those remarks.  
Mr. Speaker, let me just go back to what this bill is all about. 
This bill is about implementing a decision that was rendered by a court. 
To a large extent the institution of marriage is not affected at all. 
I have no business trying to impose my beliefs on someone else. 
It is not my business at all. 
We need to get the facts straight. 
We have to treat everyone fairly without any exception.  
Why do we have to continue to live in the dark ages of the 1200s? 
Why do we not move into the new century and do what is right?  
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let me congratulate my colleague from Ottawa Centre. 
He made a very fine presentation to the House.  
Unfortunately, at other levels of government, that is what is lacking. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):
What I want to do is bring this to the 21st century.  
I wish I knew who wrote this but apparently it is anonymous. 
For the record, I want to indicate that there are four classes of people. 
There are those who do not know and know that they do not know. 
They are simple and should be instructed. 
There are those who know but do not know that they know. 
They are asleep, and we should wake them. 
The fourth are those who know and know that they know. 
They are wise and we should listen to them.  
There are many Canadians who fall into the fourth class. 
They know that they know. 
It has to do with marriage. 
They know what the institution of marriage is and they know that they know that. 
That is why the minister brought in an amendment to the bill.  
We need clarity on this bill. 
The first is the need for clarity in legislation. 
It is for our children that we send this message.  
It is simply a question of who is the master, that is all''.  
We had better decide, not the courts and not the judges.  
As a parliament, we need to clearly express what we intend marriage to mean. 
I want to move on to the next point which is for our children. 
I notice there are five hon. members from the government side of the House listening. 
I congratulate them for being here. 
I want to register the point about the message parliament is sending to people. 
Are we a democratic institution or are not?  
I am so glad the hon. member over there said yes, yes. 
It matters what history has told us. 
That has been our history and tradition. 
It was very clear that parliament should do every thing it could. 
She did none of those three.  
What was the amendment? 
It would have meant something. 
The way it is written now does not have that impact.  
The Minister of Justice knows this is the case. 
There is absolutely nothing new in what I am telling the hon. minister. 
So do certain other ministers who are sitting across the way.  
They want that in the law of Canada. 
That is what they have told us. 
They should vote according to the way the people have told them to.  
We have to be absolutely clear what this is about. 
It is time that we determine what we are. 
Is that the issue or is it something else?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the amendment, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the amendment lost.  
The next question is on the main motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
(Bill read the third time and passed) 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House resumed from November 15, 1999, consideration of the motion.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
When debate was suspended the hon. member for Churchill had five minutes remaining.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
The 55th parallel is very important to me. 
I have lived in Thompson, Manitoba for about 27 years. 
We recognize ourselves as being north of the 55th. 
In a lot of cases our peoples are the same in those northern areas.  
This motion would certainly give us that opportunity. 
The different peoples involved in these regions are similar throughout the world. 
That is the area which Canada recognizes as belonging to the circumpolar group.  
I would hope that my colleagues would consider that. 
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Those great cities are located in Scandinavia and Russia.  
The member uses the argument of global warming. 
He is doing us all a great service by bringing forward his motion.  
The government has done a remarkable amount of work with respect to the circumpolar community. 
The Arctic Council has been very active. 
Now of course it would include Nunavut. 
I am pleased the hon. member is putting this motion forward. 
I commend him for it. 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
I have many reasons to wish to speak to this motion. 
They do not always have the means to resolve these problems.  
For the expression ``frontiere canadienne'', in English, instead of saying Canadian border, they say boundary. 
The second meaning is that of a ``dividing line between two countries''. 
I am sure this is not at all what he intended. 
Other members wondered whether the 55th parallel should be debated. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In English, the word used is not border but boundary. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The amendment is therefore in order.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I take that as a compliment.  
I did not mean it to have any derogatory sense at all, Mr. Speaker. 
What the amendment has done is put into French what we were understanding. 
I would like to speak to the motion as given: 
As I understand it, he is not changing any borders. 
He is nodding yes. 
I happen to live just outside of Edmonton, Alberta. 
Edmonton is at 53 degrees. 
We have a lot of people who live north of the 55th parallel. 
We are indeed a hardy population in Canada. 
We believe in sticking our faces into the wind and the snow and carrying on.  
It goes without saying that living in the northern climate is a challenge. 
It is a harsh climate. 
They are a hardy people. 
We ought to congratulate and admire them for that.  
Second, this part of the country is very rich in resources. 
A lot of people are not aware of that. 
North of the 55th and 60th parallels, there are many resources. 
There are many different forms of life.  
This brings challenges to all of us who live in that kind of a climate. 
I have some serious questions on this subject. 
We see our Prime Minister going overseas. 
We have heard that in the last couple of days.  
How effective is the Arctic Council? 
It could not be much worse than what we already have. 
Now I have it on the record.  
The other question I have concerns the relationship between the provinces and the federal government. 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
This is a rather distinct group of organizations that we are dealing with here. 
I note the comments of the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
I think the government could accept it.  
Why not take advantage of that? 
The hon. member for Mercier is a very thoughtful member.  
He has reminded us that this is a plural country. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
However, I would like to add a few more points.  
And what are the consequences of this change? 
What is the purpose of it? 
What are we trying to accomplish here?  
Indeed, we should pay better attention to the northern people as well.  
For instance, what will happen to the provinces? 
How will they react to this? 
Certain provinces, then, might have to comply with new obligations because of this change. 
But are they in a position to respond to that impact?  
The Canadian north is one of our best kept secrets. 
High technology is often referred to in connection with the world economy. 
The north, however, is going to take on more and more importance as well.  
Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
To use one example, I have read significantly fur trade literature. 
There are eight member states in the Arctic Council. 
These people do get together and they have many important things in common to discuss. 
I believe that is why this motion is important. 
That is the kind of thing that is happening to people in the north.  
He is saying that these people also have a concern. 
He is certainly talking about governments. 
He is saying that we have to change. 
This motion is only a motion, it is not a bill. 
I recommend to other members that they support it.  
He feels that there will be an advantage if this occurs. 
I certainly agree with him.  
Mr. Denis Paradis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise to speak to this motion.  
Real progress is being made. 
Let me be perfectly clear from the start. 
We, in fact, do not have one singular, inclusive definition of the north. 
This funding helps keep the cost of food down.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
But as we all know, good intent is not enough. 
Concrete, positive action is desperately needed in this case.  
Upon impact, the DU bursts into flames. 
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
The total uranium radiation was below detectable limits.  
The arsenal of some countries currently includes depleted uranium ammunition. 
Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre-Rosedale, Lib.):
More than 50% of the population is under the age of 25. 
These young people want changes. 
That was obviously indicated in the consequences of the recent elections.  
The president, Mr. Khatami, is a very positive individual. 
He wrote a book called ``Dialogue of Civilizations''. 
We see a real change in attitude.  
They told us that they could see real signs of change in Iran. 
On the other hand, there are very disturbing indications in that country. 
The security apparatus is not in the hands of democratically elected officials. 
We see arbitrary actions of authority. 
We see things like the way in which tax laws are applied. 
They do not have the juridical security they would like to have.  
There is a parliamentary majority in favour of reform. 
We still read in the newspapers about how they are seized. 
The morality police are still harassing young people. 
There is a question as to the courts and how responsive they are. 
I suppose that is true in all political situations. 
I would like to know what we are doing about it. 
What are we doing to encourage change? 
How are we helping Iranians who want change to get change? 
It seems to me that now is the time to move. 
Now is the time to encourage those in authority in Iran to open their country.  
I would like to suggest that we might be a bit more active. 
Mr. Denis Paradis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
The reformers of President Khatami won a majority of the seats. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House adjourned at 7.18 p.m.)
