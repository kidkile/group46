The House met at 2 p.m. 
Members sang the national anthem ] 
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Canadian Alliance):
What is the reason for the delay? 
Who are we to believe? 
The hon. member for St. Paul's.  
Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
The keynote speaker for this evening will be the Prime Minister of Canada. 
Mr. Marcel Proulx (Hull-Aylmer, Lib.):
My most sincere congratulations to Mr. Brunet.  
Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering-Ajax-Uxbridge, Lib.):
To them we say insh'allah they will continue to prosper, as-salaam alaikum .  
Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay-Boundary-Okanagan, Canadian Alliance):
However, designation as part of the national highway system alone is not enough. 
It put back less than $300 million nationally. 
Pro-rated out, we got back a mere 3% of our own money. 
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
Nothing has been done since. 
Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):
These situations are beginning to cause some concern. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):
Is this Liberal leadership? 
The provinces have been placed in an impossible situation. 
Their pleas have so far fallen on deaf ears. 
The Liberals should talk.  
QUEBEC MINISTER OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS 
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
After all, we will not see any relief at the pumps until next autumn.  
But suppose you live in St. John's, Newfoundland. 
My own province of Saskatchewan is also an oil producer. 
Consumers continue to lose billions of dollars to foreign oil companies.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville, Lib.):
Canada's banks are also strong contributors to the Canadian economy. 
The math clearly works to our benefit.  
The Canadian banking industry is making a strong contribution and deserves our recognition and respect.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Now, it is the senators who are being targeted by the Prime Minister. 
What is the Prime Minister waiting to withdraw his bill?  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to pay tribute to a true Canadian hero. 
R.B. lived his life greatly with class and compassion. 
REFORM PARTY OF CANADA 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
O stands for zero which is the sum total of its policies.  
R is for rich who is exactly who its flat tax will benefit.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
The information in it is damning.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
These audits continue to come forward. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
I would ask her this and I would like an answer. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, let us talk about yesterday. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
She talks about a screw-up and the sharing of information- 
The hon. leader of the Bloc Quebecois.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
And the minister says there is nothing to justify ordering a police investigation.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Let us not get things mixed up.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
On this side of the House we chose to continue to work with these companies. 
As a result, 170 people are still working.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Ten days ago, her department confirmed that there were 78 jobs at Placeteco. 
Where is the proof the minister refers to?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
From our point of view it was an investment worth sticking with.  
I remind the hon. member that we are only but one partner. 
In fact the Government of Quebec supported us in this undertaking.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
We are talking about Placeteco, a serious matter.  
What is she waiting for before making them public?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let us look at them. 
At various times there were as many as 135 working at Placeteco. 
Both companies are now doing well and have the potential for more in the future.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
The hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
The government tried to justify these advertisements by saying that the other guy started it. 
These ads may be good for PR, but they are not good for ER.  
Canadians are not interested in this kind of- 
We will hear the member's question, so I ask members to listen.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
Mr. Speaker, Canadians are not interested in this kind of fight. 
Tomorrow there is a critical meeting of health ministers. 
Will the federal government bring cash to the table?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We like to hear the questions and the responses.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Is that his answer today at this critical juncture?  
We are talking about the future of medicare, something that ties the country together.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We will hear the response. 
I ask members to listen.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
He negotiated the deal with himself.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would be glad to do that.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
That cannot be wrong.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member talks about perception. 
What I want to talk about is the reality. 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Canadian Alliance):
The hon. member for Calgary Southwest can begin his question.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let us quote some other things from the same report: 
Let us get the whole story on the agenda.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Canadian Alliance):
Listen to this quote on ethics from the same audit: 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We were not caught by anybody.  
It is part of our process of continuous improvement. 
We do look at ourselves. 
We do identify where we can make improvements, and we take action.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of the Environment. 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Canadian Alliance):
The minister says that she wants the best system possible. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We saw that there were places where we could make significant improvements. 
I am not going to change that approach.  
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
The hon. Minister of Transport has the floor.  
Hon. David M. Collenette:
There are no problems with bilingual communications in Canada's air space.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I think statements by ministers are at 3 o'clock. 
What kinds of reprisals did employees in her department fear?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member talks about a report from 18 months ago. 
That is two names ago for that party. 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is talking about ethics. 
They would stand and say that it was not $1 billion. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health.  
Will he show that leadership tomorrow?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Well, Mr. Speaker, the minister talks about a plan.  
This government is now in its seventh year in office. 
Where is the plan? 
I want to know why there is not a plan for health care.  
Where is the leadership from this minister? 
Does he not know what leadership is?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, members of the NDP had a plan in their 1997 platform. 
We have made it $15.5 billion.  
We have now doubled that and put in $14 billion more.  
Since then we have put $14 billion more into health care.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
We show them receipts, invoices and cancelled cheques and they pay. 
In principle creating a paper trail for community contributions is simple.  
We are getting into hypothetical questions now. 
If she wants to answer, the hon. Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will get the information from the hon. member. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
However, I do have one concern and that is the focus on debt reduction. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Canadian Alliance):
That audit laments this government's lack of openness. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, again, I do not know where these guys have been. 
We got an internal audit. 
We, the department, made it public. 
We are not hiding from anything. 
We will continue with this kind of action because it is what the people want.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be pleased to raise this issue with the banks. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member obviously did not hear my response. 
BILL C-206-SPEAKER'S RULING 
It will in that case remain eligible for selection in the next draw.  
That, following completion of all deferred divisions, the House shall adjourn.  
Does the hon. government House leader have permission to put the motion?  
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Does the hon. member have permission to put the motion?  
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):
CANADA POST CORPORATION ACT 
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Canadian Alliance):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Quite a few members have petitions to present today. 
I ask them to make a summary of their petitions and not read them.  
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
LABELLING OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS

Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):
Question No. 67- Mrs. Michelle Dockrill: 
Question No. 75- Mr. Leon E. Benoit: 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Each province has regulations for the use of strychnine. 
Control of pocket gophers requires an integrated approach. 
Buffer zones are effective in isolating certain areas from pocket gophers. 
The recommended method of controlling pocket gophers is called a border control strategy. 
This strategy prevents pocket gophers from entering a clean field.  
I ask, Mr. Speaker, that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Each year, as February approaches, there is feverish anticipation in the population.  
And I thank all those who took part in these consultations.  
Then February rolls around, and the media start getting involved. 
Then the Minister of Finance's moment of glory arrives. 
Year after year, the scenario never changes. 
Their expectations are never met. 
But this year things were different. 
However this Canada-wide intention is not what families in Quebec have in mind. 
Once again, they have thumbed their nose at the consensus in Quebec. 
But no improvements are planned.  
Since the early 1990s, those in inadequate housing have paid the price of budgetary restraint.  
For Quebec, this comes to less than $20 million a year. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the comments of the member. 
It is an issue that continues to come up in this place. 
The member said that we should return EI to a true insurance plan. 
As a statement of principle I would agree with that. 
This is very interesting.  
There is no employment insurance fund. 
Let us be honest. 
The money was spent. 
I think it is outrageous to do this. 
Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):
Unfortunately, not everyone will be invited at its table. 
This organization told us the following: 
The association also observed: 
Some of Canada's small business people may like this budget. 
These, in short, were the main remarks of the certified general accountants.  
I will quote the main observations made. 
First we were told ``It was smoke and mirrors''. 
We asked ``Were you satisfied with the budget?'' 
They said ``No, because the unemployed and the provinces got nothing''. 
What did the Bloc Quebecois want? 
We could have easily put together a budget. 
Quebec is now out $1.7 billion annually. 
These requests were ignored. 
What we got was a ridiculous ten cent decrease.  
Indexing is not synonymous with tax cuts.  
It continues to interfere in areas of provincial jurisdiction. 
I will repeat them because this is very important. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed the member's speech. 
I wanted to raise that for him.  
Maybe he can answer it. 
How will we address this dilemma with regard to EI benefits?  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question.  
But, initially, let us set contributions aside. 
People who work already have the distinct advantage of having a job. 
So the plan must be improved in terms of its benefits.  
In this regard, I believe that the Minister of Finance has not gone far enough. 
He has taken the surpluses and put them in other programs. 
Increasingly, businesses are closing their doors, laying off older workers. 
The employment insurance money must be used for those who have worked. 
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
I will be splitting my time with the member for Simcoe-Grey.  
This is why we are doing the work that we are doing.  
They want us to give them some opportunity for tax relief. 
They want to see some reform to the tax system. 
I was pleased to see that.  
First, the plan will restore full indexation. 
My constituents were concerned about indexation and bracket creep. 
Budget 2000 addresses these concerns. 
My constituents will see the benefits, especially those in the low and middle income bracket. 
They will see the results of budget 2000 in deindexation.  
We see an investment of $2.5 billion annually by the year 2004. 
The budget has responded to what we have heard from our constituents. 
I stand in support of budget 2000. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Palliser for his question. 
The whole issue of the free trade agreement is almost a two-way street. 
The world is becoming much smaller as a result of new technologies. 
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, first, I want to thank my colleague for his compliments. 
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
The first is to listen. 
My hat goes off to him. 
Again, my hat goes off to him for that.  
We talk about how the process works. 
What they are looking for is a balanced approach. 
The key word from my constituency was balance.  
They talked about a collaborative effort. 
That is what they want. 
That is a message that I delivered loud and clear.  
I believe that I am here to do good work for them. 
I view the role of the party as being the same. 
My analogy would simply be this. 
I speak most specifically to incompetence.  
Would that make it better? 
Has the platform changed? 
No. Has the party changed? 
My pledge to the future is simply this. 
That is what we are here to do. 
I look forward to any questions my hon. colleagues may have.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member for Simcoe-Grey. 
Last year the imbalance was in excess of $30 billion. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Palliser for his question. 
Some of the white collar jobs could be attributed to foreign investment. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):
I am not really happy to be here today. 
There has been quite a bit of talk about what a positive budget this is. 
I believe everything that has happened has been despite the government. 
Furthermore the prosperity we seem to have is also illusory. 
I sometimes just shake my head in wonderment.  
What a rich country we have. 
We are rich in resources, in mines and in minerals. 
We are rich in agriculture across the country. 
We have much potential. 
What do we see? 
We see a huge debt that has been accumulated over the last 30 years. 
This is a political budget. 
Frankly I am very distressed when governments do this.  
I received two answers. 
This is on the verge of not being factual.  
It was the amount that is above the floor from which they started.  
I would love to have a graph here to show that. 
I think it is good to have long term planning. 
There is no doubt about it. 
The further we plan ahead, the better off we are. 
Let us look at the tax cuts outlined in the budget. 
The government is claiming $58 billion in tax cuts. 
It is incredible that we have $58 billion in tax cuts.  
Let us look at what it really is. 
We have $7.5 billion in social spending on child benefits. 
It does not reduce the tax bill. 
They are mixing together income and expenditures.  
Let us look at the next one. 
Then they are claiming another $13.5 billion. 
It just does not add up and Canadians will be aware of that.  
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the member opposite. 
The $58 billion is an absolute minimum.  
The revenues do not go anywhere near the consolidated revenue funds of the government. 
The government has no access to these revenues. 
They are clearly a program. 
Mr. Speaker, the answer is no and I will explain why. 
The member is asking the wrong person this question. 
The field of mathematics happens to be my profession. 
I have done these computations.  
It has done that consistently and it is wrong. 
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
Let us think about what he was saying.  
Members of that party do not want to support that. 
They think that is not an investment and want to keep their tax dollars. 
It is absolutely ridiculous.  
The deficit is now gone. 
Which party in the House brought forward the fiscal policies to eliminate that deficit? 
That is the only point I want to know from the member.  
I gave it credit. 
It is quite possible that during the Trudeau years governments would have done it differently.  
That is not so. 
That is what would happen.  
They are taxing them to death. 
They are killing them.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Canadian Alliance):
The second mandate is high taxes and increased government spending.  
They are claiming that they are cutting taxes by $58.4 billion. 
That is an illusion. 
Government members should be upfront and honest and say so. 
That equates to about $2.07 additional money per week for the taxpayer. 
It is the number one concern.  
And what does the government do? 
One of the other priorities outside of health care is that of transportation. 
The transportation infrastructure in this country is falling apart. 
The budget this year has put in only $150 million for highways. 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Does she support the bill introduced by Mr. Klein in its present form? 
Does she support the five principles of the health care system?  
Does she not like the fact that we have eliminated bracket creep? 
There is already a multi-tier health care system. 
It is deluding itself if it thinks that. 
It has been proven that it does not work.  
The one it is supporting does not work. 
They do not have that in today's health care system.  
They are looking for leadership and they are not getting it from the federal government. 
They participate every year. 
That is what happens.  
We are participating in a process which is extremely important. 
I want to offer a couple of comments to my friends in the official opposition.  
It could find nothing to criticize or comment on. 
Next week it starts all over again. 
Next week we will begin a series of meetings with people. 
We have looked at the initiatives in this year's budget. 
We have looked at initiatives that we would like to have seen in it. 
We will go once more back into the same process.  
It is an interest that was brought to each of us differentially. 
In his constituency people approached him and started raising the issue with him. 
In my constituency in Winnipeg people met with me. 
We began a discussion. 
We did a little work on it. 
During that year we went to work on it. 
We met with more people and we built a database on it. 
That is what this process is. 
Literally thousands of people across the country will be invited to participate in the process. 
We will add our voice to that of everyone else who comes before the committee. 
That is what the budget is all about. 
There is no secrecy in it. 
This is why the budget has come through with such ease. 
People see it as their budget. 
People see their concerns reflected in it. 
There will always be demands for changes and improvements. 
We will continue to go back into the cycle. 
We will continue to invite Canadians into the process. 
PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTION AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS ACT 
BILL C-6-NOTICE OF TIME ALLOCATION 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF MINISTER OF FINANCE 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):
We all know the history. 
We have that symbol of authority in the House. 
It used to be that the king taxed people too much. 
Has he ever voted against the current king's requisitions? 
I say that advisedly. 
He was censured by the government for doing exactly that.  
Did he vote in favour of it? 
The rabbits were hung on fences in my riding. 
I supported the display wholeheartedly. 
I thought it was a very creative and interesting piece of art.  
The member asked a question and I will take it very directly. 
Have I ever voted against a budgetary motion of the government? 
That is how the government runs. 
That is how human society runs.  
The reality is life. 
The processes are sometimes called parties. 
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):
Madam Speaker, I have a question for the member opposite. 
One line in the budget of this year referred to the net public debt. 
Madam Speaker, I spent five years in opposition. 
Let us look at unemployment. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Madam Speaker, my question for the hon. member is very simple. 
Where did the member stand on the issues of free trade and the GST?  
Things got worse and worse and worse until Canadian voters threw them out. 
Only one sitting member was re-elected and one new member was elected. 
Madam Speaker, it is very simple. 
When this government came to power it changed its fiscal policy. 
They reaped the rewards. 
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):
Madam Speaker, some days the debate in here is better than other days. 
I will be sharing my time with the hon. leader of the Canadian Alliance.  
It will not add up to very much.  
The number one issue that keeps coming up is health care. 
It has been on the table for a long time.  
We need to put into perspective what has actually happened. 
That is not the way Canadians expect their government to act.  
Let us allow ourselves to have that debate and come up with some sustainable solutions. 
Health care must be put at the top of the priority list. 
It is a concern to everyone. 
All of these things have to be factored in when we are looking at solutions.  
We are paying the highest taxes of the industrialized countries. 
Grants were given when there were no applications. 
No follow-ups were done to see if jobs were actually created.  
She drags their names into this debate. 
They are not the problem. 
The hardworking organizations that do a great job are not the problem. 
The problem is the government and the minister that is mismanaging their money. 
It takes over $40 billion a year in interest payments to service that debt. 
In a five year period that is $200 billion just for the interest. 
That will cause a change in a hurry and it will hurt every program. 
Every worthwhile need that citizens in the country have will be affected.  
That should have been addressed in the budget. 
It has been run down. 
The whole air transportation industry is in turmoil. 
We have not seen any solid answers from the government on that.  
We could go on and on. 
The system has failed.  
I would like to give them one on bracket creep.  
Finally it has been done. 
That is not a tax cut. 
It does not add up.  
I will end my comments with that.  
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The answer was they would save 39% in their federal income taxes.  
They certainly do not reflect the budget measures we introduced in 2000.  
Perhaps he would like to clarify the points he made earlier.  
We put out a proposal on a 17% single rate tax. 
Under solution 17 the family would pay $387.  
That is substantial tax relief. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
That is a pile of money. 
The question is not whether some of the HRDC programs are good. 
I was at the Alberta Land Titles Registry just before the budget came down. 
They are saying that it is their cash and they want a few answers.  
In fact I have not had one person tell me that. 
They are hearing about that tax relief, but they are not seeing it. 
That ought to feel good. 
That is a pile of cash. 
That is not really tax relief. 
Off the top we have to take $7.5 billion.  
We have to make another subtraction from the $58.4 billion.

It was going to nail us with that, but decided not to. 
I suppose that could be called a tax break.  
I taught English, not math. 
Math is not my finest suit, but I could figure that much out. 
Let us do the mathematical equation. 
A person cannot even go to McDonald's on that amount. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Maybe the Canadian Alliance has some new math.  
If the government would implement a flat tax, I would save a lot of money''. 
That is who they like.  
Exactly, those are their supporters. 
Madam Speaker, boy, there is a ramble. 
The hon. member is talking about a tax plan and $26 billion in surpluses. 
The member asked me a question about our solution 17. 
That group ran exactly the same numbers for him.  
I put my faith in solution 17. 
I think if solution 17 were implemented it would be terrific. 
What if a person is not married?

My question was a simple one:
I received a letter from a constituent dated March 16 of this year which stated: 
Another constituent wrote to me on February 17 stating: 
What is the Liberal government's real agenda?

The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member's time has expired.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
The legal nightmare that we envisioned has evolved in the way we said it would. 
Only the lawyers have been paid. 
I asked the minister to take some leadership on this issue and do something. 
To conclude, I want to quote from Justice Krever's report. 
The federal government has simply not done that. 
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
In doing so, the Government of Canada met all its obligations under the settlement.
