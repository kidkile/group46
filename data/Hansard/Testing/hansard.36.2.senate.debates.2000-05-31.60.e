Wednesday, May 31, 2000 
The Senate met at 1:30 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
The Late Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas G. Bowie 
Hon. Raymond J. Perrault :
Lieutenant-Colonel Bowie had a rich and full life. 
He was the right arm ofMr. 
He was very popular with the people with whom he worked. 
One quote from the archives states: 
That is a high tribute from the ranks.  
We mourn his loss.  
Hon. Jean-Robert Gauthier :
Citizenship of Canada Bill 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, there are reports of breaches in the data bank. 
I have no more information than that. 
Effect of Proposed Cuts 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I asked for his reaction to the new plan. 
He said that he was very relieved at the change. 
I immediately understood what he meant.  
Replacement of Sea King Helicopters-Operational Requirements of New Aircraft 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
The question is simple. 
Has there been any change in the operational requirements for that aircraft? 
However, we will not be getting the piece of equipment we want. 
I think senators in this chamber will recognize that.  
Replacement of Sea King Helicopters-Release of Submissions of Interest 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Air Canada-Commitments to Small Centres-Government Policy 
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Is the cabinet monitoring this situation? 
For instance, the biggest plane that will service our area will bea 737. 
We were being served by Airbuses. 
It is getting difficult to fly into these small centres.  
It certainly is happening in the area to which I travel by air.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Quite frankly, a number of us were left in Winnipeg.  
Honourable senators, I just want to reinforce my question. 
The short answer is no.  
The honourable senator's concern is real. 
Now we are left with a new set of circumstances.  
Air Canada-Progress of Legislation Setting Out Obligations 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
I have a supplementary question, honourable senators. 
It will be in committee for quite a while, I would think.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
War Between Ethiopia and Eritrea-Possibility of a More Concerted Intervention 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, that is a commendable suggestion to the minister and the government. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Heritage Lighthouses Protection Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Catherine S. Callbeck :
The purpose of Bill S-21, and I am quoting from clause 3, is: 
I am in strong agreement with this point. 
Alterations include dismantling, demolishing and disposal.  
FHBRO conducts these examinations using a set of established criteria. 
Once the evaluation is complete, points are awarded for ease of classification. 
Bill S-21 does not seem to overcome this obstacle.  
On motion of Senator Hays, debate adjourned.  
National Archives of Canada Act 
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Continued 
This is evident in the wording of the census guidelines. 
He tells me that the data is useful in a variety of ways. 
On motion of Senator DeWare, debate adjourned.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
They are here at the invitation of Honourable Senator Poy.  
Welcome to the Senate of Canada.  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Continued 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I rise today to speak to Bill S-12. 
Honourable senators, I must ask a question:
Honourable senators, I am the proud mother of two daughters. 
Their father, who also happens to be my husband, is an equally proud parent. 
Infants' expectations are almost entirely on the side of parents. 
We, in turn, had the expectation that they would put their toys away. 
Both John and I place a high value on education. 
Many will only be able to offer free room and board. 
The custodial order is then changed.  
On motion of Senator Hays, for Senator Sparrow, debate adjourned.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Second Report of Joint Committee Adopted 
Honourable Senator Robichaud, P.C. ( L'Acadie-Acadia )).  
Hon. Louis J. Robichaud :
Honourable senators, I move the adoption of the report.  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration 
Ninth Report of Committee Adopted 
Honourable Senator Rompkey, P.C. ). 
Honourable senators, I move adoption of this report. 
Honourable senators, there will be no hiring quotas. 
However, we will be setting objectives. 
"Objectives," as distinct from "quotas," are a means of measuring progress.  
Everyone is encouraged to complete the questionnaire as accurately as they can.  
The survey will help in two ways. 
Honourable senators, I commend the adoption of this report.  
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson :
Today, the Senate has taken another step in that direction.  
It brings credit to the Senate of Canada.  
It is very important work that they have undertaken. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Canada-Japan Inter-Parliamentary Group 
Tenth Annual Bilateral Meeting with Japan-Canada Parliamentarians Friendship League-Inquiry 
It saw270 business leaders from across Canada in Japan. 
The dollar amount represented by contracts signed was $450 million.  
Since our bilateral meeting, there have been some changes in the Japan-Canada Friendship League. 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Does the senator agree with that? 
I thank the honourable senator for the question. 
Talks are underway, supported by the Business Council on National Issues. 
The Japanese are sensitive about a number of areas, agriculture being one. 
I commend Senator Hays for the award he has received from the Japanese government. 
It is a great tribute to him and his efforts. 
The present Canadian co-chair is the Honourable Ed Lumley. 
That group is engaged in broad discussions on the trade file.  
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
They are right in the midst of Taiwan and China. 
What is their general attitude?  
I would be interested in hearing his opinion.  
Honourable senators, that is a large topic. 
Japan has a close relationship with Taiwan which goes back a long way. 
Japan is a large spender on military hardware and has a large self-defence force. 
One of the great debates in Japan revolves around their future role. 
Taiwan is also, to some degree, involved in that question.  
I appreciate the honourable senator raising the issue.  
PKO resources are already spread too thin, especially in Africa. 
However, we have the potential to do a lot more.  
A second meeting is, I believe, scheduled for later this year. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Energy, the Environment and Natural Resources 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
One can appreciate why that is so with some tobacco executives. 
I do not think this would establish a fatal precedent.  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Perhaps this item could be left on the Order Paper one more day. 
Honourable senators, I move the adjournment of the debate.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
However, that is for a government bill. 
We are talking here about a private bill. 
Honourable senators, we are setting a terrible precedent. 
I do not care that witnesses may be available only at a certain hour. 
How many tails do we need to wag one dog?  
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
I did not say that.  
There is no minister asking to appear.  
Please bear with me for a moment.  
Honourable senators, perhaps I am wrong constitutionally. 
I do not see a differentiation between the two. 
Honourable senators, let me add a word to the honourable senator's about the rules. 
We started to make a distinction some years ago. 
That is the way it is done. 
It is not just a matter of custom and tradition. 
I do not disagree with anything the honourable senator has said. 
That is not my point. 
In custom and practice, why should it be any different? 
Honourable senators, I am not demeaning the importance of private bills. 
I agree with the senator on that point. 
That is what the honourable senator is doing.  
Honourable senators, I happen to agree completely with Senator Lynch-Staunton. 
That is a rarity in this chamber.  
You are coming around.  
I agree that the business of the chamber should take precedence over all other business. 
On motion of Senator Hays, debate adjourned.
