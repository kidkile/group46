ACT OF INCORPORATION OF THE BOARD OF ELDERS OF THE CANADIAN 
EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 69 
Wednesday, March 22, 2000 
The House met at 2 p.m. 
Members sang the national anthem ] 
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, today is World Water Day.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
He later became interim leader for the opposition during the Diefenbaker years.  
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, March 25 is Greek Independence Day. 
Member spoke in Greek ] 
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
His work and its underlining thought motivated the masses.  
My friends, Pakistan Zinda Bad-long live Pakistan.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
I honestly do not think the solicitor general knows what has been spent. 
To add insult to injury, no one wants the darn things. 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
Things are on the move in the world of amateur sport. 
With this good news, our government is showing its faith in Canadian athletes.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
There is still time for them to wake up.  
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, Canadians lament the murder of 36 innocent Sikh villagers killed in Kashmir.  
Mr. Lawrence D. O'Brien (Labrador, Lib.):
Finally, congratulations are also in order for the Dalhousie Young Liberals who- 
The hon. member for Bras d'Or-Cape Breton.  
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP):
The hon. member for Beauharnois-Salaberry.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
The verdict of the popular vote has been accepted. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hail and health to the national champs, an extraordinary effort.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
The question is very simple. 
Who is misleading us?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
The former deputy minister says there were not. 
The minister repeatedly implies that there were. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is the hon. member who is wrong.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, absolutely not.  
Those members are casting aspersions on the individuals who are benefiting from this money. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
The Liberals sure do have flex appeal. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
That leaves $200,000 unaccounted for.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We have reviewed the files in both Placeteco and Techni-Paint. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
What we are asking for is not unreasonable. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Some 170 people are working. 
That was the intent of this program and it is working.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Yet it is simple, Mr. Speaker. 
The minister tells us there were invoices justifying the payment of the grant. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I say again that the invoices were for salaries and overhead. 
They were not used for a banker payment.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Let me quote the memo that confirms it: 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Action is needed now. 
The Prime Minister is going to Alberta this week. 
Will he move beyond the empty speeches? 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is absolutely no secret deal, absolutely none. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
I remind him he has been there seven years.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member first of all has the wrong years. 
They were much more recent than that.  
Not once did they mention the plight of ordinary Canadians.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I have talked about this on a number of occasions. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, that answer has nothing to do with the question. 
Obviously they cannot both be right. 
Either there are no explicit guidelines or there are explicit guidelines. 
Who is telling the truth in this matter? 
We need to have an answer?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We know that is just not so.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
How can the Minister of Human Resources Development say what she has just- 
The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
They were of a value that was equivalent to the moneys that were allowed.  
The hon. member for Roberval.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the minister's answers on the two previous cases are disconcerting. 
Lots of people are watching us. 
The minister tells us it was used to pay invoices.  
What I am asking her is to tell us the truth. 
What invoices were paid with this money? 
That is what we want to know. 
We want to know the truth. 
Where did the taxpayers' money go? 
That is what we want to know.  
This must never be challenged.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, despite the hon. member's huffing and puffing, the answer remains the same. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
It is helping Canadian companies to do very well on international markets. 
Indeed, the EDC works with two accounts. 
It has a corporate account with 98% of the transactions that describe exactly that.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
It is a matter of commercial confidentiality.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Emac International; Products financed: aluminum form work and shoring equipment; Principal exporter:
Aluma Systems Incorporated; Amount: $458,000.  
If this information was available in 1983, why the secrecy now? 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
We will continue to do so. 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
My question is very simple. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
The Export Development Corporation does not give grants. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
My question is simple. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Can I be any more clear than that?  
Perhaps the hon. Minister for International Trade has not finished.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
This is an extraordinary contribution. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Go directly to the question, please.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We heard the question. 
Now we will hear the answer, please.  
If the hon. member would like to return them, it would be up to him.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Will the minister explain to us what a pocket of poverty is? 
Only the first part of the question is in order. 
The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, again the hon. member is incorrect. 
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
The hon. parliamentary secretary.  
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
The hon. Minister for International Trade.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
There is nothing new here. 
Canada has been using the Canada account for more than 30 years.  
Every other country does exactly the same.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
This is buck passing at its worst. 
All it does is transfer hard earned cash from consumers to consultants.  
He called upon us to proceed with it right away. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):

Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):
The petitions deal with the subject of mammography. 
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):
The fourth petition, Mr. Speaker, is on behalf of rural mail couriers. 
I would like to table that petition.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
The act discriminates against seniors from certain countries. 
It only follows that the Liberal government would discriminate against immigrants by- 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
We know that this government will not- 
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I present a petition on behalf of rural route mail couriers. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
The petitioners say that the Senate of Canada is an undemocratic institution. 
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions. 
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):

That is two days in a row.

Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have three petitions.  
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, you have saved the best for last.  
The first petition I have is from my riding of Lower Sackville. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to present a petition on poverty.  
As we all saw, there were important steps taken in that budget.  
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
A corrigendum to that effect is available at the table. 
I regret any inconvenience or embarrassment this may have caused hon. members.  
Today our economy depends on a very good seamless transportation system.  
It is important for the federal government to bring the parties together at the table. 
This is an area that the federal Liberal government of today has reneged on.  
The federal government has to play a part in helping to make this a reality.  
The federal government must overhaul its tax policies for the transportation industry. 
Our transportation industry has gone through and is going through some major changes. 
I speak of the CN-BNSF combination. 
I speak of the crisis in the Canadian trucking industry. 
The federal government must play a leading role. 
This is badly needed and has to be done sooner than later.  
It has to be a continental plan. 
We need a continental plan to move goods and people.  
We have to think long term. 
That will affect our economic well-being. 
Mr. Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough-Agincourt, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to my colleague across the way. 
Indeed some of the points she raised have great merit. 
Canada needs to move forward to the 21st century. 
We have highways that are in desperate need of repair. 
I travel the 401 on the way to Windsor. 
I saw the site where the accident occurred last summer. 
I do not find that to be a good priority. 
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I have one simple question to ask my colleague.  
A city does not necessarily have the funds to look after an airport.  
We still do not have that highway. 
How will we make sure that the small airports have the facilities they need? 
How will we make sure that the communities are able to support them? 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Our country is the second largest in the world. 
Forty per cent of our GDP is comprised of exports. 
There is a crying need for money to be put into the transportation system.  
Railways played a critical role in bringing Canada together.  
No one can deny the importance of a seamless, good transportation system. 
All of these have played a major role in Canadian history.  
Those were the days of regulation. 
On the other hand, Canadian Airlines was left to the market forces.  
Canadians became apprehensive of what was happening.  
This has caused concern for many who come from western Canada.  
Now that Air Canada has taken over Canadian Airlines, the apprehension still exists. 
Canadians will demand more competition. 
The fact remains that there will not be competition. 
Without competition the Canadian travelling public is going to pay a heavy price. 
We can already see that. 
Air Canada talks about negotiating this.  
I hope it does not do that. 
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
The competition is there. 
He is from western Canada. 
It cannot happen overnight. 
It will not happen in one week. 
The government sat and did nothing. 
Yes, the government gave Air Canada two years. 
That applies to the government too.  
Mr. Gerard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):
The same goes for the Montreal-Toronto and Montreal-Vancouver flights. 
The problem is in the regions. 
I would like the hon. member to confirm this to me.  
Smaller aircraft can be used. 
A fleet change can take place. 
These are the issues which need to be addressed.  
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
However by its nature, transportation does have an impact on the environment. 
It is also the single largest source of our greenhouse gas emissions.  
It supports Canada's trade and tourism and underpins our competitiveness as a nation. 
I should point out that we are not alone in this. 
What is causing this growth? 
The issues and solutions are complex. 
This unique initiative provided a comprehensive and holistic look at our transportation system. 
From their work it is clear that there is no single solution.  
New technologies and operating practices offer potential. 
New vehicle designs using lightweight materials will improve vehicle efficiency. 
This is just a snapshot of some of the options examined. 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
We were talking about $2.6 billion. 
The hon. member must realize that we are talking about partners. 
We are hoping that the provincial government will also play a major role.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the government member. 
There are two points to this question coming from Atlantic Canada.  
They were cut anyway.  
My question is twofold. 
Petitions have been filed on behalf of those communities recognizing its importance.  
Will the government commit to that?  
We in the government are concerned about this.  
What about the Trans-Canada Highway?  
The Trans-Canada Highway is involved. 
The member talked about railways. 
We all remember that back in 1993 we were involved in an electoral campaign. 
We talked as well about economic development.  
The issue raised by the official opposition party is a fundamental one. 
It is directly related to economic growth as well as tourism.  
The national system alone accounts for 25,000 kilometres. 
The conclusions were fairly positive. 
We know what happened. 
We know there are specific trade and transportation corridors.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
I refer members to the CANPASS program, which they probably know about. 
The CANPASS in Windsor, Ontario is a pilot project and works very well.  
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I have two short questions for the minister.  
Why not focus more on rail transportation and shipping?  
In Quebec, we have the St. Lawrence River, which is hardly used. 
I have one more question. 
The minister is familiar with the riding of Matapedia-Matane. 
Business people say about the airport ``It does not make sense. 
The results were quite positive.  
It is extremely competitive. 
Naturally, it is very strategically located. 
It handles an enormous volume.  
Mr. Gerard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):
That is the Bloc Quebecois position as far as this Reform Party motion is concerned.  
There are different types of transportation: land, marine and air. 
This is why the SHIP program was abolished. 
That program had been established under the Conservatives. 
I was listening to the minister. 
Highway 138 is the only road linking Quebec City to the Lower North Shore region. 
In short, everything comes in and out of our area by truck.  
There is unanimity on this project in the Charlevoix region.  
The minister of revenue spoke of the road infrastructure program. 
This is a desired program, of course, and one that should continue to exist. 
The provinces should be running this program. 
Here too, we can imagnie what the expectations of municipalities were.  
It is a drop in the bucket. 
It will create expectations and disappointment. 
It is the same for school boards. 
The provincial government cut their allowable expenses. 
It wanted to transfer responsibilities to municipalities and school boards. 
Why does Quebec want to separate? 
Why does Quebec want to achieve independence? 
Let us talk about VIA Rail. 
The Bloc Quebecois has a position regarding VIA Rail. 
The government must not act precipitously. 
It must start with a franchising pilot project.  
I would also like to talk about the marine transportation system. 
Some mentioned the fact that we have such a system. 
I am referring to the Minister of Transport's policy regarding the privatization of ports. 
Now it wants to hand them over to municipalities. 
In this case, we are inclined to think the minister was floating a trial balloon. 
Everything is dependent on these ferries and tourism development.  
Air service in Canada is in a shambles. 
The minister said the goal was to reorganize the air industry. 
The deal with Onex smacked of influence peddling.  
We went through a period of turbulence. 
The minister jumped without a parachute. 
How he was going to land was everybody's guess. 
Inter-Canadian went bankrupt; it is no longer in operation. 
This is the case for the airports of Baie-Comeau, Forestville and Saint-Irenee. 
This service was handed over to the Pointe-Lebel municipality's volunteer firefighters.  
There have been three plane crashes in eastern Quebec within eight months.  
There is much I could say on this. 
In my opinion, things are always done better if we do them ourselves. 
Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):
Then he went on with his remarks about that coin.  
Second, the hon. member spoke of the debacle in the airline industry. 
I am certain that the hon. member understands and will apologize. 
That report and study was so successful- 
Mr. Speaker, the member is right, the NDP had reservations. 
The NDP has reservations about many things.  
It is hard to keep track of what is going on in Charlevoix. 
They want to know what is going on in the federal government. 
We pay taxes and get nothing in return.  
This is what people want to know. 
What will the government do with our taxes? 
This is the first component.  
The minister must now implement the report's recommendations, so that things will work.  
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
There was love too. 
Communications are airports and also wharves.  
It is very expensive to travel from Baie-Comeau to Montreal. 
But there are not enough passengers because of the cost. 
It is the chicken and the egg. 
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Is there unanimous consent to allow for an extension?  
The motion before us is very important. 
They have been negligent because they have allowed the system to collapse. 
He was not in his seat.  
It does not matter. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The member from the New Democratic Party is a very experienced parliamentarian. 
It is not a case that the member will not have an opportunity to speak. 
I think the points have been made. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to know how much time I have left.  
Mr. Speaker, I have not had a chance to speak.  
Thank you very much for your generosity, Mr. Speaker. 
Energy prices have been soaring to record levels day after day. 
We are looking for a conservation plan. 
We are looking for a regulation plan for energy prices.

Is the House ready for the question?  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Transportation infrastructure is vital to Canada's future economic development. 
Our transportation infrastructure is degrading rapidly under the Liberal government. 
I want to talk about three important issues of transportation. 
We are the only country in the world to do that.  
We provide our farmers in western Canada about six cents on the dollar. 
There is a very severe attack of heavy equipment on the roads.  
We go to the next phase. 
What did the federal government do in terms of helping our farmers? 
It took away their transportation subsidies. 
What does it put back to support the transportation system? 
It is a shame.  
Farmers in that province look at this. 
We feel it is an investment in the economy of western Canada.  
The Liberal government is responsible for interprovincial highways. 
Bad roads cost lives. 
It has to be maintained and improved.  
The government has totally decimated the rail system. 
It talks about giving a few subsidies for the railways. 
What have they done? 
They have continued to reduce subsidies to railroads.  
It was a great job. 
I loved the railway dearly.  
We are now faced with record energy costs in the country. 
In Saskatchewan it is 74.9 cents. 
Oil only hit a record of about $34 a barrel. 
Now it is down to $28 or $29 a barrel.  
The record price in 1991 was 61.9 cents. 
We have only had a 1 cent or 2 cent tax increase since that time. 
I would like the Liberals to undertake to have an energy summit. 
Gas prices are at record levels. 
I went on to say: 
Regulation is not a dirty word. 
We are not talking about chocolate bars here. 
However, energy is the linchpin of our economy. 
Energy is the key underpinning of our economy.  
That is why I and the NDP are asking for this action. 
I have also asked that any national strategy must, by necessity, include a conservation component. 
We do not worry about ripping people off. 
I am a former business person. 
I have been in business for many years in different businesses. 
I believe that profit is very important. 
That is why I did this.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
It spends 4% not 85%. 
I am very pleased that the member asked me her question. 
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
I agree with the member on that.  
I also want to get into the realm of environment. 
Would the member explain his party's position. 
Does his party support meeting the Kyoto protocol? 
If so, how does it plan to do it? 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for that question. 
The environment is a very important element in this world. 
We really are custodians of this planet for future generations. 
Out of 37 years we have had 35 surplus budgets.  
We had no deficit and no debt either.  
The member raises some good questions and I thank him for that. 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
I think we could throw a t in there for tax party as well. 
I would like him to answer that question.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for that question as well. 
There is a six cent difference. 
B.C. is about the same.  
That is all I really know about it. 
We have some ferries across the river here and there.  
It keeps passing the buck on highways. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
If it continues no one will be able to go out. 
They will have to stay home and we might not need a transportation system.  
I think most Canadians now understand the situation.  
It needs action and it is needed now. 
Yet look at the state of our highways. 
Our largest trading partner, the U.S., has recognized the importance of highways. 
That government has made a commitment to the highway system. 
The act is a firm commitment to improving the nation's highway system.  
It is estimated to be worth some $218 billion. 
In their reported entitled ``Catching Tomorrow's Wave'', they said: 
Our basic transportation infrastructure needs improvement. 
This is an issue that must be addressed. 
Transportation infrastructure is inextricably bound up with the economic development of our region...To 
Some 38% of our national highway system is considered substandard. 
We need only look at Highway 101 in Nova Scotia as a prime example. 
Why has the government not sat down with the provinces to negotiate such a program? 
Unfortunately, statistics are here to prove it.  
This falls far short in its attempt to address Canada's crumbling highway system.  
Currently, it has a surplus exceeding $3 billion.  
The federal government collects $4 billion in fuel tax a year. 
The province of Nova Scotia cannot go it alone. 
Transportation affects every aspect of our lives. 
Shipbuilding is one of Canada's long-standing industries. 
It is highly respected for the quality of its products. 
One of the reasons for its success is the skill of its workers. 
Several of them have been working in this shipyard for over 20 years. 
They have developed a level of expertise one cannot achieve in school.  
What is the future for VIA Rail? 
Does the government intend to keep throwing money at it? 
Does it intend to privatize it? 
Has it thought about it?  
The United States Surface Board has already held its hearings and released a decision. 
Yet our government holds fast to the motto ``Let us wait and see''.  
What about the airline crisis of last August? 
Obviously the government does not see transportation as a priority. 
When will the government accept the responsibility of leadership? 
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
There is no doubt about it. 
However, we are not dictators. 
It is what makes our economy work.  
We can pay taxes in many ways. 
That is what drives our economy. 
It is one of the main engines which drives our economy.  
The hon. member said it. 
The government can consult until the cows come home. 
It needs to be put together, maintained and improved. 
I do not understand where the member is coming from with his comments.  
However, let us face facts. 
Our provincial finance minister is telling us this every day. 
The government has not thought about the sick. 
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
He decided to tax gasoline. 
As a matter of fact, it seems as though it has been completely forgotten. 
Then it disappears into that abyss known as general revenue. 
This year the federal budget allocated $150 million to highways. 
Maybe he should take a long drive. 
I bet the Prime Minister would give him the time off.  
What is the price for government inaction? 
Canadians pay the price of the government's neglect. 
This all contributes to lost productivity and lost trade opportunities. 
It does nothing to advance the cause of job creation. 
I do not think that will go very far.  
I do not think that is asking very much. 
It is a very reasonable request.  
Perhaps my colleague has hit on one of the new government strategies. 
Millions of dollars are spent each year to obtain public input. 
Three years later and the report is gathering dust on the library shelves. 
Enough time has been wasted on studies. 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
The highways are like the arteries of Canada. 
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
We can talk about rail line abandonment. 
That is quite an issue in a lot of parts of the country. 
I am sure my colleague from Cypress-Grasslands will talk about that later. 
Railway efficiency is another issue that needs to be looked at. 
It is a huge concern in Canada. 
We are still going through the huge restructuring of the air industry. 
We have some pains there that need to be looked at. 
I am sure environmental issues will be addressed when it comes to transportation. 
It is the high price of fuel.  
The spike in fuel prices has hit truckers especially hard. 
That is an extremely rare occurrence.  
More regulation is not the answer.  
This is a kind of made in Canada solution I suppose.  
This ripped $60 billion out of the Alberta economy alone. 
High fuel prices have hit every sector of the economy. 
That jump was the largest month to month increase in five years. 
They cannot afford this. 
The official opposition believes that the government must immediately reduce fuel taxes. 
There is no reason for this tax to still be in place. 
Furthermore the government has collected even more tax revenue as the price of gasoline increases. 
This compounds the problem. 
This is a tax on a tax and it is unfair to consumers.  
How many more reports do we need? 
Fuel prices in the country are too high.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
There were 3,000 last year alone. 
For 10 years I was involved with police issues. 
It really was a problem. 
Fatalities have been cut in half while traffic has doubled. 
That is quite an impressive trend. 
Road safety in Canada is very much a shared responsibility. 
It is my belief that the genesis of our progress is co-operation. 
The whole notion of Road Safety Vision 2001 has four overall safety priorities.  
First, we must raise awareness of road safety issues. 
I know it is a very important issue. 
For each priority a number of projects are under way in each jurisdiction.  
The first priority is to raise public awareness of specific road safety issues. 
Their parents play an important role in this instance.  
Packaged with each of these videos is a supporting facilitator's guide. 
There is good reason for this. 
There is a total of 70 programs to date in this very important initiative.  
There are national organizations in place. 
At the same time the government and I believe it is attainable. 
We can improve our current standing in the world in this very important area. 
After all, safety is a shared responsibility. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I will be dividing my time. 
By that time it is too late.  
Estey called this sort of activity a breach of the spirit of the law. 
Now it is a ghost town. 
The reason for this is fairly clear. 
However, the producers will pay in other ways.  
Some small villages will lose up to 30% of their revenue.  
An equivalent annual expenditure would be $2.9 billion in this country. 
I see that I have used up my time. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Much to the government's surprise, he did exactly what it asked. 
He recommended changes which would in fact improve the system.  
Producers would sign contracts with grain companies for delivery of the grain.  
This would result in improved efficiencies and reduced producer costs. 
He recommended that the rate cap be replaced with a revenue cap. 
These savings of up to $300 million are not being achieved.  
Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay-Boundary-Okanagan, Ref.):
In the last parliament I was involved quite heavily in transport. 
Take, for example, VIA Rail. 
The government of course has to cover that.  
The subsidies in 1997 were $212 million. 
Interestingly, we have a really good private sector comparison that we can use. 
They provide a lot of good, solid, sustainable jobs and they pay taxes. 
VIA Rail leaves something too. 
It just dumps straight through.  
The Rocky Mountaineer said ``We can't do that. 
However, it said ``We have a corporate responsibility. 
The private sector can run a transcontinental rail system in this country. 
I do not believe that. 
The private sector can do the job. 
We have to give them the opportunity.  
They are operated like businesses, very much like the private sector would operate.  
It was losing money at virtually every one of them. 
All the communities did just that and the government accepted it.  
In Castlegar, my home airport, we were losing over $500,000 a year. 
The community took on that airport and turned it around. 
The government is now making a move to reintroduce the very thing it cancelled. 
I worked at airports for 22 years. 
Airport firefighters are trained, dedicated personnel. 
They are good people. 
Canada needs a better transportation network. 
Two wrongs do not make a right.  
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
I am going to talk about marine ports and air regulations.  
Municipal governments entered into these negotiations in a spirit of co-operation. 
The goodwill in some negotiations is now completely gone. 
There are real problems with this shortened list.  
I know what a remote community is. 
I have lived there. 
I made my living there. 
That road does not exist.  
Many of the same families are still there. 
I am well aware of problems along the same lines in other west coast communities.  
Lo and behold, what is happening now? 
This has been happening across the country. 
The Federation of Canadian Municipalities and others are complaining. 
This is not fair negotiation.  
It is a widespread issue and local authorities are complaining.  
These are stakeholder comments.  
That is why we are so respected in the international community in this endeavour. 
We cannot tie up our entrepreneurs and pilots in red tape. 
In other words, flight visibility was 2 miles.  
The complaints go on. 
That is a list of some of my complaints. 
What is happening is the federal government is doing all of those things. 
This is simply not fair.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, the comment from my colleague was a good one.  
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
Simply put, this debate is about getting the government to show some necessary leadership. 
He claims that escalating gas prices are outside his jurisdiction. 
He has refused to even consider reducing his share of the profits. 
We have not gotten off to a very good start. 
He merely walks away from the issue saying it is not his problem. 
Then we have our rail system. 
At the same time it has been helping the American rail system. 
That deficit plagued U.S. railroad agency gets Canadian federal government support. 
At the same time our own rail system is being dramatically reduced. 
They plan to expand into other parts of Canada.  
There has been no plan in place. 
There has been no leadership. 
Unfortunately this puts out the fires for just a short period of time. 
This is the same problem with our transportation industry. 
Our highways have been left to break up and disintegrate. 
It will now cost many billions of dollars to get them back up to scratch. 
The same goes for rail transportation.  
It is part of the Fraser River Port Authority. 
Surrey North is also home to a large rail marshalling yard and an intermodal facility. 
That was in my leaner days. 
It was just a wonderful drive on the highways. 
Through the mountains it was a wonderful drive. 
It was washboard and bone rattling. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
My constituents care about transportation. 
I will tell the House about the makeup of my constituency. 
The constituency of Surrey Central is mostly an urban community. 
A few months ago about 1,200 people on average moved into Surrey every month. 
Lots of new development and construction took place to accommodate the influx of people. 
Both these highways pass through many residential areas. 
Industrial development is important to create and sustain jobs in Canada. 
Rather the government discourages jobs by increasing taxes. 
Small business is the backbone of our economy. 
Road development and maintenance of the roads are important elements in urban planning. 
It is very effective.  
Car pooling in Canada, particularly on the lower mainland, is not effective at all. 
It is absolutely ridiculous. 
Crime control is a serious problem with park and ride. 
Break-in and theft of vehicles happen very frequently.  
It should be reduced. 
I do not see anything being done in Canada in that regard. 
If the government does not address these problems they become more serious.  
Nigeria did not plan like we plan in Canada. 
Its government did not show any leadership in this area, at least not enough leadership. 
Traffic congestion on the roads became very serious. 
The situation was serious.  
Therefore the motion is very important and timely.  
The other aspects of transportation are equally important. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
