EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 85 
Thursday, April 13, 2000 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The House adopted it at first reading. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT AND THE STATUS OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES 
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
I would like to point out that this is an interim report. 
The standing committee will be presenting its final report by June 1.  
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Canadian Alliance):
We are tabling a dissenting report unanimously. 
We oppose the report and we are tabling a dissenting report.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, in connection with this report, I would like to point out that- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the opposition is able to present a dissenting report. 
I thank hon. members for their support.  
STATUTORY PROGRAM EVALUATION ACT 
The third question would be is it being done efficiently? 
(Motions deemed adopted, bill read the first time and printed) 
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
Mr. Raymond Lavigne (Verdun-Saint-Henri, Lib.):
This practice constitutes a health risk to the population as well as an environmental mess. 
I therefore support this petition wholeheartedly.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Canadian Alliance):
They would not like to see the bill pass through the houses of parliament.  
Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. David Iftody (Provencher, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have three petitions to present this morning. 
The first petition concerns Bill C-23.  
Mr. David Iftody (Provencher, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the next two petitions I have address the same topic.  
Since 1989 the number of poor children in Canada has increased by 60%.  
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
I wish to table this petition on their behalf.  
Mr. Speaker, I would ask that all questions be allowed to stand 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 2000 
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
It is clear that competitive tax rates are essential. 
This kind of thinking reflects a sixties or seventies view of the world. 
This is a staggering sixfold increase in just 10 years.  
In the last five years there have been 50 different tax increases. 
The 2000 budget was the tax cutting budget. 
The 2000 budget falls short of its potential.  
The case for deep and immediate tax cuts is real. 
The PC Party of Canada firmly believes that Canadians have suffered long enough. 
That surplus ought to be returned to the Canadian taxpayers.  
It is essential that the CHST funding be restored to the 1993-94 levels.  
Instead, it has chosen simply to put a band-aid over an arterial wound. 
That is a surplus of $6 billion.  
EI premiums are a regressive tax on the poorest of Canadians. 
It does not seem like a fair system.  
It is not to be used as a fund to pad government books.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
Cancer patients are going to the U.S. for treatment. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I have listened to the comments of the hon. member. 
We are also proposing a $3,000 deduction for each child. 
I wonder if the hon. member has some reaction to that.  
We feel that it would support the family and children. 
The family is the future of Canada. 
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
I echo the words of my colleague from Markham. 
Promptly after the announcement of that budget over 12,000 young Canadians declared bankruptcy. 
We would have been free of debt within a period of four to five years.  
What happened to that budget? 
Since then our level of debt reached the point of strangulation. 
We have basically killed ourselves with the debt load.  
That did not happen.  
That was basically an insult to western Canadians as well. 
That did not happen.  
We know they have to be paid.  
I remind members of the interest on that. 
Without going through detailed charts and analyses, the calculation is very fundamental. 
Again this is arithmetic that a grade school student could understand. 
We have to get the economy moving. 
Today money has no boundaries. 
One can move money around in the blink of an eye. 
The government in the last seven years has missed a golden opportunity. 
It brags about what it has done in the last seven years. 
Indeed there is some room for boasting. 
It did not have to do it at the expense of the provinces. 
Let us look at some of its successes. 
Let us look at the deficit and why it was reduced. 
Why this magic transformation after 1993? It was because reality set in. 
The government had no choice. 
It had to act and it did act. 
The question is how did it do it. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Canadian Alliance):
The debate today deals with the budget and budgetary matters. 
It was the compound interest on the debt that strangled the government.  
That is why I used the analogy of the individual and his or her credit. 
We are barely getting out of that. 
The member is absolutely right about the medication. 
The health minister is still on that same bent and talks about designer programs. 
Canadians want health care. 
There is more the government can do. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):
Today we are talking about the current budget.  
When I think of the implications of the budget, I immediately think about families. 
Psychologically, that is very discouraging.  
The rest of it is taken from us. 
The Liberals do not do what is good for families. 
They do not do what is good for children. 
The government has no money. 
The degree to which this government does it is excessive. 
How they are delivered is a matter of great debate. 
The government's anti-family agenda continues. 
The previous speaker from the Progressive Conservative Party spoke about the debt. 
The message from the PR department of the government is that everything is fine. 
Yet the facts belie the situation. 
The bill we are debating is the implementation of parts of this budget. 
I happen to have a copy of the budget here. 
It is a fairly big document. 
It has about 350 pages in it. 
I am on page 52 of the budget plan 2000. 
With respect to the debt, it says ``Net public debt''. 
We see in 1998-99 it was $576.8 billion. 
We look at the current budget. 
Then we have the projection for the next budget for planning purposes. 
What is the number? 
It is $576.8 billion. 
We have young pages in this place. 
Earlier today we had a number of young people in the visitors' gallery. 
I take partial responsibility for that because I sat on my hands. 
Yes, I always voted. 
The numbers are obvious. 
In the last year it was over $40 billion. 
It is simply true that they did not look at the debt. 
They pretended it did not exist. 
They did not address it.  
In 1993-94 the debt was $508.2 billion. 
My numbers are a little too high because those are the projected numbers. 
The tax revenues are up. 
It is right in the budget document. 
The amount of actual program spending the government has cut is minuscule. 
The auditor general is a non-partisan officer of the House. 
He does not use the word boondoggle, we do. 
I have a surprise for a lot of people who do not know this. 
Have the Liberals corrected it according to the actuarial standards? 
They have made some little mediocre changes. 
The next paragraph is the one which will shock members. 
I have exposed the secret. 
It is in the book in a little paragraph on page 76. 
The lid has been blown off that one. 
We have seen all of that. 
The government is not responsible. 
We have a hardworking energetic population. 
It should be debt free. 
They should hang their heads in shame because they have failed utterly.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
Not that I support it. 
We in the Bloc Quebecois voted against the budget. 
It is hard to oppose the principle of parental benefits. 
The government is putting certain social measures in place, such as this one.  
What I think is needed is a real family policy. 
That is what Quebec is aiming for and it has laid down some important groundwork. 
For there to be real assistance, there needs to be consistency. 
That would best be achieved by one level of government looking after things.  
That is what Quebec wants to do. 
That would be the ideal.  
I am referring here to high unemployment regions.  
How inconsistent that regional disparity is not taken into account with respect to parental benefits. 
This is not consistent.  
And there is another thing. 
In general, to interfere in provincial jurisdictions. 
It is completely ridiculous.  
The committee went on a tour and there were protests everywhere. 
But the government went ahead anyway.  
In 1993, a leaders' debate was held. 
It is one of the options being considered by the Conservative Party''.  
That too was normal, because there were more poor people in certain regions. 
It is paid out based on need.  
I told them that it was now based on population.  
Someone then said ``So why are we in the federal system? 
What is the advantage? 
Sometimes the explanation is that there are tax points.  
Tax points are the same thing. 
Quebec has its own department of revenue and collects its own taxes. 
The other provinces do not. 
He says ``Quebec gets this amount of money, which is generous''. 
It is not constructive spending.  
There is another $219 million that Quebec does not receive. 
The federal system serves them well. 
Ontario is the province best served by the federal government, in every respect.  
The Liberals currently hold just about every seat in Ontario. 
This has to be said. 
I am greatly concerned about shipbuilding. 
Unfortunately, I did not see any additional moneys for shipbuilding. 
There is no new program, no new measure for the shipbuilding industry. 
Exports are often mentioned. 
The government talks about globalization and the Internet. 
We know that the federal Liberal government cut transportation subsidies. 
We see the debate that took place over current gas prices. 
This government is not listening to what the regions are saying. 
It is not listening to low-income families. 
The Minister of Finance is cautious, if nothing else. 
I think that people are entitled to all the necessary information. 
They should talk to their member of parliament. 
They are entitled to objective information. 
They must see it for themselves.  
It ignores provincial jurisdiction. 
That is the main thing wrong with it.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
For once, it admits that there are particular problems in that area.  
Shipping and shipbuilding are not exempt. 
It has to be or it will be an incredible stratagem. 
We must go further and pass it at third reading.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):
In my community those payments are certainly one of the big concerns. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
But the member is definitely right. 
We saw that these cases are predominantly in the Prime Minister's riding. 
There are also some in Montreal, but not in my riding. 
She applied it where there were pockets of poverty. 
Therefore, it still does not have a significant impact on my riding.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
A budget is really about more than money. 
It should never be seen as just being about money.  
As we know, the budget sets the priorities for a government. 
It sets a sense of direction. 
It says a lot about the attitude of government and what government is all about. 
It is a very important topic.  
Usually a budget attempts to be good news. 
However, I am afraid this budget was not good news. 
It was not something which we could stand and be really proud of.  
Did the government listen to Canadians when it fashioned the budget? 
I have held a lot of meetings over the past number of weeks and months. 
I have talked to people and listened to what they said. 
I will read a few quotes which come directly from them. 
We are talking about an issue that affects people daily. 
Many people across this country need their automobiles. 
Automobiles are no longer a luxury, they are a necessity. 
The cost of gasoline is too high. 
That is an issue that was not addressed by the budget.  
People are concerned about what is happening. 
They are very pleased when we communicate with them. 
Why are these hospitals in debt? 
Why is our health care system suffering? 
When they snap their fingers, we jump. 
Again, this is very true when it comes to our health care system. 
Look at what has happened. 
Only those who can afford certain services will be able to get them. 
Everybody else will wait in line. 
Health care in our country is a very serious issue. 
What has the government done for health care in the budget? 
It did not address any of the problems that students have. 
It was dressed up to look good''. 
The jobs are classified as McJobs. 
They have been around for quite some time. 
This is not what people want. 
People see through this. 
They realize that this is not sincerity. 
It is not setting a true attitude of caring and understanding for the people.  
Cape Breton is a wonderful part of our province. 
It has all kinds of potential. 
People see through that.  
These are the words of my constituent, they are not my words. 
We can do that.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Was it the hon. member's intention to split his time?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We need the infrastructure now. 
We need these programs to move in favour of the communities.  
We want to watch that infrastructure very closely. 
The health care system is a mess. 
I have spoken about this already. 
We know that this must be more than window dressing. 
These are very important issues. 
This is a very real problem for many people, particularly seniors. 
I have many comments I can make about this issue.  
In some cases, constituents never see their elected representatives. 
The government backed off rather quickly because there was quite an outcry from the public.  
If they combine their voices with that of others they can get some change. 
We have to make the government listen. 
Who can live on a $575 per month CPP disability pension? 
Yet, they have trouble getting the disability pension. 
When they do get it, it is only $575 per month. 
There is not much left over. 
This issue was sadly lacking in the budget. 
What happened to the debt? 
Is the government not worried about it? 
That is a very important comment. 
What will we be leaving our children? 
What will our legacy be to our children? 
This is what we in the NDP are fighting for. 
This is what we feel the government should maintain. 
Unfortunately, we see the government moving in an opposite direction. 
They look at whether or not that service is available to them. 
What kind of system are we leaving to our children?  
I will share another comment with the House because I like this one in particular. 
I think that is a good one. 
Was it the Minister of Finance?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We do not want to get carried away here. 
We just cannot use the name. 
The hon. member for Halifax West.  
However, the key is this. 
These are the kinds of comments that are coming forward. 
We have to get past the bottom line being just the dollar. 
By that I do not mean that the dollar is not important. 
Of course it is important. 
There is much more to the budget than just the dollars themselves. 
In conclusion, I would say that we certainly were disappointed with the budget. 
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Canadian Alliance):
Where does he see the rates stopping?  
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Canadian Alliance):
This budget is about tinkering and tokenism and nothing more.  
Canadians are getting less. 
We have seen our disposable income continually fall. 
We have become worse off. 
There is something desperately wrong with this. 
This all comes back to the Minister of Finance. 
Unfortunately, he does not understand that this is not his money. 
I chatted with my colleague, the member for St. Albert. 
He introduced Bill C-477, which I found very fascinating. 
There is something that is quite startling in that bill. 
I want to read one little section of what he is trying to do. 
Again, the member for St. Albert tabled four criteria this morning. 
Time and again we see that there is no accountability. 
These programs create a life of their own. 
Unfortunately, that is not happening.  
The guy who is holding the purse strings is the Minister of Finance. 
I will give an example from my riding. 
One of those institutions is about to be closed. 
There is not enough money. 
The pie is not big enough. 
Health care in this country is in a crisis.  
Let us look at some specific things that this budget does or does not do. 
It talks about bracket creep. 
I applaud the government for eliminating bracket creep. 
Let us call a spade a spade. 
It is absolutely amazing. 
It cancels future tax increases and that is supposed to be tax relief. 
It is beyond comprehension. 
We have to put a solution on the table. 
I am extremely proud of what the Canadian Alliance has put out there. 
It did not help them. 
All the money was for naught. 
We gave them no hope and no future. 
They were extremely frustrated five years later.  
Our health care system is crumbling before our eyes. 
People are dying while on waiting lists. 
Let us look at the billion dollar boondoggle. 
The government will of course say that it was not a billion dollars. 
No one could even tell us if the people had applied. 
It is absolutely mind-boggling that the government actually tries to defend these actions. 
The budget was tabled in the House in February. 
How did the government respond? 
It received $1 billion. 
Our national health care is very sacred. 
The Canadian Alliance has a better plan. 
Let me tell the House about the government's six point plan. 
The first point is, there is no plan. 
That is not in the plan.  
A member has said that is not in the plan. 
We then have a little spike up over the line. 
Guess what happens at the end of this year? 
The government will spend more money than it will take in.  
Let me give the Minister of Finance's definition of what this chart means. 
Why is the government spending more money than it is taking in? 
It is because we are one year before an election. 
What do members think the billion dollar boondoggle was all about?  
People were backpedaling so fast to make it happen it was not even funny. 
That is is so wrong. 
It is a culture that has permeated this institution that we have to change. 
We have to bring back accountability and respect.  
The government is not interested in anything like that. 
It will not let something like that see the light of day. 
It is none other than the Minister of Finance. 
Children's lives will be put at risk. 
That is the province.  
No, that is factual. 
It will be very tragic. 
They will have to be airlifted to Vancouver. 
It is time that the government did something about it.  
We could go on and on but let us stick to the facts. 
We live in a great country but we cannot take it for granted. 
The standard of living since the government came to power has dropped. 
The savings of Canadians have dropped. 
Young families are struggling. 
Health care is in an absolute, complete crisis. 
We see such things as the billion dollar boondoggle going on. 
What is the government's six point plan? 
In my riding migrants were the big issue. 
I hope the members on the other side have taken note. 
It is long overdue.  
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Canadian Alliance):
How would my colleague rectify this situation? 
However, where is the $86 billion increase in spending going?  
Some of the grants are absolutely mind-boggling. 
They are almost insulting to repeat. 
It is important that we remind Canadians how the money is being spent.  
They are absolutely horrific. 
Not only did it send it, it supported it. 
It defends those types of programs.  
The member made a very important point. 
There was an $86 billion spending increase. 
Our national health care needs to become stronger. 
Unfortunately that is not where the money is going.  
People with lower incomes would be the biggest beneficiaries. 
Where does the money go? 
That is so frustrating to me. 
There is example after example. 
There are lots of examples. 
It is corrupt and it is wrong. 
I am not going to quit until we do.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, the member has raised an excellent point. 
We have seen the farm crisis. 
We need to help these people but we need stated objectives. 
We are going to have stated objectives. 
That is what this is all about. 
That money will reach the people. 
These programs are delivered inefficiently and ineffectively. 
That goes to the core of the problem of the government.  
They are not going to stop until they do. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Unfortunately the budget does not speak to that. 
The government does not believe Canadians are capable of doing that. 
I will speak to that in certain areas.  
It is called vision. 
However we live in a new and innovative society. 
We live in a world now which demands that we compete in a globalized world. 
The government does not recognize that. 
It has no vision. 
We have talked about that. 
The budget does not speak a word about agriculture. 
There is no vision. 
The government puts out false hopes, false statements and false programs. 
Yet the dollars do not get to where they are supposed to go. 
Let us talk about the lack of vision in health care. 
Two things are wrong with that. 
The government has no vision on transportation. 
Our country was built on transportation, by the rail links, by air and by road. 
Let us talk about Bill C-32 specifically. 
I mentioned the lack of vision. 
The government has tried to deal with a couple of areas. 
One of them was the basic personal deduction. 
One way to do that is for the government to take less.  
Let us talk about CHST. 
As I said earlier, the health dollars are abysmal. 
That has been reduced. 
That is wrong and the member knows it.  
Mr. Speaker, they like to dispute that. 
Let us assume they can put that forward. 
There are three issues in health care. 
The first is that we have an aging population. 
I have talked about the new global economy. 
We live in a globalized world. 
We have technology that we never considered possible. 
As I said, we have an aging population. 
There is also technology and inflation. 
We will not get any of those with this government. 
Bill C-32 also deals with employment insurance. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to address one specific point. 
The member referred to it as the basic personal deduction. 
What the member is proposing would cost the federal government $12 billion. 
This is not something to be taken lightly. 
Now we are up to $18 billion. 
My question is simple. 
If we went to $12,000 on the basic personal exemption, we would be- 
We do not want to hear him.  
It is about $1,200 annually, which works out to about $2.5 billion.  
We are saying that individual Canadians should be the masters of their own destiny. 
The money should be given back to them. 
Those dollars should be invested back into the pockets of Canadians.  
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
It is inconsistency and it is backfilling.  
All he had to do was to ask me. 
It is hard to get nursing care. 
It is hard to get into hospital. 
It is hard to get a hospital bed. 
One hospital in our province is projected to cost approximately $40 million or $50 million. 
That is one hospital. 
It is truly a token.  
What does the government come up with? 
I also mentioned inconsistency in this budget. 
All lives are precious, but young lives are even more precious. 
For this situation to be allowed to continue is unheard of.  
Nova Scotia in the middle will get zero funding. 
Certainly, it is totally inconsistent. 
Yet Nova Scotia gets zero dollars in the next two years. 
It is just completely unfair and, again, it is inconsistent.  
Why were these toll highways built? 
Because there was no choice. 
Recently the New Brunswick government eliminated the toll highways. 
I mentioned backfilling in my opening remarks. 
I see much of this budget as backfilling. 
He has spent years pondering a plan for VIA Rail. 
What did he do? 
Yesterday he announced an increased subsidy of $400 million. 
There is nothing new. 
There is nothing additional. 
There are no additional services, no additional facilities, no additional equipment. 
It would not work and we all know it.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Canadian Alliance):
I would like to make this point to my hon. colleague. 
The province of Saskatchewan has more miles of highway per capita than any other province. 
That is the end of federal subsidies to highways in Saskatchewan. 
There will not be any improvement in highway construction.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Souris-Moose Mountain for his remarks. 
The fact of the matter is it is a national disgrace.  
There is actually a highway deficit in this country. 
We owe money to our national highway system. 
It is going to get a lot worse as these highways continue to deteriorate. 
I was being generous.  
Mr. Speaker, the member is being very generous, as he always is. 
Saskatchewan has truly not fared well in the highway casino.  
Nova Scotia gets zip. 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):
Now certain first nations are being given the responsibility to collect 7% as well.  
I want to point out a couple of things. 
The 7% GST goes to the federal government. 
There are no regulations about how this tax is to be administered. 
After he had paid his $12 to fill his tank with gas, he bought cigarettes. 
Maybe not, but perhaps. 
It is the exact same amount of tax. 
There are no regulations attached to this bill. 
I am seriously concerned that we are providing these opportunities and challenges. 
It bothers me immensely.  
It is an excellent point, as my colleague says. 
The report covers a number of horrifying things. 
In paragraph 4.72 the auditor general writes: 
This is the year 2000. 
That was eight years ago. 
The agreement had expired. 
No one had really bothered to do anything about it. 
They just wrote the cheques and carried on.  
What about things such as special needs? 
We are concerned about special needs. 
Special needs students are those who are psychologically disadvantaged or who have learning disabilities. 
The department does not know. 
In one region this amounts to $581 per student. 
I have a problem with these kinds of numbers. 
Should we not be asking the question, what is going on? 
We know what happens with the minister of HRDC. 
What about the lack of education funding agreements? 
I mentioned one region that did not even have one. 
However, the department was able to identify agreements in only 58 cases. 
Native people cannot do that. 
The department does not even know if they are going to school.  
Only 30% succeed in meeting the basic fundamental requirements.  
The minister does not have agreements with the school boards. 
Agreements expire and he does not follow up on them. 
Kids are dropping out of school and he does not know how many. 
The department is a disgrace.  
He has no clue. 
Unfortunately, he is not the only one.  
For every $40 spent, we received $1 back. 
Where is the logic?  
The minister kept the study under wraps. 
I cannot understand it.  
How bad is it? 
Let us take one particular claim as an example. 
It was a complex claim. 
That was five years of auditors' time on one claim. 
There are 16,000 to approve. 
They spent 10,000 hours on one claim.  
They had to get some scientific expert advice. 
We are not sure how many tens there were. 
Let us look at the rationale. 
The subcontractor did the research and development. 
He got it again. 
The rules allowed him to get it again. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Canadian Alliance):
One word can sum up the last 20 years: nothing. 
Nothing has changed and it is getting worse.  
I want to thank my colleague for drawing attention to this situation. 
The first question is what is the program designed to do? 
The goal is to provide educated children on reserves. 
The department's mind is in a fog. 
What about the student who is not getting an education? 
He or she should care and we should care. 
We care and the government should care.  
We must always be creative in seeing if we can improve ourselves.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):
This is my second speech on the budget. 
My remarks are based on two concepts.  
The first is what constituents are saying are their two major concerns. 
People are having a hard time making ends meet. 
Despite having a college degree all she earns is $7.50 per hour.  
But a lot of our money disappears into the government coffers. 
It is interesting the way the whole taxation system is designed. 
In between what are they supposed to do? 
How are they supposed to live?  
I am paying so much in taxes''. 
I have a letter from another individual in my riding. 
I am not going to fill out all the paperwork''.  
There is nothing to ask. 
It does not agree with what the finance minister is saying. 
He gives a tax break, but at the same time CPP premiums are hiked up.  
It will not even reduce the EI premiums. 
We have people in the government who have their own agendae. 
Our heritage minister wants to be recognized as the Canadian cultural protection person. 
We hear on the streets from Canadians that their take home pay is shrinking.  
That is one of the areas of prosperity for the country.  
I applaud him for that. 
I hope it goes higher and higher. 
After all, it helps the Canadian consumer and it brings prosperity to Canada.  
I have seen them hard at work. 
As we know, trade with Europe has been gradually declining. 
It is improving but not to the level that we thought it should have improved.  
Somewhere down the line it will crack.  
We are trying to get agreements with Costa Rica and other countries. 
We have seen the demand coming in for Britain to join NAFTA. 
The biggest one is taxation, the way we are taxing our companies. 
Let me quote here for a second an editorial in the Globe and Mail . 
He said that Canada looked good but was moving too slowly. 
All of them have one simple straightforward message: taxes are too high. 
They must be able to take advantage of market opportunities. 
They are the ones who are out there selling their products.  
If we want to have prosperity we need small and medium size businesses. 
I do not have to repeat it. 
Everyone talks about it. 
Time after time when we talk to them they express concerns. 
That is a great idea. 
It is fantastic if we can do it. 
There is no point in each one going in different directions. 
Today's polls indicate the priorities of Canadians. 
It is the number one concern, and rightly so. 
Why should it not be? 
This is a government run by polls. 
Everything it does is by polls. 
I am sure it will. 
I am glad that Canadians spoke up about it. 
That is what Canadians should do.  
Let us talk about health care for a moment. 
We listen to the grandiose statements of the Minister of Health. 
When they come up with a solution we hear the government screaming. 
We have heard from businesses. 
We have heard from Canadians who have told us their priorities. 
I find them rather interesting. 
Perhaps he could explain to me why one positive point was not raised. 
Can they not stand positive news?  
I will tell him why. 
The hon. member's government is the one that killed the health care budget. 
Instead it has set us back. 
It is just flying straight. 
Nothing great has come out of this. 
They have seen it go down and down. 
That is how the budget deficit was killed. 
There is nothing to be very excited about there. 
Let us listen to what Canadians are saying and address the issues.  
As I said, 43% of our GDP is now in export. 
It will not last too long.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Canadian Alliance):
Let me just read what solution 17 is going to do for families.  
I guess they do not like good news either.  
It will address the issue of families trying to put food on the table.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Canadian Alliance):
Absolutely not, Mr. Speaker. 
I congratulate my hon. colleague not only for his presentation but for his response. 
We talk about increasing funding to the attorney general's department. 
The government has the wrong priorities. 
We need officers on the street. 
The auditor general has talked about tools not being available to the RCMP. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Canada is a vast country. 
This may eventually be done in Cumberland House.  
We must empower them. 
They may be in this place or they may become legislators in their provinces. 
This requires strategic financial investments.  
The program reviews-I must applaud the government-are now history. 
None has been announced.  
We have a major initiative for our young people when they graduate. 
The program is called Katimavik. 
It is a very worthwhile program for youth in the country.  
More people want to have access to these community projects. 
There was no increase in the funding for Katimavik. 
The member still has 14 minutes left in his talk. 
I thought this might be a good place to interrupt. 
He will have the floor when we resume debate after question period.  
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Let us thank all these volunteers from the bottom of our hearts. 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Canadian Alliance):
However, let us look a little closer at the announcement. 
The Liberals have to put the money into VIA. 
The regional transit authorities do.  
The minister says that privatization would not work. 
It is too bad that the government's thinking has not.  
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
On an annual basis 1,800 meals, prepared by volunteers, are delivered to homebound people. 
Volunteers transport frail elderly- 
The hon. member for Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik.  
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
And we thank the Government of Canada for taking part and helping young Quebecers.  
Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Middlesex, Lib.):
Entitled Water under the Bridges:
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):
The provinces have pleaded with Ottawa to restore funding levels. 
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville, Lib.):
FONDATION QUEBECOISE DU CANCER 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
My greetings to the foundation and my thanks to all of its volunteers.  
Mr. Raymond Lavigne (Verdun-Saint-Henri, Lib.):
The announcement of this investment brings a ray of sunshine to a still snowy area.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne-Blainville, BQ):
Anything is possible with this man. 
But one thing is sure. 
Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the arrival of the new millennium was the subject of much celebration. 
There can be as many as four parties on a line. 
I remind you that my riding is 40 minutes away from Montreal.  
I think Bell Canada would do well to take part. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
I will be with you.  
You will be with me.  
How great our riches are.  
No more will what is ours be taken from us, 
No more will lies be told about us.  
We will not be sold like slaves.  
We will willingly go into the forest 
And emerge bathed in light.  
And my children will walk in that light.  
Will play in that light. 
And their lives will be their own.  
Life is all we will share now, 
All that we possess, our only revenge.  
I will forget the forest, yes, 
The rain, the cold and the snow, yes, 
But do not think that I will forget the beating of your heart, 
> The words you breathe, 
The warmth of your arms.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
Mr. Speaker, constituents of Winnipeg North-St. 
We owe our constituents a duty to state where we stand on the issue. 
This let us pledge to Canadians.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
I speak of Senator Ron Ghitter. 
I want to quote from the apology that was elicited from these two members. 
I thank Senator Ghitter for standing by his principles. 
He is a class act.  
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
It would like to thank all those who attended and participated.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Sitting along the shore 
Did he the waves implore: 
Did he the waves implore: 
``Should you my country see, my country all in dread, 
Please inform all my friends 
That 'tis on eggs I tread.  
Please inform all my friends 
That 'tis on eggs I tread.''  
These days the gaffes abound, 
Out there for all to see, 
My party at this frowned, 
Will have no more of me, 
And my dear home, oh zounds, 
Is quite upset with me.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
His comments have been unwise and indefensible. 
Everyone across the world knows that.  
Our Prime Minister is unable to manage his government here at home. 
He is unable to manage his words. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
He signed important agreements in Israel and Egypt. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
The Prime Minister is clearly out of his league. 
We know that he is endangering very fragile and tenuous diplomatic relationships. 
In four days we have seen four gaffes. 
I ask again, is it not time that he just came home?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
The Prime Minister seems to be doing that very well on his own. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Canadian Alliance):
Imagine the damage that he would do if he was actually trying.  
He is seriously jeopardizing delicate diplomatic relations. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
They have been pleased with the way the talks have been going. 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Canadian Alliance):
How many years will he set them back?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is wrong. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is totally wrong in her criticism of the Prime Minister. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
In that respect, I would like to ask a question of the Minister of Health. 
It is the minister's government which signed NAFTA. 
It is the minister's government that is responsible for these kinds of agreements. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
He made that very clear.  
Frankly, I did not get from Minister Jonson a satisfactory response. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
He has the opinion from Mr. Appleton. 
It is not something that can be left for a long time. 
If the wrong thing happens, NAFTA kicks in. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We are doing our own legal analysis through justice and foreign affairs. 
I assure the member and the House that we will respond at the appropriate time.  
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
There are special rules on that side. 
They identify money and explain it after. 
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the proposal was made yesterday. 
It is very clear regarding commercialization aspects of the entire program. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is totally off base. 
Therefore I repeat, the hon. member as usual is totally off base.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):
Then he told the Palestinians to unilaterally declare independence. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
He is advancing our economic relations through the agreements he is signing. 
The hon. member for Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
To tell the truth, I am really disappointed in that.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, enough is enough. 
The waste of public moneys at Human Resources Development Canada has lasted long enough. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would agree. 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The department will be reviewing this and will report when it has a response.  
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Canadian Alliance):
If the hon. minister wants to respond, I will permit that.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
My question is a very simple one, directed to the Minister of Industry. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Canadian Alliance):
The minister has some explaining to do. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
It would be inappropriate to comment on it or to prejudge the results.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Canadian Alliance):
Here is something else, Mr. Speaker. 
How about using grant money to buy a motorhome? 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We are up to 602. 
We are working diligently to provide the information that has been requested. 
The department takes this very seriously and the answers will be forthcoming.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
My question is simple. 
Mr. Rick Limoges (Windsor-St. 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
This is good for Canada.  
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Canadian Alliance):
Today we were told we would receive those documents. 
What did we get? 
What is it hiding?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
All of that will also be revealed in due course.  
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Canadian Alliance):
What is it trying to hide?  
It is very selective about what it releases. 
To wait six years for two pages is not believable. 
We want the board meeting minutes. 
Why will the government not release them?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
He should see the ethics counsellor. 
That is the long answer.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
It is called getting to the truth. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Let us remember that we presented a plan. 
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
That is exactly what they wanted when I met with them last year.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
I appreciate those comments, Mr. Minister.  
The hon. member for South Shore will be address his remarks through the Chair.  
Mr. Speaker, I will try again. 
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we do not negotiate in public. 
It is a responsibility of the federal government to negotiate directly with the first nations.  
We will continue to do that.  
Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):
Canadian access to European markets is hampered because we do not have this national standard. 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
That certainly includes Vintners' Quality Alliance wines as well.  
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Canadian Alliance):
Now the ethics counsellor seems to be stonewalling us.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's question simply makes no sense whatsoever. 
The hon. member has all pertinent documents.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
He replied that he would read our letter and get back to us.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
In fact, my hon. colleague could refer the letter directly to the RCMP himself.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
In fact we have not discussed any such option.  
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
The hon. member for Dewdney-Alouette.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Canadian Alliance):
He just said in the House now that all pertinent documents have been released. 
Why will those not be released today?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the ethnics counsellor has released a report which is about this thick. 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
The board has come up with some suggestions which I think are worthwhile. 
We are looking at them right now. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to follow up on my last question.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
PRESENCE IN THE GALLERY 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 2000 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
National parks have been a great part of our summer activities. 
We are going very slowly. 
There was nothing planned for increased park allocations. 
There was nothing from the government. 
There has been zero increase in their budgets. 
A greater demand on more user fees has been coming from the parks. 
The issue of northern development in Canada is of great interest. 
Many people will look at the north and see its vast natural resources. 
The north has a sparse population. 
It is the final frontier, as one opposition member mentioned.  
Two concepts come to mind which I would like to share with the House. 
One of them deals with the issue of banking.  
That is the investment banking side. 
But regional development banking is lacking in this country. 
Sustainable development is the key. 
Let me speak about investment banking. 
That is what we call colonization. 
They came to Canada looking for new found land. 
Let us hold on tight to our resources. 
The resources in Canada and the world are dwindling. 
If we hold on to our resources, their market value will increase. 
The student-teacher ratio might diminish to 10:1. 
Not everyone can be moved to an urban centre.  
We must continue to support rural and remote communities. 
This is the reality of being Canadian. 
We are a huge country. 
We must think big but we must also think of what is fair for everyone. 
Our communities are in the middle of the boreal forest region and we lack housing. 
That is a challenge for the government. 
We should not have a housing problem in the middle of a boreal forest.  
Biotechnology is a major initiative that the Department of Industry has been working on. 
The moral and ethical issues dealing with biotechnology have to be addressed as well. 
We have no alternatives. 
The schedules connecting western Canada with eastern Canada are being dismantled. 
The schedules that were there before are not there today. 
A train is probably the cheapest form of transporting freight in this country. 
Railroad tracks that existed fifty years ago have now disappeared.  
All these people have get to know each other because we are all Canadians.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Canadian Alliance):
This whole place is built on politics. 
A majority of the members are from the Ontario region. 
We have a party reflective of the west. 
The farmers have had opportunities to reflect on the political wills. 
Maybe the VIA Rail decision is right. 
Hopefully we can work together to make that possible.  
They need to know what kinds of decisions they will have to make. 
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Canadian Alliance):
The user fee schedule has not really given the general taxpayer relief.  
I wonder if the hon. member could comment on those two things.  
Some of its aspirations were cost recovery. 
Cost recovery in national parks is a reality. 
We have to consider the social conscience of the country. 
We cannot talk from both sides of our mouth. 
I am talking about program and service enhancement.  
It is nice that the hon. member has raised this issue. 
In some areas the infrastructure development is very unfair. 
It is a single lane highway that barely has any shoulders.  
There is an intercontinental highway system just to the south of us. 
There are highways needed in western Canada. 
These are the sad facts and sad results. 
We have to look at investments, which I call regional development investments. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):
I was rather shocked that the present budget did not deal with that item.  
Mr. Speaker, I suppose we have to have a balanced approach. 
We would see a better economic cycle within the regions.  
People talk about the fear of globalization. 
We still live over there, yet we live here.  
That is not true. 
The North West Company runs all that.  
Colonization and globalization are in a similar realm. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):
Let us talk about some of the failures of that budget. 
Let me try to highlight some of the less than good points in the budget. 
There is program spending. 
Certainly Liberals love program spending. 
They have always loved to create programs because programs lead to bureaucracy. 
Bureaucracy leads to boondoggles. 
Boondoggles lead to ways to patronize friends. 
What about that debt? 
What about that $588 billion? 
By 1972 we had $18 billion in debt. 
But that same government carried on. 
Since then we now have a debt of roughly $580 billion. 
Let us look at where that places us. 
That is what we are passing on to future generations.  
How does the budget deal with that? 
This budget did not even address that.  
Is that what we want to leave for our children and our grandchildren? 
That is the first failure, Mr. Speaker. 
What about the 11% increase in HRDC grants? 
The year after an election they are at their lowest point. 
As we get closer to an election, grants and contributions increase. 
What about those grants? 
We have heard much in the House about the boondoggles. 
A band in my community is leaving this coming Sunday for Australia. 
It is going to be accompanied by a number of teachers and parents. 
The cost was under $1,000 for a plaque. 
How about the canoe museum? 
How about the armouries with a good view of the fountain?'' 
That is a sorry commentary in a democracy.  
The letter was from the Deputy Prime Minister. 
That is not 100% funding coming from the federal government. 
That is the kind of stuff that happens with these grants. 
Let us talk about health care. 
How did this budget deal with health care? 
The government says it has returned all the money. 
How does it figure that? 
It is difficult to explain but let me attempt to. 
Where did that come from? 
Immediately upon doing that, the federal government raised its taxes. 
The provinces were to have room to raise their taxes. 
The tax credit is really a figment of the government's mind. 
The money is really not there.  
Let us talk about actual transfers of cash. 
What has the government done with that? 
In 1995 they were $18.4 billion. 
In 1996 there were $14.8 billion. 
Over the the next four years they will be $15.5 billion. 
Remember, they were $18.5 billion in 1993. 
What has happened in between besides inflation? 
These have not been accounted for in the cash transfers to the provinces. 
Because of the lack of funding. 
Who is to blame? 
It is not just the provinces. 
The federal government can be blamed for it as much as the provinces.  
We are in fifth place in spending on health care. 
We have fifth place spending with 23rd place ranking in our health care delivery. 
There is certainly something wrong there.  
We are opposed to that. 
We can clearly state that we do not believe in that. 
That is what they would like.  
This budget did not deliver that. 
Last year it was $11 billion over five years. 
This year it was $2.5 billion over four years. 
That is after taking out $26 billion. 
That is just not good enough. 
The responsibility stops right here and it stops with this budget.  
I think we can simply say that we must fix that system. 
How do we do it? 
We have to do it by co-operation with the provinces. 
What do we do to the provinces? 
We have our drive-by smear that occurs. 
We have the taunting and the constant attacks on the Government of Ontario. 
We need to have a level playing field if we are going to compete. 
With respect to agriculture, what did we do for our farmers? 
We showed no interest in agriculture whatsoever in this budget.  
You have seen them, too, Mr. Speaker. 
What are we doing to our NATO and NORAD partners?  
I was not happy with this budget.  
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened to the arguments of the hon. member for Red Deer. 
I do not know if it is a movement or a party. 
Let me explain if I might for the member opposite how it works. 
Do you know what, Mr. Speaker? 
That is exactly what they did.  
When the federal government vacated that tax room, the provinces immediately filled it. 
Since 1977 the world has changed. 
There have been a lot of things happening up and down, back and forth.  
Surely that says something about the priorities of this government. 
Therefore, I find the member's arguments spurious in the least. 
The members talks about the grants and contributions going up in this budget. 
Those are just two. 
I could go on and on.  
Someone who believes his own propaganda is even more amazing. 
That has to be another slur on that member's mental ability.  
The Liberal propaganda says yes, in 1977 they transferred the tax room. 
From then on there is not a dollar left in there.  
There is $4 billion less in spending. 
Is that not something when $43 billion is spent on interest payments? 
That is nothing to stand and brag about. 
We are losing half our graduate doctors. 
That is something to talk about. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
He is quite right.  
He was emphatic, very emphatic. 
He is nodding his head. 
This is something they could not possibly tolerate, at all. 
He is still nodding his head.  
It was first introduced in 1966. 
How do we fix that plan? 
What can we do about it?  
I did an interesting project. 
I went door to door. 
They buy their groceries at the stores in which they have shares. 
They buy their cars from companies in which they have shares. 
They are proud of it. 
The money is there in the country to invest. 
They do not have any foreign debt because of it.  
You said scrap it.  
The member will not try anything new. 
He is not prepared to try anything new. 
Some members across have their heads in the sand.  
The final point is that we are not Liberals. 
We are the Canadian Alliance Party. 
We believe in democracy. 
We do not throw people out like the party on the other side.  
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Canadian Alliance):
Tax brackets and personal deductions were not indexed to inflation.  
I am referring in particular to a speech made by a Progressive Conservative member. 
It might have been the House leader. 
He was addressing the deficit which grew to enormous levels under their leadership.  
It was increasing as a result of deficit budgets by the previous Liberal government. 
At this point I will discuss the legislative agenda of the Liberal government. 
I want to put that in the context of the legislative agenda of the government. 
We have a $600 billion national debt. 
The government refuses to act. 
The HRDC billion dollar boondoggle is very telling. 
We have a taxation system that is in dire need of repair and reform. 
The government in the budget has increased funding to HRDC. 
I will illustrate a few examples. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to clarify that. 
That is what I meant.  
However, when the measure of that is put to the test, he fails repeatedly. 
One area of concern has to do with employment insurance premiums. 
All of that money comes from property taxes.  
That is a good illustration of why the EI overpayment is unfair. 
It is an excessive tax on workers and employers. 
What possible benefit do taxpayers get for this massive expenditure of money? 
It was $316 million.  
The Senate is another example of waste and patronage. 
The Prime Minister also appointed someone from Alberta that same day. 
I would ask him to be very careful in his choice of adjectives. 
I know he would not want to be.  
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
I know the people of Alberta feel the same way. 
I also want to point out that there is an agriculture crisis on the prairies. 
Liberal priorities are skewed. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
I would like to list a few for the member's edification.  
Since I became a member of parliament I have written five books. 
I wrote a book called Divorce:
They are all available on paulszabo.com.  
That person was me. 
In the following election it was in the platform of this party. 
Mr. Speaker, I am poised with bated breath waiting for the question. 
It is questions and comments. 
I believe that is somewhat hypocritical of him to say that. 
He talks a mean talk.  
I support family values. 
He supports the government which does not allow that. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
In fact it is exactly the opposite of what he said.  
I am afraid we are on a point of debate here.  
Mr. Speaker, he mentioned child poverty solutions. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on some points that the hon. member mentioned.  
Words like ``representation by population'' are nice words. 
This budget highlights an increased budget for the RCMP. 
We have communities that have many run-ins with the law. 
Could the hon. member answer that?  
Mr. Speaker, there are a couple of things here. 
Secretary to the Governor General 
BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 2000 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I apologize to the House. 
I was a little outrageous with my tirade about the family. 
I feel kind of strongly about the issue. 
I do respect the rule of law. 
There was some talk about our national debt. 
I take a great deal of interest in this, being a chartered accountant. 
It is not the case. 
In fact the economy continues to grow. 
Interest rates remain at relatively low levels. 
Our unemployment rates are lower than in the last 25 years. 
Canadians are working again and the economy continues to be very strong in Canada. 
That is good for people to be working and for our economy to be growing. 
That was another $42 billion being added to the national debt. 
We do not just wipe out $42 billion of deficit in one year. 
It is not just taxes. 
Quality of life issues are very expensive. 
That is a very substantial decrease. 
We are very fortunate to have continuous growth in the economy. 
That is very important.  
Canadians wanted the Canada pension plan saved. 
They are living from paycheque to paycheque.  
That is a very important aspect.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
It is far from returning us to 1994-95 levels.  
In 2003, the provinces will still face cuts of $33 billion. 
This surplus is unhealthy because it is hidden. 
I want to share with the House an experiment I conducted. 
They said ``No, you cannot do that, this is not allowed''. 
But the Minister of Finance has done it repeatedly. 
I now want to discuss an issue that few people raised, which is extremely unfortunate. 
I am referring to international development assistance.  
In 1999-2000, it was down to 0.24%.  
He had said that the level attained was unacceptable. 
How is it that Canada's proportion keeps dropping?  
There are billions of people living on incomes of less than $2 a day. 
Famine is widespread and we know that AIDS has become endemic in Africa.  
Rich nations cannot be rich alone. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Canadian Alliance):
The future financial health and security of all Canadians are determined by budgets.  
The debt is sitting at around $577 billion. 
He is a Canadian-born economist who earned a Nobel prize. 
What does a country do when it gets into that situation? 
The most recent case that is being used is that of Ireland. 
It began a dramatic reform of its tax system. 
Electoral reforms are required on some reserves. 
First nations also need a free and independent press.  
The aboriginal people need an access to information act. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
This would rid the Canadian system of its accountability problems.  
This would be great for to all Canadians.  
It might even be a major election issue in the next campaign. 
There is no such thing in the current program.  
I would also like to emphasize another point that seems very important to me. 
In March 2001, the surplus will reach a total of $34 billion. 
Today, the results are there. 
Seventy seven percent of fishers are affected by the intensity rule. 
This budget falls far short in this regard. 
Tax cuts are minimal for 2000. 
There is no improvement in the condition of the unemployed. 
I read somewhere in a newspaper article the words ``If I were a rich man''. 
The choices made in this budget protect the rich. 
The surtax has been eliminated. 
And yet, this is what is to be found in the budget.  
It is unfair to the Canadian federation as a whole.  
Even when times are good, it cannot do it.  
This means that our generosity is not very genuine. 
In both cases, it is trying to save face. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):
I think the credit goes to the official opposition for that.  
The one time increase to the CHST continues to frustrate the provinces. 
The extension of maternity benefits simply offers more redistributive thinking. 
Only half of all mothers currently receive maternity benefits. 
These arguments can be easily refuted.  
The other day we were discussing access to information. 
It is a blackout for the government when we talk about that.  
The other point I want to make concerns the government's tax record. 
Let us begin with the first year in which he became the finance minister.  
Let us see how we can hold him accountable in the next year. 
What does it rely on? 
It simply relies on tax increases.  
He said ``Let me begin by reaffirming our goal. 
That was in the budget speech of February 24, 1998. 
We came up with a strong initiative, solution 17. 
It is fair and it is simpler.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
There may also be very considerable consequences for the provinces.  
( a ) whose implementation requires 
(i) the enactment of an Act of Parliament, 
(iii) the imposition of a tax by Parliament; 
( c ) concerning the transfer of a part of the territory of Canada...; 
( d ) under which Canada undertakes to impose economic or military sanctions...; 
-including the transfer of jurisdiction to such institutions.  
The institutions in question are international institutions.  
Finally, this bill aims at guaranteeing consultation with the provinces. 
The wording of the bill is precise and was intended that way. 
The bill would guarantee respect for the jurisdiction of provinces.  
Why was it not submitted to parliament?  
That is why we will strongly support our colleague. 
We already know that other parties have expressed their support. 
All these things are essential to democracy, to a modern democracy.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):
I congratulate the member from the Bloc Quebecois for his efforts. 
The Canadian Alliance would go even further.  
On behalf of the people of Surrey Central, I will be supporting this bill. 
Treaties are like diamonds. 
They are supposed to be forever. 
If it is not undemocratic, it is anti-democratic. 
Most of the members of the House never see the treaties signed by the government. 
We do not know. 
Canadians only find out about them by reading newspapers.  
This is typical of the old line traditional parties when they formed the government.  
Why does he not try this idea at home in Canada? 
He also said ``A treaty is strictly the purview of the federal executive branch''. 
This was an unbelievable statement from the parliamentary secretary.  
When has this ever happened? 
What is the rush? 
Why do we not follow the right procedures?  
We know how it signed those treaties. 
The treaties are signed, sealed and delivered behind closed doors.  
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member, but his time has expired. 
Resuming debate, the hon. member for New Brunswick Southwest.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
The key word is ``concluded''. 
That obviously means the people of Canada. 
The summary of the bill states: 
(a) in an area under the legislative authority of the legislatures of the provinces; or 
That means this House, the House of Commons.  
The key phrase in that is ``important treaty''. 
For the purposes of this enactment, ``important treaty'' means any treaty 
(a) whose implementation requires 
(i) the enactment of an Act of Parliament, 
(iii) the imposition of a tax by Parliament; 
(b) imposing a substantial financial obligation, whether direct or conditional, on Canada; 
The other one is the international law of the sea. 
Where does that leave us? 
In a sense these are treaties. 
Is that an example of what we should be debating here in the House? 
We are not sure.  
This is the place where it should happen.  
We look forward to the debate. 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Under Bill C-214: 
-Canada shall not, without first consulting the provincial governments, negotiate or conclude a treaty: 
( a ) in an area under the legislative authority of the legislatures of the provinces; or 
A message was delivered by the Usher of the Black Rod as follows: 
Accordingly, the Speaker with the House went up to the Senate chamber.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
I am disappointed that they want to remain powerless.  
They are shirking part of their responsibilities, responsibilities they should take seriously. 
The government's leadership is not being challenged here. 
It is, of course, up to the executive to negotiate treaties. 
That is the way it is done throughout the world. 
Mr. Ian Murray (Lanark-Carleton, Lib.):
Is it as flawed as the hon. member suggests? 
Does it need to be radically overhauled as he is proposing? 
The problems facing governments often extend beyond national borders. 
I have trouble following the hon. member on this point. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. 
We already have consultative mechanisms. 
We do not need to reinvent the wheel.  
Bill C-214 would be contrary to our constitution.  
Why did it do this? 
Here again the hon. member is not inventing anything new. 
The advantage of the Canadian practice of concluding treaties is that it is flexible. 
This bill does no such thing.  
On December 1 the hon. member for Beauharnois-Salaberry stated that: 
The role of parliament in treaty making continues to evolve. 
They did so prior to the conclusion of these agreements by the federal executive. 
The bill raises major constitutional concerns. 
No such provincial prerogative exists. 
It is done because it has to be done.  
Our current practice meets these imperatives.  
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
I am very interested in issues of globalization. 
Should we always rely on governments to negotiate treaties? 
Nobody in the world, except of course the negotiators, knew this was in the works. 
We parliamentarians were not in the picture. 
An international agreement was being negotiated behind closed doors. 
It should be discussed''. 
This is what democracy is all about. 
It is about debating issues. 
Unfortunately, this is all the time I have for today, but I was pleased to- 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Canadian Alliance):
This is hard to believe.  
That is almost a year. 
Each of these companies has made a profit of at least $70 million. 
The grants at HRD use tax dollars which come directly from the farmer. 
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
However, I can respond to some of the allegations made against HRDC. 
We work with both the private sector and the non-profit sector. 
There was a big plan announced in the last budget to that effect. 
(The House adjourned at 6.46 p.m.)
