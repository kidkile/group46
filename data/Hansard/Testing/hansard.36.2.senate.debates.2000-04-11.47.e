Apology to the Honourable Ron Ghitter 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
In this case the ultimate responsibility lies with Preston Manning.  
Mr. Manning had the following to say when I threatened a law suit.  
This is the same Mr. Manning who previously is quoted as saying, 
Mr. Ghitter ends his statement by saying: 
World Curling Championships World Junior Curling Championship 
Congratulations to Winning Teams 
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
Team British Columbia was from the Kelowna Curling Club.  
It cannot get much better than this. 
No other country has ever accomplished this feat.  
Forum on Society and the Economy 
Honourable senators, a remarkable event took place yesterday on Parliament Hill. 
Contrast these values with the voices of the poor who were heard yesterday. 
Yesterday's message was loud and clear:
People who seek change are abandoning political parties and processes. 
The group that made up yesterday's forum will not be silent. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Palestine-Israel Peace Negotiations-Statement by Prime Minister 
Hon. Jean-Claude Rivest :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I thank the Honourable Senator Rivest for that question. 
I must correct the honourable senator when he describes it as a difficult meeting. 
I was there with many of my colleagues. 
It was a wonderful and terrific meeting. 
He has indicated that and I support that judgment. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
He believes in clarity.  
That is a position we probably all support.  
Are we still on the original foreign policy? 
I believe the honourable senator is quite correct. 
Why did the Prime Minister, therefore, in that context, make that statement? 
Honourable senators, our position as a country has not changed. 
Honourable senators, I take that to mean that the Prime Minister made a mistake.  
We continue to hope for the successful conclusion of that peace process.  
When will those two come together in a coherent foreign policy?  
We have a particular set of circumstances before us now. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
No doubt, he will give it his attention upon his return.  
Hopefully, the story will be false.  
Israel certainly has nuclear weapons. 
I will attempt to obtain that information for him as quickly as possible.  
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Honourable senators, this morning the Auditor General of Canada tabled a report. 
We are still convinced of it. 
Now there is a problem of time.  
What are we to do about it?  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I am giving this information from memory. 
I ask the senators' indulgence if any of the numbers are not accurately presented.  
The same witnesses appeared in front of the committee on both bills. 
We need reassurance that what was said in front of the committee is the truth. 
Honourable senators, we were never informed of a delay of half a year. 
The witnesses always indicated that it was 30 days. 
An individual can be linked to a crime, so it is very serious. 
The witnesses never talked to us about half a year. 
Is it a problem of resources or securing the technology? 
We were never told. 
We have a problem, which is why I am asking these questions. 
Is it half a year? 
The Solicitor General is indicating 30 days. 
Honourable senators, I will forward the issue as a concern raised by the honourable senator. 
Business of the Senate 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
He does not need leave.  
With or without leave, I should like to comment on house business.  
I thank my counterpart for his cooperation in reaching this agreement. 
It is very much appreciated.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
I wish to advise that, pursuant to rule 38: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I appreciate that that does not include independent senators.  
Referrence has been made to rule 38. 
With leave, I shall move such a motion later today.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is there leave, honourable senators, for such a motion to be moved later this day?  
Honourable senators, rule 38 is discretionary. 
It says that the Deputy Leader may propose a motion. 
Hon. Edward M. Lawson :
Honourable senators, I am sensitive to the point raised by Senator Lawson. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Nisga'a Final Agreement Bill 
Third Reading-Motion in Amendment-Debate Continued 
Hon. Ione J. Christensen :
That is a very sexist comment. 
How about "spouse swapping"?  
We would not be interested in that either.  
The Yukon Umbrella Final Agreement was different. 
Negotiation is by far the most favourable option. 
One cannot use a referendum when one is dealing with minority rights. 
It is not democratic. 
This is not a new problem in land claim negotiations. 
Honourable senators, this is a difficult issue. 
Lines on maps are not the traditional way by which boundaries were delineated. 
Individual ownership was a foreign concept. 
Other bands that are also negotiating could have similar provisions. 
Their rights would be recognized where they can prove ownership. 
We cannot, here in this chamber, renegotiate that issue. 
Delaying this treaty would not solve the overlap issue. 
Have we got it right, honourable senators? 
How will history judge Bill C-9? 
Fifty years from now, will it have stood the test of time? 
It was not done maliciously. 
It was full of good intentions. 
Will it be a resounding success? 
Will it be a better approach than that taken in the past? 
I would suggest not. 
We must show our trust in their ability to manage their affairs. 
We are not creating new communities or new people through this piece of legislation. 
New funding will not necessarily be needed. 
Resources are not being taken away. 
It concerns Bill C-9.  
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
Honourable senators, I should like to ask several questions of Senator Christensen, if I may. 
I listened carefully and wish to compliment her on her speech.  
Senator Christensen was in committee with us and did an excellent job. 
Where will these poor people get the money for litigation?  
However, he also never said that he would, from what I recollect.  
I concur with the remainder of my honourable friend's speech. 
The Nisga'a should have an agreement and they deserve an agreement. 
We must move forward with these things. 
All are in the management area, not on the core lands. 
Honourable senators, I was not at the negotiating table. 
Therefore, I cannot comment on whether it was fair.  
Honourable senators, I agree with that. 
I know that there are supposed to be remedies within these sections. 
The Gitanyow and the Gitxsan, however, find no comfort in this. 
How will they accomplish this? 
I met with the Gitanyow, who felt that that was the case. 
Litigation is always the final step. 
However, I think other avenues are still open to them.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, Senator Christensen's 15 minutes has expired.  
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Honourable senators, I wish to ask a question of the Honourable Senator Christensen.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is leave granted, honourable senators, to extend the speaking time of the Honourable Senator Christensen?  
Honourable senators, I thank the honourable senator for her question. 
The honourable senator's question is certainly one that I anticipated being asked. 
Unfortunately, I have lost my notes on that particular question. 
I am not a legal-minded person.  
Going the delegated route gives a paternal effect. 
It leaves it wide open. 
We have been doing this through the Indian Act for years. 
There are provisions to make changes, if it is proven necessary. 
That, however, does not concern me.  
It is a bad bill as far as the Constitution is concerned.  
I refer to the Constitution as amended in 1982 and 1983. 
It is as simple as that. 
It should be fixed before is it is passed by the Senate. 
It should have been fixed before it passed the House of Commons.  
That did not happen. 
There was no such constitutional conference at which that occurred.  
If we do not do that, then we are inviting anarchy into our system.  
I am not commenting at all on its substance.  
For whatever reason, the government wants to do it. 
Is this a constitutional bill? 
After 1982 and 1983, the Constitution of Canada was intact. 
It is still intact today, just as it was back in 1982 and 1983. 
We as legislators know that that is not true. 
These were delegated authorities that were taken away from them.  
It was not done in 1982. 
Was it done after 1982? 
That did not occur. 
They will know it did not occur. 
There was no such resolution, through all of the 1980s or the 1990s. 
Certainly, there was no such resolution in the provincial legislatures.  
Was it ever discussed, honourable senators? 
There was never any agreement to set it up. 
You may ask how I know this. 
I checked with some of the premiers who were there. 
I checked newspaper accounts. 
I said, "Buchanan, are you a little bit fuzzy in the head? 
They are telling you that that level of government was set up in 1982." 
I can recall the premiers who were at the conferences:
Bill Bennett, Peter Lougheed, Sterling Lyon, Bill Davis, Grant Devine. 
He said, "We never did." 
I said, "That is good, Grant. 
I could not call him unfortunately. 
I know what he would say, though. 
Premiers Lee or MacLean? 
I never missed one, from 1977 right through 1990.  
The present Prime Minister, Jean Chretien. 
Because we had never set it up in the first place.  
can guarantee that because I was there. 
I simply say, let us be very sensible here. 
I do not want to get involved in the substance, as I have said. 
Would Senator Buchanan entertain a question?  
He will recall the three first ministers' conferences that were mandated by the 1982 Constitution. 
The first one was presided over by Prime Minister Trudeau in 1983. 
My friend will recall that.  
This was a recognition of the inherent right of the aboriginal peoples to self-government. 
I think that was the nub of the Charlottetown Agreement, as I recall it.  
All that being said, I do have a question for the honourable senator. 
What does he make of section 35(3), where it says: 
What does my friend make of that?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted for the honourable senator to continue?  
We agreed to do that after 1982.  
Why would we ever agree after 1982 and 1983 to set up conferences? 
Senator Beaudoin was there as an expert. 
It never happened because we had never set it up. 
Again, section 35 reads: 
It just did not happen.  
I am not saying I am opposed to self-government. 
There were premiers who were opposed to it, as Senator Murray said. 
The answer is it had never been achieved.  
It is right here.  
Read it to me because I was there in 1995.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
If she has the proof, I should like to see it.  
Sit down and we will read it to you.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
She wants to table something.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Thelma J. Chalifoux :
Honourable senators, I should like to ask a question.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Otherwise, there will be no order in our discussions.  
That is a Liberal policy.  
I can find all kinds of statements made over the years. 
Honourable senators, I, too, was there. 
I was on the other side. 
Are you aware of that policy?  
Does that come from the Red Book?  
I am aware of many policies of governments of Canada that were just that.  
There is no constitutional amendment in Bill C-9. 
There is no change to the Constitution of Canada in this legislation.  
No one said there was.  
I know there is not. 
How can you amend a constitution unless you go through the - 
That is what you just said. 
I do not think it did. 
Did it, Senator Beaudoin?  
No. All through the 1970s and 1980s it never occurred. 
"Delegating" something means that you can take it back at any time you want. 
Senator Beaudoin says yes; if he says yes, he is correct.  
There is no change to the Constitution of Canada.  
It just does not happen.  
That is how we changed the Newfoundland education system. 
It is not bilateral.  
That is right, this is not bilateral.  
Paramountcy, that is right. 
Are you saying that? 
If you are, you are wrong.  
That is what they are saying.  
Honourable senators, I have a question for Senator Buchanan.  
No, they are not third levels of government. 
They are delegated federal authorities. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, to Senator Buchanan, who was there and has consulted with - 
That was when he was the olive bearer.  
We were all there.  
Too bad we were not all there.  
That was the model that they were studying.  
I am pleased that you intervened, because you were there. 
I was there, too. 
We certainly, as premiers, were not. 
Why, then, do you say that we did it? 
It just was not done.  
However, that is exactly right. 
We had these conferences. 
We had very good meetings. 
Senator Beaudoin was there as a consultant. 
Many of the participants smoked a peace pipe.  
But he didn't inhale!  
What kind of tobacco did you have?  
That is a low blow.  
The test of justification would be some extreme emergency. 
Was that ever discussed in 1982?  
That is what we had been discussing.  
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
I will correct one thing that Senator Comeau said. 
Senator Andreychuk talked about age. 
The answer to the question is no.  
On motion of Senator Andreychuk, debate adjourned.  
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. William M. Kelly :
I was particularly interested in the case made by my colleague Senator Rivest. 
The way I see it, Bill C-20 cannot be considered on its own. 
Men's courses will foreshadow certain ends, to which, if persevered in, they must lead. 
But if the courses be departed from, the ends will change.  
We cannot change the referendum result in 1995. 
We cannot change the Supreme Court's decision. 
We cannot change the Block Quebecois commitment to separation. 
Because of that, in my view, Bill C-20 becomes necessary.  
The bill then became necessary for two reasons. 
First, the bill clarifies what the supporters of separation have attempted to obscure. 
I am impressed in this regard by the case made by Senator Lynch-Staunton. 
I trust this matter will be examined carefully in the committee.  
I was taught to recognize the rule by numbers in this chamber. 
Will passage of Bill C-20 eliminate that feeling of being torn? 
However, we must find a reason for this legislation.  
I firmly believe in a united Canada. 
It bulldozes ahead, with no respect for our opinions. 
Despite clear answers, the PQ government is turning a deaf ear. 
We saw this with the past two referendums. 
The high turnout confirmed that democracy had been exercised. 
Can we stop talking to each other through legislation?  
For years we have been saying the same thing. 
For years the constitutional debate has got hampered us. 
Could we come up with something else, do something else?  
Our history is no different. 
However, the constitutional debate did not yield the anticipated benefits. 
So, it is more than time to move on. 
Are we really that different? 
We will always achieve more through mutual respect and cooperation.  
Then it will be too late.  
Honourable senators, this bill was necessary to clarify the situation. 
It is necessary now, but we must move on. 
We cannot have a second one.  
On motion by Senator Kinsella on behalf of Senator Tkachuk, debate adjourned.  
Corrections and Conditional Release Act 
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Honourable senators, Bill C-247 purports to do two things:
This body of law has been carefully expounded and developed over decades - centuries, in fact. 
These principles were the result of many years of detailed study. 
( a ) to denounce unharmful conduct; 
( b ) to deter the offender and other persons from committing further offences; 
( c ) to separate offenders from society, where necessary; 
( d ) to assist in rehabilitating offenders; 
( e ) to provide reparation for harm done to victims or to the community, and; 
These principles reflect our society. 
They reflect Canadian values. 
Honourable senators, Bill C-247 does not reflect these principles. 
The concept is founded on the biblical injunction of "an eye for an eye." 
Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand or hand, foot for foot, 
Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.  
There are technical problems with a literal application of this principle. 
Do you rape a rapist, molest a molester? 
How do you take someone's life twice over if they take two lives? 
This bill uses prison time instead.  
Prison becomes a panacea - perhaps a dangerous panacea.  
The database consisted of 325 comparisons.... 
The authors are cautiously optimistic about the results so far. 
One of the policy implications identified from the study reads: 
That is a big change.  
Honourable senators, this country used to have a criminal justice system based on punishment. 
I will give honourable senators some examples from the book Crime and Punishment in Canada:
A History by D. Owen Carrigan, published in 1997.  
One David McLane was convicted of high treason. 
Honourable senators, I am not reading these excerpts out of historical curiosity. 
These punishments were not imposed by our ancestors in the interest of being barbaric. 
This sentence appears to us to be remote and alien. 
Canada should take a lessen.  
It is signed "Claire Saunders, Kanata."  
What is the nature of Canadian society today? 
However, those are the exceptions. 
We cannot learn anything terribly useful from, say, Karla and Paul. 
He is referring to Karla Homolka and Paul Bernardo.  
We are a decent society with good, strong values. 
Crime, in fact, is down. 
Violent crime has decreased every year of the last six years. 
Honourable senators, I fear we would become them. 
Our values would be indistinguishable from the criminals whom we are punishing. 
We would be saying that these are acceptable values.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Forgive me Honourable Senator Bryden, but your 15-minute speaking time has expired.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
We would be saying that those are acceptable values. 
Is that what we want to teach our children? 
Is that the vision we accept for the future of Canada and Canadians?  
These individuals have been sentenced. 
I have confidence in our current system. 
There can be no equivalency between a crime and its punishment. 
These families have suffered unspeakably. 
They must deal with their grief in any way that they can. 
People whose loved ones are murdered get angry. 
When my brother Matthew was murdered in 1998, I got angry. 
We who are angry want our own pound of flesh. 
Having had it, we will not be quiet; one pound will not be enough. 
Nothing will be enough. 
Mr. Sullivan also said: 
It seems to me that too many of us are desirous of others' suffering. 
There is no recompense in another's suffering.  
In fact, victims' rights groups have not sought vengeance. 
Victims' rights groups call for notification, support and the right to be consulted. 
Part of the discussion revolved around capital punishment. 
Honourable senators, and Senator Cools, Senator Cools' suspicion was wrong. 
For example, Senator Cools said in her address to this chamber: 
Honourable senators, this does not tell the whole story. 
I believe the minister would have had good reasons for that opinion. 
Amendments to the bill were then negotiated during debate at report stage. 
There are many issues that should be studied. 
Are the views of parliamentary committees to be ignored? 
The committee of the other place took this bill very seriously. 
They heard witnesses from 15 organizations. 
Honourable senators, I believe in the parliamentary system as it has evolved in this country. 
I take seriously the views of our fellow parliamentarians. 
Read the transcripts, honourable senators. 
There were no allegations that the process was somehow flawed. 
There were no suggestions that amendments were somehow railroaded. 
No, honourable senators, the process was correct and proper. 
After detailed study, the committee decided to reject the bill.  
Finally, honourable senators, this bill in its current form is seriously flawed. 
Honourable senators, this also points out the importance of our parliamentary committees. 
Let me explain, honourable senators.  
Those people would not be subject to this bill. 
Is this a case of sloppy drafting? 
This same sloppiness is apparent throughout the bill. 
Why is there discretion in this part of the bill?  
The bill goes even further in this regard. 
Honourable senators, this is setting our criminal justice system on its end. 
It is completely backward. 
They do not all result in a prison sentence. 
In fact, the proposed amendments contained in clause 1 are completely unnecessary. 
Honourable senators, for all its clauses, nothing in the bill would change this. 
The original bill would have changed it. 
This language was changed completely by the amendments at report stage. 
In other words, this bill would not change the existing law. 
Yet, it could seriously undermine Canadian sentencing principles. 
Why would we want to do this, honourable senators? 
What would we possibly achieve that warrants this serious, retrograde step?  
Let me now turn to clause 2 of the bill. 
In his testimony, David Daubney said that in fact: 
We do not, and we should not, "count" victims. 
Rather, we deplore and we denounce murder. 
I've had to face the consequences of what I did.  
A man or a woman has only one life on this earth. 
How can we impose any sentence longer than that? 
Canadian law has said 25 years. 
This bill would say 50 years.  
Parole eligibility is not parole entitlement. 
Honourable senators, 25 years is a long time. 
No. Yet we are asking a judge to make that kind of decision. 
First, I question whether the bill amends the correct statute in this clause. 
Those provisions are set out in section 120.1 and 120.2. 
Proposed subsection (2.4) 
Is this the Canadian way?  
In my opinion, we would be incorporating principles of vengeance into our system. 
If that is the will of this house, then so be it. 
However, that may be the wish of honourable senators.  
All it would do is spread more pain.  
No, let us stop the cries for blood. 
We have spilled enough. 
At least the silence will give us time to think about what we do.  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, would the Honourable Senator Bryden accept a question?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable Senator Cools, are you asking a question?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I am very grateful to the senator for his consideration.  
The senator has talked about the Canadian way of doing things. 
Could the senator tell me how I have been exaggerating anything to this chamber?  
Honourable senators, let me explain very carefully. 
I was very careful in what I said. 
I did not say the honourable senator was exaggerating. 
I, like Senator Cools, have a right to my opinion. 
I invite the honourable senator to check Hansard.  
Honourable senators, that is the position. 
I am simply correcting the record as best I can.  
Honourable senators, I thank Senator Bryden for his response, but I remain unsatisfied. 
I am the sponsor of Bill C-247. 
However, I heard Senator Bryden say, very clearly, "the sponsor". 
In this chamber I am the sponsor. 
I wonder if Senator John Bryden could clarify?  
I shall do the best I can. 
Those are the instances. 
For the purposes of this debate, sponsor means me. 
However, I can leave that for another day.  
We will leave that discussion to another day.  
I believe he said that those are the four principles. 
( a ) to denounce unlawful conduct; 
( b ) to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences; 
( c ) to separate offenders from society where necessary; 
( d ) to assist in rehabilitating offenders; 
( e ) to provide reparations for harm done to victims or to the community; and 
I accept that Senator Bryden has said what he has said. 
I can revisit that matter another day.  
Would Senator Bryden help me a little bit? 
It could be an additional 10 or whatever.  
This is the major concern I have with this bill. 
You cannot, in my opinion, quantify it. 
I would like to leave it there. 
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
The honourable senator mentioned deterrence and vengeance. 
Is that not a very subjective decision? 
How do you fit vengeance into the equation? 
The end result is five years or fifteen years, whatever it is. 
It could be a deterrent, or it could be vengeance.  
You asked which of the principles would govern. 
That is why this list exists. 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Honourable senators, I wish to thank Senator Bryden for the very interesting lecture.  
For the benefit of our colleagues, that section of the Charter reads: 
I did not consider section 12 in detail. 
That was my emphasis. 
On motion of Senator Taylor, debate adjourned.  
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration 
Eighth Report of Committee-Debate Adjourned 
Honourable senators, Canadians have a right to participate fully in the affairs of the Senate. 
Credit is due them more than anyone else. 
I thank them for their work on this document.  
Honourable senators, I recommend the adoption of this report.  
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson :
What is the purpose of the action plan? 
It is also designed to support our leadership responsibilities in our respective communities. 
Officials need our guidance and our support. 
All of us need advice from the public, and particularly from Canadians with disabilities. 
On motion of Senator Hays, for Senator Carstairs, debate adjourned.  
Financing of Post-Secondary Education 
Honourable Senator Graham, P.C. ). 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham :
I will return to that question in the course of my remarks. 
Last week, 30 CEOs demanded greater funding of the liberal arts. 
Because of these programs, he concluded: 
I believe there is a great deal of truth in this. 
Rising tuition has resulted in climbing debt. 
University graduates carry an average debt of more than $25,000. 
Some leave school owing $60,000 or more.  
What are the solutions? 
Can our country feasibly follow such an example?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I regret to interrupt, but the 15-minute time limit has expired. 
Is leave granted to allow the honourable senator to continue?  
Let's put this in context. 
That is the highest proportion of the G-7 countries.  
The submission is aptly entitled, "Nova Scotia:
A Knowledge Economy Dropout?"  
We must work smarter, but smart costs money, as well.  
The recommendation from the Special Senate Committee was: 
Continuous learning is the engine of the knowledge economy. 
We speak of national goals. 
What are those national goals? 
What kind of students are we trying to educate in this country? 
To which values do we as a nation adhere? 
What values will we carry with us as we travel through cyberspace?  
I believe that the classroom is where technology must acquire a human face. 
On motion of Senator Andreychuk, debate adjourned.  
Statement of Minister of Finance-Inquiry-Debate Continued 
Honourable senators, attitudes and circumstances have changed since the 1970s. 
After the budget, they are still the highest. 
You cannot even buy a cup of coffee for that amount of money. 
What the government has really done is cancel a tax hike, through deindexing. 
Let us assume that the breadwinner earns $1 extra of income.  
The end result will not change by more than a few percentage points.  
Then there is the provincial surtax of 2 per cent of net income. 
That is pretty astounding. 
This brings us up to 39 per cent.  
A person might be better off to refuse the money.  
Perhaps the government should take a serious look at fixing it. 
I hope honourable senators agree.  
Hon. Wilfred P. Moore ( The Hon. the Acting Speaker) :
Honourable senators, it is six o'clock. 
Is it the wish of the Senate that I not see the clock?  
Honourable senators, you will have to forgive me. 
Other senators went very long in their speeches today, and I think they understand that.  
Unfortunately, the world will not stand still and wait for Canada to catch up. 
Honourable senators, "Payroll taxes are a barrier to jobs." 
That is not good enough. 
Honourable senators, what did the Commons committee say? 
The Commons committee went on to say: 
It does not belong to the people who put it there. 
It is a tax, pure and simple.  
Honourable senators, let me turn for a moment to health care. 
I do not see any kind of long-term plan to save health care. 
I see nothing in the budget that will shrink waiting lists. 
Let us look at the longer-term aspects of the fiscal plan. 
The government does not have a long-term fiscal plan. 
It will not fall because the debt is falling.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I require two more minutes.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
It is deplorable because you are doing nothing. 
You have paid $6 billion on it. 
With a good Liberal government, we will do that.  
On motion of Senator DeWare, debate adjourned.  
Energy, the Environment and Natural Resources 
Honourable Senato r Kinsella ). 
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
Honourable senators, this arose about a week ago. 
She has been in and out a number of times in the last 10 days. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
I will return to her the mandate that was requested.  
Honourable senators, I certainly agree to withdraw the motion.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
Review of Anti-Drug Policy 
Motion to Form Special Senate Committee Adopted 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, it had been my intention to speak to this particular motion. 
I thank him for his initiative.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Honourable senators, I move that the motion be adopted.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The present Minister of Defence in relation to both matters; 
2. Former Ministers of National Defence in relation to both matters; 
6. The then special advisor to the Minister of National Defence (J. 
Dixon) in relation to the Somalia occurrence; 
That the Committee have the power to sit during sittings and adjournments of the Senate; 
Hon. John G. Bryden :
Many things have happened within the Department of National Defence. 
Perhaps it would be better to assess how we are doing at a later time.  
On motion of Senator Kinsella, debate adjourned.  
Legal and Constitutional Affairs 
Honourable senators, I ask for the consent of the Senate to withdraw this motion.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators, that this motion be withdrawn from the Order Paper?  
Honourable senators, I seek leave of the Senate to withdraw this motion.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I rise on a point of order with respect to this motion. 
The quotation refers to Bourinot as follows: 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Consequently, His Honour may want to consider whether the bill is intra vires . 
Some will say that the bill has yet to be referred. 
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
Honourable senators, I wish to make a short comment.  
They are all found in the second paragraph of that page. 
I am sure His Honour would like to read that paragraph.  
That is an unusual characterization. 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, this is unexpected for me. 
This motion is asking the Senate to remedy that defect or that particular problem.  
This is a most interesting process. 
Obviously, the Senate is indivisible from the Parliament of Canada. 
Section 18 of the British North America Act, 1867, reads: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I did not think I was. 
In other words, the real question is, how are these conclusions reached? 
Instructions to extend the scope of bills are undesirable.  
The Lords say after second reading. 
I have one other comment, based on the interventions of Senators Cools and Kinsella.  
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
I am sure that that is not what he wishes to do.  
It will therefore be a very easy decision for the Speaker. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
However, I shall take the whole matter under advisement.  
Nisga'a Final Agreement Bill 
Motion for Disposal of Third Reading 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, pursuant to rule 38, I move: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Does the Honourable Senator Kinsella second the motion?  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Leave having been given to revert to Government Notices of Motions: 
The Senate adjourned until Wednesday, April 12, 2000, at 1:30 p.m.
