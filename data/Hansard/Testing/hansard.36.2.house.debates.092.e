EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 92 
Monday, May 8, 2000 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP) moved: 
The statistics provided to me by the organization are quite interesting. 
It basically would mean scraping by and surviving day by day.  
I cannot emphasize enough what that means to an individual. 
They had no chance of receiving a phone call back from the employer.  
This is a very basic but important thing.  
But it is provided on a very spotty basis. 
That is something I agree with.  
I met with the folks who run it and with people who use the service. 
It was really amazing to see how this operates. 
He came from Saskatchewan and moved into east Vancouver. 
He was looking for work. 
The reality is that this service is only available in Vancouver. 
Other than that there is really nothing that exists. 
The DERA community voice mail system has 12 phone lines. 
If it were not so serious it would be laughable.  
I do not want to go to another shelter. 
I want to be employed. 
I want to have a phone so that I can have some sense of dignity''.  
That is what we should do here. 
I ask for the support of members to do just that.  
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):
Basic telephone services is quite a different matter.  
It is a good idea.  
I think there are many methods to address this concern. 
That certainly is something we in the Canadian Alliance support. 
From that perspective Motion M-361 would be a step backward.  
Therefore, I am not in support of this motion.  
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
That is exactly what Motion No. 361 says.  
If it warrants, it shall be done.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
We certainly know the importance of telephones.  
Because they do not have the money to pay for it. 
Our house has three telephones and they seem to be busy most of the time. 
That household might have two or three telephones as well.  
How can society level the playing field? 
A level playing field is a very apt phrase these days. 
This is fundamental New Democrat philosophy. 
To do that these folks have to have telephone access. 
Some may ask who does not have access to telephone service. 
We have to provide some assistance. 
The association has found a way to do it at the local level.  
Will this be a major imposition on the telephone companies? 
It would be a great public relations exercise. 
That is one thing we ought to consider as well. 
This is something the telephone companies ought to be offering people within their jurisdiction. 
The hon. member for Vancouver East has come up with a very creative solution.  
My apologies to my friends in the Canadian Alliance.  
We all agree with the idea. 
Maybe her idea is not the best one but it is a good one. 
What is stopping her?  
It would be nice to have the voice from the House of Commons. 
Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Quebec East, BQ):
The Bloc Quebecois is therefore open to the motion by the NDP.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
It is a coming together in support. 
We are getting a tremendous potential return for a very modest outlay of funds.  
The executive officer of the DERA Voicemail project, Terry Hanley, has said: 
It provides previously marginalized people with a way to reconnect. 
We see the disparities growing between the haves and have nots. 
They hear the bickering and the back and forth that go on all the time. 
It would behove us to pay some attention to doing the right thing. 
The motion before us states: 
I encourage all my colleagues in the House to support this very important motion.  
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
The public consultation process is available to all Canadians, including the hon. member. 
The CRTC has already run a number of hearings on this issue. 
Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
From where will they get their telephone service? 
The motion as it reads is not prescriptive in that way. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
I absolutely will follow it up.  
Let us be realistic about it.  
It is about creating equity in society. 
Here we happen to be talking about phone service.  
I will certainly follow it up because I am very committed to doing so.  
I think other members obviously have some questions. 
To say that the CRTC is already doing this is simply not the case.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The period set aside for the study of Private Members' Business is now over. 
BILL C-11-TIME ALLOCATION MOTION 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I move: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion agreed to.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye:
I will explain why I feel this sadness. 
At the time, close to 1,700 miners were working for the crown corporation. 
These 1,000 employees are going to end up on social assistance fairly quickly.  
These families will be in a very shaky situation.  
Let us look at the broader picture.  
The Devco mine is basically a coal mine. 
Coal is less popular than it used to be. 
It is a fairly polluting substance. 
The problem is the approach being taken.  
For some time now, the Devco mine has been run for the federal government. 
There were a number of ways to go about it. 
In short, there were solutions. 
They could really not have cost more in the medium term. 
They could definitely cost less in the long term. 
I have the impression that things are cast in stone. 
The Bloc Quebecois does not like this situation. 
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
I have a couple of questions for the member. 
First, he talked about money. 
More important though, I would ask the member to comment on the following. 
This is not the first time crown corporations have been shut down by the government. 
These people are miners for the most part. 
They have gone underground. 
They have suffered injuries. 
Let me just cite some comparisons.  
That is just in health benefits. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye:
Indeed, this is what I pointed out earlier in my speech.  
There seems to be a will to save federal dollars in the short term. 
Incidentally, these dollars come from the taxpayers' pockets. 
Mr. Julian Reed (Halton, Lib.):
Recently this process led to the appointment of an arbitrator. 
The sale process will involve substantially all of Devco's assets. 
That is the reason for Bill C-11.  
This is a relatively simple straightforward bill. 
Most of these clauses are standard for this type of legislation.  
Finally, there are consequential amendments to other acts.  
It is now time to study these aspects of the bill in committee.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
There are several concerns about Bill C-11. 
This is not really a very good comparison.  
These are the types of things we should be looking at. 
There are some significant flaws in the fairness issue related to Bill C-11.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
We are here in parliament to defend and uphold democracy. 
I will deal with two issues in my comments. 
Over the years these mines have also provided great economic benefit. 
I am from the other coast, the west coast. 
I think last Christmas we saw an inkling of what that impact would be. 
Many of us were back in our ridings. 
It was really awful to watch.  
The miners wanted to be home with their families. 
They understood what was going on.  
We do not want to see children go hungry. 
There will be more poor children in Cape Breton, a community that is already suffering.  
Why would this mine closure make any sense? 
Why would this bill make any sense? 
What does it say about the priorities of the government?  
They wanted to ensure that there was local control.  
We talk a lot about community economic development. 
They were completely ignored by the federal government. 
What we need to know is who will be mining that coal. 
Will child labour be used? 
The worst part is that we should not even be considering foreign buyers. 
We should be investing in this local community. 
That is what we stand for in this party.  
I want to move the following amendment: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I will get back to the hon. member.  
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Canadian Alliance):
What else would motivate the government to suddenly move so quickly? 
Certainly it could not be the interests of Cape Bretoners and Canadians.  
Yet the entire time the government has known differently.  
It simply was not working.  
Cape Breton Island has experienced poor economic conditions many times...but 
none can compare to the present day. 
People are showing a lack of confidence in the future. 
After all, the Prime Minister has promised an election within the next year. 
More important, what will replace those controls? 
Mr. Shannon has obviously done fairly well through his appointments. 
That is not the end of the story of Mr. Shannon. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
It is very important to meet with the people there. 
It is important that we on the government side listen carefully.  
She talked about child labour in other countries. 
She talked about rumours that she had heard. 
We are now at that point and into binding arbitration. 
We need to proceed in that fashion. 
It is important and it makes a great deal of sense.  
That really is an out and out falsehood.  
Members from the NDP know that as well. 
Listen to them caterwauling instead of listening to the speech. 
They are caterwauling and trying to stir things up. 
What I am about to say is worth listening to.  
At the end of the day, is it perfect? 
It will assist that part of Atlantic Canada and, more to the point, Cape Breton. 
That has been a goal of the government from the outset. 
So it is that we proceed in this important area.  
I have visited there on a number of occasions. 
Why do we do that? 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
We are talking about the direct loss of close to 1,500 well paying jobs. 
However, in 1998, foreign ownership in this country jumped fourfold to $24 billion. 
We will see it again with Devco. 
Where did we hear that kind of story before? 
We will see absolutely the same scenario with the Devco operation.  
A number of other costs cannot be calculated. 
Yet no meaningful consultation has taken place to date. 
That is what we have been after. 
Before I sit down I move: 
I find the amendment to the amendment to be in order. 
RED CROSS AND RED CRESCENT 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
The Red Cross provides assistance to countless victims of conflict and disaster. 
VICTORY IN EUROPE DAY 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):
It is also necessary to acknowledge some veterans who were abused and forgotten.  
Surely they have suffered enough indignity, personal loss and injustice.  
NATIONAL PALLIATIVE CARE WEEK 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
There is one unacceptable practice in this pension plan. 
Where are the surpluses? 
Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Canadian Alliance):
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
HEART AND STROKE FOUNDATION 
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale, Lib.):
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Canadian Alliance):
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
NATIONAL CHILDREN'S AGENDA 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Unfortunately, Canadian kids and their parents have absolutely nothing to celebrate. 
It is time for action. 
The hon. member for Compton-Stanstead.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Newswatch is a program watched by thousands of Quebecers. 
It is important for these people to have access to local news in English.  
I put four questions in the House on these closures. 
Then she said certain options were on the table.  
The minister has emphasized the arm's length relationship between the government and the CBC. 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
It is the largest private sector employer in the national capital region.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Canadian Alliance):
The police refused to protect the family. 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
A fine example set by a man who would be Prime Minister.  
Sail on, he who amasses millions of dollars. 
Sail on, until the next election.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
The ACOA grant was supposed to create 40 full time long term jobs. 
Now it is closed due to ``mechanical problems'', whatever that means.  
Why are taxpayers on the hook for another Liberal boondoggle?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
They said they were delighted to have the Prime Minister go with them. 
They feel he is a real plus.  
I do not know why the hon. member is asking this question. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
Bren Powers was the mastermind behind this particular scheme. 
It is not the same.  
It said that a grant is like a loan. 
If it were then we would have no national debt. 
We could just say all those loans were grants. 
Please be very judicious in our choice of words, my colleagues.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
I would like to know why he is defending it so much now. 
That to me equals a grant in my thesaurus.  
Who cares if it drives another business out? 
Who cares if the project will fail anyway? 
Why is it so important for this government to pay bucks for ballots?  
When the Liberals took over, the program was completely revised.  
There is a byelection going on in Newfoundland. 
That is why there are these questions today. 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, first it was the Tories and now it is the Liberals. 
Nothing has really changed.  
That was the first thing we did. 
Because the auditor general had pointed out that was exactly what we should do. 
The second thing we did was we put a limit on those loans. 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):
This is not about creating jobs. 
In fact, the Clarenville sportsplex killed lots of jobs. 
And it is not like the Liberals believed in ACOA. 
They tried to stop its very creation. 
The alliance party should align itself with some chartered accountants.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
The hon. leader of the Bloc Quebecois.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Why are there no such MOUs in the case of CINAR? 
Who do they want to protect? 
Who is hiding behind this whole business? 
Who is the minister helping?  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
The hon. member for Vercheres-Les-Patriotes.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, there are two elements here.  
This is very simple.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister is in Boston. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
When will the government come clean on NAFTA?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Indeed that is what we are doing.  
In terms of the Canada Health Act the principles are there to be respected. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her question.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Is it today, tomorrow or next week? 
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to reassure the hon. member that we have- 
We want to hear the hon. parliamentary secretary's response.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
They had never read it. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Canadian Alliance):
We have had it for weeks and we have read it.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
It is the department that discovered an overpayment. 
What more does the hon. member want?  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, here are some details for the minister.  
Can the minister explain why the contract was not respected?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, that is nice but it is irrelevant. 
CSIS says that this federation is a front for the Tamil Tigers. 
Why were the finance minister and the minister for CIDA breaking bread- 
The hon. minister responsible for CIDA.  
Hon. Maria Minna (Minister for International Cooperation, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I find this very offensive. 
I had dinner with 600 law-abiding citizens and residents of Toronto. 
They were not there for any other reason.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
In fact, Mr. Speaker, I can confirm that is not the case. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
An internal investigation was undertaken and this was not confirmed. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is obviously a very tragic and sad situation. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Canadian Alliance):
This is a very serious issue. 
This judge messed up and the provincial government- 
The hon. Minister of Justice.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
My question is a very simple one. 
Where are the invoices? 
We want to see them.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the minister of Indian affairs.  
Mr. Smit has failed to register as a lobbyist as required by law. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, that was a good non-answer.  
How much money will Mr. Smit donate to the minister's next election campaign? 
The question is out of order.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we can have a national debate at any time. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, there is a small difference. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Nortel acquired Bay Networks. 
Now, there is a pebble. 
That is what Canada can benefit from. 
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.  
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
The Government of Canada cannot intervene in that situation.  
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):
There are no deadlines and no timelines. 
It has been seven years.  
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
It was purely weather and operational considerations. 
I hope the member takes that into consideration.  
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
The problem is very serious. 
There are health risks. 
It is perhaps the most polluted single site in Canada.  
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
This process is underway.  
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
They connect employers with employees.  
We anticipate over 400,000 young people to go through these centres. 
I would also note that as a result of our Canada youth strategy- 
The hon. member for Calgary Northeast.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):
Those words are beginning to ring hollow. 
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
However, we must look at the whole picture.  
We have bought new equipment for our Canadian armed forces. 
We have got new Cormorant helicopters for search and rescue. 
We have got submarines. 
We have got the Coyote reconnaissance vehicle.  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Canadian Alliance):
It is my pleasure to present this petition on the petitioners' behalf.  
Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard-La Prairie, Lib.):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
The petition contains literally thousands and thousands of signatures.  
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Question No. 91- Mr. Svend J. Robinson: 
Mr. Gar Knutson (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
Any further comment on matters before Commissioner Hughes would be inappropriate. 
Question No. 98- Ms. Pauline Picard: 
The ad hoc working group also co-ordinates pilot projects.  
Participating provinces and territories will also commit resources to the pilots. 
Potential candidates could express their interest to the appropriate representative in their jurisdiction.  
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
It is never a pleasure to talk about that. 
I am not going into that in much detail. 
The process is often as important as the results.  
Let us talk a bit about what happened. 
Last December there was a shutdown of the Phalen colliery. 
This resulted in a protest. 
A little later on in January there were wildcat strikes. 
The miners had finally had enough. 
On January 8 several miners went underground and stayed there. 
We can imagine and understand why people in Cape Breton were so frustrated. 
It was said across the floor this morning that they had gone to binding arbitration. 
I want to move on to something that I find particularly disturbing. 
I am going to focus my remarks for the last few minutes on this. 
Ask the Minister of Finance why.  
I have two things to say about that. 
Let us talk about the Colombian side of it first.  
He told us about the coal coming in from Colombia. 
He talked about the labour which is used. 
We take safety for granted.  
The situation here is that the Devco assets are up for sale by the government. 
We may well see a further devastation of the coal mining industry in that province. 
We are extremely disappointed that has not happened. 
The coal mining industry has had a long and illustrious history in Cape Breton. 
It has manipulated people and the process aimed at dissolution and divestiture.  
That is why we feel so strongly that the situation has to be studied. 
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Canadian Alliance):
These are some of the questions that are being asked down there.  
Studies show there is plenty of coal in the ground. 
The location and facilities on hand for export are great. 
Skilled workers are on hand. 
There is a long tradition of mining coal and a fully developed community infrastructure. 
I want to talk about that just for a second. 
Let us look at the money that has been poured into Devco. 
The miners have not seen any result of that. 
The mine is being shut down. 
Let us have a public inquiry. 
Let us see where the money has been going. 
Let us look at it. 
We spend years to develop foreign markets for customers. 
Try to get those markets back. 
For example, union representatives went along with management to visit Mexico. 
Mexico signed on but the government team signed off. 
In fact, they are the worst I have seen. 
I have to admit on some grounds the work was tough. 
They kept shutting down time and again. 
We know it is not from people in Canada. 
No, it is a shipping firm.  
Yeah, it would be CSL. 
That is held by, what is his name?  
The finance minister of the Liberal government. 
Yes, the finance minister of the Liberal government. 
That would be my way of looking at it. 
Where is the new technology for coal back east? 
I go back to what I originally said. 
The government is trying to force the miners of Cape Breton to become telephone operators. 
These men are supposed to be retrained. 
Maybe that is the game plan, I do not know.  
Before I close I would like to quote Mr. Murphy: 
That is the question. 
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Let me begin by explaining what the negotiation process was.  
I would ask you, Mr. Speaker, to call in a quorum.  
And the bells having rung: 
I see a quorum.  
Let us start with how this crown corporation was wound down. 
The Minister of Natural Resources came to Cape Breton in January. 
Why not for the miners of Cape Breton? 
Let us look at the education allowance. 
They also received a relocation allowance.  
There is no such consideration for Devco.  
The list goes on and on.  
It would look at precedent. 
He knows that from his law school days.  
I think it is because it has a foreign buyer. 
I am not a young man. 
I am in my forties.  
The government is to sell it to a foreign company. 
Do we know what that will mean? 
Cape Bretoners will not mine that coal. 
That foreign coal will feed the contract with Nova Scotia Power. 
The provincial government is looking at selling the steel corporation to foreign ownership. 
Again we talk about betrayal. 
For 30 years we made some progress. 
There are some very other important issues. 
Many retired miners are receiving their pension. 
Who administers that pension? 
I do not think they will do that.  
I know I am right. 
I have one minute left and I have much to say. 
Let me just say it is a sad day for Canada. 
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to the opportunity to engage in this debate. 
Surely enough is enough.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I think you would find that we do not have a quorum.  
And the count having been taken: 
And the bells having rung: 
There being a quorum, the debate shall continue.  
My essential point was the question as to when is enough enough? 
When should the government get out of this business? 
There is something in the order of an expectation of $100 million environmental cleanup. 
No purchaser is going to purchase this mine with that liability. 
The government has taken on that liability.  
Again, no purchaser is going to take on these kinds of liabilities.  
The numbers get to be a little staggering after a while. 
Since 1987 ACOA has put $249 million into the riding. 
Then we have the Enterprise Cape Breton Corporation, or ECBC. 
In the past 10 years ECBC has put $97 million into the island. 
Again, what is enough? 
Apparently to members opposite it is never enough. 
There is never enough.  
We are quite prepared to be responsible with assistance. 
In conclusion, the Government of Canada has been most generous in this area. 
Those moneys are substantial. 
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
It is about working through issues. 
It is about taking the time. 
That is not what democracy is.  
What the people in Cape Breton are facing is globalization. 
My father was born in Cape Breton and had to leave. 
He came from a big family of 21 children. 
There was nothing for him to stay for in his home province. 
This is a huge country and it is very culturally diverse. 
People from Cape Breton are very different from people in the Yukon. 
What we are facing is a possibility of Colombian buyers purchasing this mine. 
What would that mean for the people of Cape Breton? 
That is not a small amount. 
Miners have a tradition. 
They have had to go on illegal strikes to even have ministers listen to them. 
These decisions were made in 1995. 
It is becoming a routine practice. 
I was elected to come here and to be a part of a democracy. 
It does not want to hear. 
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
I think that is the essence of this Chamber. 
I am here for no other reason.  
We will have to deal with this crisis sooner or later. 
He specialized in discrimination and racism. 
He lived and worked in a very tough situation. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
For years the federal government has been meddling in regional development. 
A case in point is Atlantic groundfish. 
Here in Ottawa, everything is fine, of course. 
Today, we are talking about Cape Breton.  
There are not just the laid-off workers to think about. 
These 1,000 workers have families. 
Devco employees have vested rights. 
For one thing, they have been paying into a pension. 
The work force could thus be gradually reduced to a minimum. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
We heard speeches earlier today that border on being intellectually dishonest.  
The coal mine in fact was successful as a stand alone enterprise. 
For many years it showed a profit. 
The other side of Devco in the years from 1967 to 1980 was economic development. 
All kinds of things were tried on the island to stimulate and diversify the economy. 
Some of those ventures succeeded and some of them failed. 
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The record will show that is not accurate.  
Members have other things to do besides sit in the House. 
I am sure there are committees sitting as we speak. 
Members have other obligations. 
We will avoid that, I know, in future remarks. 
And the count having been taken: 
I see a quorum. 
The hon. member for Winnipeg Centre has the floor.  
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for at least going through the exercise.  
Many things have not even been raised. 
There was a natural customer for the product.  
It will probably be from the eastern seaboard of the United States. 
It will be Canada Steamship Lines. 
They were told the big lie. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I have already raised this point a couple of times. 
And the count having been taken: 
I see a quorum.  
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Canadian Alliance):
There is something really rotten about this whole deal.  
Those questions have to be answered.  
All of those questions have to be asked.  
It cut them off at the knees. 
There is that whole issue. 
How can it sell Devco before it settles the whole legal issue?  
I found the suggestion by the member for Broadview-Greenwood interesting. 
That was really interesting and really made a lot of sense. 
When I was in Cape Breton I met with the mine workers union. 
We could quite clearly see from year to year where it cut off capital investment. 
Why did the government do these things? 
That is not an efficient operation. 
Someone has to answer for those things. 
We have to have a committee. 
That has to be a sweetheart deal. 
I do not know how he possibly could do that. 
He again is clearly in conflict of interest.  
Being a Canadian bid should not be the reason to reject it. 
It should have been the reason to move it to the top of the list.  
I would like to hear from that side of the issue at committee.  
I think it is a valid proposal.  
I do not really care which committee it goes to. 
As far as the amendment to the amendment, I am ambivalent on that. 
I hope the government will allow us to do that.  
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
Some may wonder why I am interested in this issue. 
They were upset about the passing of a part of their history. 
Indeed that is not the intention. 
There has been a lot of discussion about abandonment of the workers. 
This seems to be the essence of the problem. 
In fact there are jobs to go to.  
They are receiving three weeks salary for every year that they worked. 
The government has been generous.  
In my opinion these comments are terribly inconsistent.  
It is not just about coal mining in Cape Breton. 
However in Cape Breton approximately 3,000 people are employed in the forestry. 
What about knowledge based industries? 
Some 44 businesses have set up on Silicon Island, employing 300 people. 
What about Precision Finished Components in North Sydney? 
It is making money and expanding. 
The list goes on.  
This tells me that the people of Cape Breton are adaptable. 
In fact the people of Cape Breton have changed their economy. 
It may well be that members of parliament do not seem to realize this. 
They went back in history. 
Certainly it was not without some unease. 
The industrial revolution was not easy on a lot of people. 
I would be the first to admit that.  
To keep on going with something that is not working is not reality. 
The reality is that they require change. 
Economies change and they change with the times.  
The people of Cape Breton are up to that change. 
As a consequence, they have tried to experiment and they will continue experimenting. 
It is time to move on. 
It is time for a new future. 
The people of Cape Breton realize it and the government realizes it.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
This is becoming a habit with the government.  
I represent an urban community on the other side of the country. 
I have the great privilege and honour of representing Burnaby. 
Instead of that we see the government railroading the legislation through the House of Commons.  
It is absolutely shameful.  
We know that there is a great deal of uncertainty in those communities. 
There is currently an arbitration process under way. 
We know that foreign ownership of these resources is a very real possibility. 
This is not a debate about figures or statistics. 
They are asking to be treated with some dignity and respect. 
They do not want a job at a call centre. 
They want a decent pension and they want a future for their kids. 
They face the direct loss of about 1,500 good quality, well paying union jobs. 
They face the loss of almost $80 million per year in wages and salaries. 
Yet the Liberals insist on just ploughing ahead. 
Mr. Speaker, I see you signalling me that my time has come to an end. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
I have seen the figures on this. 
I am told that it was a really major industry. 
This is where our parliamentary responsibility calls out to us.  
This is what we call the ``tertiarization of the economy''.  
That is what I cannot understand about this debate.  
Let us not mince words, it is imposing gag orders.  
I am grateful to the NDP members for waging this battle today. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
And the count having been taken: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
At least in our party we are making an effort to keep the debate going. 
I know others are very sad. 
I can see their heads shaking. 
It is also a dark and mysterious day for Cape Bretoners. 
It has to be embarrassing. 
We are going to bring coal from Colombia to Cape Breton.  
Guess whose ships are going to be hauling that coal. 
As a matter of fact, it has been shipping coal for a long time. 
Does he select Canada's shipyards to build ships? 
That is where he is building his ships. 
The Minister of Finance is supposed to be setting a model for economic behaviour. 
Who is going to buy this? 
They wanted to find ways of raising finances. 
It is part of the theme of Canada being up for sale.  
What does the Minister of Industry say about it? 
It is time to take Canada back. 
It is a sad commentary.  
You have been to Cape Breton, Mr. Speaker, probably many times. 
Most of us have been there many times. 
As a matter of fact I was there recently. 
They are working hard.  
Today we are talking about hundreds of people who go down into those pits underground. 
They have been tossed on the coal heap. 
We are not talking about 1,500 jobs. 
We are probably talking about 5,000 jobs.  
We have got a great idea. 
The government expects people to cheer for this. 
To be fair, it is nice to have some kind of an infill.  
We are talking about men and women who work hard. 
We have to deal with this in committee.  
We heard others say that today. 
For goodness sake, we are the most connected country in the world. 
Our banks are overflowing with money. 
We have talented and trained individuals. 
This country has the best minds. 
I was in Cape Breton with some of my colleagues from the New Democratic Party. 
They all said the same thing. 
That is definitely not the case. 
We have to expose that.  
Eight thousand dollars is a bit of an embarrassment. 
Cape Bretoners get shortchanged. 
Cape Bretoners do not get a fair deal. 
There are lots of questions. 
That would be the darkest day.  
Mr. Speaker, thank you for recognizing the constituency of Okanagan-Shuswap. 
What are we doing today? 
We are talking about exactly that. 
I have had the opportunity to go to Cape Breton. 
Not one of them I talked to was asking for a handout. 
When I talked to them they were asking for the truth.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, but not on the subamendment.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
But not on the sub- amendment. 
I was just going to talk about the mismanagement with regard to Devco.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sorry it took that long to figure it out.  
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
They took control of the mine. 
Together they took control of the mine. 
I do not blame them. 
They brought the attention of the entire country to their plight.  
The Liberals seem hell-bent on destroying Cape Breton island. 
Maybe I should be a little more charitable.  
I am not surprised, only saddened.  
The Prime Minister called this the best kind of patronage. 
I call it arrogant and patronizing.  
A black comedy, absolutely.  
First it announces call centres. 
Then a problem surfaces. 
This greatly offends their sense of global commercial homogeneity and the companies are not happy. 
What is the result? 
This is no real choice at all. 
It is cruel, cynical and unjustifiable.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
That's nothing to be proud of.  
That is nothing to be proud of. 
What does closure mean? 
It means that the government is cutting off debate.  
This is an important issue. 
There will be almost 1,600 families affected by this legislation. 
We have talked for a little over five hours on this issue in the House. 
Let us consider Bill C-20, the clarity legislation. 
We talked about it for 18 minutes before the government moved closure.  
They should be absolutely ashamed. 
This is anti-democratic behaviour. 
On an issue that is as important as this one, it is absolutely ridiculous. 
I will now move on to more specifics in Bill C-11. 
Cape Bretoners are wonderful and warm people. 
They live in a beautiful part of the world. 
Given an even chance, they would have an outstanding economy. 
It was to build a sustainable industry in Cape Breton. 
Obviously, that has not happen. 
Now it has all come tumbling down around their ears. 
They have families and they expected to have a future in that place. 
It is now gone. 
Because of government policies, that has not happened. 
Who pays the price for that? 
It is the workers at Devco and the people of Cape Breton.  
I suppose there are many ways we could try to fix this. 
It lies in the private sector. 
What are those things? 
The people of Cape Breton need to enjoy some lower taxes. 
Cape Breton is a beautiful and gorgeous part of the world. 
We do that in a number of ways. 
First, let us clean up the mess at Devco. 
Let us treat them decently and put this issue behind us.  
We begin by lowering taxes for one thing. 
I am not saying that is the only thing. 
Cape Breton, I would argue, is a victim of those sorts of policies. 
Sadly, that has happened at the provincial level. 
I will not reflect on whether it is happening now. 
That is crazy and it has to end.  
We are not in the 20th century any more. 
These people need to be well trained. 
The people are great and have a unique culture. 
Help is not going to ultimately come from governments. 
For crying out loud, let us not go down that road again.  
Instead, let us give these people the tools. 
I believe it can. 
We have seen it happen in many other places.  
This is the House of Commons, the Parliament of Canada. 
Sadly, freedom of speech is apparently something that is anathema to the government. 
Cape Breton has the tools to do the job. 
Promises have been dashed by this government and other governments.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
It is because it closed Cape Breton's Devco mine.  
Only opposition members are talking about it. 
That is the problem for the Atlantic provinces. 
The Liberals let them down.  
It is not just Devco. 
We have a similar situation with the Sydney steel plant. 
The Liberals are letting the people of Atlantic Canada down.  
The government offered $8,000 for training. 
Jobs do not grow on trees.  
The people of Cape Breton deserve more respect. 
The miners of Cape Breton deserve more respect. 
The people of Cape Breton got up every morning to go to work. 
They have put their health and their life on the line. 
They have sacrificed their health for this country. 
They used to say economic problems ought it be attacked, not people. 
This is what the Prime Minister used to say when he was in opposition. 
But once in office, the Liberals gutted employment insurance. 
This is what the Liberals have done. 
They followed in Brian Mulroney's footsteps. 
There is a good reason why we can hear a Liberal member singing. 
The Liberals have invoked closure in the House of Commons 65 times. 
This is an all time record.  
What is the difference?  
There is no difference. 
The parliamentary leaders in the House of Commons know better than that. 
It is a real shame how the people of Cape Breton are being treated today. 
That is not what he said. 
That is not what they said. 
Now they are saying that the Atlantic is for sale. 
I have a surprise for them. 
Let us catch the wave''.  
The kids will go hungry because of the decisions of this government. 
The government dropped them, that is what it did.  
It is a shame what the Liberals have done to Cape Bretoners. 
Shame on the Liberals for what they have done.  
I am sure the same thing is going on in Cape Breton.  
The attitude of today's governments has to change. 
If they go to northern Ontario, perhaps they will understand too. 
Even Liberal colleagues say that people have been mistreated by the Liberals.  
Mr. Brent St. Denis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
I appreciate the emotion and the colour he is able to put into his speeches.  
That decision is expected around the end of May.  
The bill will not change that requirement.  
Let me remind my colleagues of two points.  
However, economic development on Cape Breton is continuing to be addressed by the government.  
The Government of Nova Scotia also contributed $12 million for this purpose.  
The initial elements of that strategy should be operational this summer.  
Legislation now before us is the key to moving that process forward. 
Bill C-11 is relatively simple and straightforward. 
With that I see that my time is up, Mr. Speaker. 
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP):
Where do such ideas come from? 
But what do I know? 
I do not get paid to pontificate. 
I am a coal miner's daughter who grew up in Glace Bay.  
The men took it and came back for more. 
Whatever it took to dig the coal, they did it. 
Through the long days of summer they did it. 
They did it to get a paycheque and earn their way. 
When the wars came, we implored them do to it. 
They served us all well. 
They never, ever got something for nothing.  
Miners were not that lucky.  
To date we have been left with only the word of the federal government. 
Blaming us for the loss is an insult that sears our souls. 
Do not add the indignity of insult to injury.  
We earned everything we ever got. 
There was a time when it was enough to earn us a living. 
It should forever be enough to earn us respect.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
There are really three things that provoked me to do that. 
What a legacy for the current federal Liberal government. 
On Friday I was in Windsor, Ontario. 
What he described is absolutely true. 
Our human resources are going to be the future of Cape Breton. 
Let us refer this issue to the human resources committee.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The question is on the amendment to the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment to the amendment?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the amendment to the amendment will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I declare the amendment to the amendment lost.  
The next question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.

The next question is on the main motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.

I declare the motion carried. 
Accordingly the bill stands referred to the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage.  
(Bill read the second time and referred to a committee) 
Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
It is not just the companies that are dragging their feet. 
As of today, Canada has still failed to ratify that pact. 
It is going to take more than volunteerism here. 
It is going to take government action.  
Climate change is no longer something for Canadians to worry about tomorrow. 
The changes are already with us today. 
The polar ice caps are thinning. 
Earlier this spring NASA reported a shocking decline in the ozone layer over northern Canada. 
Again this is because of greenhouse gases.  
Climate change is upon us, yet the government refuses to take action. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to respond to this point.  
That work is now virtually complete. 
We intend to perform to international standards.  
(The House adjourned at 7.17 p.m.)
