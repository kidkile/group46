The House met at 2 p.m. 
Members sang the national anthem ] 
Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):
The Hungarian state is 1,000 years old.  
Many celebrations are planned in Hungary for this historic milestone. 
On May 19 and 20 in Budapest the Hungary 2000 Conference will be convened. 
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Canadian Alliance):
We need shared parenting put in the law. 
Maintenance should reflect the principle of ability to pay and demonstrated need. 
The act must respond to false allegations.  
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
These pictures are available to Canadians on the web. 
Mr. Irwin Cotler (Mount Royal, Lib.):
Israel is not simply the Andy Warhol of the international media. 
NATURE CONSERVANCY OF CANADA 
Mr. Rick Limoges (Windsor-St. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Canadian Alliance):
All the natives ask is to be treated equally. 
They want annual budgets and an annual external audit.

Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
CANADA-FRANCE PARLIAMENTARY DAY 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):
Dr. Jackson passed away last Saturday in Edmonton at the age of 95.  
The working conditions were rough and isolated. 
Supplies and provisions were scarce. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Today it is 85%.

NATIONAL PRESS CLUB BOOK DRIVE 
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Teen Express 2000 is a shining example to all.  
Mr. Raymond Lavigne (Verdun-Saint-Henri, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
I have a list here of 123 grants totalling more than $12 million. 
Yesterday they claimed we gave out grants to businesses. 
What does it feel like to be wrong 100% of the time?  
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
I would like to remind the minister about what he said yesterday.  
Those are giveaways, as far as I know.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
I thought they made money.  
We see now that ACOA really did fund golf courses. 
Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member said improve his line. 
I think that was what she said.  
That is enough on lines for today.  
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, the ACOA minister's storytelling abilities know no bounds. 
Are you going to answer the question?  
Hon. George S. Baker:
I am answering the question. 
It has been paid back. 
It set up a business in Fredericton, New Brunswick. 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):
Both hand out millions of dollars of taxpayer money. 
Statistics Canada did a study in 1997. 
It examined over 6,000 ACOA clients. 
It found that 92% of the money goes to small and medium size businesses. 
Who do we believe, the reform alliance or Statistics Canada?  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
At the present time the department is reviewing that new information. 
If any additional steps are necessary on this file they will be taken promptly.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, let us be clear. 
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, it is both funny and sad.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The party opposite has chosen to go that route.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, it is much simpler than that. 
When will the government ask the recipient to repay the grant?  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
If action is necessary, it will be taken.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the government is not abandoning the CBC at all. 
The government has stood by the mandate of CBC.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Regional broadcasting is not optional. 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the government is not abandoning the regions. 
In the meantime, before the next board meeting where decisions and recommendations will be- 
The hon. member for Saint John.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
It does not mean they have active tuberculosis. 
In fact, none of the five have active tuberculosis. 
All of them are receiving treatment for this. 
It is in fact totally 100% curable with treatment.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Now we will have the short answer.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
In these five particular cases they are receiving appropriate medication.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Canadian Alliance):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member opposite is mistaken. 
This member, once again, is using her own tactics to twist the facts.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, that is just unbelievable. 
Let us examine the players in this unsavoury drama.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I would ask members to please tone down the rhetoric a little. 
We are getting carried away on both sides.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Today the government has announced ``We are going to audit this matter''.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, once again the opposition is not listening. 
I did not announce an audit. 
I did not announce an audit.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, the Modes Conili grant scam is a disaster. 
There are people in prisons for scams less serious than this one.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I would challenge that member to say those things outside the House.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, the facts are clear. 
The truth is that $7,000 went to the hon. member for Ahuntsic- 
I ask the hon. member to please go to his question.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have already shown our compassion. 
We have already responded to the needs of the victims of our blood supply system.  
This is what is most important for victims.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the minister has no compassion. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois' position is completely absurd. 
We have avoided ten years of litigation. 
The measures which are- 
We will listen to the answer, if the Minister of Health wishes to conclude.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):
Why did the EDC chose patronage over trade rules?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Prince Edward-Hastings, Lib.):
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence. 
How has the minister's department responded?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
We have been receiving requests with respect to some protective equipment. 
We are looking at other ways that we might be of support in this endeavour.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the aviation industry is fairly healthy in Canada. 
We are very optimistic regarding the future development of competitive patterns. 
Competition is taking place. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, who runs our military? 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have a supplementary question for the same minister.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
There is certainly no testing of nuclear weapons that would be allowed in that range. 
We have operated this test range for numerous years. 
It has always been done quite safely and quite successfully. 
We want to take extra measures all the time to ensure safety.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
The lawyers defending the case have been paid but not the victims. 
Is it simply a case of lawyers come first, victims later?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Those cheques will be going out soon under court direction and management.  
That is what Ontario should be doing. 
It should be accepting the services we are providing for sick people.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
Those active ingredients from third world countries have been attributed to numerous deaths.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia, Lib.):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we do that. 
We have family resource centres. 
They provide services for the spouses and the families of our forces personnel. 
As I said yesterday in the House, we will go beyond that. 
We will take the recommendations from the report that we received. 
We will not tolerate that and we will take the necessary action.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the solicitor general.  
Why are the RCMP doing that?  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):
When does he intend to correct this oversight?  
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
PRESENCE IN THE GALLERY 
We have a special guest with us today that I want to introduce to members. 
He is a gentleman who took part in the Mercury space project. 
All members are invited to attend.  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS

Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Vaughan-King-Aurora, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions.  
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Vaughan-King-Aurora, Lib.):
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Canadian Alliance):
The first petition decries the public funding of abortion in this country. 
The petitioners say that this is something that should be addressed very quickly.  
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have another petition on an unrelated topic.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
A large number of constituents point out the need for a national highway system. 
They are calling upon the federal government to take the appropriate action.  
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Canadian Alliance):
I would like to know when I could expect an answer to these questions.  
I must tell the hon. member that the answers to his questions are imminent.  
Shall the remaining questions stand?  
Motion No. P-5 
I therefore ask the hon. member to withdraw his motion.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
I will be transferring the motion to Private Members' Business.  
The motion is transferred for debate pursuant to Standing Order 97(1).  
CITIZENSHIP OF CANADA ACT 
The motions will be grouped for debate as follows: 
Group No. 3, Motions Nos. 6 to 8, 15, 16, and 18 to 21. 
The Chair will remind the House of each pattern at the time of voting.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
There have been some discussions among representatives of all parties. 
Is there unanimous consent to proceed in this fashion?  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance) moved: 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ) moved: 
That Bill C-16, in Clause 8, be amended 
( a ) by replacing line 11 on page 5 with the following: 
(1) Subject to section 8.1, the Minister shall, on application, grant'' 
( b ) by adding after line 24 on page 5 the following: 
``sections 8 and 8.1 have been met;'' 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance) moved: 
Is the hon. member for Lakeland moving this motion?  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance) moved: 
That Bill C-16, in Clause 16, be amended 
( a ) by replacing lines 5 to 12 on page 7 with the following: 
( b ) by replacing line 14 on page 7 with the following: 
``that the Court specifies in the'' 
( c ) by replacing line 16 on page 7 with the following: 
``(3) For the purposes of this Act and prior legislation, a person'' 
That Bill C-16, in Clause 31, be amended 
( a ) by replacing line 22 on page 15 with the following: 
( b ) by adding after line 25 on page 15 the following: 
defining the expression "public interest" for the purposes of section 21;'' 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ) moved: 
(i) the Charter of the French Language (R.S.Q., c. C-11); 
(iii) the Election Act (R.S.Q., c. E-3.3); and 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.) moved: 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance) moved: 
Unfortunately not nearly enough change was made to the bill to make it acceptable.  
Many of the motions I propose today will improve the bill. 
It is certainly in need of change. 
I start by speaking to the Group No. 1 amendments.  
For the past several years any child born in Canada automatically becomes a citizen. 
This concern has come up several times before. 
I deal with this concern in my amendment. 
Most Canadians see that as being reasonable.  
Most Canadians understand that there is a lot of abuse of the current system. 
The court did not consider that.  
Again, that committee had a majority of government members. 
That change was not made, which is very unfortunate. 
That is a sad commentary. 
That is what has happened here.  
The former minister acknowledged that this was a problem. 
The government should have made the change and then do the study. 
There are several more motions in this group to which I would like to speak. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
There is something rather odd about that. 
Legal counsels for the Department of Immigration were present at the time. 
Why so many reservations when it comes to international adoption? 
There are, basically, two reasons, three even. 
On April 12, I raised my first question and expressed my first concern.  
It was not new. 
It is not new. 
So things had to be activated and negotiations initiated.  
Quebec gave negotiations a chance. 
As late as yesterday, the deputy ministers were talking. 
That motion, which seeks to amend clause 8, reads as follows: 
We also proposed the following: 
The amendment that we are proposing has already been submitted to the deputy minister. 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
The member is indicating that there is a problem. 
Their children require citizenship in those countries.  
This issue cuts both ways and I do not see it as being a problem. 
I do not think that amendment to the legislation would make any sense at all.  
That would create a huge amount of unnecessary paperwork and unnecessary complications.  
It is my hope that the House will not support those two motions.  
The applicable law involves all of a country's adoption legislation.  
For all these reasons, the government will not be supporting this motion.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, it has often been said that Canada is a country of immigrants. 
My oldest brother was born in North Dakota. 
Let me cite two cases which I have had to deal with.  
As young people do, she fell in love. 
There is nothing new about that. 
She decided to get married. 
The complications that this girl faces in moving to the United States are unbelievable. 
There has to be a better way.  
Let me give the House an example of the most recent case. 
They fell in love. 
They want to get married. 
That represents another $500 or $600.  
That ought not to happen. 
There is no reason for that to happen. 
I am speaking particularly of our young people who choose a spouse outside Canada.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
I am not our party's critic for immigration. 
It is for this reason that we have a problem with this amendment.  
The amendments he proposes solidify the fact that adoption is a provincial area of jurisdiction. 
We support Motion No. 22 put forward by the hon. member for Lakeland. 
We did not like this. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
It has always exercised that right. 
This is the fundamental problem I see with this bill. 
Provincial governments have rights that are guaranteed by the Constitution and by tradition. 
This approach is unacceptable. 
We certainly do not want this for adoptions.  
I appeal to the common sense and good judgement of this House. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):
The minister is well aware of that particular issue. 
She was aware of the issue when she took office. 
I could go all the way back to when Sergio Marchi was the immigration minister. 
Each one claimed that they would look at the issue. 
That was good because that was the way it should be done. 
I do not think that is the response that should be coming from a minister.  
Why does the minister not take a little trip over to the city of Vancouver? 
One hospital in particular handles a number of them.  
Obviously, she does not want to do that. 
She does not want to question status quo immigration policy.  
I have a problem with that. 
We must question status quo immigration policy. 
If it is poor legislation or inadequate legislation, why are we here? 
I will make the reference again. 
The government pointed out that it likes consultations. 
We had consultation after consultation. 
I rest my case. 
The bill before us is inadequate. 
The issues of concern to most Canadians will not be addressed.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The question is on Motion No. 1. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The recorded division on Motion No. 1 stands deferred.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The recorded division on Motion No. 2 stands deferred.  
The next question is on Motion No. 3. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The recorded division on Motion No. 3 stands deferred. 
The recorded division will also apply to Motion No. 17.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The recorded division on Motion No. 22 stands deferred.  
This group contains Motions Nos. 4 and 5.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):
The proposed legislation that is outlined should be addressed to its fullest. 
We will support Motions Nos. 4 and 5.  
Even if there were fraud I think there is entitlement. 
That was under the Singh decision.  
First they were allowed or permitted an oral examination. 
It could be changed. 
Is that not somewhat of a paradox or a contradiction? 
I think it is a contradiction.  
However that is not what the bill provides.  
I find that passing strange.  
The point in question is the issue of citizenship. 
Once it is revoked then another matter must be dealt with such as deportation.  
There is no mention of that in the bill at all. 
We deport people who commit fraud, who lie, who misrepresent. 
It has to be adversarial.  
I find the whole proposal lacking. 
I was a young boy. 
It is important for Canadians to know that.  
It is the recognition that no one judge is infallible. 
What happens is this. 
The minister is the prosecutor in the case. 
She goes to the federal court trial division. 
The cabinet makes an order on revocation.  
This is a good motion. 
If we think back, we had the Asian exclusion act. 
We only have to go back to the second world war. 
They were sent back to the gas chambers. 
We have made some great strides heading into the new millennium. 
We have a premier of British Columbia who is from India. 
We have a governor general who is from Hong Kong. 
We have a Minister of Citizenship and Immigration who is Jewish. 
I urge my colleagues in the House to go the rest of the way. 
Let us get rid of this archaic piece of legislation on revocation. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Canadian Alliance):
He also experienced great danger in coming to Canada. 
I have talked to many people like him. 
My area of Canada is much younger than that of Ontario. 
These people are very proud Canadians today.  
The hon. gentleman mentioned some of the dark periods in Canadian history. 
I think about the time of Confederation when we became a nation. 
That was the time of the plight of the Irish. 
These people, like me, are concerned.  
I am not against the Department of Citizenship and Immigration. 
We have not done that.  
In some cases these individuals have committed crimes and have never been deported. 
There were three people in my office not too long ago. 
They were all immigrants within the last 10 years. 
They were taking the brunt of the jokes in society. 
I am not anti-immigrant. 
The hon. gentleman has presented a very worthy case. 
I want to support him and I want to support this. 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Canadian Alliance):
They have to be taken very seriously and treated equally.  
We should not take it lightly. 
It is very important to take a moment to congratulate him. 
As I said, the official opposition wants to support these particular motions. 
We cannot just have the minister being able to revoke that citizenship without any discretion. 
I think it is in clause 17. 
I will take a moment to review what is being done on committees. 
It will take the discretion out of the hands of the minister.  
It is not something that happens very frequently, thank goodness. 
The equality of all citizens and Canadians will be taken very seriously.  
Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
In fact the Liberal government is not sponsoring these two amendments. 
They are being sponsored by the Canadian Alliance.  
I have read the amendments carefully and I do not support them. 
I would like to give my reasons.  
I find it passing strange that his party supports lengthy court referrals. 
He talked about it as being a paradox and a contradiction. 
As a matter of fact this has been a hue and cry of that party.  
Let us be clear about what the motions would do. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I did it as a co-signator.  
I want to clarify that for the member. 
The motion did come from the government originally. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I wish to go back to my point. 
It has been reviewed extensively across the country. 
There has been much consultation, particularly with immigrant groups. 
Again I would like to state that the government does not support these amendments.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):
I do not understand the logic in that. 
It seems ludicrous if there is a change that makes sense.  
I cannot understand the argument.  
We have several members of our party who were not born in Canada. 
That is old style. 
That is what the motion is meant to do.  
The member will have to answer to her constituents. 
I cannot believe the member made this argument. 
I do not believe it is a correct interpretation. 
They seem to be happy with that. 
It is something that no other country offers. 
I really do not understand.  
The Citizenship Act is very important. 
It is all wrong that the ultimate power is going to cabinet.  
The two motions in this group both deal with this issue. 
I encourage the government to reconsider. 
I believe some members will support them. 
There will not be one negative word from this side of the House.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
These folks have experienced extreme persecution in their country. 
They have lived a period of horror in terms of their personal lives. 
Unfortunately they have been trying, I must say unsuccessfully, to enter Canada. 
They have gone through all the appropriate channels.  
These people on a personal basis have experienced severe persecution and extreme harassment. 
The spouse of the head of the family has been threatened with rape. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
A recorded division on Motion No. 4 stands deferred. 
The recorded division will also apply to Motion No. 5.  
This group contains Motions Nos. 6 to 8, 15, 16 and 18 to 21.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):
That is the way the government seems to manage. 
It cannot co-ordinate things even in the House. 
The minister cannot co-ordinate her own time. 
The minister should be taking part in this debate and listening to this debate. 
That is completely unacceptable. 
This would be done on very serious issues, usually security issues. 
The minister would be asked to appoint a retired judge to preside over the hearing. 
I do not think that is too much to ask.  
I will run that by members again, because it is important to take careful note. 
It is unbelievable that would be the case.  
It is an unacceptable process. 
One has to wonder why.  
Everyone in this group is a political appointment. 
Motion No. 8 deals with another instance of patronage. 
It is the same type of thing. 
I am talking about only the top dog here, and I understand that. 
Does that not make sense?  
All other members will not be patronage appointments. 
We will see whether the government supports the motion or not, although I doubt it. 
Too much is left to regulation. 
However, that is what this new act will do. 
That was not done and that was what we wanted. 
I encourage the government to support these motions.  
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
This is a fundamental issue. 
The proposed motions deal more specifically with clause 43, the regulations clause. 
In our opinion, this is fundamental.  
Some of the motions are aimed at defining what the child's best interests are.  
There is no definition. 
We do not know if it will be before of after the proposal. 
Adoptive parents were clear on this issue.  
We wanted these fundamental aspects to be considered. 
CANADIAN TOURISM COMMISSION ACT 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried. 
Accordingly the bill stands referred to the Standing Committee on Industry.  
(Bill read the second time and referred to a committee) 
SALES TAX AND EXCISE TAX AMENDMENTS ACT, 1999 
Is there agreement to proceed in such a fashion?  
Mr. Speaker, members of the Canadian Alliance will be voting against this motion.  
Mr. Speaker, members of the Bloc Quebecois will vote against the motion.  
Mr. Speaker, members of the New Democratic Party will be voting no on this motion.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:
Mr. Speaker, I vote no on this motion.  
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried. 
Accordingly the bill stands referred to the Standing Committee on Finance.  
(Bill read the second time and referred to a committee) 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.) moved: 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It is Motion No. 69.  
It is non-votable which means that this matter is here for debate tonight. 
There is some concern that there is direct causal harm. 
That is the issue, freedom of expression.  
Harm is said to flow from pornography in two ways. 
There are three potential sources of proof available. 
The first is anecdotal evidence. 
In any event, establishing a statistical link of this sort is extremely problematic.  
It talked a bit about the harm effects. 
The article which is dated May 1999 states: 
Pornography is a root of all kinds of evil. 
Bernardo's trial was, in part'', she concluded, ``a trial about pornography''.  
In the Criminal Code of Canada the word pornography is actually not there. 
It is the word obscenity. 
Consider what has happened in the past 20 years. 
I do not think so. 
Yet socially, adult pornography has been a massive industry.  
It spawned an outrage right across Canada.  
However, that did not matter because the laws of Canada were under attack. 
The case is now before the Supreme Court of Canada.  
Here we are back to the fundamentals. 
There has been much written about this case. 
It was admittedly a rushed piece of legislation. 
This is a very serious situation. 
I cannot state it any more simply. 
I tend to agree with the justice minister. 
I believe that the notwithstanding clause is for extraordinary circumstances. 
I want it to be dealt with promptly. 
I believe I have the support of colleagues in this place. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Canadian Alliance):
That proves that in this world we can do anything we want to do.  
This type of legislation is something we should support. 
It should be used if the supreme court does not make the proper decision.  
In fact, it is more reflective of our times. 
Surely times have changed, particularly the manner of transmission of obscene material.  
I am talking about Regina v Butler. 
Sex with violence will almost always be undue exploitation. 
That seems to be the manner of law in the interpretation of obscene.  
The court of appeal did not agree. 
In fact, I would welcome this new definition.  
I do not believe this could happen. 
As I said previously, that section dates back to 1959. 
Yes, Mr. Speaker, a crime comic. 
This is another example of the 1950 attitudes existing in our criminal code.  
Surely we have moved beyond that thinking. 
Section 163 is out of touch with our times. 
It is in step with the times, which I support.  
Sometimes it is said that we should only use it in extraordinary circumstances. 
The constitution of the country was drafted by people from across the country. 
We have never used it in this House and I find that rather strange. 
We have gotten away from that.  
He really believed that the supreme court had the final say. 
Perhaps now is the time. 
The member for Mississauga South talked about the child pornography case. 
We know what the majority feel. 
I hope his view is the one that the supreme court will take. 
We will support the bill. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
I am very pleased to participate in a debate of such a very significant nature.  
I want to begin by commending my colleague, the hon. member for Mississauga South. 
The motion would amend subsection 163(8) of the criminal code. 
It would basically tighten up an existing definition. 
We have to send a clear message that it is absolutely offside.  
The current practice is to let these matters progress through the courts. 
It is the equivalent of a legislative nuclear bomb. 
This issue is of importance. 
There are fundamental freedoms which are very much protected by our charter. 
The law is and has been referred to many times as a living tree. 
I for one still have a fair bit of faith in our judiciary. 
We have some very talented judges. 
I can think of many instances where that is the case. 
That is something that should not be contemplated. 
The government should very much consider revisiting the particular issue.  
We should be doing more to study this area. 
Technology has broken down many barriers in terms of making information available.  
There is much to be done. 
That is another suggestion I am sure many members of the House would embrace.  
Obviously a lot can be done. 
The charter is there as a shield and a sword. 
I support the hon. member in his efforts. 
I commend him and congratulate him again for bringing the matter forward. 
Debates of this nature help Canadians to understand the issues. 
He is well known for his work in this area and I congratulate him. 
However, I am not sure the aim of the motion is clear enough.  
First, let us examine the effect of the proposal before us. 
Obscenity is understood to include some notion of sexual immorality or indecency. 
The replacement of the word publication with matter or thing is not necessary. 
There is no need therefore to make this change.  
But there may be other, more efficient ways to go about it than to legislate.  
The voluntary code states that: 
The criminal code is a blunt instrument. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Canadian Alliance):
It is now before the Supreme Court of Canada. 
Canadians from coast to coast are worried about that. 
Is it not the responsibility of the House to draft new legislation? 
It cannot be any clearer than it is now.  
The only recourse we have is the notwithstanding clause. 
I cannot believe the defence of the system. 
It simply goes beyond my imagination.  
The motion introduced by my hon. friend is a new definition for obscenity. 
Obscenity takes place in many different ways. 
Let us take freedom of religion. 
If we look around the House we see people of different religions. 
The member would be called totally out of order. 
It is even creeping into the House.  
He said that I was not carrying any baggage. 
He asked me why I called that baggage. 
We are allowing this in many different ways.  
What will we do, I would ask the hon. member? 
I congratulate him for bringing this forward. 
I have never had so many cases of representation.  
They would bring it in tomorrow if they had to. 
This is not a party thing. 
It is a thing of principle, of morality and of decency. 
However, here we are in limbo. 
We will let the courts decide.  
Why would it not grow? 
Hon. members should ask the RCMP and their police forces. 
Hon. members may think I am carrying some baggage. 
They may also think that what is happening in this country is all right. 
We know that people were told what to do. 
That was interference in the freedom of religion. 
In closing, I want to congratulate the hon. member. 
He will stand in defence of children. 
He will stand against child abuse. 
He will stand against pornography.  
This is freedom of expression. 
Nobody can defend it.  
We are so worried about being politically correct that we have become obscene within ourselves. 
We should not be passing the buck. 
It is our responsibility to do it in this place.  
There will be no change. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
From that standpoint, I feel that Motion No. 69 served a purpose.  
The parliamentary secretary took me to one other dimension of this whole issue. 
He talked about the role of parents. 
There is no question that we all have to be part of the solution. 
We cannot legislate morality. 
This is a very tragic case. 
He is also a person who was sexually abused as a young child. 
It is linked to this debate.  
He is a person for whom there is no recovery. 
He has permanent brain damage. 
He is a person who dropped out of school and abused drugs. 
They could see it.  
We have an opportunity to be a part of the solution. 
That is why Motion No. 69 came forward. 
It has been a constructive debate. 
I thank hon. members for their kind comments.  
We know that the starting point is children. 
We have to look at that seriously.  
Have we got a clear understanding of the views of this place? 
If not, maybe we should.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The time provided for the consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
It would increase from 25 to 50 weeks.  
This group represents Quebec organizations.  
We asked the minister to reduce the number of hours of work that is required. 
The figures confirm our concern about who can qualify. 
How many of those who qualify will be able to afford parental leave? 
Because 700 hours are now required to qualify. 
This is totally inadequate.  
Who will be able to afford it? 
Those who work full time, those who have fringe benefits. 
Once again, a large percentage of the female population will be excluded.  
That is the whole issue with regard to parental leave.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
These benefits are provided to Quebecers like all other Canadians.  
Our priority is to implement our improved parental benefits.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
I want to wish them a happy birthday. 
We are going to share a dinner. 
They cannot share it with their families at home because they are here working. 
It is a fine distinction. 
Canada is experiencing robust growth, which is expected to remain strong in 2000. 
The minister gave some very interesting statistics. 
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Our exports plus imports add up to the equivalent of over 80% of our GDP. 
Our trade numbers show that we are having some success. 
It is true that we ship a lot of rocks and logs. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 7.15 p.m.)
