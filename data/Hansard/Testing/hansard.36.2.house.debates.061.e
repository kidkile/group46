The House met at 10 a.m. 
SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES (B), 1999-2000 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We just heard the message saying that the Governor General was recommending some additional spending. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
This is not a point of order.  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
This will limit debate. 
I am aware of this motion. 
I read the order paper, as the hon. member did today. 
I do not know if this is the motion that will be presented for discussion. 
It is not there. 
We shall, however, wait until the motion is moved.

In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
And the bells having rung: 
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):
One deals with genetically modified organisms. 
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the second petition deals with child pornography. 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions to present. 
The first one contains signatures on some 20 pages and pertains to child poverty.  
I am glad to notice that the government has listened.  
Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):

QUESTIONS PASSED AS ORDERS FOR RETURNS 
Question No. 10- Mr. Gilles Bernier: 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
ALLOTTED DAY-HEALTH CARE 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP) moved: 
A corrigendum is available from the table.  
I regret any inconvenience this may have caused hon. members.  
The government knows there is a serious health care crisis happening across the country.  
The Canadian people know better. 
Our motion sets out three steps.  
We must first take urgent fiscal action. 
We have to draw that line in the sand. 
It is the thin edge of the wedge. 
We have seen what has happened with eye clinics in Alberta. 
We cannot allow that to happen in Alberta. 
Why have they been torn down? 
We are going to shift it on to a private system''.  
It is not a pretty picture.  
Yes, it takes changes. 
Let us talk about the changes. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Is the hon. member aware of that fact?  
Canadians have been waiting all week for that to happen.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
It is a unifying force. 
We are standing at the precipice. 
Her health insurance plan did not cover this particular intervention. 
The first organ transplant did not take. 
The woman who went through that operation died. 
Do we want that kind of situation in Canada? 
Stanley Knowles had a good sense of humour. 
He went on to say: 
The motion today is about just that.  
He says ``Let us roll up our sleeves and get on with two tier medicine''.  
Canadians do not want American style health care. 
They know that for profit medicine is not going to answer their needs. 
Did they not know that before Monday? 
Did they not know there was a crisis? 
Why did they not act in this budget? 
Do we think human life is important? 
The answer from Canadians is a resounding yes. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The amendment is receivable.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
I wish the NDP would take a little closer look at it.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
Madam Speaker, I would make several comments in response to the question.  
That is not the solution.  
Is that a response?  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
How much of that was earmarked for health? 
Now we hear from the hon. member opposite all these nice words. 
My question to her is simple. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
Madam Speaker, first, I will put a question back to the member. 
The government cut $6 billion out of transfer payments in 1995. 
That has left a cumulative shortfall of $21 billion. 
That is what we want to see.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
It is about the way we want to live. 
It is about being part of this country. 
It is clear that the status quo is unacceptable. 
The status quo is not on.  
Private for-profit medicine is not the intelligent or effective response. 
Public spending on medicare every year approximates $60 billion. 
Let us be honest about the facts on financing. 
Let us tell the truth about role of the Government of Canada. 
The first is the proper level of financing. 
That means long-term sustainability. 
I have spoken and written about these issues at length in the past. 
Provinces are moving in that direction as well. 
In reality it is needed.  
The third is a focus on quality care. 
The Canada Health Act does not speak of quality or standards of care. 
It talks about principles.  
The Government of Canada has a crucial role to play in all this. 
Let us now move from resolution to action. 
That is what I think we must do on behalf of the people of Canada. 
Let me conclude by saying that the status quo is not acceptable. 
That is not the choice we face. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
My first question is for the minister. 
Why does the cash not count today? 
I have a second question. 
Madam Speaker, the cash does matter. 
The cash does matter and it has increased.  
She talked about the passive role of the Government of Canada. 
We do not take a passive role. 
We are awaiting the tabling of the legislation later today. 
I do not think that is passive. 
I am not speaking now about members opposite. 
I am speaking of other participants in the debate. 
We will not advance this issue on the basis of personal attacks.  
They are not at work on what will make a difference.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
How can they, in the real world, pretend that is not so?  
The leader of the New Democratic Party talks about problems in emergency rooms. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
Budget 2000 is based on previous budgets. 
I cannot agree because $2.5 billion is not an insignificant amount of money. 
This is just the CHST cash portion.  
Tax points are converted into cash and paid to the provinces. 
They are the same as cash. 
Members opposite need to understand that. 
It is not an abstract issue. 
What is a tax point transfer? 
Ultimately the individual taxpayer still pays the same amount.  
It is because as the economy grows so does the value of these points. 
I will give just a brief rundown. 
The federal government has invested significant amounts of money in the CHST. 
Ottawa cannot do it alone. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, the member opposite quoted a figure that is absolutely false. 
The parties opposite talk about the health care system in the United States. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am tired of this. 
This is not the first time this has happened. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
A lot of members are interested today.  
Now listen this one out. 
You recognize about three people in this House. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
First of all it is the privilege- 
Are you going to recognize the same three people over and over and over again?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
That is why we are here. 
That is why we are elected. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I ask the member to please listen to my reply. 
This is not the first time that this has happened. 
How many times do I have to stand up in this House to be recognized? 
I have made my point. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Right now I have recognized the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
My question for the member is simple. 
My question relates to the purpose of our motion. 
Will the government restore the cash that it took out of the system in 1995? 
Madam Speaker, the member opposite still has not got it. 
The hon. member continues to quote the cash. 
The reality is that the CHST funding has been fully restored to 1993-94 levels.  
It is one of the principal tenets of our party. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
The member was accurate. 
The National Forum on Health did quote accurate figures.  
Since that time we have slipped to fifth place in the world. 
The U.S. is still at the top. 
We have been passed by Germany, Switzerland and France. 
I could not express how much enjoyment that would give me. 
I felt I would be able to bring some common sense to the debate.  
I will talk about this in relation to priorities. 
If I were titling my talk, the title would be ``messed up priorities''.  
A significant budget was recently handed down. 
My Liberal colleagues will leave because they do not want to hear this. 
I can understand their not wanting to listen to it.  
In 1993 they had just been elected. 
I will not comment on the previous spending. 
That is the CHST cash component for health. 
What happened to the boondoggle prone grants and contributions component? 
Boondoggle prone grants and contributions went as low as $12.5 billion. 
Let us count the tax points and cash. 
Let us compare 1993 with today. 
Let us do it per capita. 
I will use the tax points in the broad figure. 
When they started there was a total of $28.991 billion in transfers. 
In the interim, what happened to the per capita expenditures? 
There was a golf course, which was not a high priority. 
There were sawmill funds. 
What did this budget do? 
It rewarded the minister of HRDC. 
It gave her more money. 
What is the role of the finance minister? 
He is the overseer of the public purse. 
We trust him to look at the overall expenditures of the government. 
We trust him to say that health care is a high priority. 
He sets the broad policy by funds available. 
What did he do? 
In the next four years there will be $2.5 billion. 
What does that mean per capita? 
This is not apples and oranges; this is a specific comparison. 
The Prime Minister should lead by example. 
There would be no way the minister would get out by blaming somebody else. 
His responsibility, in my view, would be to remove incompetence from his cabinet.  
It is obvious that medicare is under stress. 
I will go over the three big reasons for that. 
That debt is a significant reason our health care system is under stress.  
Let us look at our debt paydown and compare it to other countries. 
Australia was in trouble with its debt. 
It looks like Australia will have its debt paid down in three years. 
Where are we in our debt repayment program? 
That is a significant issue for our health care system.  
There are other big problems. 
The baby boomers who will be coming through the system will create a big bulge. 
He is saying that the status quo is not good enough. 
The status quo is not good enough.  
MRIs and ultrasounds were experimental. 
Now, although they are expensive, they are valuable and they do extend people's lives.  
This is really and truly a discussion about individuals. 
The future of medicare, frankly, is in doubt. 
That is not where my interests lie. 
That is not the way to go. 
I will return to the comparison of international expenditures. 
The latest figures are not available to us.  
We are 10th in the world and falling. 
My colleagues ignore that completely. 
Other countries are spending more for public health care than Canada.  
Let us take France as an example. 
Where is Canada in private expenditures? 
What has been the response of the provinces to this budget in relation to health? 
I can sum it up. 
I will sum it up by giving it a thumbs down.  
Is it all just about a political battle? 
I do not think so. 
They are faced with dealing with a population that is rising in numbers. 
They are faced with dealing with this new technology.  
What has been the federal health minister's response? 
Now there is a point on which we can agree: new proposals.  
What are his proposals? 
His promise is that, if the provinces will come along, he will fund 50%.  
Is that not eerily familiar to a promise that was made back in the 1960s? 
I remember it well. 
The federal government said it would fund 50% of medicare. 
The provinces said ``That is a pretty good deal. 
Then the funds started drying up.  
They are not stupid. 
I am not surprised that the provincial response has been one of great hesitation.  
The lawyers are happy. 
The victims' funds have not been disbursed.  
The government chose the wrong mechanism. 
It chose a legalistic mechanism. 
That legalistic mechanism was wrong.  
He continues to be the Prime Minister's conscience. 
I am profoundly disappointed that the victims have not been taken care of.  
Our system is at least three tiered. 
That tier is one which I want to capture and keep here in Canada. 
The debate on medicare can turn into a slanging match. 
That is a fear which I share.  
If we do not, we are going to be criticized forever.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
At this time, if he has a question to ask, the floor is yours.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
However, I will get on with the question.  
I have one simple point I want to make to the member for Macleod. 
Does that not send us a message?  
They do need our help.  
It is pretty evident that would be the case. 
Would it allow health care to be pushed off to the side? 
I object, however, to the use of figures that are inaccurate. 
I would debate the parliamentary secretary vigorously on figures that are outdated. 
I do hope that he will get updated figures when he comes into the House. 
If I have one objection, it would be just that. 
Updated figures would be really nice.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
It is like a tax on the sick and the elderly.  
No, I do not. 
I would fix medicare before I would branch off into other programs.  
There is room for specific home care programs. 
This makes economic sense and it makes people sense.  
I asked them to simply acknowledge the 30% private. 
We have a complete lack of frankness and openness on this subject.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
What we heard in his speech was precisely that. 
They reject it out of hand and they reject it for all the right reasons. 
Yet, there they are clinging to it like they so desperately want to do.  
I say that Canadians see through that nonsense. 
They see through its ridiculous two-tier American style nonsense. 
We on the government side will not have any part of it.  
The hon. member is a physician. 
My question is simple. 
Why will he not do that?  
If he could explain that to his constituents, he would satisfy me.  
The Liberal government chose grants and contributions over health care. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Let us start with the beginning. 
What happens when $33 billion are slashed? 
Zeros start showing up on the bottom line.  
What is the federal government's role? 
My friend the member for Beauharnois-Salaberry knows. 
This is quite a remarkable state of affairs. 
I want to be very specific. 
Between 1994 and 2003, $33 billion will have been cut. 
It was initially to be $45 billion, but then a few crumbs were handed back. 
This is not peanuts. 
It represents half of the budget for all of the CLSCs.  
The sum of $500 million would mean that home support could be continued. 
Hospitalization is avoided as much as possible.  
It is three times the budget of the Royal Victoria Hospital. 
We cannot say often enough how pressing this is. 
That is the simple fact of the matter.  
I see some Liberal members who seem to be- 
The natural growth of the system is 4%.  
I have researched this and will share my findings with the hon. members.  
I see the parliamentary secretary is joining us. 
It will be no different in 2002-03. 
We need to remember that this is our money. 
Thirty-one billion dollars yearly. 
It is our money, after all. 
On the subject of radiation oncology, it is important, because it is related to cancer. 
Cardiology is not a simple matter either. 
People's needs increase after the age of 50. 
There are more bypasses among older people. 
We know that he is listening to us, and we miss him. 
He works very hard with us and he follows our proceedings from a distance. 
Let us consider what Mrs. Marois said. 
The provinces are being offered $2.5 billion over four years. 
Is this not a far cry from what the premiers said they needed? 
Another reason they are demanding this money is because they have to buy new equipment. 
Millions of dollars in investment are required. 
This is also necessary because of the new types of care being developed. 
There are new health-related problems that require funding.  
I would like to express one wish in closing. 
It has done a great deal, considering the means available to it.  
This is not a partisan issue. 
Our fellow citizens are begging for this. 
It is the government's primary responsibility.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Unfortunately that is not so today.  
Quite frankly he is wrong. 
It is not always about throwing money at the problem. 
It is time for us to get beyond the partisanship. 
This is the problem with the political system in which we live.  
What is the hon. member's duty? 
This is no handout, it is our taxes''. 
The issue is one of finance.  
Some people question the regional management structure, while others wonder about certain types of care. 
The Quebec government is ready to participate in this debate.  
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien:
Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. 
The member, my former union president, was elected in 1997. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It is not a one way street.  
Thank you for this clarification.  
These transfers have increased by 25% in the last two years. 
These are substantial increases.  
I am looking after health''. 
Mr. Landry said yesterday and today ``This requires some thought''.  
He is repeating thoughts of the former minister of health, Mr. Castonguay. 
What does the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve have to say to that?  
I am asking for some honesty from the hon. member. 
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
That tells us how much the government has done.  
When they are on their feet it is always with patronizing platitudes. 
We are tired of that. 
The Liberals have been in office for seven years. 
Right now we are 10 years behind the times. 
Let us look at some of the statistics.  
There are shortages of nurses, shortages of beds and shortages of doctors. 
There is a shortage of pathologists. 
That is important because pathology is at the root of diagnostic medicine. 
We have to know what is wrong with us before we can be treated.  
In the meantime the Canadian population has grown. 
The same thing is happening in Canada. 
There is only one party to blame. 
Talk as they may, the Liberals cannot get out from underneath the problem. 
I am quoting Mike Harris out of the Ottawa Sun : 
But he has no ideas, no initiatives. 
He's given us nothing. 
If he has a plan, would he please tell us what it is? 
Tell us what it is. 
The Liberals do not have a plan. 
They have no ideas. 
Day to day they stumble along making it up as they go along. 
That is exactly what the Canadian Medical Association has been saying for seven years.  
We have to know where we are going. 
That is exactly what the Liberals have been doing. 
Why can we not do it? 
Penny wise and pound foolish; the Liberals are living examples of that. 
That is not the way to run a country. 
It is not the way to run a health care system. 
The Liberals are in the driver's seat. 
They set the rules. 
It starts and stops right at the feet of the Prime Minister. 
The buck stops there. 
He has to take his duties seriously. 
He has to give some direction to the finance minister and the health minister. 
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member from the Progressive Conservative Party for his comments.  
I concur with him on that. 
We have learned many things from different experiments in different provinces in the past.  
I would like him to comment on that practice in the province of Ontario.  
Mr. Speaker, I welcome the member's question. 
I believe the NDP health critic has spelled this out herself.  
You had better come to Ontario.  
They are the ones who have taken away the funding. 
You should be extricated from the House.  
Mr. Speaker, please identify that member by name.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
He talked about Mike Harris. 
Mike Harris made some choices. 
He said his priority was tax cuts.  
They are one time severances. 
I would like to make one final point. 
Who but a Liberal could use those figures and get away with it? 
In the meantime, the population is aging and the population is growing.  
Our own program spending is down $1 billion.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I will go around the circle once more.  
It is the form and the context of the use of the word. 
The word hypocritical has meaning. 
It is a perfectly good word in the English language. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That is the end of the speech of the hon. member for New Brunswick Southwest.  
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Like him, I support the motion tabled by the NDP.  
It is as if the government thinks it is the sole keeper of the truth.  
The minister is trying to cover a huge open sore with a bandaid. 
Right now there is a shortfall of over $4 billion.  
To illustrate the effect of this underfunding I will use Quebec as an example. 
How will the fine gift from the federal government be used? 
This is practically nothing. 
The measures announced are stop gap ones. 
This is why we have to get back to the base figure.  
Once again, those who are worst off will likely be the hardest hit.  
Their precarious existence means that their diet is poor. 
They are therefore vulnerable to all sorts of illnesses. 
And because they are ill, they must take medication. 
Too often, unfortunately, they cannot afford it. 
It is a vicious cycle: greater needs and fewer services.  
As a result the poor are penalised because of this government's inaction.  
The needs of this category of citizens will increase constantly. 
It is therefore imperative to get more money.  
The time has come for this government to help the provinces and the territories. 
However, his government refuses to increase payments to provinces. 
Once more, this government wants to centralize and control. 
What we are witnessing is the emergence of an unhealthy federalism.  
Is that the kind of health care this government wants for our country? 
It seems we are heading very rapidly in that direction.  
Our health system is sick. 
Is the government going to wait until the system gets terminally ill? 
It must act now; it is urgent.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
Ms. Diane St-Jacques:
I believe the government should listen to what the needs are. 
I do not know if it is whether it has difficulty understanding. 
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I listened with interest to the comments of my colleague. 
Ms. Diane St-Jacques:
We say we dismiss this issue because it cannot be done. 
However, have some studies been done? 
Have we thoroughly considered the issue? 
This is often a problem with governments; they implement programs, but never examine their impact. 
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
I will be sharing my time with another member of the New Democratic Party. 
This is what made Canadians proud.  
Over the last five to seven years the government has chipped away at those values. 
It has chipped away at the cultural institutions. 
It has chipped away at the notion of regional economic expansion. 
I predict it is something that Canadians will not allow to happen.  
The federal funding to the provinces was once a real partnership. 
The transfer payments to the provinces have been cut and cut and cut. 
The explanation for that was that the government had to fight a deficit. 
The president of the Manitoba Nurses Union said: 
This budget didn't go nearly far enough. 
It's not really sufficient. 
These are not partisan statements. 
Let us see what they are saying, and they are from every political stripe. 
From my own province of Nova Scotia, Premier John Hamm said: 
Instead, we got crumbs.  
That is where the federal leadership is falling down. 
That is the betrayal to the country.  
The list goes on and on. 
This transcends political partisanship. 
I am sure their constituents will also be be watching.  
It calls for more funding. 
The Minister of Health has said that he is not favour of that either.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Could the hon. member just expand on that a little bit more?  
Would the hon. member please like to expand on that topic just a bit?  
If it is there, surely Canadians should know about it.  
I hope those things will take place.  
I do not know why it has taken so long to pull everyone together. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
First, there is an immediate problem. 
We cannot get the health care that we need. 
I say to the Minister of Health that this is a genuinely dangerous situation. 
We will see today. 
It will be the wide edge of the wedge. 
This will be very, very significant.  
As far as I am concerned, Alberta is a big culprit in this. 
It cannot be done.  
This is what I say to the minister. 
We are in a very, very dangerous situation.  
There is not adequate funding at this time. 
But it is not enough to say that it is coming. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That is what is under debate in the House today.  
We looked at the low cost solutions and the very high cost solutions. 
We all know that. 
Nobody is denying that.  
This is everybody's problem.  
I do not think that is a viable approach.  
It is a question of creating those long term care facilities and beds. 
The provincial governments will say ``Wait a minute. 
Let us not pretend that nothing has happened. 
We have done all of that and we still have a problem.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
I congratulate him for taking the high road.  
The federal government's principal responsibilities come under the Canada Health Act. 
It is a significant ethical issue.  
Those are some of the underlying principles. 
It is not just about dollars. 
It is about the values that Canadians hold.  
The National Forum on Health did two years worth of work. 
It went across the country and consulted very broadly. 
The world changes and people change but our values do not. 
Our values have remained firm and consistent. 
These are issues which have to be agreed upon with the provinces.  
That is not the end of it. 
Doctors and nurses in Canada have the highest standards for which we could ever ask. 
Things do not happen very quickly in the health care system. 
It is a gradualist approach. 
The average length of stay went down significantly. 
This had no impact on the re-admission rate. 
The work that was done showed that it was taking advantage of new technology.  
During this period the Mississauga hospital reduced its beds from 650 to 600. 
It means that there has to be a constant dialogue.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
What would be the hon. member's comments in this regard?  
Would the hon. member comment on my remarks?  
The member raised an interesting issue, though. 
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY 
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, March 8 is International Women's Day. 
Our collective efforts can make a difference.  
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
This tax costs Canadians an extra 8 cents per litre every time they fill up.  
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Two great heritage buildings were lost in the fire and 57 animals perished. 
The only survivor was a Limousin cow named Rosanne. 
The Agriculture Museum is one of Ottawa's best kept secrets. 
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia, Lib.):
Her team also won three world championships. 
She was a great sports woman who set an example for athletes across the country. 
She will be greatly missed.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
I do not know why he or the Prime Minister does not take action. 
NATIONAL FARM SAFETY WEEK 
Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, Lib.):
It is a small effort to keep a loved one safe.  
The government's rural caucus is well aware of this issue. 
Do it for you, for your loved ones and for your community.  
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
FEDERAL TRANSFERS FOR HEALTH 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
I loved every minute watching those games.  
Sandra is the most decorated women's curler in Canadian history. 
Her teams are legendary. 
The world was her stage but Sandra's life is her legacy. 
We grieve and we pray with you. 
Mr. Jerry Pickard (Chatham-Kent Essex, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Mike Harris says that health care funding is inadequate. 
That tax cut tyrant has made a disaster of the social programs in Ontario. 
When an agreement is reached, the federal government will be there with added funding.  
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale, Lib.):
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Sandra died this morning after an intense battle with cancer. 
She was only 36 years old.  
Sandra was a role model for all of us. 
Her skill on the ice was matched by her courage for life.  
Our prayers and our thoughts are with them.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
Today, the Liberals are betraying their commitment and adopting a short-sighted approach. 
It is high time that the Liberals' red books were recycled.  
Mr. Marcel Proulx (Hull-Aylmer, Lib.):
What a scandalous statement.  
Once again, this is a real scandal.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Our troops will be replacing a British light artillery unit in Bosnia. 
Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
This budget demonstrates that Canada continues to be a generous and fair country.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Students who travel to university are dependent on fuel. 
It is a federal and a provincial responsibility. 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
``Where is that budget?'', 
And he is right. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the opposition leader for his question. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
We will look into it and I will refer back.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
The Prime Minister himself is involved in it. 
Fugere and Champagne have a long history of delivering cash. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member is making an accusation. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, let us just go through a few facts. 
Now these are the facts and they speak for themselves. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
If she were serious she would have given us notice. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister is asking for facts. 
Surely he must have a few. 
I imagine that there were facts for there to have been investigations.  
We want a clear picture.  
Let us make it clear, as she says.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Does this not warrant an inquiry? 
When is she going to wake up?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let us review some of the facts. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I categorically reject the allegation made by the hon. member. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
If this is the case, he is wrong, in my opinion.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Now it is hinting, no, no, there will be more money.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We have exceeded that.  
We have doubled that already. 
Since then we have invested over $14 billion.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, we talked cash this morning and we will talk cash again. 
The health care system does need change.  
Federal cash is the ticket of admission to participating in those changes. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
The provinces recognize it is not just a matter of money.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, there are a few basics the minister should keep in mind. 
My question is for the Minister for International Trade. 
Why is his department even dealing with these individuals? 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the EDC takes its full responsibility. 
It has its way of dealing with Canadian companies that is fair and equitable.  
Members have heard the question. 
I think we should hear the answer.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
It is doing a great job.  
I will look into the particular file which the opposition party- 
The hon. member for Calgary-Nose Hill.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
He is under RCMP investigation for unregistered lobbying. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
I will look into it and report back to the House. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a news flash for the government. 
We are going to keep asking these questions until we get answers.  
Boy, were these meetings ever successful. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
How does the minister explain this difference of 70 jobs and $300,000?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The lists may change with a specific request made. 
The 10,000 pages that we presented to parliament last week are there. 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Again, let us be clear. 
There were no master lists.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Now he goes to international trade and who shows up? 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I reject the allegations of the member. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let us make it clear. 
We should be careful, this is not the minister.  
Canadians deserve better information than this.  
Frankly, this was the first time I heard of the company called Earth Canada. 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Can the minister say otherwise?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Second, the auditor general will look at all of the grants and contributions. 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, really, the answers are incredible.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
He goes to international trade and guess who shows up? 
Rene Fugere and Gilles Champagne. 
His fingerprints are all over this scandal.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
We will look into it again, but they look completely wrong again. 
They are just trying to move dirt around. 
That is what they like to do. 
We lead them in the country, Mr. Speaker- 
The rhetoric is starting to rank up a bit. 
The hon. member for Dewdney-Alouette.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Rene Fugere is under RCMP investigation. 
Gilles Champagne is a two-time political appointee. 
He set up an illegal trust fund. 
How can he possibly explain this scandal?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
At this point, there are only 75 to 80 jobs left.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have commented on this particular project a number of times. 
It will continue to create jobs in Shawinigan.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
I will look into it very carefully.  
I can tell the House that EDC is doing a very fine- 
The Hon. Minister for International Trade.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
Mr. Speaker, let us be very clear. 
That is the reality.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we need the binder boy to move from over there to here.  
I would prefer that we address each other by titles.  
Mr. Speaker, Canadians have a right to know. 
Why are the taxpayers funding deals for the friends of the Prime Minister?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I reject the allegations of the hon. member. 
These innuendoes are not acceptable in the House. 
I will look into it with our responsible people at EDC.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
We know it is a clever ruse and that it is a crafty strategy. 
It is truly a Trojan horse for the privatization of health care.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I understand that the legislation will be tabled later today. 
It has not yet been released publicly. 
I have already expressed real concern about many aspects of this proposed policy. 
I raised serious questions with the minister of health of Alberta.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have already made the point. 
It takes more than just money. 
It takes the additional money. 
It takes planning, ideas and constructive change.  
Will the NDP stop helping Mike Harris? 
We will never accept two-tiered medicine in this country.  
DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS AND NORTHERN DEVELOPMENT 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I can confirm that indeed we are not.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
VOLUNTARY CHALLENGE AND REGISTRY PROGRAM 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
That program now includes 900 businesses across the country.  
It is now entirely under private leadership.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
The hon. member for Calgary-Nose Hill.  
We have a money losing company. 
In fact just last year it lost nearly $2 million. 
The man supposedly in charge of all this pleads ignorance. 
Maybe this is the question- 
The hon. secretary of state.  
Mr. Speaker, maybe I could help the opposition.  
However, there is an agency called Canada Economic Development, of which I am in charge. 
We were involved with a corporation called Earth Canada. 
We will keep being involved in such corporations- 
The hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean.  
MINISTER FOR INTERNATIONAL TRADE 
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
But we see nothing but disaster and scandal in his wake.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
I can also assure the House that the Export- 
Members will please listen to the response. 
The hon. Minister for International Trade.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Those same conditions exist in numerous first nation communities.  
How long do aboriginal people have to wait before the government does something? 
How many must die?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We are doing the best we can. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let me make it clear. 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
ALLOTTED DAY-HEALTH CARE 
The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the amendment.  
Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
I do not quite understand this crisis. 
We have to commit to do things differently. 
The federal government must set an example. 
The pointing of fingers in all levels of government should stop. 
It is a huge barrier to the ultimate sustainability of the the system. 
Hopefully the CIHR will do that. 
This nation needs a plan. 
We have to do things differently. 
Removing scatter rugs from the homes of seniors would dramatically prevent broken hips. 
We have to deal with the air quality.  
We know user fees do not work. 
Private hospitals cost more money to society. 
There is absolute mismanagement or misplanning. 
Doing it in the opposite order creates a crisis.  
We must be smarter. 
We have to talk about real outcomes in health care. 
How much money we spend is no longer good enough. 
This is not good spending of health care dollars. 
Canadians want it to be spent properly. 
They do not want us throwing money at things if it is not.  
This is not co-operation. 
That is not in keeping with the social union framework agreement. 
I am hugely enthusiastic and optimistic. 
Let New Brunswick speak about its level of care. 
Let Edmonton bring its knowledge on the flu epidemic. 
Let B.C. bring its prevention knowledge.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
We have a serious problem. 
As the member knows we have an aging population. 
How will this damage the public system?  
I have another concern about the private system. 
My experience is with the tiny ones that exist in Toronto. 
What happens after hours in private hospitals? 
Who looks after the complications? 
The patients go straight back into the public system with even less accountability.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I listened to my colleague carefully. 
I do not agree that cash transfers without accountability is the answer at all. 
It is the same taxpayer. 
I am hugely worried. 
He had more than the ability to absorb that. 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
It is the most important issue affecting Canadians today. 
We must recognize that we have a problem. 
I will just go through them for the House. 
It is because we do not have any beds. 
The next day we had a disaster. 
A bus full of children was hit by a logging truck. 
Only two of them were critically injured. 
Let us imagine if more were injured. 
We would have been in a situation that I do not even want to comprehend.  
I would like to speak to the myth of universality. 
Quebec has not signed on. 
People do not have access to home care. 
They do not have access to dental services. 
This means the tax base declines substantially. 
As our demand goes up, our tax base goes down. 
The discrepancy between supply and demand will widen. 
Let us talk about facts and not rhetoric. 
Nothing could be further from the truth.  
The question is how do we do it. 
Therefore, how do we get the money?  
The government likes to trot out and say that it is defending the status quo. 
A private system must be completely separate from the public. 
Where will they come from? 
They will not materialize overnight. 
It is crushing for the patient. 
It should never ever happen in this country but it does.  
We must talk about specific solutions to deal with this problem. 
We cannot hide behind the rhetoric any longer.  
Why do we not allow that to happen? 
I ask members from all sides to please put aside the rhetoric. 
It is not difficult to do and it can be done.  
It is not and never was designed to be all things to all people. 
The cold, hard reality is that we do not have it.  
It is true that there are some patients who occupy acute care beds. 
It is true that the geriatric population puts a great strain on the system. 
That is true if it is done properly. 
Both are ill but she is forced to deal with this. 
That needs to be cut down. 
We need to look at that.  
We need to look at experiences in other countries. 
We also need to look at prevention. 
It is a practical and pragmatic approach. 
Some of these children were on the lowest socioeconomic rung in our society. 
It is a model that can be used all across this country.  
I have worked in jails, both as a guard and as a physician. 
This is irreversible brain damage. 
The average IQ of these people is 67. 
Their cognitive functions are impaired and their learning functions are impaired. 
They have emotional difficulties and cannot function properly in school. 
Many, unfortunately, turn to crime. 
They are often in home situations that are less than desirable. 
They should use existing resources to employ the head start program. 
The House has adopted it, supported it and passed it. 
They should do it for our children and do it now. 
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
For example, we can have a national health information system. 
We can re-orient our practice guidelines.  
Mr. Speaker, first of all we support access of patients to health care.  
The member mentioned that the minister talked about meaningful change. 
He said we want to talk about reform, ideas, vision, planning. 
I will put it in a nutshell. 
Those are the facts and that is where the squeeze exists.  
We have to put patients first. 
Will we begrudge that? 
That is not the issue. 
All of us would support that to the end of our days.  
Surely there is a middle ground. 
I have articulated it. 
We want to make sure that patients get health care. 
I have shown them the way.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's remarks; it was a very good speech. 
The government has had seven years to do it. 
The other point is the minister of HRDC is receiving $200 million in discretionary funding.  
We would all be very interested in knowing the answers.  
That the government has waited seven years is absolutely outrageous. 
That is a crying shame.  
My hon. colleague has worked with me on the issue of organ donation. 
What has the government done? 
It has done nothing on this issue. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
When she rang for help no one came. 
Finally her family said enough of this. 
Provinces simply do not have the money. 
I would like the hon. member to comment on the actual funding part of it.  
That is the cold-hearted reality.  
That is the minimum obligation. 
We will continue to fight the fight to ensure that happens.  
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
We need an integrated health care system.  
As was mentioned by my colleague, the Minister of Health, two elements are essential. 
We all agree on the need to resolve those urgent concerns. 
Now we must take action. 
We need a plan to implement these changes.  
Different models were proposed. 
We will not succeed in alleviating the pressure on the emergency rooms.  
In this respect, home care is one solution among others.  
Let us talk about funding. 
It was the most important one-time investment ever made by this government. 
Status quo is not an option.  
I repeat that the answer is not simply to increase funding. 
The federal government, the provinces and the territories must work together. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the NDP member for his question.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask my colleague a question and make a comment.  
This is what Canadians want to avoid. 
There is nothing more important than health. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Acadie-Bathurst for his question. 
This is what is missing now. 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
Why am I taking part in this debate on the issue of transfers? 
These are: public administration, comprehensiveness, universality, portability and accessibility.  
Quality of care is not merely a matter of funding. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
I have some more percentages. 
She had to go to Augusta in the United States for her treatments. 
Here in Canada we are not even capable of treating our own citizens. 
I would like to know where the member stands on this.  
Mr. Guy St-Julien:
Quebec always stood to gain.  
There was none for the hon. member's sister-in-law. 
The money was dormant in Toronto and people were not receiving the treatments they need. 
This was dereliction of duty on the part of the separatist government in Quebec. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Quebec is not the only one in that situation.  
Mr. Guy St-Julien:
That is what Mr. Landry said yesterday.  
The hon. member has referred to trust funds. 
One has to remember the interest. 
Let us not just talk about trusts. 
Let us talk about the region of Abitibi-Temiscamingue. 
In part, the article reads as follows: 
Solutions must be sought together. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Depending on which party we represent, we have a different reading of the situation. 
Obviously, this view does not agree with that of the Liberal Party. 
I would qualify this. 
We know that public finances are in very, very good shape in Canada. 
With such a large surplus, this government could have committed a much larger amount. 
The result is increasing pressure on demand. 
I will go into this a bit later on.  
The network's financial situation must also be rectified and its functioning improved. 
We agree on that. 
Since 1994, the Government of Quebec has taken major steps to balance the budget.  
The shift to ambulatory care means moving some medical procedures out of hospitals. 
The average hospital stay needs to be shortened. 
We are faced with dealing with new technology. 
There were many children born at a certain time in our history. 
The population of Quebec is ageing at an amazing rate. 
This must be addressed. 
I will explain the implications of this.  
Of these, 56% were age 75 and older. 
The first baby boomers have already reached that age. 
We must be able to respond to this increase.  
The same is true in cardiology. 
Needs are increasing, particularly from age 50 on. 
More coronary bypasses are being performed on seniors. 
She really does not know what is going on. 
Some people require more services in their community.  
We must take a new tack in dealing with this.  
I do not think anyone is acting in bad faith. 
The Canada social transfer was higher in 1993 than it is today. 
We hear that some people feel exhausted and belittled. 
I spoke about our ageing population. 
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate my colleague from Quebec for her eloquence. 
I thought her speech was just brilliant. 
I ask my colleague to make a brief comment on that.  
The Government of Quebec made that investment. 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
The provinces are being given a difficult choice. 
This is terrible and has got to stop. 
It is not up to the federal government to take over from the provinces.  
It has been cutting it back. 
It can meet the needs of its people. 
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Broadview-Greenwood.  
It does not buy very much today.  
The fact is that money is still sitting there. 
I have looked through the pages of the Ontario government expenditures. 
What have I discovered? 
The federal government put the money in a trust account. 
Ontario took $755 million out of the trust account. 
How much new money did it spend on health care? 
When thinking of a trust account, what is the concept of trust? 
What did the province of Ontario do? 
We talk about accountability in government. 
This is the problem with this whole debate. 
This is a clear example. 
Is that not an amazing thing. 
What did the province of Ontario do with this money? 
I do not know.  
Perhaps that is what the Ontario government did with it. 
We know that it has done all kinds of other spending. 
It did not spend it on the sick. 
I do not know what the province spent it on. 
We are not going to give the province any more money. 
Do not tell me it is about more money.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
There is no question.  
What did the government do with that money? 
It used it to create a surplus. 
It sounds an awful lot like the member's version of Mike Harris.  
What does he have to say about that?  
Give us more money''.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, now I have seen it all in this House.  
This has meant a shortfall of $30.5 billion for all the provinces since 1993. 
It is $11.1 billion in Quebec and $10.5 billion in Ontario.  
I am not ashamed at all. 
I will defend the taxpayers of the province of Quebec if I have to. 
The finance minister for Quebec is saying ``It is not about money. 
It is not about spending money. 
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
Do you have another idea over there?  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
The member for Durham talked about this the other day. 
We should be talking about re-engineering the health care system. 
I have not heard one speech in the House today which mentioned health prevention. 
I will give a couple of specific examples. 
The best doctors in our country appeared before us. 
It is not about that.  
What about the whole realm of alternative medicine? 
What about mental health? 
When will we talk not only about sending cheques here or sending billions there? 
We all have a part to play. 
I do not think we are talking about it enough in the House. 
All we want to talk about is sending cheques here and there. 
Where are the creative ideas on fixing the health care system? 
To quote my colleague from Durham, we should be re-engineering the system. 
We have heard the notion of Premier Klein wanting to privatize the system. 
That is one of our trademarks as a nation.  
NDP members would give blank cheques to Premier Harris and let- 
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
That is what the motion says. 
The NDP did not even put an amount on it. 
It did not put an amount on what it would give. 
I would not give my dear friend Brian Tobin a blank cheque.  
Let us stop talking about money and start talking about creative ideas. 
What is wrong with that?  
It is your fault.  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
I think the Minister of Health has it right. 
This is not a partisan issue. 
Let us get into the prevention business. 
Anybody can write a cheque.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Unfortunately, the time for questions and comments has expired.  
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will pleased say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House divided on the amendment, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the amendment lost.  
The next question is on the main motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the motion lost.  
SUPPLEMENTARY ESTIMATES (B), 1999-2000 
REFERENCE TO STANDING COMMITTEES 
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
He was born in 1910 in Vancouver. 
He said of course not, that is ridiculous.  
In the United Kingdom efforts are being made to release data after 100 years.  
Too often we forget the importance of our history. 
One could make the argument that this country is losing touch with its past. 
It contributes collectively to our historical understanding as a nation.  
This motion is limited in its scope. 
Again the scope is limited. 
It only deals with that census. 
I look forward to the debate which will ensue. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
I hope he was.  
That is in the Income Tax Act. 
This was 100% a backbench initiative. 
However this is before the House. 
It will fix that problem immediately. 
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
There is no man more partisan, no Orangeman more orange than him. 
He has no respect for this principle.  
He is arrogant, indeed, and a resolutely orange Orangemen. 
He has, unfortunately, been dead for quite some time.  
My colleague's initiative shows an obvious interest in history. 
I am interested in butterflies. 
On the other hand, I have a keen interest in genealogy. 
I know mine, I know Quebec's history. 
Quebecers, especially those sitting here, know their history very well. 
They know about their past, including the history of Acadia. 
We have a colleague here who comes from there. 
There is information there.  
I have been in Saskatchewan to visit my friend the member for Regina-Qu'Appelle. 
This is the sort of information that could interest me.  
I in fact stopped in Qu'Appelle. 
They asked me what I was doing there. 
It was the French name Qu'Appelle that made me wonder. 
I was called to Qu'Appelle, a cappella, because Qu'Appelle called. 
I hope you understand. 
I am not sure I understand myself, but I follow what I am saying.  
All that to say that we can laugh here too. 
We can take this motion with a hint of humour.  
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
I appreciate the intent of this motion. 
However, people do not give out their personal information lightly. 
They have a pre-eminent concern about confidentiality.  
We in the NDP take their concerns very seriously.  
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Upon initial consideration, supporting this motion may seem to be quite a simple decision.  
We have two competing interests that present a difficult case for the House. 
It is very involved and it can also make for quite a personal experience.  
Why do they answer these intrusive questions? 
The goal was not to keep the information from historians.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Is there unanimous consent to permit the hon. member to divide his time?  
We have to look at the facts. 
Virtually all the people affected by this census will be dead. 
Why should it be released? 
It is very important from an historical perspective. 
By understanding our past, we get an important indication and view into our future.  
If we look at the experiences of other countries we find it is very interesting. 
Do we hear that from other democracies or other western nations? 
That information should be made public to all who want to have access to it.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
I heard during debate that we are in a dilemma. 
What do you guys know about democracy?  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:
Would the member just be quiet please out of respect for democracy? 
He cannot disturb me in the ultimate analysis.  
I did not know this motion would be debated. 
What is really at stake here is that sense of public trust. 
The member from the Reform Party is laughing at public trust. 
I am really saddened, but he will not distract me. 
That is the essence of confidentiality. 
He who cannot live with confidentiality I challenge. 
How can we trust that particular person?  
In conclusion I say I hope we do not support this motion. 
It would be a breach of public trust. 
It would be a breach of our promise. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP) moved: 
Stanley Knowles, the parliamentarian and the man, goes beyond partisan views. 
I wanted us as Canadians and as parliamentarians to recognize Stanley Knowles. 
The U.S. recognizes numerous days. 
I think as Canadians we fail to do that. 
We fail to take pride in our country. 
As a result we see some of the problems we are in today. 
Without question Stanley Knowles is a legendary Canadian. 
We welcome the beginning of a hospital insurance plan. 
He went on to say: 
Here we are, another 42 years later. 
Does it not sound familiar? 
I think Stanley Knowles definitely speaks to us even today. 
As well I will take this opportunity to comment that Stanley Knowles also said: 
Stanley Knowles was on a lifelong mission. 
Stanley's political career with the CCF began in 1934. 
According to historian Susan Mann he had to change laws rather than souls. 
Stanley Knowles went out to preach from a different house, the House of Commons. 
He ran for parliament in 1935 and again in 1940. 
Stanley succeeded the late J. S. Woodsworth. 
His integrity was never at question. 
In 1957 John Diefenbaker offered Stanley the Speakership. 
That was a parliamentarian.  
He also fought for the poor, for children, for women and for veterans.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
Let me speak about Stanley Knowles. 
I then represented Winnipeg North. 
I inherited with great pride the tradition that Mr. Knowles left. 
He reminded me of the first speech he gave when he was in California. 
It was about the Philippines, my country of birth. 
He was a vivid and caring person. 
He said that debate gives testimony to democracy and I agree. 
It was an honour for me to be with the members of his family.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Mr. Knowles was born on June 18, 1908. 
As you know, Mr. Speaker, I am a relatively new Canadian. 
My family and I have been in Canada less than 10 years. 
He was a politician who was dedicated to representing the people who elected him. 
He delivered his maiden speech to the House on February 3, 1943. 
That alone can be considered a remarkable feat. 
The people of Winnipeg had a great deal of confidence in their MP.  
The NDP member for Churchill should be commended. 
Mr. Knowles was a western populist. 
This is so undemocratic that it is anti-democratic. 
It is almost a dictatorship.  
The Liberals have been in power for almost seven years. 
It took Mulroney nine years to stifle democracy 66 times. 
Stanley Knowles is turning over in his grave, I am sure. 
The Liberals have learned nothing from Stanley Knowles.  
We should have a Stanley Knowles day. 
He championed the rights of the people. 
He left his mark on this place. 
It is important for future generations to know that such a man existed.  
It is a good time to establish this day, a day of remembrance and education.  
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Why are they not commemorated, despite their accomplishments? 
The figures tell the tale: he was elected 13 times to the House of Commons.  
In Winnipeg, a school and a park are named after him.  
Stanley Knowles was also made an officer of the Order of Canada in 1985.  
Stanley Knowles made a remarkable contribution to Canadian democracy. 
His exceptional contribution was recognized by Canadians and they are grateful to him.  
It would not add anything to the political stature of the man.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
I would also like to congratulate the hon. member for Churchill for introducing this motion. 
He worked particularly hard for the most vulnerable members of society.  
I would like to thank my hon. colleague from Churchill for introducing this motion. 
Mr. Knowles could understand and appreciate the struggles of everyday people. 
Mr. Knowles fought for employee pension rights. 
He fought for better pensions for our seniors. 
I am sure Mr. Knowles is spinning in his grave.  
But this is only conjecture.  
That is nothing to sneeze at.  
His message never seemed to change over the years. 
He continued to preach his social gospel.  
Another storm could wipe them out leaving our fishermen to fend for themselves.  
These fishermen need these wharfs for their livelihood. 
Their communities need these wharfs because they provide an economic boost to their local economies. 
There is no question of the tremendous accomplishments of Mr. Stanley Knowles. 
He has been recognized on many occasions for his commitment to the Canadian people. 
He was awarded the Order of Canada in 1984. 
Stanley Knowles has a special place in Canadian history. 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
I will now say a few words in tribute to Mr. Knowles as well. 
For instance, I did a very cursory check at the Library before coming here. 
I believe everyone knows Knowlton Nash. 
Someone from western Canada may wish to honour Peter Pocklington, or Margaret Atwood. 
They were all born on the same day but in different years. 
The final example would be January 26, where we have Roger Landry.  
Roger Landry has just retired as a journalist for La Presse . 
They were all born the same day.  
And I did not name everybody.  
We might want to consider other options, and we have been thinking about it. 
Perhaps this suggestion should be made to the House.  
We are not against the idea of celebrate the life of Stanley Knowles. 
It is the way suggested here that is inappropriate. 
For example, we have before us three similar measures.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
I thank them for the support.  
I want to clarify a couple of areas. 
My colleague who just preceded me indicated we could run out of days. 
I do not think that is the real problem.  
There may be others as well.  
There is no question there are other ways of recognition. 
St. Jean Baptiste Day has been on the calendar for heaven knows how long. 
We do not recognize it. 
I was very disappointed that the motion was not made votable. 
I certainly intend to pursue them in the future.  
The time provided for the consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
(The House adjourned at 8 p.m.)
