EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 82 
Monday, April 10, 2000 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
The House resumed from March 2 consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Ellis stated in his letter: 
This is ridiculous in view of the freedom of information act.  
Another constituent wrote to me, who said: 
I would like to voice my objection to this unfortunate decision.  
Strong families make strong communities. 
Stronger communities make stronger nations. 
Many years ago only one member of the family worked. 
All of these constraints are weakening the family institution.  
There is a significant demand for these services. 
We are still waiting for something to be done by the government.  
In conclusion, the panel will report to the minister by the end of May 2000. 
Hopefully the motion we are debating today will spur the minister to take action.  
By the way, I had written earlier to the industry minister. 
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
They were dismayed to find out that this was not to be the case.  
This is certainly not the case. 
There is also a time limitation on this access. 
Even when the person is deceased, the provisions are still in effect. 
Much of this value is contained in various pieces of legislation. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Others will be more hesitant to divulge their personal information. 
Why do they answer these intrusive questions? 
What puts their minds at ease in divulging this information? 
Here is our dilemma. 
The interesting part is no one is sure why this promise was made. 
Archival records or not, it remains unclear why these privacy provisions are in existence.  
It is true that our world has changed dramatically since 1901. 
We have cultural values. 
In so doing we perpetuate and strengthen Canadian sovereignty.  
In doing so we would be accommodating ourselves as well. 
I offer my support for the motion brought forward by the member for Calgary Southeast.  
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Canadian Alliance):
I congratulate my colleague for bringing the motion forward.  
A very interesting thing is happening in current society. 
This data is from the 1911 census. 
Some minds figured out that is not going to happen. 
It all changed because of a regulation in 1906. 
That is the way the regulations read at the time. 
What do some other western democracies do with their census data? 
It is important to make a comparison. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to take part in the debate. 
I intend to be very brief in my remarks. 
I concur with the motion that is before the House this morning. 
My uncle's book traced the history since then. 
I will support the motion when we vote on it. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
We are taking a look at exploring and reviewing the options. 
The five member panel is comprised of:
There is also no time limitation on this access. 
Even when the person is deceased, the provisions are still in effect. 
It is after all the law.  
Census information is used for a multiplicity of purposes, as I have noted. 
We have a great system. 
That is our job, not only as parliamentarians but also as Canadians.  
This must never be taken lightly. 
I know that members in the House do not.  
I recommend that we let the process take its course. 
Mr. John Cannis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
This is an important issue. 
This is the information we have gathered. 
This is our opinion and this is our view''. 
The date the panel will report back is May 31, 2000. 
My Liberal colleague talked about the members of the panel, who are prominent Canadians. 
These prominent Canadians reflect how seriously the government is taking this issue. 
These individuals will do what is right. 
It will not only be these five members doing the work. 
This is a complicated issue. 
People ask where historical census records are available. 
Local libraries can request census microfilms through interlibrary exchange programs.  
This is an issue which the average Canadian often does not understand. 
The government has taken the bull by the horns. 
It has undertaken an initiative to move forward positively. 
His heart is where it should be. 
The Minister of Industry and the government recognize the importance of historical records. 
We have also taken the opportunity to point out our concern. 
There are privacy concerns. 
By the end of May we will be in a position to respond properly.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
MODERNIZATION OF BENEFITS AND OBLIGATIONS ACT 
BILL C-23-TIME ALLOCATION MOTION 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.) moved: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I declare the motion agreed to.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Canadian Alliance):
It is getting to be a habit. 
It is all the time.  
Most of my constituents are upset with the content of the bill. 
It sounds very familiar.  
Public pressure finally got to her. 
Canadians will not be fooled by that.  
Lone parent families are becoming more numerous. 
I do not need to exaggerate. 
Not everybody will agree with the decisions, but sometimes it is right to say no.  
That is not tolerance or compassion. 
That is chaos and everybody in society suffers as a result.  
That is not what we are seeing with Bill C-23.  
Toronto writer R. M. Vaughan is quoted as saying: 
There are many quotes which could verify that.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
I have listened to the comments of members opposite. 
We know that courts have ruled on this matter. 
It makes no difference. 
We are talking about fairness, compassion and equal treatment.  
This bill strikes a balance.  
Quite frankly, this defies common sense.  
Common law relationships are not new. 
Let us put that to rest once and for all.  
They raise all kinds of outrageous scenarios, which is beneath them to do so. 
Let us put that issue to rest as well.  
On the contrary, this is simply not true. 
This is not a cost issue for the government.  
We in the government are doing the same by bringing forward Bill C-23.  
Canadians respect the charter. 
Canadians have a great love for the charter. 
Because the charter defines us as a people.  
Not so long ago Mr. Stockwell Day was in Ontario. 
Why do we do that? 
Because it is the Canadian thing to do.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
It was tabled in the House on February 11 this year.  
This legislation levels the playing field with respect to fiscal rights and obligations. 
That definition is one that has been consistently accepted throughout the country for many years. 
It is one the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada fully embraces and supports.  
Rather than omit it from the bill, the government decided to include it. 
We accept and support that move.  
The legislation speaks to benefits and obligations. 
Criteria still have to be met and there are obligations attached.  
The hon. member opposite spoke of the financial implications. 
This legislation is not meant to be judgmental in that way. 
The legislation is consistent with the decision of the supreme court. 
Many have expressed reservations and many continue to struggle with the issue of homosexuality. 
The direction has clearly been blazed.  
This is not the only criteria.  
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Canadian Alliance):
However, insidious pressures were being placed on family life. 
Both government and Canadians in general went on a huge spending spree. 
This in itself was yet another economic pressure on Canadian family life. 
Some of my school chums' families started to disintegrate. 
By the mid-1960s we were in the midst of a sexual revolution. 
Some of them wanted even more. 
They wanted vengeance and retribution. 
The things that had been considered improper went looking for a desperate legitimacy.  
This brings me to the year 2000. 
This sends a destructive message to all our children. 
What a terrible message to send to our children. 
How will the future of our country be influenced by this?  
They simply change the law in the name of equality. 
We cannot legislate equality any more than we can legislate morality. 
What are the youth of today saying? 
Who are these 1995 young people? 
This is exactly what is happening with Bill C-23.  
I look at our nation today and weep. 
I weep for the hurting children who do not really know their parents. 
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Eglinton-Lawrence, Lib.):
People want to get their views on the record. 
I underscore that this has been an issue of economic dependency. 
This is, after all, a charged environment. 
For me that is an important and significant vacuum in this legislation. 
We should include all those who are not properly dealt with by legislation.  
I am not really. 
I am one of those children of the sixties. 
However, there is one other element that people have raised. 
No, I do not think anybody is. 
There are overtones of religious bias. 
There is bias in everything.  
What dignity is at stake? 
What discrimination is so glaring that it needs my immediate and total attention? 
I would willingly give it.  
However, let us do that for every single relationship. 
Let us not restrict it by sexuality. 
From there we can extrapolate all the ills that we will.  
Their response was that the bill was not about economic dependency. 
My tolerance and my willingness to address the issue were awakened. 
What are the social benefits of any type of union?  
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Canadian Alliance):
I will focus on just a few ideas.  
Those words were from the Liberal member for Wentworth-Burlington. 
They ring pretty hollow today. 
-the Supreme Court of Canada decided the case of Egan and Nesbit. 
That slippery slope has operated quite well.  
That is what they are doing with the introduction of Bill C-23.  
It is all very disingenuous. 
It deserves to be guarded, not only protected but affirmed.  
The institution of marriage has brought great benefits to society. 
Our Statistics Canada studies demonstrate this point. 
Why does marriage bring these benefits? 
This is of great benefit to society.  
It would be foolish to undermine the uniqueness of the marriage relationship. 
It is much more than that. 
The institution of marriage is not something to be toyed with. 
We would be killing the goose that lays the golden egg.  
That optimism is good and needs to be encouraged.  
This is something to be welcomed and encouraged. 
The children in such relationships benefit and society in turn benefits.  
The Canadian Alliance offers dollars and choice for parents. 
We would use the notwithstanding clause to protect kids. 
We propose shared parenting family law to fix that. 
I could go on from there.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Canadian Alliance):
In other words what we have are negative arguments in opposition to the opposition. 
What are its objectives? 
How can it possibly benefit society?  
What is the government trying to prove?  
These relationships have been essentially prescribed- 
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member, but it is almost 2 o'clock. 
I wanted to make sure that I left you with a good chunk of time. 
You still have a bit over eight minutes in your speech. 
You will have the floor when we come back to Government Orders.  
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Canadian Alliance):
What does it mean to volunteer? 
We are beginning a new millennium. 
Everyone is in a hurry to get things done, with less free time to give.  
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Each year 63,000 people die from the disease. 
His passing was a terribly difficult time for my family, and we miss him terribly.  
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
A vibrant militia is a vital part of modern armed forces. 
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
Over the years, volunteers have focused incredible energy for the health of their communities. 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Canadian Alliance):
They were advancing on unconquerable Vimy. 
The goal was now Canada's turn. 
Their spirit lives on to this day.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Fredericton, Lib.):
These girls are the best in the world.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Is there any more true gift that we can offer than our time? 
Thanks to you from the bottom of our hearts.  
CANADIAN WOMEN'S HOCKEY 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the gold medal was on the line. 
The American team was leading 2-0 after two periods. 
They were down but not out.  
This was Canada's 30th consecutive win in the world championships. 
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Canadian Alliance):
But Canada's winning ways did not end there.  
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
when eagles circle oppenheimer park 
for the fierce and piercing vision for justice in our souls 
the eagles bestow a blessing on our lives 
but with these thousand crosses 
planted in oppenheimer park today 
our hearts shed bitter tears 
these thousand crosses are symbols 
of the social apartheid in our culture 
the segregation of those who deserve to live 
and those who are abandoned to die 
a social curse on the lives of the poorest of the poor 
on the downtown eastside 
these thousand crosses announce an assault on our community 
these thousand crosses announce a deprivation of possibility 
for those of us who mourn here 
the mothers and fathers- 
The hon. member for Trois-Rivieres.  
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
There is one single exception, Quebecers' national day. 
The hon. member for Vancouver Quadra.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
And that is not all. 
Congratulations to three remarkable teams.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
This year the owner is being charged $2,336 for the same service.  
I think the fishing industry would- 
The hon. member for Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore.  
SACKVILLE RIVER'S ASSOCIATION 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
Of course that begs the question, what did the money go for? 
Who knows what the grant was for? 
Nobody knows where that money went.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
I am happy that the Reform Party has finally discovered the questions that were asked.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, the 100 pages of documents have not cleared up the crisis. 
The money is still missing and the minister knows it.  
Canadians deserve an answer and to know where in the world the money is. 
They refuse to answer how the money was spent.  
Regardless of 100 pages of documents, the answer has still not come forward. 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the documents included exactly where the expenditures went.  
MILLENNIUM BUREAU OF CANADA 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Canadian Alliance):
With the millennium bureau less than 1% of the grants have been audited. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
She should get up and express an apology- 
The hon. member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
We will continue to do so. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Altogether 75,000 pages of information have been released.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, government transparency is at stake here.  
We know that Option Canada is directly connected to the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
In one case we have been waiting for 195 days and in the other 225.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
It is a book by Rene Levesque.  
What kind of an answer is that anyway?  
How can the minister responsible for the Privy Council behave in such a way?  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health.  
Then he told parliament that Bill 11 should be withdrawn. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Those things could have been seen in the newspaper or on television for that matter.  
They want answers and we want answers. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Rene Fugere acts as a lobbyist and does not register himself. 
Mr. Riopelle acts as a lobbyist and does not register his clients. 
Why the double standard? 
Why are friends of the Prime Minister somehow considered to be above the law?  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is a ridiculous question. 
It is as simple as that. 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the minister that looks after lobbyists.  
The government can always find new ways to spend taxpayers' money. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, that is simply not the case. 
It pays member dues to that organization.  
Why is the government allowing this to continue?  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is a national technology association. 
There are many such associations. 
Industry Canada obtains useful information by being a member of the association. 
It derives information that is used for a variety of practical purposes. 
The member should do his research and he would understand it.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
But Option Canada came under Operation Unity, which reported to PCO, and therefore to him.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the answer is exactly the same as it was two years ago.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, what is 78? 
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We are doing our best to keep up.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Canadian Alliance):
I suggest the minister might want to do that too. 
HRDC audits made public so far have shown a department in shocking disarray. 
Why is she refusing to comply?  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is no refusal to comply.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
She is telling us a lot of nonsense.  
Who has pocketed the $4.8 million?  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Canadian Alliance):
The minister, therefore, has an obligation to abide by it. 
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, it is really quite simple. 
What is the minister trying to hide?  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
What are we to understand from his remarks?  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the Environment.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Until that happens we will continue to co-operate wherever we can with- 
The hon. member for Calgary Southeast.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):
I have a very simple question for the revenue minister. 
Will he allow the RCMP to obtain access to the CINAR documents?  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):
This contradicts what the minister has just said. 
It is not a question of discretionary power.  
It is not a question of discretion. 
Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
When will the government finally ratify the Kyoto accord? 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
However, we fully intend to put in place our plans to implement the Kyoto agreement. 
The important thing is not ratification. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
If necessary, and as appropriate, we will appoint a successor.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister's friends are looking shadier and shadier.  
All of them seem to be under investigation at some point. 
My question is for the minister responsible for the ethics commissioner. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
This is simply not the case. 
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Last week she tabled the new Immigration Act. 
Could the minister clarify the matter for us?  
Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Further, it is our intention to see the family class expanded. 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance):
Alberta's first elected senator was appointed 10 years ago. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
In the meantime the Prime Minister is following the existing constitution.  
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
The hon. member for Calgary Northeast.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):
How many Canadian troops will be committed and how long will they be committed for?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
We will certainly look at the risk assessment. 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Agriculture. 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
The hon. member refers to legislation in the European Union. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Instead the minister chose to refer it to the United Nations.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
That was not received. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
What happened to the $5 million she gave to Option Canada? 
Where is the money?  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
My question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. 
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
This is the type of co-operation we need.  
We have eight agreements in principle. 
We are halfway there. 
We are continuing the hard work. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member talks about a registry system that does not work. 
We are at work making Canada safe for all Canadians.

Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions today.  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
They request the withdrawal of Bill C-23.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, today I am tabling several petitions.  
The first two petitions are with regard to the mail route couriers. 
Some would like the right to form a union and bargain collectively. 
It is my pleasure to table these petitions today.  
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, Question No. 72 will be answered today. 
Question No. 72- Mr. Leon E. Benoit 
Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
There are two tribal councils in the treaty six area of Alberta. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
MODERNIZATION OF BENEFITS AND OBLIGATIONS ACT 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Canadian Alliance):
Now we are more civilized. 
Marriage is the foundation on which civil society rests. 
Society extends certain benefits to strengthen and support the institution. 
That is not just my personal opinion. 
My wife and I do not claim we are homosexuals. 
Why should homosexuals pretend that they form a family?'' 
They told it to us over and over and over again. 
Now times have changed and four years have passed. 
This is the Liberal way. 
This has got to stop. 
It is a question of common sense.  
It would have been considered hilarious. 
Yet here we are. 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
The fact is that I have been married to the same man for 37 years. 
I now have grandchildren. 
We are all a family.  
We have been there and done that.  
Families in Canada come in many different shapes and sizes these days. 
Families can be people looking after elderly parents. 
They can be brothers and sisters living together. 
Families are not necessarily mothers and fathers. 
That is what the bill is about. 
The bill is about recognizing that not every family is the same.  
I can put it no other way.  
It is a fact of life. 
It is hardly an attitude of inclusiveness toward our fellow Canadians.  
The bill says nothing about sex. 
It talks about committed, long term relationships. 
As I said earlier, one-third of all marriages ends in divorce. 
The fact is that we as a society have to deal with that. 
It does not deal with our sense of morality. 
It deals with legal benefits and legal obligations. 
They are quite entitled to feel however they want about mine. 
The legislation has nothing to do with that. 
I do not think any of us has the right to do that. 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):
There must be something in it.  
I used the word committed. 
Unfortunately, marriages break down far too often, in this country and all around the world. 
Children need our assistance. 
Therefore, we need to nurture that environment. 
I do not believe that obligation has changed in any way.  
However, it is only in the preamble of the bill. 
She has not asked that every statute be changed. 
The Minister of Justice said no. 
The Liberal government said no. 
Does this mean that conjugal relationships of any kind are now superior to marriage? 
We have to ask that question. 
The supreme court tells us that it is eliminating discrimination. 
In doing so, we now have marriage penalties in law. 
Therefore, I have to ask the questions:
Where is our society going? 
The courts have agreed. 
They want to know if they are entitled to benefits as well. 
Perhaps the answer would be yes. 
Where would it stop?  
Marriage is now second class.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this debate is in some respects a strange debate. 
I would not discourage them from reading the bill. 
It is not a piece of poetry. 
It is a rather prosaic bill. 
It is a compendium of 68 laws. 
It is not a bill on marriage. 
Anybody who read the bill would find that out.  
It is not a bill on marriage. 
It is essentially a carpentering job. 
In that sense I regard the government amendment-in a legal sense-as being unnecessary. 
But it does not change the definition of marriage. 
It does not add to the fact. 
The bill itself does not do that.  
It would be another law on another occasion. 
We speak of bona fide dependency relationships. 
This is an idea whose time, historically, has come. 
What are dependency relationships? 
They are relationships of children and parents. 
I understand that will be done.  
It is not exactly tabula rasa. 
It exists in a more rudimentary form through the common law.  
It does not terminate the obligation to the parent. 
One may look to some sort of comparative adjustment of the obligations.  
That is the interesting challenge.  
It does not venture into the definition of a new code of marriage. 
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Canadian Alliance):
It is incompetent and deceitful and Canadians deserve better.  
Our health care system is in tatters. 
Our justice system completely defies logic. 
We cater to criminals and the victims have no rights. 
On Friday the Prime Minister appointed a member from Saskatchewan to the Senate. 
Where is Senate reform? 
There are no free votes. 
The government never resorts to the use of referendums. 
It is a dictatorship.  
What are we doing here today? 
Is that the depth to which the government has to sink? 
What about all the urgent matters facing our nation? 
That is exactly what the Canadian Alliance has done. 
Is the House ready for the question.  
The question is on Motion No. 1. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The recorded division on Motion No. 1 stands deferred.  
The next question is on Motion No. 5. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The recorded division on Motion No. 5 stands deferred.  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The recorded division on Motion No. 7 stands deferred.  
The next question is on Motion No. 113. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The recorded division on Motion No. 113 stands deferred.  
The next question is on Motion No. 144. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The recorded division on Motion No. 144 stands deferred.  
I will now put the motions in Group No. 2 to the House.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance) moved: 
That Bill C-23 be amended by deleting Clause 193.  
That Bill C-23 be amended by deleting Clause 194.  
That Bill C-23 be amended by deleting Clause 195.  
That Bill C-23 be amended by deleting Clause 196.  
That Bill C-23 be amended by deleting Clause 197.  
That Bill C-23 be amended by deleting Clause 198.  
That Bill C-23 be amended by deleting Clause 199.  
That Bill C-23 be amended by deleting Clause 200.  
That Bill C-23 be amended by deleting Clause 201.  
That Bill C-23 be amended by deleting Clause 202.  
That Bill C-23 be amended by deleting Clause 203.  
That Bill C-23 be amended by deleting Clause 204.  
That Bill C-23 be amended by deleting Clause 205.  
That Bill C-23 be amended by deleting Clause 206.  
That Bill C-23 be amended by deleting Clause 207.  
That Bill C-23 be amended by deleting Clause 208.  
The justice minister knows this. 
We cannot even get through on her fax line. 
We hear them one after another.  
It has sweeping implications for our social structures.  
Why will the Liberals not allow debate? 
No provincial voices were heard. 
Witness lists were shortened.  
Very likely they would strongly object to that inclusion. 
This definition is also generally consistent with the Canadian Alliance policy. 
This is the third reason.  
It tells us that the courts know what is a conjugal relationship. 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
While I was sitting here listening I found that quite incredulous. 
The Ontario government is headed by Mr. Harris. 
What did that bill do? 
My riding is in the province of Ontario. 
There has been a lot of talk about marriage and the definition of marriage. 
Notwithstanding that, I will support the amendment proposed by the Minister of Justice.  
Let us look at what the bill is about. 
The purpose of the bill is straightforward. 
That is not true at all. 
The bill looks at both obligations and rights. 
She talked about her children. 
I have been married for 22 years and I also have three children. 
We have discussed this legislation with my children. 
My children do not understand what the big ado is all about. 
This happens often in relationships between brothers and sisters or parents and their children. 
There are four essential elements of recovery under quantum meruit. 
First is that valuable services were rendered or materials furnished. 
The aunt had promised him a piece of land. 
There was nothing left. 
Again it is a constitutional question.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
This is the kind of thing that needs to be discussed very openly.  
Why does it concern democracy? 
Democracy has been the subject of discussions for 300 years. 
This is what we are taught in law and in political science.  
What is it that we are being asked today to do as legislators? 
First, we are being asked to acknowledge that there are common law relationships. 
However, the time for that has not yet come. 
This is a given that we must keep in mind.  
These results will keep getting better, as each of us also knows.  
The supreme court was faced with the following case. 
This is the case known as M v H. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):
Notwithstanding what members opposite say, these people are not bigots. 
They are not advocates of discrimination and intolerance. 
They are normal working Canadians. 
They ought to be heard. 
Why do Canadians raise those objections? 
Is that an intolerant statement? 
No, it is a statement of natural fact.  
It will not be used as a reference by the courts. 
It will not apply as a definition in the various statutes amended by this bill. 
Do not let it be a partisan vote. 
Do not be cowed by the voices of intolerance. 
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
I too have received some and petitions as well.  
I commissioned an official poll in my riding. 
I fear we are doing the same thing here. 
I stand in my place today to support the legislation. 
This issue comes down to a question of discrimination. 
I ask myself, if that was not the case, are they discriminated against? 
The answer is yes, they are discriminated against and are treated differently.  
In other words, there is some kind of appropriateness to some forms of discrimination. 
In other words, things seem to be changing. 
This is the way things were. 
One of the members spoke about her family. 
Having said that, we have provided a definition within the preamble. 
We must not provide for any discrimination in our system. 
There is no question that as we go down the road our society is aging. 
I do not believe it is appropriate to continue to be silent on those issues. 
We will continue to debate them. 
That is fair and justified. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):
I ask for unanimous consent for that.  
Is there unanimous consent that the hon. member be permitted to move these motions?  
I urge members to think seriously about that.  
I do not want to chastise my fellow parliamentarians for denying me consent. 
That is not being done here in terms of the feedback we are getting.  
I urge all members to think very carefully. 
One can hardly argue with those concepts. 
It is a very important question. 
The inclusion of the term ``conjugal relationship'' throws open huge questions.  
How will it be determined? 
How do we determine who will be eligible? 
The definition simply is not there and there is confusion.  
There is another huge conundrum here. 
We are putting homosexual people into the same classification as heterosexual common law couples. 
We know there are certain laws that cover common law relationships. 
How will the courts ever unravel that one? 
It is a conundrum. 
I ask for unanimous consent once more.  
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia, Lib.):
I was first married in 1960. 
Madam Speaker, if you could square that circle for me, I would appreciate it.  
Let me say one more thing about illiterate reform theology. 
It does not spread around like that. 
They will continue being heterosexuals as I am sure homosexuals will continue being homosexuals. 
I am not at all surprised by these polling results. 
The provinces have announced their intention to review their laws. 
I am fully aware that some will disagree with the arguments that I have made. 
It would bring federal legislation into conformity with the charter. 
The social Conservatives of that period were against extending the franchise to women. 
There was also a time when aboriginal people could not vote.  
This kind of fight has been going on for decades and in fact centuries.  
Bill C-23 is about equality in benefits and obligations. 
First let us examine the benefits provided in the legislation. 
What benefits are included in the bill? 
The bill has been debated for a good long time. 
It has been debated in other legislatures. 
It has been debated in homes. 
I think people have made up their minds. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):
Madam Speaker, things are looking up a bit in this place. 
In 1997 that was reduced significantly. 
There are a lot less Liberals. 
It always leads to their downfall. 
It only takes time. 
They do not allow that. 
The whip cracks and that is the way it will be. 
Even though the Liberals talk it, they do not believe in it. 
They do not believe in the petition process.  
My desk is full of responses to petitions. 
The petition is laid out on the table. 
The government takes it and it responds. 
The sentence should be simply: ``Sorry, folks. 
We are the government. 
They are tired of looking over their shoulders. 
They want to look to the future. 
Why should they be afraid of being in a school yard? 
That will not make a lot of petitioners happy. 
They truly want a voice.  
I promise that day will happen.  
The Liberals continually shut down debate in this place. 
Closure has been used 69 times now or 169 times. 
It is called a gag law.  
It is really sad.  
We are supposed to look at everything optimistically. 
Those people over there like a lot of humour. 
It is that kind of obnoxious attitude that will help make them history. 
It will not go down in the history books as being anything wonderful. 
Is your name Bull Connor? 
Where are your dogs?  
If the fellow wants to say something he should go to his seat.  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I ask all hon. members to listen to what our colleagues have to say. 
Let us keep it down a little.  
Madam Speaker, it really does not bother me. 
It just shows their true colours. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I believe we are getting into debate here. 
The hon. member for Wild Rose.  
Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague from the Bloc. 
As I said, they should carry on. 
It shows their true colours. 
It is time to do that.  
They were saying not to worry, not to worry. 
That is not the kind of government people want. 
When will the Liberals start doing it? 
Liberal governments will never do it. 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
It just must be my day. 
Let us deal with that just for a second.  
Hector wants to do that speech in his riding.  
He should settle down. 
Let us talk about Bill C-23. 
I had some concerns about the word conjugal in the bill. 
That word was defined for me by members of the Mississauga Gospel Temple. 
They are very good people. 
I said ``Just a minute. 
We will see how you vote on the amendments.  
I will be voting in favour of the bill, let me tell the member that.  
I have a message regarding that. 
I do not support that.  
I have said that before. 
I have said this before. 
I do not consider it to be homophobic. 
I understand that to be the case.  
Let me use an example. 
Is that the kind of society we want? 
I do not think so. 
I cannot wait to hear the debate. 
We will hear ``praise the Lord'' all across this great land. 
It is not one of the extreme religious right. 
Nobody can tell Canadians that they must believe in certain philosophies. 
That is absolute nonsense. 
The Canadian people are saying that we will not discriminate. 
It is as simple as that.  
I think they do. 
I think that is part of their philosophy. 
That is not the vision of this party. 
Frankly, that is not the vision of the majority of Canadians.  
Do we want to have boot camps? 
They believe in the fist. 
That is their vision. 
That is not our vision and that is not the vision of most Canadians.  
Fundamentally, they believe in discriminating for whatever reasons they choose. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance):
Madam Speaker, it is funny to hear the word extreme in this place. 
I think I just heard a speech on that.  
Therein will be the problem with this bill. 
Like my colleague from Swift Current.  
It is about exclusion, not necessarily inclusion. 
Members opposite have to remember that. 
This could all be headed off by the government saying today ``Let's clarify this. 
Let's include people. 
Let's make this fair''. 
We went through some of the issues involved in Bill C-23. 
I asked them if they would be involved in these benefits. 
I knew all four of them and I knew they were not homosexual. 
That is power gone to its worst, in my opinion. 
It is such a mess and it will be left to the courts. 
That issue has been left to the courts. 
We will see what happens a little later when the voting starts.  
A member just a few minutes ago said the ``majority of Canadians''. 
Are we excluded from this group called a ``majority of Canadians''? 
Who did the government talk to? 
It is not accurate. 
At least he cannot prove it is accurate. 
We have a majority''.  
I am against this bill for the reasons I have stated. 
Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):
It has nothing to do with adoption. 
Only the provinces can legislate with respect to adoption. 
Why would the House have anything to do with division of assets? 
That is clearly a provincial matter under our constitution. 
However, members opposite in the House today have spoken about division of assets. 
Let us look at where this law came from. 
Incidentally, Bill C-23 amends 68 statutes.  
Let us look at the whole idea of debate. 
At Queen's Park there were six speakers over three days. 
There was no vote. 
It passed on consent. 
What kind of society will we have? 
Will we have an exclusive or inclusive society. 
It is about intolerance. 
We will tell people things that are patently not true. 
We will say that we never know who voted on it. 
Every vote here is recorded. 
What did we see at Queen's Park? 
We do not know who was for bill 5 or who was against it.  
I need to ask again what kind of society they want. 
Do they want a society where the majority will dictate? 
Will we have polls for everything? 
Aboriginal people appear to be different from many of us in this place. 
However, the reality is that we have entered into constitutional agreements. 
We have recognized that this is the right thing to do.  
Let me go to something even more primitive or more fundamental. 
Let us look at Prince Edward Island which has four members of parliament. 
That was a constitutional guarantee. 
Prince Edward Island has a constitutional guarantee of four senators. 
There are only six senators for the province of Alberta. 
Is that to say that it has a privilege that Alberta does not have? 
That is absolutely correct. 
This is a situation where it is the right thing to do. 
Sometimes we have to do the right thing in this place.  
We would have people telling us that the majority wants to exclude certain people. 
They indicated that we were attacking marriage. 
They said, if I heard them correctly, that this was a slippery slope.  
It amended 67 provincial statutes. 
Members on the other side cannot have it both ways. 
It is not this government. 
If one were to follow their line of logic, who is attacking marriage?  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
It is fundamentally about fairness and equal rights. 
Section 15(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms states: 
Under our laws it is interpreted by the courts, which is fair. 
His words transcend the boundaries between denominations and faith communities. 
He writes for an organization called Citizens for Public Justice. 
He goes on to say in this interesting document: 
He goes on to talk about what has happened in the far distant past. 
We have had some references to that as well. 
There was not a public declaration of mutual commitment before a civil authority. 
He concludes in this portion of his book: 
If people are being discriminated against, then that is grounds for correction. 
That is what this debate fundamentally comes down to. 
It does not matter what the public opinion polls say. 
It does not matter what the petitions say. 
That is the point that needs to be made.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
There is a difference.  
Discrimination is not exclusively a negative concept. 
There are positive or affirmative discriminations within our society. 
We discriminate in favour of aboriginals. 
We have special programs to assist aboriginals.  
We could talk a lot about the needs of various groups within our society. 
In Bill C-23 we are no longer just talking about the negative discriminations. 
Now the pendulum is swinging. 
We have taken care of the negative discriminations. 
The supreme court dealt with it. 
There was a series of cases. 
I think that was the language the court used.  
That is how the pendulum has swung.  
I understand why there is so much discussion here. 
Parliament made that step.  
We should have consulted with our constituents. 
We should have raised legislation. 
The courts did it as a result of that ruling.  
Bill C-23 responds to the court decision. 
When people talk about intolerance, it is not a fair label. 
Canadians should appreciate that about 3% of the population of Canada are homosexual persons. 
It is quite a small number. 
There are two reasons. 
One is that there are so very few couples that will ever qualify for this. 
Canadians will know that society exists and sustains itself because of the family. 
It is a very difficult issue for a lot of members to deal with. 
I believe in the traditional family. 
Should we not discriminate in favour of the family? 
We do have discrimination in our policy now. 
I gave many examples. 
I believe we can. 
The question is on Motion No. 117. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The recorded division on Motion No. 117 stands deferred. 
The recorded division will also apply to Motions Nos. 118 to 133.  
And the bells having rung: 
The first question is on Motion No. 1.  
(The House divided on Motion No. 1, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
I wish to indicate that I voted in favour. 
I just thought we were voting a second time.  
Mr. Lawrence D. O'Brien:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to be recorded as an abstention on the last vote.  
I declare Motion No. 1 lost.  
The next question is on Motion No. 3.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Is there agreement to proceed in such a fashion?  
(The House divided on Motion No. 3, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare Motion No. 3 lost.  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on Motion No. 4, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare Motion No. 4 lost.  
The next question is on Motion No. 5.  
(The House divided on Motion No. 5, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare Motion No. 5 lost.  
(The House divided on Motion No. 7, which was negatived on the following division:) 
The next question is on Motion No. 113.  
(The House divided on Motion No. 113, which was negatived on the following division:) 
The vote on this motion will also apply to Motion No. 116.  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on Motion No. 115, which was negatived on the following division:) 
The next question is on Motion No. 144.  
(The House divided on Motion No. 144, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare Motion No. 144 lost.  
The next question is on Motion No. 117. 
The vote on this motion will also apply to Motions Nos. 118 to 133.  
(The House divided on Motion No. 117, which was negatived on the following division:) 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The members of the Progressive Conservative Party voted yea for these two motions. 
In other words, for the two votes it is nay.  
This was unanimously agreed to by the House. 
Do you want to change that?  
Is there unanimous consent?  
There is no consent. 
The vote is recorded as is and it is done.  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Canadians probably want to know a little bit more about why there is this discrepancy.  
It was an interesting period of time. 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
All told, Government of Canada spending clearly exceeds 31 cents on the dollar. 
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 7.58 p.m.)
