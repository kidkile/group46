Thursday, March 30, 2000 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
A Management Framework for the Government of Canada''.  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have the honour to present two petitions this morning. 
The first is with respect to the issue of economic sanctions on Iraq. 
It is signed by residents of Nova Scotia. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Canadian Alliance):
LABELLING OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
LABELLING OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS 
Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne-Blainville, BQ):
QUESTIONS PASSED AS ORDERS FOR RETURNS 
Question No. 10- Mr. Gilles Bernier: 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
In terms of the rules of the House of Commons, that is not really appropriate.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, no more loan guarantees. 
I opposed the bill. 
I wanted everyone to know why I opposed it. 
I do not think there is sufficient demand for the ships to be built. 
Therefore, the loan guarantees would make little economic sense. 
The Chair regards the using of props in the House with the utmost seriousness. 
We are here to carry on a legislative function, not an advertising function. 
I invite him to do that if he wishes his views to be known. 
I hope that it will not be necessary to revisit this issue. 
In the Chair's view, it is entirely inappropriate.  
PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTION AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS ACT 
BILL C-6-TIME ALLOCATION MOTION 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I move: 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
SECOND READING AND CONCURRENCE IN SENATE AMENDMENTS 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas-Charlottenburgh, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
We think it is the right way to go.  
That is the right way to go.  
I see the member for Saint Boniface who is a cabinet minister. 
Maybe the member for Saskatoon-Humboldt will do the same thing.  
I look forward to those speeches. 
I see that they are getting edgy and agitated. 
That being said, we support the amendment and we support the bill. 
We have evolved from an agricultural society into an industrial society. 
It is very important to have legislation that deals with electronic commerce.  
Once again it is another first for the Government of Saskatchewan. 
Indeed we are living in a global society. 
One thing which is obvious is that commerce has become globalized. 
Big corporations and companies have globalized. 
That is something which is very important. 
That brings me to the whole issue of the Tobin tax. 
It was my private member's motion that the House voted on. 
These are the issues we are going to have to deal with. 
These are the issues the churches around the world are concerned with. 
These are the issues young people are concerned with. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Canadian Alliance):
He said he wanted to see an elected Senate too. 
He even said it in Calgary.  
The province of Alberta will have a resignation of a Senate seat on March 31. 
It does this without being accountable to anyone.  
I agree with the member on that.  
That debate should continue. 
It is a debate well worth pursuing.  
The member asked me about Bert Brown. 
I am sure Bert Brown would like to take a seat in the Senate. 
Why would he not? 
They each have 24 senators. 
If we followed the Alberta solution the existing Senate powers would also be legitimized. 
It does not use them because senators are appointed and are not legitimate. 
That is almost anti Saskatchewan, anti Albertan in nature because of the population shifts.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The hon. member is quite correct. 
The party is known as the Canadian Alliance.  
We will see where that goes.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would expect that kind of respect.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on the same point of order. 
It is not for the Speaker to ask questions. 
I think the point has been made.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I think that you need to straighten him out one more time.  
I think the hon. member has done that very nicely.  
Mr. Speaker, they are certainly thin-skinned.  
He was part of that. 
He was on the beaches of Mexico.  
The comments seem to be going around a bit. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to ask the hon. member of the NDP this. 
He talked about the Senate. 
Did the hon. member agree with that member?  
Why is it that those people opposite would be silent on one- 
I think the question has gone on long enough.  
The hon. member from Regina-Qu'Appelle has the floor.  
I wish the hon. member would join us in that crusade.  
Some 95% of the people of the country do not support the existing Senate. 
He should ask his constituents how they feel about it. 
It is not a democratic body. 
I would be surprised if anybody said yes. 
They do not support the existing house. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
I also was a commentator for CBC and CTV. 
On Friday night the leader of the Liberal Party, the Prime Minister- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member is quite correct. 
Therefore, I would ask hon. members to concern themselves with the relevancy of their words.  
These issues have partially been addressed by the government. 
I believe that the amendments from the other place were appropriate and helpful. 
It will revolutionize and be a very commercializeable initiative.  
Canada has had during that same period a 5% increase in GDP per capita.  
These phenomena are reflected in the Canadian dollar. 
These are some of the things we need to be looking at.  
With the Internet and with e-commerce, borders are less relevant now. 
This is a challenge. 
This is both positive and negative.  
Let us talk about the brave new world that is available. 
It is a very exciting time.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened with some interest to the member opposite. 
Mr. Clark is the leader of the Conservative Party. 
Why was he not standing up for Canada? 
Why does he not stand up for Canada on this all important issue?  
He should be ashamed. 
As members are aware, patriotism is the last refuge of scoundrels. 
They have done everything they can to euthanize the Canadian health care system. 
Mr. John Cannis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
They flip-flop every day.  
They had that opportunity. 
That is what this government has done for this country. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his softball question. 
These were policies that recognized where Canada needed to be in the 21st century.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sorry, time is up.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
I can assure the House that dog will not hunt.  
I do want to point out that Bill C-6 is a very important bill. 
It is important to note that- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Cariboo-Chilcotin has called quorum.  
And the count having been taken: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It will also apply to crown corporations. 
That is very important. 
Small and medium businesses are the engines for Canada. 
It is appropriate that we move in that sense accordingly. 
This makes for better lives for them and their families. 
I am sorry, I guess that party has gone through two name changes. 
Quite frankly I think Canadians reject their extremist views. 
Canada is above that.  
He or she who is without guilt will cast the first stone. 
He should think hard and long about casting judgments on other people. 
After all that is what Canadians want.  
We can talk a great deal in this House of Commons. 
We can talk at the federal level about what we should or should not do. 
Witness health care for example. 
Imagine what Mr. Harris is doing. 
Canadians quite frankly expect more from their premiers. 
Why do they do that?  
The 10 principles are noted as follows.  
Number one relates to accountability. 
Accountability is very important. 
All Canadians expect it in legislation and rightfully so. 
Number three in the code is consent. 
They want it and they need it. 
Number four is the limited collection code principle. 
Again, I think that too is important.  
Number six is accuracy. 
Canadians expect the information given to be accurate. 
The mechanisms are built in whereby if there is misinformation it can be corrected. 
Number seven is the principle of safeguards. 
Again, this is part of transparency. 
Number nine is individual access. 
It is a principle which we are prepared to put in place.  
I believe it is ultimately in the best interests of all Canadians.  
There is a five year review built into the bill. 
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to use this opportunity to question my colleague.  
I would be tempted to advise my colleague to control his disdain.  
He could be in for some big surprises.  
I felt proud to a part of that great bill.  
It is the beginning of the end.  
That is what Mr. Mulroney did. 
He tried to build an alliance, and look what happened to him. 
He talks about where I will be after the next election. 
I would challenge him as to where the Conservatives will be after the next election.  
They were reduced to two seats. 
Because Canadians ultimately reject that kind of nonsense. 
It is not consistent with the party of Cartier. 
Where is Mr. Joe Clark and why is he not standing for Canada?  
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Canadian Alliance):
He did not talk about Quebec. 
He said that the Bloc indicated that it had concerns.  
In fact, it will not infringe on provincial jurisdiction. 
We have made that very clear.  
Let us think about that for a minute. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We are debating a particular bill. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I suspect that could have a little debate in it. 
We will go to the next question.  
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
My Reform colleague talked about Alberta. 
Alberta is a province in your beautiful great country.  
My Reform colleague's question concerned Alberta. 
It concerns provincial jurisdiction. 
This legislation is considered effective the world over.  
This is not a group of separatists. 
I simply want to explain this so that the member will understand. 
It is opposed to Bill C-6.  
There is also the Chambre des notaires. 
It is opposed to Bill C-6. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member opposite jumps the gun. 
I was getting to the point where I was going to answer the question. 
This will be done by an order in council once the bill becomes law.  
The member claims to be protecting the interests of his constituents. 
He claims to be protecting Quebecers wherever they live. 
Why would he not do his homework and know that this was happening? 
I find it shameful that he would do what he is doing.  
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Canadian Alliance):
It is very difficult to listen to a rant continued by the hon. member. 
Quebec currently has strong privacy legislation. 
Alberta could then perhaps create something that would be more specific to the province.  
This, unfortunately, seems to be a common theme with the government. 
It just does not care about dealing with the provincial concerns. 
If it did, it would be so much easier to build consensus. 
That is an area that will be further developed in this bill.  
I talked briefly about this point earlier. 
The government would be better off to allow that.  
It has also been moved in many other circumstances. 
At least it moves in the right direction.  
We need some form of commitment from the government. 
It is very important to raise these issues today. 
As I have outlined, they are moving in the right direction. 
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his very pertinent question. 
It was to no avail. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for a very good speech. 
On that level, I was satisfied with the direction of the bill. 
I think it does deal with the hon. member's concern.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Canadian Alliance):
Constitutionally or by any other means would there be anything wrong with that?  
Mr. Speaker, there would be absolutely nothing wrong with that. 
My hon. colleague has asked a perfectly legitimate question.  
This is a critically important issue. 
I have spent an enormous amount of time working on and thinking about this issue. 
I want to walk through some of that. 
This issue affects democracies all around the world.  
It was an interesting phenomena.  
We can send out 10 million cheques with ease. 
We can do very large transaction based operations. 
But the outside world has changed enormously.  
I like his framework for that. 
We heard a lot about quality in the 1980s. 
It also brought a lot of information back to the decision point. 
Information in and of itself has some unique characteristics worth thinking about. 
This takes us into the decade of restructuring. 
For the first time they could actually visualize their organization. 
What happened in government? 
What is the nature of the quality movement in government? 
What is the feedback on how that is processed? 
I have already mentioned the lack of any appearance of physical restructuring. 
Re-engineering in government tended to become privatization. 
It was the velocity issue coming at us.  
I want to lay out one other argument before I try to pull them together.  
Historically those were fought through wars, conquests and all of those other things.  
More people could have it, which would educate people. 
It was no longer simply the priests handwriting books in a few back rooms. 
All of a sudden books could be distributed to a lot of people. 
A lot of people could become educated.  
One fellow wrote a book, which I still have and quite like. 
If we educate them they will sort out all of the other problems. 
Think about that for a second. 
There is a modern example of that. 
After a while a population which does that cannot be controlled. 
They cannot be oppressed in the same way.  
The same thing is happening in China. 
In many ways we are not different. 
I am one who believes that it is inevitable in some form. 
But even now I think that some of the resistance is no different.  
The same thing happened with aboriginals, and it happened just recently with apartheid. 
Privacy was the thing that would stop it. 
I always thought that was simply security. 
I have no fear of the hackers. 
People accept that we can do that. 
It was a concern about rights. 
It was a human rights argument. 
It was: ``What are my rights relative to the government? 
This is an important piece of legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I think that is as far as I will go. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Canadian Alliance):
The hon. member has studied this a great deal. 
I am tired of this''. 
Again, our understanding is shifting.  
The hon. member raises a really good question. 
It is not a criticism. 
We have a rigid set of rules to begin with and a very rigid system. 
I bet the hon. member's files are full of examples. 
I know mine are. 
I actually started writing columns on stupid government. 
The hon. member's point about education was absolutely right. 
It will tell us things about our government and our country that will surprise us.  
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Canadian Alliance):
The technology grows in both directions. 
Now identity theft is something I hear about fairly regularly. 
The member touched on an incredibly important area. 
Does the legislation solve all those problems? 
It says that citizens have the right to be informed. 
The health area is an interesting one. 
There has been a change by the Senate which I can support. 
Is that information really voluntarily given? 
We have no choice but to give it. 
Largely this is in the commercial system. 
It has the paradigm right. 
I have the right to be told why the information is wanted. 
It puts a lot of control in the hands of the consumer.  
We can do some things. 
It is very difficult. 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
These remarks were made in 1996 and are still current. 
Ten years ago, it was easy to live incognito. 
Having gone through all that, we are back at square one. 
Privacy protection is essentially under provincial jurisdiction. 
In Quebec, for example, it is property and civil rights. 
It is the Civil Code. 
It is Quebec law that applies in addition to the Canadian and Quebec charters.  
I apologize for interrupting the hon. member. 
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the 21st century presents us with many exciting opportunities and challenges. 
The hon. member for Prince Albert.  
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance):
He will lose the tax exemption at the same time his wife seeks additional support. 
But consider this injustice. 
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
DOWN'S SYNDROME RESEARCH FOUNDATION 
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
This new centre will be the one and only of its kind in North America.  
Their work and dedication is an inspiration to all of us.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):
It is an important initiative which we must all pursue with vigour.  
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
So how are things, Jane? 
The way I see it, all is well 
And hardly worthy of report, 
The Celanese plant shut its doors, 
Finito, but apart from that, 
Just fine, just great, so worry not.  
Is Celanese a goner then?  
What can we do for all those men 
Laid off, to help them start again?  
We hardly have a cent ourselves.  
Tell me your version of events, 
I am quite shaken, truth be told.  
Because of grants not processed right 
And billions gone, right out of sight, 
What workers feel is not delight- 
Betrayed, abandoned, used, more like- 
They want to see you take a hike, 
A long one, but apart from that, 
Just fine, just great, so worry not.  
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
And yet in Quebec and Ottawa, bilingualism is not an issue. 
The Liberal government in Ottawa made French mandatory in the air in 1976. 
We are still proud of that fact today.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, Alberta Senator Ron Ghitter is resigning. 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the economic good news continues. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Finally, let us not forget about the lobster and the Marshall decision. 
Will lobsters be next?  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
People are outraged, they want a major cleanup, and this is urgent.  
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
He was the first chief of staff, a post he held for four years.  
For 162 years there has been a Dr. Langstaff in Richmond Hill. 
My condolences to his wife, his children and his many friends. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
It was requested that progress be reported to the committee and to this House.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):
No, quite the opposite. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
The legislation will not reduce crime in Canada. 
The Liberal government said the new gun registry would cost $85 million. 
To date costs have exceeded $300 million. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
Why are ethics not of concern to this government? 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, this is a little story tale here. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let us look at some of the other things that this report said. 
We continue to build a strong public service.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
The audit said that control was a four letter word. 
Things are much different there now. 
The minister's response was that she would ``find modern methods'' of control. 
What is the important modern method? 
Or, is it this boondoggle that this government- 
The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Let us go through this one more time. 
Would the opposition have us do it any other way?  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Canadian Alliance):
I ask this question again. 
How can Canadians trust a government that let them down?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
They show it day after day in the extreme.  
The hon. leader of the Bloc Quebecois.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
The minister made reference to section 10.2, so we will speak of this. 
Has the minister called for a recovery plan? 
This is a clear question, and I trust that I will receive a clear answer.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
What is clear is that the government has options in this regard. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, first of all, Placeteco is in Saint-Maurice. 
There were 81 jobs and now there are 78. 
The minister must stop clouding the issue. 
The loan was to Placeteco.  
The minister decided not to make use of section 10.2. 
Champagne and Gauthier were also creditors in the bankruptcy. 
It would be pretty hard to find a nicer set-up.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the minister's arguments have no credibility. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let me just go through the facts again. 
Indeed, we monitored this file very closely. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
The provinces say that we need federal money. 
The federal government says that we need a plan. 
Why will this government not admit that we need both? 
We need a plan to restore health care funding. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
It is simply out of touch. 
If is simply not listening.  
We say ``Health care: let's pick solutions not fights''.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
It appears that investigators fit the evidence to the guilt of the crime. 
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
That is what these audits do.  
It is debasing and building on the negative, and that is not appropriate.  
Once again, the microphones are on two desks. 
I appeal to members.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, we are not talking about Trois-Rivieres. 
The minister is intentionally mixing the files. 
Placeteco got $1.2 million from the government. 
That is what we are talking about.  
Where are the invoices? 
Where is the truth in this matter?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let me say again, the administrative- 
Show us so we can check them.  
I understand that you will be paying this amount over three years''.  
It is a scheme.  
Let us hear the minister's answer.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):
The Export Development Corporation. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
The EDC is an arm's length corporation. 
The government is helping Canadian exporters to export around the world. 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, arm's length, my foot. 
The government continues to write blank cheques for Amtrak. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the EDC has existed for 56 years. 
There is no blank cheque there.  
The EDC is well run and well managed and it helps Canadian exporters.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Finance. 
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
That is what federal-provincial co-operation- 
The hon. member for Temiscamingue.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Why this double standard?  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
The hon. member for Red Deer.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is in the usual dream world of the Reform Party.  
Why does the hon. member not admit that? 
Those are the facts.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member cannot even get our name right.  
We have a mismanaged HRDC department. 
We have a health care system in shambles. 
What does the government do? 
It places a gun to the heads of the provinces.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, Celanese in Drummondville is closing its doors tomorrow. 
For them active measures are not a solution.  
What is she going to do for them?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Charles Hubbard (Miramichi, Lib.):
Perhaps it is here today.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):
Why would it do that?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is really off base. 
The hon. member is really off base in what he is saying. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):
The Deputy Prime Minister's wife.  
Why do they not tell- 
I am not sure what the administrative responsibility is. 
The hon. Deputy Prime Minister.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
They are back in the 19th century. 
Spouses are not extensions of their spouses. 
Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
We had a review of it, which took many years. 
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
That is a 25% increase over two years.  
Canadians do not want provincial and federal governments bickering. 
They want quality health care for Canadians.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
I remind the minister that his government has taken $30 billion out of the system. 
They selectively remember what they want to remember. 
We want it fixed.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
That is over $40 billion. 
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we had useful discussions with the provinces. 
The Government of Canada is going further. 
We will reach that not by 2010 but by 2005. 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTION AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS ACT 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
The Quebec government and the Quebec society reject this bill. 
When I say everyone, I do not mean just anybody. 
Here is a partial list of the stakeholders. 
One wonders why the federal government turns a deaf ear in such a context. 
It may have reasons to do so. 
This came up one or two years ago.  
But the federal government forges ahead.  
i.e. the House of Commons.  
The Bloc Quebecois has put the government's will to the test.  
We can see this with assistance to transients, which goes directly to the public. 
The federal government is using its spending power to intrude.  
To crush Quebec, they passed Bill C-20. 
We must remember that. 
We must have some sense of history, because the stakes are too high.  
We cannot take a piecemeal approach to these issues. 
The government despises the existence of the people of Quebec, it does not recognize it. 
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I ask that an order of the day be designated for consideration of the motion. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTION AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS ACT 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I wish to congratulate the hon. member for Trois-Rivieres for his speech.  
Quebec is several years ahead in the area of personal information protection. 
What this government wants is to cast a single culture, the Canadian culture. 
It might perhaps be time to speak of distinct society. 
Why does it not? 
That is what all Quebecers wonder. 
If it does not, this means that it does not believe in it. 
If I were a Canadian, I would be a centralist.  
I am a Quebecer, let there be no confusion about that. 
I am here by accident.  
If I were a Canadian, I would be a federalist and a centralist. 
That situation did not come out of the blue, nor did this one.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
They could have woken the House up. 
I think that this is fairly clear. 
He went on to say: 
Privacy is basically a provincial jurisdiction in theory. 
It is to be expected that many jurisdictional conflicts will surface.  
In this case, it is rather striking.  
One would have thought that the senators would have examined this issue. 
This legislation is recognized and used as a model all over the world.  
They have asked about the philosophy behind it and how it works. 
I think the legislation we have in Quebec is an example.  
Let us be clear. 
The federal act intrudes into areas under Quebec's jurisdiction. 
Let us take a concrete example. 
Will it be the federal act or the provincial act? 
Will both acts apply?  
I will give examples of duplication that may lead to serious conflicts. 
I will give an example with regard to individual consent. 
The wording is quite different. 
It is a lengthy bill. 
But how will the courts interpret it? 
This is always my main concern, especially as justice critic. 
I think it is not going to be clear.  
What is added on? 
A year longer before it comes into effect, just as far as health is concerned.  
There are several amendments proposed by the Senate. 
This too we have said on numerous occasions.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Berthier-Montcalm is correct. 
There is a 20 minute slot. 
The Bloc then ended up with two slots.  
Thank you for the clarifications, Mr. Speaker. 
I shall try to start where I left off.  
They have said nothing about them. 
I will quote the second paragraph of this letter: 
This was on October 19, 1999. 
That was his acknowledgement of receipt. 
We have a problem. 
That is where we stand now. 
I heard a Liberal member mention earlier that, in Quebec, they will be exempt. 
Such is the flexibility of the act. 
I dare hope he was misinformed.  
Consequently, the federal legislation will apply in Quebec. 
We will have to negotiate on a piecemeal basis for every organization. 
This is what this government calls flexibility. 
The Quebec model is not in danger; there is flexibility''. 
This is not true either. 
Flexibility is a word catchword, these days.  
Flexibility always works to the advantage of the federal government. 
But they let the opportunity pass. 
What sort of work are they doing in the other place? 
Their comments were very revealing, and very carefully thought through as well. 
They had taken the time to examine the bill in depth. 
You will need a lot of votes.  
In this case they told the government ``You are headed the wrong way''. 
Do not do that''. 
We also heard the Conseil du patronat. 
We also heard the Chambre des notaires and various associations.  
But the government did as it pleased anyway. 
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
I see the Minister for International Trade laughing. 
In your place, Mr. Minister, I would not be laughing.  
That said, yes, the government over there is indeed arrogant. 
I will give an example that very much involves Quebec: the Young Offenders Act. 
There is a very broad consensus on that bill. 
But it carries on regardless.  
We know how much discussion is going on among the Liberals at present. 
I am dying to see how they will defend their great record in Quebec. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
I congratulate them on that.  
You can do whatever kind of net surfing you like. 
I have a program on my computer at home that is not a Windows program. 
It is a computer search program. 
I have a classic example of what happens. 
These were reflected in the list of these so-called preferences.  
There are other things. 
I have studied it actually at some length. 
It is very difficult to control these things.  
It advances the desire for openness. 
You cannot find out what crown agencies are doing. 
You cannot find out the details of their budget. 
You cannot find out what the salaries are. 
You cannot find out that kind of thing. 
Mr. Speaker, this is an incredibly positive step in the right direction. 
I should talk a little about the amendments that have come back from the Senate. 
These amendments pertain to defining personal information. 
I will do my very best. 
I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, forgive me. 
I am going to get myself into terrible trouble. 
I will get control of the debate again.  
I come back to the whole idea of commercial information. 
Most people are not bothered by that.  
It is no secret. 
So why that data should be subject to this legislation I do not know.  
Hence, I believe this amendment is apropos, but I would have pursued it further. 
The problem is that we are not very certain. 
I will switch back to my suggestion about the Internet. 
I see there are some members from the Reform Party who are watching this.  
There are quite a few members and I am very pleased. 
It can be in the United States or anywhere else. 
It does not go far enough.  
I got interested in this in the second reading debate. 
I have to say that the minister was very receptive to this type of criticism. 
I was able to persuade the minister to accept an amendment that I put forward. 
That amendment was actually to the definition of commercial activity. 
That is a very dangerous thing. 
This legislation moves in the right direction, but we have a long way to go.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Canadian Alliance):
I appreciate what the member has said. 
I have been a consensus commissioner. 
I have done other surveys too. 
Does the member see what I am getting at? 
Did that one government form fall into the hands of Revenue Canada? 
We will never know. 
I would like the hon. member to comment on that.  
That act provides for absolute confidentiality. 
Contemporary Statistics Canada data are absolutely protected. 
I think we have to take it at face value.  
This is the kind of financial information that I was talking about. 
That is where we have the problem, or at least I have the problem. 
Not making purchases is a form of information. 
Then you know what happens, Mr. Speaker. 
I know the minister is listening. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Canadian Alliance):
I also resent some of the activities of the member for Wentworth-Burlington. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
This has nothing to do with the piece of legislation we are discussing. 
Where is this member coming from? 
I think you should bring him to order, Mr. Speaker. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
So it has to ask close, probing questions.  
The member is quite right. 
We are entitled to know how that money is being spent. 
I wish this legislation protected that kind of information more specifically. 
Nevertheless, it is going in the right direction.  
As far as the member's other remarks, they are a little off topic. 
I think that is a very fine thing that the government did.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
I would like to begin my remarks by reminding members of a terrible reality.  
That legislation is used as a model throughout the world. 
It would be a terrible legal mess.  
Action Reseau Consommateur is another opponent to the act. 
It got the picture right away. 
Quebec can see the legal and administrative complications that will stem from such duplication.  
Today, the bill is being amended by the Senate. 
This was all covered in the Quebec act. 
The Quebec act applies to all sectors. 
It applies to the health sector. 
It is very clear on the matter of consent. 
How will consumers figure it out?  
We are faced with the evidence. 
This bill was put through by closure. 
The government made a decision. 
That is really the spirit that we found in the bill. 
This would cost a considerable amount.  
The bill before us does the opposite. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTION AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS ACT 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
I am referring to the young offenders bill.  
But things did not turn out that way.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his comment and his question.  
Those were his words.  
We also heard the privacy commissioner. 
This motion received unanimous approval here a few years ago. 
This situation has to be looked at in the broader context. 
The member for Joliette was asking me what this situation tells us.  
We have a perfect example of that attitude in this case. 
The Government of Quebec has a good legislation on personal information protection. 
It has been adapted, revised and it works. 
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
The criteria are not clear and well defined. 
We could see this kind of situation, and it would create duplication.  
There is also the other situation where this bill will probably be passed. 
The Liberal majority seems intent on imposing it on us. 
We do not know what kind of situation will occur. 
It would have been clear and would not have been open to interpretation. 
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
One wonders how far this government will go to attain its goal.  
This project dates back to the time when Pierre Elliott Trudeau was elected, in 1968. 
The present Prime Minister was one of his loyal henchmen. 
But the same thing is happening with Bill C-6. 
I will give a few examples.  
That too has been a trademark of this government since 1993. 
The same goes in the case of Bill C-6. 
Now, Bill C-6 is back with the amendments proposed by the Senate.  
As members know, the Senate proposes the following amendments: 
Bill C-6 is a fundamental piece of legislation. 
Around 20 years ago, the fax machine was introduced. 
Today we have digital radio. 
Then there is the whole issue of Internet.  
They use the Internet. 
What is this government looking for? 
Why do they not consult the provinces and the people concerned more often?  
Why penalize Quebec, which is out in the lead? 
We realize that this government never takes time to consult. 
But they are silent; there is not a peep out of them. 
It is trying to prevent people from expressing their views.  
This Liberal government continuously takes powers and jurisdictions away from Quebec. 
The system could create information problems and leaks. 
A message was delivered by the Usher of the Black Rod as follows: 
Accordingly the Speaker with the House went up to the Senate chamber.  
Bill C-202, an act to amend the Criminal Code (flight)-Chapter 2. 
PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTION AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS ACT 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
An apprentice earns only $25,000 gross. 
Members can see how unjust and unacceptable it is for this category of workers. 
I would like to know. 
Let me quote the same letter again: 
I have been listening intently to the objections of members opposite. 
Democratic this government is not.  
But I am straying from today's topic. 
This is naturally something that deserves our attention. 
This is perfectly normal. 
Mr. Rick Limoges (Windsor-St. 
Mr. Speaker, I am always pleased to have any opportunity to discuss tax relief. 
Finally, broad based relief should not be funded with borrowed money.  
These are the principles that have governed our actions.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I wonder if you could inform the hon. member of that ancient practice. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. Marceau):
Clair is referring to his notes in a proper manner. 
A growing economy centred on innovation is an important part of the equation. 
Here are two more examples of the tax plan at work. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. Marceau):
I think the hon. member for Windsor-St. 
Clair was making an analogy. 
Given the time allocated to the member, I believe this is a totally acceptable analogy.  
The hon. member for Windsor-St. 
He has 45 seconds to finish his speech.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):
I do appreciate the Bloc member bringing this forward.  
That is the only change. 
It is very important that this issue be dealt with. 
It would be quite devastating to lose $30,000 worth of tools.  
The mechanic could also deduct the cost of the insurance. 
That is the purpose of the bill.  
I know that copies of the letters have been sent to the finance minister. 
I would suggest that they were excuses.  
The Bloc Quebecois and myself support the measures proposed in this bill''.  
Reform MPs fully supported the bill. 
Then we come to the government side, the Liberals. 
I agree with that. 
That statement is correct. 
I believe that is a bogus issue which the parliamentary secretary brought forward.  
I would suggest that, indeed, that is an odd statement. 
That was a very odd statement.  
Taxpayers are trusted to do that. 
Again, this was another bogus excuse.  
It never raised them once.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
Mr. Speaker, maybe not this year. 
Why is it that tax fairness cannot also lead to a lowering of taxes? 
In this case, that is exactly what would be done. 
It is money that really should be left in the pockets of mechanics. 
This is long overdue.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
There is a considerable expense to becoming a carpenter or a mechanic. 
Buying a whole set of tools is a very expensive proposition.  
For almost any other business endeavour in the country one can deduct legitimate expenses. 
The reporter talked to Gene Myers, who is an Algonquin College student and an apprentice. 
The wrenches are categorized in this way. 
Who gave us the metric system?  
In any event, that is how the metric system arrived.  
I assume the Progressive Conservative Party will also be supporting this. 
We will be hearing from its distinguished House leader in a few minutes. 
Let us hear from the Progressive Conservative Party. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mechanics are no exception.  
This is uncommon in this place when it comes to legislation.  
They are an integral part of any mechanic's existence and profession. 
There is a need for standardization across the board. 
Why then should there not be a similar tax deductible mechanism in place for mechanics? 
Mechanics are no exception. 
They have lobbied not only opposition members but presumably government members. 
It trundles along in mediocrity. 
That could be brought about through the adoption of this type of legislation.  
That we know will generate further growth through spinoffs in the economy.  
We support the hon. member who has moved this bill through the Commons. 
We on the opposition side are urging the government to support this legislation.  
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
In this case, it is mechanics.  
That was what the Minister of Finance was hinting at.  
This bill defends principles in which I believe strongly. 
As far as I am concerned, this is social injustice.  
Now, moving on to another of the objectives I support. 
Unfortunately, people are constantly leaving the regions. 
There is pride in having local mechanics in each municipality.  
What does this situation lead to? 
Tomorrow it will be the electricians. 
We are proud of them and must keep them. 
Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):
I am looking for one case.  
They can buy real estate and all sorts of things. 
They are adults and anything an adult can do they can do.  
Three years later what do we see? 
I have to ask how this can be. 
If we look at the law in this country we want it both ways. 
How can this possibly be?  
However, a divorced parent does not have this choice. 
I have one final point. 
Is the Divorce Act a law that is applied to create a social policy? 
That is exactly what is happening in this circumstance.  
It needs to be said that this is not new policy. 
In fact some allow it where the families are intact.  
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.28 p.m.)
