Monday, March 27, 2000 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Do you wish to table the document?  
We will follow the wishes as set forth in this letter. 
That is how it will be referred to in the House.  
FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
We knew that over time great sacrifices would have to be made. 
We understand that, which is why the ministers will be meeting. 
The deputy ministers are meeting as we speak. 
I spoke about the promises which we as a government had made. 
That was very important. 
The finance minister was very clear. 
He indicated that it would be a plan over five years. 
I want to indicate that I will be splitting my time. 
This is an important topic and other members want the ability to speak to it.  
Let us go back to the time of the Conservatives for a minute. 
We inherited a huge deficit from the Mulroney administration. 
It is important that we do that.  
I find it most distressing and I find it very shameful.  
That is most upsetting.  
Since we are talking about the budget today let us talk about the flat tax. 
Let us talk about what those Reformers stand for. 
Canadians do not buy into that nonsense. 
That is what the Reform Party represents.  
I was reading today a little about our friend Stockwell Day. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
This is a trifle.  
This was something he glossed right over.  
The CEO told us ``We applied. 
We were sure we would not get it. 
They handed it to us and we took it of course''.  
Placeteco received $1.2 million to create jobs. 
I am sorry to have to interrupt the hon. member. 
The hon. member for Waterloo-Wellington must be allowed to reply. 
He has one minute to reply.  
They do not know what to do any more. 
They do not know what they stand for any more.  
The hon. member talks about disarray. 
He should get Mr. Parizeau and Mr. Bouchard together. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I rise in direct reference to the comments made by the member for Waterloo-Wellington.  
I believe a retraction is due. 
I appeal to the Chair for that very course of action.  
The hon. member is against everything. 
He is anti-feminist, anti-immigrant- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I suggest that the hon. member retract those remarks or apologize to the House.  
The Chair heard the comments. 
I am not sure that the hon. member completely crossed the line. 
They are not necessarily words that all members would use. 
Mr. Rick Limoges (Windsor-St. 
Today we have a federal budget that is able to address very different issues. 
Clair and across Canada.  
Tax relief is a very important issue in my riding of Windsor-St. 
Under this plan Canadians in Windsor-St. 
Clair and across Canada.  
Clair and all of Canada.  
Now only two-thirds of these gains are taxable instead of the previous three-quarters.  
Today Canada enjoys a new economic reality. 
The federal deficit is history. 
The national debt burden is in decline. 
The disposable income of Canadians in Windsor-St. 
Clair and across Canada is on the rise.  
Budget 2000 delivers just that. 
Budget 2000 is good for Windsor-St. 
Clair and it is good for Canada. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Canadian Alliance):
There is a number of ongoing sales because of the economy in western Canada. 
Among the goods listed are some firearms. 
Would the hon. member like to comment on that?  
Mr. Speaker, I would be very pleased to respond to that question. 
However we have more than a right; we have a responsibility. 
I make no apology.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
We know the Liberals do not understand the concerns about health care. 
There was not a single word in the budget on shipbuilding.  
Indeed the figures speak for themselves. 
We are now surpassing the levels of the pre-cutback years.  
As the Minister of Health said it will take more than money. 
It will take innovative solutions from every province. 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):
It is an historical moment. 
I am extremely proud to be part of this history. 
What happened on Saturday night in Calgary? 
Let me say what happened in referendum 2000. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would suggest that we keep the comments relevant.  
I know the hon. member for Calgary East is working into the budget very quickly.  
You are absolutely right, Mr. Speaker. 
In Manitoba 80.9% of the people said yes. 
In New Brunswick 96.2% said yes to the alliance. 
In Newfoundland 94% said yes to the Canadian Alliance. 
In Ontario 91% said yes to the alliance. 
In Prince Edward Island 92.2% said yes. 
In Quebec 91% said yes. 
In Saskatchewan 82.8% said yes. 
In the territories 80.8% said yes. 
It is a shame.  
Let us deal quickly with the tax cuts proposed in the budget. 
Let us see what my constituents are saying.  
He earned $17,000 last year and paid $2,000 in taxes. 
Yesterday I got a call from a senior in my riding. 
She is working part time. 
She is 67 years old. 
That was her question to me. 
This is how the government indirectly taxes Canadians.  
My son is 15 years old. 
His friend went out to work in the evenings. 
He is a young fellow, 15 years old, working out there. 
His first paycheque was $300 minus $87 in taxes. 
He told my son ``Tell your dad what is going on here''. 
What do we get from the budget? 
Otherwise there would have been no tax relief. 
They won't get another chance.  
Hopefully the election is next year. 
What did they do in the budget? 
The HRDC fiasco has shown what is happening to the grants. 
The same applies to EDC. 
We are talking of federal tax. 
Let me tell him that it was on the backs of the provincial governments.  
I tell the Liberals this is the 21st century. 
It is time for change. 
Welcome to the Canadian Alliance.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
I believe the member should check his numbers. 
Maybe he would like to table the numbers in the House.  
It is for the spouses so there certainly would be tax.  
Let us talk about that family. 
Let us go back to the GST issue the member was talking about. 
We can see how he is twisting numbers. 
It goes to show how the numbers are twisted by the government.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I am sure all of Canada is very proud of the member. 
That is a fact. 
I would like his comments on that.  
I agree with him on that point.  
I have some statistics. 
Even the Minister of Industry agrees with that. 
I hope I have answered the question.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):
I was rather disappointed in his comments. 
I thought they were quite inflammatory toward our party.  
I am speaking as a member of parliament from the Canadian Alliance party. 
I want the House and the Canadian people to know that.  
He made disparaging remarks toward people that built this country. 
I do not believe those comments should go unchallenged. 
I do not think that is acceptable nor should they remain unchallenged. 
They are the people who built this country. 
The Liberals may snicker and smile and I see some of them doing that. 
It is absolutely unjustified. 
I will make very direct reference to the comments of the member for Waterloo-Wellington. 
How are they managed? 
That is more important than setting the budget itself. 
HRDC is a prime example. 
A new budget was tabled. 
Look at the new budget. 
The taxpayer is looking very carefully at what the government is doing. 
Defence has been in the news a lot over the last year and a half. 
It has suffered tremendously. 
It has been starved to death. 
The amount is not a lot when it is divided over three years. 
It will not stop the rust out. 
It just prolongs the problem. 
There is no long range plan from this side of the House. 
Everything is done on an ad hoc basis. 
The long range plan is 15 to 20 years down the road. 
That is how far one should look. 
Depending on what the plan is.  
It would depend on what the plan is. 
The key point is to make our military combat capable. 
I totally agree with that. 
The reserves should be factored in and should be part of the whole mobilization plan. 
Unfortunately, that is not the case.  
It is over $900 billion. 
Our budget is just a little over $10 billion. 
Our troop numbers are still being cut down. 
That should not happen. 
Unfortunately, so much that the military does goes unnoticed. 
That is where the Canadian Alliance is coming from. 
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
We can dress them up but we cannot take them anywhere.  
We will give tax reductions and increase spending at the same time. 
I heard them talk about the flat taxes. 
We can do that in a progressive system as well.  
That is what the so-called CAs envision. 
By the way, I also object to their name. 
I happen to be a chartered accountant, as are some of my colleagues. 
These people are now calling themselves a professional designation by stealth. 
The member is wondering where the money will come from. 
To whom does all the billions of dollars go?  
They barely have an identify left. 
Accountability and priority are the keys. 
What is the priority? 
We have a need for security. 
We live in a global environment with a lot more threats. 
He should ask his own constituents what they think. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):
What is happening here?  
I wonder if my hon. colleague could briefly address that question.  
It has been a concern to the Canadian people for a long time.  
What are the priorities on this side of the House? 
Unfortunately that does not exist on that side of the House.  
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to join in this debate. 
I followed it this morning and it has been very interesting. 
Let us take a closer look at some of these initiatives. 
These environmental technologies are much longer term investments. 
We need to invest in these technologies because we need to demonstrate that they work. 
These investments are very timely and definitely significant.  
The Kyoto file is a very interesting file. 
Some critics have said that $700 million falls short of what is required. 
Almost three-quarters of a billion dollars is certainly a good start.  
Let us take highways as an example. 
How do we approach such a challenge? 
Our highways and infrastructure are fundamental to a competitive economy. 
I think those kinds of creative approaches could turn this ship around. 
It is an item in the budget that did not get a lot of attention. 
This may have been accurate at one time but things have changed.  
Is anyone talking about whether Canadians are happy? 
If we did not have that, our well-being would be significantly affected.  
My background is one of business. 
When I say ``we'' I mean governments at all levels. 
I really think we need to take another look at it.  
The Atlantic cod is a classic example. 
What we count and what we measure signifies what we value. 
It is not unlike the ISO process that businesses have gone through. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
It is a great initiative. 
My question is for the hon. member. 
We have done that for over 200 years. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for an interesting question. 
We have to earmark for things like sewer and water.  
I keep coming back to the larger issue. 
Statistics Canada already keeps track of many of these things. 
I say this as an outsider. 
It has constantly butt heads with economic factors. 
That is why I underscore the significance of the indicators announcement. 
I will give the member an example. 
Germany has a program called lifetime products stewardship. 
It does not go to a landfill site. 
Let us look at what has happened over time. 
That is built-in obsolescence. 
That all ends up in landfill sites. 
We need to shift the sands and take a different approach. 
It starts with Canadians being informed about problems and priorities. 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
I want to talk about the areas of health care and education. 
I want to be frank. 
The same thing applies in the area of education. 
That is the area into which we have to put our investment.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Even Elections Canada does not recognize the name Canadian Alliance. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Very well, I will take the hon. member's point under consideration. 
We certainly will come back to the House with an answer.  
FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE 
The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the amendment.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
He will submit his report by the end of the year.  
The Canadian government is very transparent, much more so than any other in the world. 
My constituents are very pleased by the way this government has been managing public finances. 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
I urge him to tone down the hype. 
What a candid admission of guilt. 
The minister acknowledges that the rates are higher than those needed by the program.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member went over a number of items. 
He talked about additional tax cuts. 
He talked about another $1 billion for shipbuilding. 
Right now we are presenting a balanced budget. 
He is surprised that I would make such a statement. 
I never claimed that the budget does not include tax cuts. 
The member asked where the money would come from. 
He seemed to be implying that I was proposing an increase in spending. 
The government is obviously not meeting these expectations.  
These trusts will intervene in the fields of education or health care or both.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
This is really hiding one's head in the sand like an ostrich. 
The house is burning down, but ``Everything's fine, just great, so worry not''.  
The good news that has been so long awaited has been put off until later. 
Taxes will be lowered later; we will have to wait. 
As I have already said, it will likely be announced during the election campaign.  
They are telling the taxpayers to be patient. 
That is clear: $17 billion.  
Why did he not do it earlier? 
Because it was very lucrative. 
My colleague explained this earlier. 
It merely means that next year an individual's taxes will not go up. 
Indexing the tax tables merely means that people will not pay more.  
The big losers in this budget are the provinces. 
But the public is not stupid. 
The Minister of Finance tells us that he did provide an increase. 
This is how it happened. 
This is the problem.  
Another problem generated by this budget is that of social housing and infrastructures. 
In the case of social housing, it is nothing short of outrageous. 
In the first year, it will provide $100 million for all the provinces. 
There is worse to come-the employment insurance plan. 
This budget provides no improvement to the employment insurance plan. 
Ten cents a year is so ridiculous. 
In four years, it will be 40 cents. 
He is using the unemployed as if they were his milk cows. 
This is a horrible and unacceptable situation.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for my hon. colleague from the Bloc Quebecois party.  
We hope that does not happen in the next budget. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for this fine question.  
I think we have a good health insurance plan in Canada. 
It also covers all of the most disadvantaged. 
Everyone can therefore obtain treatment without cost. 
It is accessible, and the care is good.  
It sees in this a share of the market. 
Private enterprise is putting enormous pressure on the governments. 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
There was a very impressive response. 
The government has responded. 
The second most important priority was health care. 
The government, notwithstanding the comments of the member from the Bloc, has responded. 
The government has responded.  
People were concerned about investment in research, science and technology. 
The government has responded.  
Canadians are concerned about health care. 
I can only conclude that this is a well balanced budget. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the words of the hon. member. 
We know that we have an aging population. 
Let me first correct something the member said. 
In Ontario alone that meant nearly $1 billion extra.  
That is 25% in just two years.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to return to the environment for a second. 
The legislation to address this will come forth in the next little while. 
Why would the government not accept the investment in time that those groups have made? 
The Minister of the Environment has chosen to ignore that particular initiative.  
Mr. Speaker, I do not think anything could be further from the truth. 
The work of the working group has very much guided the development of the legislation.  
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
I will, but I will be honest and factual at the same time.  
Seven years ago this country was at an economic low. 
Nine years of the Mulroney government had played havoc with our federal debt. 
It may even have hit the New Zealand wall that everybody talks about.  
The top three priorities- 
HRDC, $1.2 billion?  
No, Mr. Speaker, the member is absolutely wrong. 
That is what the survey said.  
Where did the government put the HRDC money then?  
That is the problem.  
These priorities were right in line with what the budget delivered. 
Budget 2000 has something for everybody. 
It is a good deal.  
We are lowering taxes when the nation's finances allow us to do so. 
These cuts have already been paid for through three consecutive balanced budgets. 
To make strides in our economy it takes more than lowering personal income tax. 
Over 1.8 million new jobs have been created since then. 
This means the government is held accountable on a continuous basis.  
People in my riding are very interested in protecting the environment. 
My constituents were happy with the budget. 
I have not to date received one phone call complaining about the budget. 
I can remember back in 1993 my fax machine going crazy. 
We could not keep paper in it. 
There were no tax increases.  
My constituents were afraid that we were going to be like the previous government. 
Canadians are very comfortable and very confident in the government's management of the country.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
The hon. member across the way talked about the GST. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
He certainly did not hesitate to stab his leader in the back.  
Of course I stand up for the interest of farmers. 
I was out west at least three times last year. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Would the member respond to those two issues, please?  
The Canadian navy is brand new again. 
There are contracts already let out to replace the Sea Kings. 
I believe that will happen next year. 
More money is being put into defence as a result of this budget. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
I would like to point out missed opportunities. 
To get the basic premise, let us look at where the surplus came from. 
People seem to have forgotten about this issue. 
Obviously the government would have a surplus.  
That is $700 million a month, not a year. 
We should be well aware of that before we go into the main arguments.  
The government stumbled upon another windfall. 
That is the second source of revenue.  
Anybody could do that.  
The Liberals failed to listen to Canadians in the prebudget consultation. 
They did tour the country to listen to Canadians. 
The number one priority was to fix our health care system.  
It is so small that it is almost insignificant. 
It is offensive frankly. 
They said what they needed and the government did not listen to them. 
Instead, what did the government choose to do? 
How is that for skewed priorities? 
They wanted their health care system back. 
They wanted all these issues fixed.  
Canadians wanted something done about child poverty. 
That was the lowest depth of Dante's inferno. 
The federal government owns 50,000 buildings. 
It spends billions of dollars a year in energy costs. 
Many of those buildings are outdated, obsolete and are absolute energy hogs. 
They waste energy and they pollute.  
That was a year and a half ago. 
They have not done diddley-squat in that regard. 
They could be the example. 
They should set the example for the private sector to do the same. 
It was another missed opportunity.  
That should be the goal. 
That is why we are here. 
Let us do what is right in a way that would really move society forward.  
If we leave a significant number of people behind, we do not really move forward. 
Freedom is only privilege extended unless it is enjoyed by all people. 
That is a basic tenet that we must adhere to.  
If money is not an issue, what does that lead us to believe? 
That the government just does not care about that subject. 
Money is not an obstacle. 
The government has barrels of money. 
It has money coming out of its ears.  
The budget does nothing to move society forward as a whole. 
We do not move forward unless we all move forward together. 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
I would like the hon. member to respond to that.  
That is still $4 billion less in actual spending than it was before.  
They want cash on the barrelhead. 
That is what they told us. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
This is one of the better ideas I have ever come across in the House. 
Both sides of the House passed that motion. 
Mr. Speaker, I am very glad to elaborate on this subject.  
There are 50,000 federally owned public buildings in the country. 
Only about 100 have had significant energy retrofitting done to them. 
It is almost 2 o'clock so we will go to statements by members.  
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
LEADER OF THE OFFICIAL OPPOSITION 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Canadian Alliance):
Now I can fire away directly across from the Prime Minister.  
I want to thank my husband Lew for his wonderful unconditional love and support. 
I would like to thank my family who have been there with me all along. 
I would like to thank the entire House of Commons.  
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Let us use this opportunity to boost public transportation. 
Let us give tax breaks for public transit passes. 
Let us assist the municipalities and the private sector in promoting public transportation.  
Natural gas heating should be extended. 
Let us do even more to support our ethanol plants.  
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
The challenge is for Canadians to get involved by rolling up their sleeves.  
Together we can make a difference. 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
THE LATE HAMED NASTOH 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Canadian Alliance):
It must not be tolerated.  
Bullies survive through intimidation. 
They thrive on fear, the victim's fear to come forward. 
The victim usually moves to another school and the bully finds a new victim.  
Hamed's death was preventable. 
I plead with young people to speak up. 
I beg of parents to listen and watch for the signs. 
I demand of educators to identify and remove the predators.  
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Canadian film industry is a key player on the international scene.  
The federal government supports Canadian talent. 
In 1997-98, these credits totalled $21 million.  
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, today is World Theatre Day.  
Happy World Theatre Day.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, the race is on. 
It is an exciting time to be in Canadian politics. 
They understand and accept what Canadians are saying. 
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, last night was the time for cultural awards.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Not a penny of that money has even been received. 
Lawyers are getting paid. 
Bureaucrats are being hired. 
Will the health minister not retrace his steps- 
The hon. member for Etobicoke-Lakeshore.  
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Friday, March 24 was World Tuberculosis Day. 
Tuberculosis is killing more people today than ever before. 
The yearly deaths attributed to TB are 2 million. 
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
The people of this country are fed up. 
They want the government to act and to pay out the promised compensation. 
The lawyers have had their money, but the victims are still waiting.  
It is obvious that Canadians find this government's inertia shocking. 
CANADIAN AID FOR CHERNOBYL 
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
It pays to be ``maitres chez nous''.  
It seems obvious to me that it pays to be ``maitres chez nous''. 
I believe that sovereignty will provide even greater rewards.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Here we are today and the tragedy continues. 
Thousands of hepatitis C victims were excluded from compensation. 
Not one penny has gone to those victims. 
How can this government, in all good conscience, live with its terrible decision? 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):
The Calgary woman had been swept into the sea by a large wave.  
David and Brodi both attended William Aberhart School. 
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
In this year's federal budget it will receive only $271 million. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to announce a new birth. 
The Canadian Alliance was born this weekend. 
It weighed in at 91.9. 
The new extended family is very excited and mama is back at work already.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The last time we changed our name was in 1867. 
We would not need that sort of thing to remain in opposition.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
There was an internal audit done and the results were damning. 
A follow-up audit was done nearly a year later. 
No matter how many audits come out, the results seem to be the same. 
The response is ``insufficient''. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We are applying the criteria. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister is talking about HRDC. 
Certainly there are problems there. 
But we are talking about problems today in CEDA. 
That is not going, no matter how many audits they come up with.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, we see another coincidence here. 
It sat on the latest one for over a year.  
We have internal audits on a yearly basis. 
We are monitoring the situation properly.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):
Three successive audits in a row have come to the same conclusion. 
The problem is still systemic and it is still in this department. 
They have not fixed a thing.  
This raises the questions:
Mr. Speaker, I simply do not know exactly where the members are going. 
I guess it must be part of their dream.  
On a yearly basis the Economic Development Agency has internal audits. 
We keep focusing on the reports. 
We are monitoring the situation in a very proper manner.  
We have been involved in economic development for quite some time. 
We are pleased with the results we have provided people. 
We will keep working on the economic development of the region. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
They are misquoting him again.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Despite the many revelations in the Placeteco matter, no investigation has been called.  
We are very close to ascribing motives. 
I will ask members to choose their words very carefully.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the answer is no.  
They match the funds we have given. 
Therefore there is no need to establish an overpayment.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Is he concerned about his leadership? 
What is the problem?  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
There has to be a basis upon which to call for a police investigation. 
Our review of this file suggests there is no basis. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
This file does not make sense. 
The more we get answers, the less clear things become. 
An investigation would be in order for much less than that. 
The Prime Minister was quicker on the draw in the case of CITEC.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, again the member is making allegations. 
If he wants to make allegations he should bring them forward.  
If he wants to make allegations, let him do that and we will investigate.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister went to Calgary. 
He met with the premier, and he blinked.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I was extremely clear with the premier. 
Otherwise money would have been cut in the transfer for social programs.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Everything is not fine. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have done it once. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
The minister spoke of the basis for investigation. 
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):
What did the auditors find? 
They found that the program was too flexible. 
It was not applied uniformly across the province. 
Do we now have Industry Canada adopting HRDC's management style?  
They are Reformers, former Reformers. 
The hon. member for Peace River.  
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):
What kind of monitoring is that?  
It is across all government departments. 
The main concern of members on the other side is not the question of management. 
They would have destroyed all economic development area agencies.  
The results are amazing. 
The hon. member for Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans.  
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we believe that the paramount issue here is road safety. 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the minister refers to consultations. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Canadian Alliance):
The hon. opposition whip.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Canadian Alliance):
We make the difference in all the regions.  
What I have shows that we are doing good work in the regions as Liberals.  
I am sure we want to hear both the questions and the answers.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, Canada has special problems in the petroleum industry.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
First of all, it was suggested by Liberal members. 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Canadian Alliance):
HRDC is not alone. 
Mr. Speaker, as I said back in 1995, we changed our mission. 
We have developed brand new programming. 
Actually we are dealing with and getting involved in the regions with two main programs.  
The hon. member for South Surrey-White Rock-Langley.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that the minister actually read the audit. 
Now we learn of similar problems with the Department of Industry. 
How long has the Department of Industry been mismanaging taxpayer dollars?  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
However, I must say that it is functioning well.  
Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
Today the task force issued its report ``Gateway to Canada''. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is a very good day for Toronto and for Canada. 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):
There is too much flexibility, insufficient monitoring and lack of compliance. 
After three audits the problems remain. 
I remind the hon. member to please not use any props.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):
He still does not get it. 
I have all the reports- 
I would ask that this type of thing not occur again in the House. 
The hon. minister may answer the question.  
Mr. Speaker, you have seen what they just did. 
To keep up such behaviour has to be seen as a lack of judgment. 
I would like to tell the House that we are working with the auditor general. 
PUBLIC WORKS AND GOVERNMENT SERVICES 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
We work with the agencies and all the departments involved. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I can tell the hon. minister how many. 
It will be a 500 year program to energy retrofit its buildings. 
The government is devoid of ideas. 
The demand side management of our energy resources is an idea whose time has come. 
Why will the government not get on with it?  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
I think she doth protest too much.  
The minister has referred many times to the 19 that are currently under way. 
We would like to know about more.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Will she undertake to table those documents in the House?  
Separate from that, three of them involve investigations into provincial involvement. 
Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Middlesex, Lib.):
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
The document to which hon. member refers is only a reference document. 
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Canadian Alliance):
We are dealing basically with- 
We will hear the response from the minister.  
We proceed with improvements on a yearly basis. 
I am proud of the work which is done by the agency. 
We are going to keep working with the regions. 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
Two months later, there is still no action.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
We are continuing to consider the information they are providing.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Is it any wonder? 
Two years ago the same minister made another promise. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Every NDP government in the country supported us in that and continue to support us. 
Every government went before the courts and had the agreement approved. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
However, the government has chosen to ignore it. 
This is another circumstance where a borrowed par record on the green is not acceptable.  
Why will the Minister of the Environment not accept the recommendations of SARWG?  
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
The reality is that the minister will introduce species at risk legislation. 
He has been working very hard on it and it will be a good bill.  
CANADIAN ALLIANCE-SPEAKER'S RULING 
The hon. member for Wentworth-Burlington is in his seat. 
Is he aware of the question of privilege which was brought up? 
He signals to me that he is. 
Would the hon. member like to make an intervention? 
The hon. member for Wentworth-Burlington.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am very surprised by the attack made by the Canadian Alliance Party. 
You will forgive me if I reply at some length.  
In it you will find no such reference. 
Last Friday the whip for the Reform Party went on to say: 
What is it that I actually said following your ruling on March 21? 
Just to be doubly sure, I repeated it and said: 
In fact, Mr. Speaker, in your own words, you said: 
The answer is, yes. 
Is that what the question is?  
So, Mr. Speaker, that is clear. 
Well, yes, some peace.  
It is Prince George-Peace River, I would remind the hon. member.  
Mr. Speaker, I am sorry, but I am suffering. 
I am coming to that as well.  
On Wednesday I had a sore throat and was afraid I had strep throat. 
I do not want you to become ill''. 
It is a prescription.  
I invite the hon. member to bring it to a close.  
I think we are getting the picture. 
I do not want to get into more debate. 
Of course I hope the hon. member will recover soon. 
I see the hon. whip of the Canadian Alliance is on his feet now. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Canadian Alliance):
That is one thing that all members can be sure of. 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions I would like to present today. 
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Canadian Alliance):
Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have the honour to present two petitions to the House.  
Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
There is a hunger strike under way dealing with this issue. 
Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, today I have two petitions to present. 
One is from the Canada Family Action Coalition. 
Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the second petition is from the Organization of Rural Route Mail Couriers. 
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. John O'Reilly (Haliburton-Victoria-Brock, Lib.):
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
They call upon parliament to preserve the reference to God in the Constitution of Canada. 
Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Question No. 64 will be answered today. 
Question No. 64- Mr. John Williams: 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
(c) See (b) above.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Canadian Alliance):
On October 18, 1999 I asked Question No. 29. 
I would like those questions answered.  
I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
I visited to speak to them about their concerns. 
They were pretty disappointed. 
It is basically a program that will institutionalize shelters. 
Several homeless people died in the city of Toronto. 
I wanted to know their reaction to the budget. 
How many times have we heard government members talk about the children's agenda? 
There are no dollars allocated for this purpose. 
Canada's children deserve more than rhetoric. 
That is what the Canadian Teachers' Federation had to say.  
The government has failed miserably on that score. 
There are now 50% more children than there were in 1989 living in poverty. 
The real proof is in the numbers. 
It begs the questions:
Is this a budget that is based on any sort of principle of equality? 
It will not even cover inflation.  
This is particularly offensive. 
Finally, it is no better on the health care front. 
The budget fails on that score as well. 
Instead it decided to implement tax cuts, which basically favour the rich over the poor. 
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
These were the first new grants in higher education for many years.  
There will be junior and senior professorships. 
Students will be employed.  
The granting councils over the last several years have received considerable additional funds. 
I have not even mentioned the millennium scholarships.  
If she has, I would be glad to hear it. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for his question. 
We believe very much that there must be federal dollars. 
Unfortunately that does not exist.  
I remind the member that it was his government that brought in the CHST. 
That is why we are in a mess now. 
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and Youth), Lib.):
I should not forget rural development. 
Budget 2000 is an achievement of historic proportions. 
We have tackled the burdensome and ballooning deficit left by the previous government. 
We have increased job creation. 
We have launched a strategy to invest in Canadians.  
We have a new government. 
We have a new premier, Premier Kakfwi who is of aboriginal descent. 
This budget is not separate from that. 
We look to a strong partnership with the federal government. 
The national unemployment rate is at its lowest level in 24 years. 
The Canadian economy is growing. 
These are facts that not even the opposition can deny.  
This record of achievement is what Canadians elected us to do.  
We will not leave anyone behind as we move forward in this new century. 
We believe in access of opportunity.  
These speak loudly to my constituents.  
Two diamond mines are in operation. 
Presently we get $19,000 per capita for the individuals in my riding.  
We hope to develop a partnership with the federal government on devolution. 
That means a sharing of the revenues, a sharing of the authorities, powers and responsibilities. 
This is what the government in my territory is proposing to do. 
This partnership is a sound approach for prosperity, for participation and for equity.  
Now the aboriginal people are saying they want this development. 
That means a great deal of self-sustainability for our community.  
The budget is not separate from that. 
We believe we can do best in partnership.  
This is a significant investment. 
That is not the way in which governments or economies work.  
That is of particular concern to me. 
This budget will now support new environmental initiatives.  
These people are looking at the incidence of deaths related to cancer. 
An hon. member from the other side presented a petition today. 
I support that petition. 
We do not separate ourselves from this budget. 
This budget is very relevant to the things we want to do. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):
She makes eminently good sense. 
That is perfectly legitimate. 
It is the kind of thing I would expect any member of parliament to do.  
The job creation schemes have to be paid for through tax increases to someone. 
People are paying additional taxes to pay for these job schemes. 
Where does it come from? 
Could the hon. member address this issue? 
I wonder if she could comment on that.  
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:
Unemployment is very high. 
I come from an area where we must diversify the economy. 
We do not need a hand out; we need a hand up. 
Northerners take good advantage. 
We do not have huge industries. 
We have to invest in training and development.  
As it is today, the majority of our workers are coming from outside the territories. 
This was much needed funding and it was used very well. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member made reference to the pensioners in the area. 
She has highly supported the petition that came in. 
Those who are left are now having their pensions wiped out.  
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:
I have the utmost respect for his judgment and thinking.  
We are not looking to blame someone. 
We are not into that. 
We want to find solutions.  
I feel that their story has to be told. 
The budget put forward a plan of tax reduction of some $54 billion. 
It also dealt with the issue of debt reduction. 
I will quote a piece of the speech that the Minister of Finance made. 
-there are major differences between urban and rural communities.  
We simply have to take a look at some of those issues. 
Let us take the issue of geography. 
Let us look at the whole issue of population density. 
Let us look at the economy of rural Canada. 
It is very different from an urbanized, diversified, manufacturing based economy.  
I believe it does.  
This is our own billion dollar program. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Canadian Alliance):
I particularly want to address the minister in charge of rural development.  
I am a little surprised that the hon. member speaks that way. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
My riding of West Nova is very rural. 
I heard the secretary of state talk about supporting our rural communities. 
What does my hon. colleague think of that?  
Mr. Speaker, I am happy to hear from the member for West Nova. 
He makes a very good point. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to have an opportunity to speak to this debate. 
I know we are all looking forward to his speech.  
Budgets are more than just about numbers. 
I want to talk about what the government is not doing in the budget. 
In 1988 Canada went to the polls on the initiative of free trade. 
We have had an enormous amount of economic growth over the last seven years. 
From where has that enormous growth come? 
We are now at another milestone in the country's development. 
I call this an amazing coincidence. 
We are lagging behind our trading partners. 
The reason for it is that we cannot keep wealth in this country.  
It happened in Ireland. 
It happened in Finland. 
Now it has a very growth oriented economy. 
It happened with the economy of Ontario. 
This is the blueprint. 
This means paying down our national debt. 
Let us make sure that we lower the taxes. 
I know you are of Celtic heritage as well, Mr. Speaker. 
I spoke a few moments ago about the Celtic tiger. 
Today that is simply not the case. 
It may be a bit more than that; I am starting to age. 
For that to quadruple in this period of growth is a national shame.  
There is one solid thing on which I would like to compliment the finance minister. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):
They continued to add to it with deficits every year.  
During that era the Reform Party actually took flight. 
It doubled in a number of economies. 
That is the context in which this debate should always be phrased. 
It was part of the western world. 
It happened in Germany under Chancellor Kohl as well. 
History will speak for itself in that regard.  
I thank the member for his constructive question.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
I do so with a deep sense of regret and disappointment. 
Canadians can no longer afford to wait much longer. 
They deserve significant tax relief now. 
Naturally, Canadians expected to hear about significant tax breaks in the finance minister's budget. 
Why should Canadians celebrate this budget? 
That is not acceptable.  
We certainly do not want to see such a system. 
I represent West Nova which is predominantly a rural community.  
They did not have adequate upkeep because of lack of funding. 
Some of these wharves were damaged beyond repair.  
What was the answer to the repair question? 
The government is neglecting our rural communities. 
It is not so. 
The Liberals' words say one thing and their actions say something else.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
The answer in the provinces all too often has been simply to cut spending. 
In my own province of Ontario that has been the typical attitude. 
The Harris government began with that principle.  
I have just had a note passed to me. 
I believe that there is an opportunity now. 
I think there is an enormous opportunity, if government seized the opportunity. 
In a way, I would like to think that I am part of that equation. 
What a marvellous, marvellous move that would be.  
She just sort of jumped the gun a bit. 
What she did was, she said ``All right, you can have all of these documents''. 
Inevitably, Mr. Speaker, there are going to be problems. 
I think that is entirely possible.  
I have read the American freedom of information act. 
Actually, I have 60 backbench MPs on the Liberal side who support it. 
The opportunity is in this next year. 
If we can spend well we can save well.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to what my colleague across the way had to say. 
I think that he misses a key point when he makes that suggestion. 
I have no problem with being transparent. 
That is the key question that needs to be answered by the government.  
I think it is a given that high taxes destroy jobs. 
What is the hon. member's response to that?  
There are tens of thousands of purchases made by government. 
There are thousands and thousands of grants and contributions out there. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my Alliance colleague was right. 
That is precisely my argument.  
But we cannot see that.  
I have had spending in my riding that has taken me completely by surprise. 
I did not know about it. 
Mr. Julian Reed (Halton, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is indeed an honour to rise to debate the budget. 
What a difference seven years makes. 
I am no fan of deficit budgeting. 
There was a deficit when the Tories took over. 
In half the time they doubled the debt. 
It was becoming a travesty. 
It has changed the whole complexion of governance. 
This last budget consisted of an initial thrust into comprehensive tax cutting. 
We are into a new world, a new experience. 
The ghosts of abuse?  
Letters of thanks have come in to the offices of members. 
How many young people were able to experience their first job because of that money? 
That is what that money was intended for, and that is where it went.  
As the next few months come along that evidence will be falling into place. 
However, other funding came in to Halton for other kinds of purposes. 
We all see evidence that comes to us every now and again. 
It is twice the size of Prince Edward Island.  
In China the figure is something like 95 million should the oceans rise.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member. 
I am very sympathetic to the real problem the member raised. 
We are certainly doing everything we can within the limits of the available funding. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Canadian Alliance):
Madam Speaker, the hon. member made a comment. 
He told us to talk to the recipients of grants. 
I have a question. 
Why not talk to all the people who are donating the money? 
They are the taxpayers of the entire country. 
He tells us to talk to the people who are getting jobs because of it. 
What about all the people who are having their jobs destroyed because of it?  
In my province of Saskatchewan farmers have to move off the land. 
Their livelihood, their jobs are being destroyed because of high taxation. 
I talk to the people every election time.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):
I am not against taxation per se. 
Madam Speaker, I was a farmer. 
No they are not. 
Which ones are not deductible?  
Excise tax on fuel.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):
Madam Speaker, I find this debate very interesting and enjoyable. 
I wish to address the budget from a principled point of view. 
It has to do with what exactly is a budget. 
A budget reveals the values and the priorities of the government. 
I wish to present four very elementary principles of what a budget should do. 
First, it should be achievable. 
Second, it should be sustainable. 
Third, it should help Canadians achieve their goals and objectives. 
Finally, it should help Canadians realize their dreams.  
How did budget 2000 fair on those principles? 
First, is it achievable? 
I suppose if interest rates do not rise very much, it is achievable. 
The way it stands now it will not do that. 
So it is not sustainable.  
It will not allow Canadians to achieve their goals and objectives either. 
I cannot achieve the goals and objectives that I want. 
The budget fails on at least three of the four principles we talked about.  
Is it to pay down the debt? 
That is a 200 year vision to pay down the debt.  
I looked at it and it sounded really good. 
Let me give members a specific example. 
That is some cut.  
What would the Canadian Alliance do? 
How do I know that? 
I know it by solution 17.  
Solution 17 is a single rate tax. 
It is unfair, it is inequitable and it does not build strong families.  
There is another part to this. 
It will also help to reduce the brain drain. 
It will also encourage the entrepreneurial spirit of young people. 
We will have a universal child care deduction of $3,000 per child. 
What will this do? 
It will support the freedom of choice. 
Here is a tax plan that will do that. 
What is the great benefit of this? 
It has all the advantages for which we could possibly dream. 
That is the kind of tax plan we need. 
The small business tax was reduced from 12% to 10%. 
That is what the Canadian Alliance would do, and it is solution 17.  
How does it differ from budget 2000? 
First, it differs remarkably by being specific, clear and sustainable. 
That is the big difference. 
It was not our people who did it. 
The tax reduction proposals of the Reform Party, now the Canadian Alliance, are affordable. 
That is very significant and we should pay very careful attention to it.  
It is time for a change. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Is there a plan for us to actually pay down the debt?  
Mr. Speaker, there is as far as the Canadian Alliance is concerned. 
The world has changed dramatically in the last while. 
It is now a global economy. 
A major part of our economic benefit comes from trade with other nations. 
We benefit from them and they benefit from us. 
It is a mutual and beautiful symbiotic relationship.  
If there was a downturn in the American economy would it affect us? 
It is simply nonsensical to suggest that it would not affect us. 
Do we have a plan to deal with that situation? 
For payroll taxes, it is 27 cents. 
For the sales tax it is roughly 17 cents. 
For capital costs it is $1.15 for every $1.  
What is the net gain? 
It is not nearly as much as what the government is suggesting. 
It kills jobs in other places. 
It kills expansion and it does not last.  
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
I believe very strongly in the balanced approach. 
He knows well that the economy depends on all sorts of things. 
I believe in paying down the debt. 
I believe in tax cuts. 
We have made tax cuts once we had balanced the books.  
I do strongly believe in reinvestment. 
It is a balanced approach.  
The member keeps using a term that I do not understand. 
What is this Canadian Alliance he keeps speaking about?  
Madam Speaker, that is absolutely tremendous. 
The Canadian Alliance is the alternative to the Liberal government. 
This is a brand new party that has just been created. 
That is the Canadian Alliance.  
Let us pay down the debt so we have a balanced budget.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Canadian Alliance):
I certainly agree that the economy is doing well. 
Let us start with health care. 
Education also seems to be underfunded. 
I do not understand it.  
This may be part of the answer to my second question. 
That first nation which I spoke of is a real sad situation. 
Those are sad commentaries on how the government is handling its budget. 
It is the government's responsibility in dealing with the budget to deal with problems. 
This was done in time for spring seeding. 
The money is already on the way.  
The budget failed to do a number of things. 
That is something that could have been done.  
We still have not seen that.  
The government has an opportunity in a budget to reduce taxes. 
The government continues to charge user fees. 
Fighting high foreign subsidies is also something the government could be doing. 
Its economic theory sounded a lot like that of the New Democratic Party. 
It was a pretty interesting presentation.  
I will conclude by saying what farmers do want. 
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
It is 10 cents a litre on gasoline. 
I would support lowering these taxes.  
The member misquoted one of my colleagues. 
I see the problem this way. 
The following week it was back up at the same level. 
The hon. member asked about the G-8 countries. 
We need to eliminate the four cents.  
We remember the fiasco that caused. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
The reduction in the subsidies was a big problem.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Canadian Alliance):
This young man took off some grain during damp weather. 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
I am not trying to be difficult. 
Maybe they are all going to bunk together and have a pyjama party. 
That is a possibility.  
With the limousine there is a chauffeur. 
That is why they call them limos, I am told.  
What about all the staff time? 
There is the real boondoggle.  
There is the real boondoggle. 
I wish I had thought of it.  
It seems to me that the Canadian Alliance and principles is an oxymoron. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member has somewhat of a point. 
I would ask the hon. member to keep his speech on the budget.  
I do not mind the fact that they would raise some concern about that. 
Let us talk about health care. 
If that would not have an impact on the budget- 
That is a lie.  
The member says that is a lie. 
I can tell members what it would be replaced with. 
We could look at delivery mechanisms.  
I do not want to single out members of the fifth party. 
Let us talk about health care. 
This government is committed. 
The CHST payments have an established floor of a $11.5 billion. 
We put an additional $2.5 billion on the table for health care. 
They left it sitting in a trust account, wisely invested I am sure.  
I do not understand. 
The health care system must be accountable. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
When will the government grow up and learn what a tax cut really is?  
This government bit the bullet. 
Now we are rewarding Canadians for their hard work by making those tax cuts.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
It is not just destined for health care.  
We will be initiating that. 
The budget certainly was not inclusive in that regard.  
The government has led the way in terms of economic development.  
I want to respond to the hon. member. 
We added $2.5 billion to it. 
That is not what the Canadian public wants.  
They cannot have it both ways. 
Mr. John Godfrey (Don Valley West, Lib.):
I particularly talk about the case of parents with young pre-school children.  
This will be an extraordinarily important and difficult operation. 
It goes beyond income. 
It goes to the matter of social cohesion. 
It goes to the things which will overcome income if we do it right.  
You have in your constituency, Mr. Speaker, a community which does this job. 
If we do our job well we reduce the risks all Canadian children experience.  
What is so terrifying about our situation? 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
They also failed to break their promise on the GST.  
This happens now in my province. 
I would like the hon. member's comments on that.  
Some of us believe it is an ideal toward which we should be working.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
The government has allocated more revenues with respect to the environment. 
Now it is the very smallest, the 21st largest.  
Is that why we had a bit of an augmentation in the environmental budget?  
It is very young children and very old people. 
The two are inextricably linked.  
The question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.
