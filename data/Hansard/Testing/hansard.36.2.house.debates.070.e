Mr. Speaker, my last petition is on the matter of taxes.

Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
CANADIAN INSTITUTES OF HEALTH RESEARCH ACT 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
I would like to remind hon. members of what the health research institutes will be. 
They will replace the Medical Research Council. 
It is said that these research institutes will not be centralized bricks-and-mortar facilities. 
They are virtual institutes. 
The Bloc Quebecois agrees with and supports the establishment of these virtual research centres. 
The stakes are very high. 
We also know that people live longer. 
We are in favour of this multidisciplinary approach. 
We know very well how it could promote science. 
All researchers want these virtual institutes to be implemented. 
There is a great demand for funds.  
I have attended the meetings of the Standing Committee on Health. 
Operations are supposed to start on April 1, 2000. 
This is a deadline to which researchers and the federal government are hanging on.  
We in the Bloc Quebecois are very vigilant. 
What bothers us is the words that are used.  
The bill goes beyond promoting research. 
It gives national mandates to the institutes, without the provinces' involvement. 
The Bloc Quebecois cannot support such a measure. 
The Bloc Quebecois agrees with that. 
That is why the Bloc Quebecois is proposing amendments. 
Our constituents are lobbying to have this bill adopted.  
It is very important to look at this bill. 
I know that this is a truly important social issue. 
We would not want our communities, our researchers and our universities to be penalized. 
This is not at all what we want to achieve by our amendments. 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
I would say that it is high time. 
We have the Heart Institute. 
We have to work in a positive way, not a negative way. 
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
We noticed that and it is fine with us. 
We are only asking that it comply with the constitution.  
He had already spoken to this group of amendments. 
This is an error, not a precedent.  
Is the House ready for the question?  
The question is on Motion No. 1. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The recorded division on Motion No. 1 stands deferred. 
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.

So, the money will not be invested in buildings.  
We know that research is an area that evolves rapidly. 
We want the scientists to be networked, to be linked together in networks. 
We have done exactly the same thing here. 
What are these areas of priority? 
That is the type of amendment we presented.  
There is one problem. 
Perhaps the hon. member for Quebec would give us a little smile. 
There is one problem and it is as follows. 
There are 13 references to the health care system in the bill. 
We are prepared to admit that research is an area of shared jurisdiction. 
We believe it is important that researchers be part of a network. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Health care research can have tremendous benefits. 
It can alleviate a lot of suffering. 
We need to use public money much more efficiently. 
That must be obvious to all of us.  
I could not agree more. 
Who will be on the selection committee? 
That is what I mean by getting down to the details.  
The president will make recommendations based on public selection processes. 
As I have said, there are many good parts to this bill. 
That should reduce the influence of high ranking government officials. 
Sometimes, because of political correctness, we exclude some of those areas.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
The Liberals just simply paid lip service to health care.  
I do not think it is going to work.  
We have a problem with the construction of the institutes. 
For starters, all of the appointments will be made by the Prime Minister. 
What does the term governor in council imply? 
We actually defined in my amendments what we mean by the health community. 
In fact, this is modelled after the U.S. example. 
There is no indication in the bill what the government is considering.  
I think what the Canadian people are demanding today is transparency in everything. 
There is no evidence of that in the bill. 
I would say that is the essential flaw in this piece of legislation before us.  
We do favour the replacement of the Medical Research Council with this institute. 
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
We have seen a whole series of absurdities. 
This surplus was accumulated by means of the Canada health and social transfer. 
Waiting lists show how people are paying for this now. 
There has been no consultation with the provinces. 
We want the provinces and Quebec to be consulted.  
What about the health research institutes? 
In 2001-2002, $500 million will be invested in these institutes. 
And yet, Quebecers foot 25% of the bill.  
A lot of people will be supplying the research centre, and that creates jobs. 
This is the new economy.  
We are paying 25%, but we are receiving only 14%. 
That is more or less how things stand, right now. 
We know about the scandal at Human Resources Development Canada. 
Unfortunately, as usual, Saint-Jean will end up empty-handed. 
These issues are a big concern to us.  
I say hats off to the Government of Quebec. 
Mr. Landry just brought down an excellent budget. 
The federal government did not do it. 
It is important that Quebecers know these facts. 
All this boils down to one single thing: encroachment, encroachment, encroachment. 
It is not too late to do the right thing. 
This is roughly what the Bloc amendments are all about. 
I do not think that this is the best way to manage money. 
We have always been against duplication, overlapping and encroachments. 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Those two elements both have to be taken into account as a priority every time.  
Earlier, my colleague touched on the subject of fairness. 
Unfortunately, it does not always work like that.  
We would like it to work. 
It does not make any difference here, in this region. 
This region is a model for the rest of the country. 
I say that this government listens and responds. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
That is not the problem. 
This morning, we are dealing with health. 
We are not questioning that. 
We know we have an international reputation. 
We have brought forward amendments that I think are reasonable and realistic. 
We do not want the federal government to support the health care system. 
This preamble should talk about support for research. 
We know that some provinces have certain research and development priorities. 
The federal government is being called to order. 
The Bloc Quebecois is not happy with the provinces' role in social services. 
We all know that the federal government is trying to nibble away at them. 
This is like treating the provinces like children. 
These areas are much too important to let the government have its way. 
The leeway the provinces now have is very important for them. 
The stakes are crucial for the future. 
It is clear it wants to stick its nose in the provinces' business.  
We will be the leaders in those areas''.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.) moved: 
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to debate Bill C-13. 
We have to go back to basics. 
Historically Canadians have done very well. 
They are in the forefront of health discoveries and advances throughout the world. 
They are numerous in my riding. 
The CIHR will literally change the way we fund and organize health research in Canada. 
It has virtual institutes and CIHR will focus on the critical health issues affecting Canadians. 
Second, CIHR will unite the four themes of health research. 
CIHR will now break down the old barriers and open up new opportunities. 
The third difference that the CIHR is about is the breadth of its mandate. 
Achieving these goals requires significant and sustained investment. 
It is a major step forward. 
It will provide a strong ethical framework for health research in Canada. 
The next step is getting this legislation going including getting through all these amendments. 
We need all of their co-operation and hard work.  
I want to thank all members of the House who have worked toward this goal. 
We have all worked very hard to do this.  
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
This motion will amend the preamble to the bill. 
With this amendment, we say explicitly that: 
It could not be clearer. 
So the provinces' point of view was integrated into the whole process.  
I would like to talk about certain other amendments brought forward by the opposition. 
Some amendments say that it should be restricted to medical research. 
These processes were explained many times. 
Amendments were proposed regarding the president's mandate. 
This is standard procedure for governor in council appointments.  
That Motion No. 56 be amended as follows: 
By replacing all of the words after the word ``reviewed'' with the following: 
``after five years by Parliament.''  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
This is trickery of the worst kind. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We are not going to get into debate on the content.  
The members were not here. 
They have to be present in the House. 
That is the procedure. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
What has transpired has transpired. 
Once that has been done, it has been done. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We gave our consent on that understanding. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It is not up to the Chair. 
All the Chair can do is present motions. 
It is up to the House to accept them or not to accept them. 
The House accepted them. 
What has been done has been done.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We will not get into debate on this. 
I will hear one more point of order from the hon. member for Ottawa Centre.  
He used the word- 
That is exactly what it was.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I would invite members to come- 
He used the word dishonest.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I invite the hon. member for Ottawa Centre to retake his seat. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We have gone down this road twice. 
We are not going down it again.  
Mr. Speaker, I simply want to make sure that- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
That amendment was not in the group of amendments we were speaking to. 
We did not have an opportunity to speak to it. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I thank the hon. member very much for his intervention. 
If there is a revision, I will be happy to advise the House.  
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Then somebody needs to stand to speak on debate.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I really want to thank all members for their interventions. 
Now we are on debate.  
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
I was listening to government and opposition members. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I call on your judgement, and the government's fair play. 
The House cannot operate that way.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
This is a very serious consideration. 
I will recognize the parliamentary secretary in a moment.  
I would invite members to approach the table for clarification. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
That is in fact the original motion.  
I was contacted and immediately came to the House. 
I agreed to do this and I came back to the House. 
I came to the House and I made the motion. 
This is not the proper way for business to be handled in the House. 
I apologize sincerely for upsetting the House with this matter. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
What is before the House is the amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
I will read from Beauchesne's 6th edition, pages 177 to 178: 
That is up to the House, or the Chair, to decide. 
I will go through this step by step, clause by clause. 
I think we have a case for this one. 
We touched on that.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The subsequent amendment was properly moved. 
It is not possible for the Chair to move it. 
It has to come from the House itself.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Does the hon. member have unanimous consent of the House?  
(Motion and amendment withdrawn) 
Mr. Speaker, one can easily get lost in this kind of debate. 
Some people who work there live in my riding. 
After Riviere-des-Mille-Iles.  
There is also Acadie-Bathurst.  
We are talking about scientific research. 
We understandably have concerns about Bill C-13.  
He just said it makes sense.  
I thank you, Mr. Speaker, for listening to me with interest.  
This is what worries parliamentarians. 
``No money, no candy'', as our friends in Ontario say, and ``no fun''.  
We can focus our economic development according to our skills and expertise. 
That is the problem for all regions, except Ontario. 
The breaking of the Liberals.  
Or the breaking of the Liberals.  
For the Liberals, chairs do not always have four identical legs. 
Yes, we are pleased about Bill C-13. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
There were, however, other concerns raised. 
I reject the amendment. 
The member still has three minutes for debate.  
I believe the House concurs with the importance of transparency and accountability. 
The hon. member is asking for unanimous consent of the House. 
Does the hon. member have permission to put the motion?  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I hope the member considers that. 
At this point, I have not been asked to make any ruling on that. 
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.

CITIZENSHIP OF CANADA ACT 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
The concept of citizenship may have a connotation and a definition that are purely legalistic. 
There is also the aspect of responsibilities.  
One had to be a British subject. 
Before 1947, a person could be Canadian provided he were a British subject. 
There are three or four elements characterizing the 1977 legislation.  
This is an important element. 
The act introduced a new concept: dual citizenship. 
From then on, people could have dual citizenship. 
I would like to highlight a few of the changes to the existing legislation. 
Technically, a child born in Canada is a Canadian citizen.  
These exceptions are maintained in the bill before us today.  
Then there is the whole question of the physical presence with regard to residency. 
As we often hear, it is like motherhood and apple pie. 
In Quebec, the whole issue of adoption comes under the Civil Code. 
( a ) was in the best interests of the child; 
( b ) created a genuine relationship of parent and child;- 
I want to read the oath of citizenship. 
The current oath reads as follows: 
The oath will be replaced by the following: 
I continue reading the new oath of citizenship: 
We admit that there must be an oath of allegiance. 
These documents were adopted, often unanimously, by the Quebec National Assembly.  
This is a document that was adopted by the National Assembly on December 10, 1986. 
It was passed by the National Assembly. 
This idea did not come out of the blue. 
The president of the Haitian Christian Community supported the amendments proposed by the Bloc Quebecois. 
I am pleased that the committee finally yielded to my arguments. 
However, we must not take too long to study this bill. 
This is quite a number. 
We can imagine the tragedy their families have to go through? 
Why does this happen? 
Because our system is vague, weak and inadequate.  
Bill C-16 is an important bill. 
I remind members of the immigration department's guidelines. 
I totally agree with that.  
We have seen Romanian children arriving by container in the Port of Montreal. 
I think these minors, these children, should be granted special status.  
No child shall be deprived of his or her liberty unlawfully or arbitrarily. 
I think we have a basic human rights problem here.  
We fear the commissioners might have to promote the values that symbolize Canadian citizenship. 
This is a concern.  
I see the member for Bourassa is reacting once again. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
We consider ourselves fiercely proud Canadian nationalists. 
We consider ourselves champions of this country. 
It is also how we view ourselves as a part of a community. 
First, they do threaten the whole concept of citizenship. 
Second, they threaten the concept of democracy. 
It gives people a forum to raise this much larger picture.  
Canadians want basic questions dealt with. 
Has anybody ever really had that debate in the House? 
How big should Canada be as a country? 
That was the goal. 
We are still way off. 
We have failed to achieve those goals, even although they are modified somewhat.  
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam, Lib.):
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
VISUAL AND MEDIA ARTS 
Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
The minister had nothing to lose by reopening the courts. 
Yet last Friday the justice minister denied Patrick Kelly his right to justice.  
SEMAINE D'ACTION CONTRE LE RACISME 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale, Lib.):
We strongly condemn attacks of violence against minorities and civilians.  
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
That is absolutely outrageous. 
Mr. Raymond Lavigne (Verdun-Saint-Henri, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt about the economic vigour of Canada. 
LIBERAL PARTY OF CANADA 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
So how are things, Jane? 
way I see it, all is well 
Although one item I should tell. 
And hardly worthy of report, 
HRDC a crisis faces, 
Humongous, but apart from that, 
Just fine, just great, so worry not.  
The party is in crisis deep.  
What say you, trait'rous minister?  
Give me your version of events.  
So small, so lacking in import 
And hardly worthy of report, 
The party lustre fades and dulls, 
The Leader, clinging, carries on 
Regardless, but apart from that, 
Just fine, just great, so worry not.  
One minister my job would have.  
How so, oh very shaky one?  
What is your version of events? 
One minister resign just might, 
Police my riding seem to like, 
Alliance members love our plight, 
The Bloc is moving up all right- 
Disaster, but apart from that, 
Just fine, just great, so worry not.  
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
I am talking about the opening of maple syrup season.  
Now we are all being rewarded with this glorious golden treat.  
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
This goes to the very heart of the problem. 
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, PC):
The livelihood of too many Maritime families is at stake.  
Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):
In addition to that, our researchers are innovating.  
These corporations promote local economies. 
They also help small businesses.  
The CFDCs take various initiatives to develop and diversify local economies. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
This is a political decision. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Why should taxpayers be assisting huge foreign firms to- 
The hon. Minister for International Trade.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
It actually got other private sector credit to do its transaction. 
It has not received any support from EDC at this time.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Nor will he let anyone else have a look at EDC's books. 
Petrobras is worth more than $2 billion. 
Why should they risk any more for friends of the Prime Minister?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Let me quote again the auditor general: ``In my opinion these transactions are-'' 
The hon. member for Fraser Valley.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, just so it is clear, let us go through it. 
Petrobras is worth billions and is owned by the Brazilian government. 
That is exactly what it did. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
This is what Canadians expect from us.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
What other explanation can there be for the sudden generosity of the National Bank?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, what I will say is what I have been saying in the House. 
On this side of the House we view that to be a good investment.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, we will get back to the supposed invoices later.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the health minister. 
Let us make no mistake about it. 
This secret deal paves the way for full blown, two tier health care.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, as usual the health minister avoids the question. 
As usual the health minister lawyers the facts. 
My question is very simple. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Right now we have the draft bill. 
We have possible amendments, no regulations. 
Let us wait to see what the final bill looks like. 
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have answered this question on a number of occasions. 
The action plan is exceptional''.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The auditor general is working with us and he says that we are on track.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the minister wants it both ways. 
This is a sweet deal at the expense of the taxpayers.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Let me also quote from another client of EDC.  
The hon. member for Calgary East.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Let me quote a financial institution. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, on the contrary, we have taken this file very seriously. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
There was no overpayment that needed to be established in this case.  
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
This is something for which Canadians can be proud.  
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
That is Liberal economics at its finest, I am afraid.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
I have explained this time and again. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Placeteco refuses to justify the grant, but all is well.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
There is another minister who said this about the area.  
Who was that minister? 
It was Bernard Landry.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
It is using its $1 billion subsidy from Canadian taxpayers. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
It is part of the corporate account of EDC. 
They should borrow from the bank like everybody else.  
The hon. member for South Surrey-White Rock-Langley.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
It does not need additional capital.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
It is not there for transportation in this country. 
My colleague, the Minister of Transport, does a very fine job doing that.  
I am surprised to see that the Reform Party has now stopped liking profit.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Yet the Minister of Industry did nothing.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the preamble to the question is totally erroneous. 
First of all, I reacted promptly to the committee report, with several precise responses.  
The hon. member for Lambton-Kent-Middlesex.  
Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, today is a great day for federal-provincial co-operation. 
It is also a great day for the agricultural producers of Canada.  
The hon. member for Wanuskewin.  
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I totally reject the allegations that the hon. member is making. 
We will deliver to the best of our ability. 
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, these requests are not very complicated. 
Has the minister not learned from her mistakes? 
The hon. member for Bras d'Or-Cape Breton.  
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP):
My question for the minister is quite simple. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
They have benefited from the family supplement. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, it would be a good thing if the minister read her own report.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is absolutely no contradiction.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Low interest loans could be made available to first nations.  
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, what we have done is we have followed the consultations.  
That is exactly what we are doing. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Discussions are going on at this moment. 
I hope that in the near future I will be able to announce more.  
We rejected that position.  
Mr. Rick Limoges (Windsor-St. 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
They gave us the template. 
They gave us the blueprint. 
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
We now have 30 requests past 30 days.  
Once we get into terms like breaking the law, we are getting into criminal activity. 
Therefore I am going to say that this question is out of order.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
No comments can therefore be made about the CINAR case.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
It is the same with the food fishery. 
We will have enforcement to back that up.  
Mr. Julian Reed (Halton, Lib.):
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
We have talented individuals who are meeting that challenge. 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
This can hardly be described as transparent. 
Why will she not simply release this information immediately?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
It is my department that made the internal audit public. 
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the government has taken a leadership role. 
We will be tabling that report at the United Nations in early April. 
Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
We offer our heartiest congratulations to these very talented artists.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
However, I refer you to a decision made by James Jerome. 
I have his book. 
At that time the Speaker made this ruling: 
Therefore, today I made this decision that stands for today. 
Mr. Jerome made another decision in his time.  
But there is no need to explain it. 
Did I make mistakes? 
Yes, like anyone else. 
Was I too quick? 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his excellent question. 
We will not deal with Bill C-19 this afternoon.  
Next Monday will be the third day of the budget debate.  
Wednesday will be the last day of the budget debate.  
That is the agenda for next week.  
CITIZENSHIP OF CANADA ACT 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by summarizing somewhat.  
How do we seek out and find these people? 
How do we convince them that Canada is the country they should come to? 
If I could take one moment just to talk about that one subject. 
Some will be eligible and some will not.  
We in the New Democratic Party went a bit further. 
We did a bit of research on the Fujian province, from where these people originated. 
Here is a graphic illustration in these free economic trade zones.  
It is a heck of a long way from the Fujian province. 
They cannot get here from there. 
I hope the truth is finally getting out.  
It sends absolutely the wrong message. 
I believe that has been addressed and we are happy to see it.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
I will also, of course, speak to the bill itself.  
We have always valued and cherished the contributions that newcomers make to our society.  
Related to that, I wish to provide some clarifications.  
Aboriginals aside, we were all immigrants or refugees. 
All refugees are immigrants but not all immigrants are refugees. 
This is not clearing things up very well is it? 
I will try to clarify it a bit more.  
An immigrant is legally defined as a person who seeks landing. 
I will talk about one in particular, which was a rather heart-rending story. 
It involves a young lady, around 18 years old, who came from Sudan. 
She lived with her mother and two brothers. 
The city was being bombed. 
Rebels were on the outside. 
This family was told they had to leave the city. 
At that home she was sexually abused. 
It was basically yeses and noes. 
At that point, the immigration officer asked her to write down something. 
She spoke, read and wrote English.  
During that time her mother tongue was Arabic. 
She spoke, wrote and read Arabic. 
We know she spoke, wrote and read English. 
She also spoke two other languages fluently, with only five years of education. 
This is the type of person would would probably be an excellent Canadian citizen.  
I also had a chance to sit in on an immigrant interview. 
We do have some major problems in that system.  
For that I applaud them.  
Last summer 599 illegal immigrants arrived on the west coast by boat. 
They encounter far too many delays in the immigration process.  
During the month of January a container ship with stowaways arrived in British Columbia. 
Almost every week in January illegal immigrants were found somewhere in the province of Ontario.  
We bring in roughly 30,000 a year to attend our different universities. 
These students pay double the tuition that our students pay. 
They are immersed in our culture. 
We end up losing these people. 
In my own riding I have seven border crossings. 
It is a problem we deal with every day. 
We do not have enough immigration officials. 
Our customs officers are not equipped, quite frankly. 
They have just been given a certain amount of power. 
These studies have been done. 
Why has it taken the department so long to release this new bill?  
There are parts of Bill C-16 which I wish to address.  
That is 1095 days. 
Exit controls do not exist in Canada for non-residents. 
However, we do not know when non-residents are in our country.  
The whole issue of these identification cards has been shrouded in a veil of secrecy. 
It would also hopefully free up resources at CIC. 
The PC Party has been demanding these changes to overseas adoption for a long time. 
The minister should have acted much sooner.  
What kind of overlap and additional paperwork would this cause? 
Would the minister please explain the thinking behind this part of the bill?  
These citizenship commissioners will be appointed by orders in council. 
It is worth my time to highlight some of these recommendations.  
Candidates must not be renewable and candidates must be staggered. 
This would ensure constant new blood in a stressful field.  
This committee would be composed of individuals from the immigration, refugee and law fields.  
Our party has been calling for a more transparent hiring process for a long time. 
One needs only to glance at our platform from the 1997 election to see that. 
Professor Crepeau happens to be a professor in Montreal. 
The government should look to the province of Quebec more often for its immigration policies. 
I am speaking in particular about the Quebec investor program. 
Quebec is the only province in Canada to run its own program. 
The federal program has failed miserably. 
Is it any wonder that the province's plan has worked so well?  
Citizenship is of prime importance. 
Citizenship is perennial in providing a sense of community. 
This is not a novel concept. 
Citizenship was a prized entity among ancient Greeks and Romans. 
Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
I think it was very important for that to be acknowledged in the House.  
I have been listening very carefully to the debate. 
I expect the committee will hear witnesses.  
I hope to see it become a reality soon.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for her comments. 
Not very much has been done in the negotiations with other countries in this regard.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
There are some more clearly defined parts in the bill. 
I like to give credit where credit is due, even if it is a little. 
I will not go into that but I wanted to make the point. 
By being given broad based tax relief families can be strengthened. 
Strong families make strong communities and strong communities make a strong nation. 
Having said that, I would like to go into the nitty-gritty of the bill.  
The first is physical presence. 
This is a positive change. 
This clause has been removed from Bill C-16. 
This is a negative change because the clause presented an equality problem. 
This is valid only for government employees. 
The third is the definition of spouse. 
This is another positive change.  
The fourth is a response to the Mennonites in clause 57. 
Is this not amazing? 
It goes to show that no one is treated equally by the government.  
The government is weak. 
The Liberals do not listen to anyone. 
They do as they please and still there are many problems with the bill. 
Let me go over some of them.  
This is contrary to what the standing committee heard. 
Only children born in Canada to landed immigrants would assume Canadian citizenship.  
First, subclause 6(1)(b) deals with presence in Canada. 
How could someone be a resident when not residing in Canada? 
The next one is penalties for bureaucratic delays in subclause 6(1)(b). 
Another one is redefining the family in clause 43. 
The next one is the famous one, blatant patronage in clauses 31 and 32. 
Bill C-16 maintains the tradition of patronage appointments.  
The Liberals are famous for patronage appointments. 
How about those who are unfortunate, who are mute, deaf or blind? 
How will they pass that test? 
Another one is the citizenship oath in clause 34 of the bill. 
The minister prepared this oath on her own. 
She ignored listening to Canadians.  
I believe it will be fulfilled sometime down the road.  
There are criminals and terrorists unfortunately.  
We have to make Canada a better place. 
Therefore our legislation should be carefully crafted and drafted.  
The new rules will erode public support for real refugees. 
They will not do anything to fix that. 
They will not stop bogus claimants from clogging the system. 
The pipeline is clogged. 
Genuine refugees are already suffering. 
We have to do more work to scrutinize them. 
They will not discourage human smuggling. 
Between 1995 and 1998 only 14 smuggling charges were laid. 
To summarize, let me go over some of the points because they are interesting.  
It is like an onion; we peel off one layer and there is another layer. 
We have to stop this onion effect. 
They will not be sent back to countries which are deemed unacceptable by the minister. 
Migrant smugglers are sure to exploit this loophole. 
We have to plug the loophole.  
What about when there are batches of nine illegal immigrants? 
Then the penalties are different and less.  
That is the Liberal style.  
She should hear what the committee has to say and re-write this legislation.  
I mentioned that Canadian citizenship is one of the most respected citizenships in the world. 
We are proud of this fact. 
I received many petitions on this issue. 
I can understand that there is a difference between immigrants and citizens. 
To some extent we can probably understand the extent to which the difference exists. 
These are the questions the petitioners asked of the government. 
Why does the government treat some citizens as second class citizens? 
A Canadian citizen is a Canadian citizen. 
No Canadian citizen is superior or inferior to another Canadian citizen. 
This is what equality is all about. 
All Canadian citizens are Canadian citizens, period.  
Should we not integrate new citizens rather than segregate them? 
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
It is the cause for the deteriorating health care system. 
Coming back to immigration, yes, the government can do a lot. 
All these factors are compounding the situation.  
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau-Mirabel, BQ):
That is paragraph 4(2).  
This is often referred to as ``citizenship by transmission''. 
One of the major changes clarifies the residence requirements. 
Unfortunately, French is not the language chosen in most cases. 
The criteria are very similar.  
The procedure being used now to challenge the revocation order remains essentially unchanged. 
It is set out at clause 17. 
That is under section 31 of the bill. 
Each commissioner would receive a remuneration. 
I would like to focus on the role of the commissioners. 
According to the bill: 
It is therefore of the utmost importance that commissioners be chosen very carefully.  
In conclusion, I would like to speak briefly about the citizenship oath. 
It is an allegiance oath, and I quote: 
-to Her Majesty Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada, and to her heirs and successors.  
I was raised as a Republican. 
Not an American style Republican, but an anti-monarchist nonetheless. 
Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
I will be sharing my time with the member for Halifax West.  
I am a relatively new member of parliament. 
I was elected in a byelection last November. 
I have very strong feelings about immigrants and refugees. 
My family members were farmers and settlers. 
In 1979, 1980 and 1981 I worked with the Catholic Archdiocese of Regina. 
That has been far from our experience.  
I will only mention one point and it is of a theological nature.  
These people were extremely pleased to be taking some part in the democratic process. 
I can remember a Filipino man in particular. 
This arises out of my family background, my life experiences and my philosophical orientation.  
I know that often there is a backlash toward immigrants and refugees. 
For all the reasons I have mentioned, I certainly do not share that. 
I try at every opportunity to talk to people about it.  
That is something which Canada has to look at as well.  
We have to ensure that we do not have queue jumping. 
If I may, I would like to make several specific references to the bill. 
I have talked about due process. 
I will refer to a few of them.  
There will be a certain loss of discretion in citizenship making. 
Citizenship judges will no longer be the people who make decisions. 
Frequently it will be civil servants working within specific guidelines. 
This concerns our caucus as well. 
We believe that cabinet powers to refuse citizenship are too broad.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Quite often there are a lot of bureaucratic entanglements before they can get here.  
With respect to the bill, some of our concerns have already been mentioned. 
We have some concerns about that. 
The question of the definition of public interest is not really clarified in the legislation. 
This order would be conclusive proof of the matters that were stated in the report.  
We have a lot of concern about that.  
We are also concerned about the citizenship commissioners. 
Again, the words ``during pleasure'' cause us a bit of concern. 
That is an aspect I would want to emphasize as well.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
The first incident happened in the last two weeks. 
A medical doctor was returning to Canada. 
He was not yet a citizen. 
He had been working in Canada for three years. 
I know of one big dairy farm which requires labourers. 
Far too often it is almost like never the two shall meet.  
Those are issues that we have to work on.  
Those are areas we have to work on.  
It is very unfortunate. 
I agree, I have shared many of the same experiences. 
Canada is a beautiful country. 
There are all kinds of opportunities and all kinds of people to fulfil those opportunities.  
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
It was very moving. 
It is actually the people of Canada. 
It is the people who make this country what it is. 
It is a democracy and we should be very proud of that fact.  
Second, the timing of this bill is all wrong. 
Bill C-16 is no exception. 
Therefore, I would like to focus my comments on the conditions for granting citizenship.  
The current legislation governing citizenship is lax in this regard. 
It seems as though having a physical presence is not important. 
Canadians believe it is. 
We all know the time will not be served.  
It would have been a great opportunity for a nation-wide patriotic debate. 
Instead, the minister hobbled together an oath on her own. 
Of course with all things Liberal, there is an issue of patronage. 
I know the Speaker is shocked by that.  
It is just one more plum post for friends of the Prime Minister.  
This legislation also discriminates against refugees. 
This is blatantly unfair for true refugees.  
Instead the Liberals are throwing the door wide open.  
This definition goes well beyond that required by the United Nations' definition. 
Sentencing in Canada is anything but credible.  
The government must focus its attention on priority areas like immigration. 
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I compliment my colleague and friend on his speech. 
I find that ridiculous. 
Legislation should once in a while be geared to the needs of Canadians.  
The UN has a declaration on refugee status and it is very explicit. 
It was through illegal means that they arrived in Canada. 
We have to deal with that. 
We have to deal with people smuggling. 
That is what we should be focusing on.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
It was an issue that was debated at length by the Reform Party. 
We dared to bring up this topic. 
Immigration lawyers and consultants.  
Unfortunately things have not improved all that much. 
The consultants still exist and are making piles of money from it. 
The lawyers are still making piles of money from it. 
For what and to whose advantage? 
Things have not changed. 
Immigration has become a political football. 
That is the accusation made. 
Unfortunately that is a smokescreen. 
The government would be very surprised in what it found out.  
That is a fair request. 
That is a fact. 
No one can send him back. 
Unfortunately that very specific court ruling has never been challenged. 
What else is wrong which this act does not address? 
I am going to go back to the refugee system. 
There are so many queue jumpers who use the refugee system to enter this country. 
The issue is not being addressed in a very effective way.  
Lo and behold very little has changed. 
That permeates the whole immigration system. 
Let us look at the immigration and refugee act. 
I will now talk about the issue of sovereignty. 
They should be taught that this is not acceptable. 
Unfortunately, the government of the day refuses to tighten up the laws in this area. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
I also dealt with that in my remarks. 
They did not even want to give them a new boat. 
These people have been locked up and are awaiting hearings. 
They are being dealt with one by one. 
I personally will not sit here and listen to it. 
I hear it too much on the immigration committee as it is. 
I am just wondering if they are not more constitutionally connected or associated.  
That will be my question. 
I am surprised at the member's comments. 
I will put it in a way that all in the House will recognize. 
The Reform Party wants to see a good, honest, fair immigration process. 
That is what we are asking for. 
We have set ourselves apart. 
There is a party that just did.  
The time for questions and comments has now expired. 
Is the House ready for the question.  
The question is on the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
That the following words be added at the end of the motion: 
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP):
It is trying to delay further and this delay is dangerous. 
The motion proposes immediate action. 
We have been asking for that for a very long time as have seasonal workers. 
Even the delegates to the Liberal convention know it is right. 
It is a part of their working conditions.  
Their needs for housing, food and clothing is not seasonal. 
The need to get by, day by day, with dignity is not seasonal. 
Tourism is a seasonal industry.  
Seasonal workers are not some marginal part of the workforce. 
We must stop the marginalization of seasonal workers and we must stop it now. 
We need to restore those benefits now. 
Do we need to have a debate about the problems that seasonal workers face? 
The Liberal government's record shows that it deserted seasonal workers. 
The Liberals have a chance to improve their record. 
Who knows what it will do for them in the polls? 
The Chair finds the proposed amendment to the amendment in order. 
The question is on the amendment to the amendment.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I must disagree with the phrasing of his motion as it now reads. 
The fact is that seasonal workers in Canada do have access to employment insurance benefits. 
Why then should we adopt a motion calling on such benefits to be restored?  
We are also focusing our efforts on helping those workers who are out of work. 
It was not keeping pace with the new labour market and its demands. 
Third, to encourage work and discourage reliance on benefits. 
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
The government is pleading poverty where it need not. 
I am glad to have this opportunity to speak on this important issue. 
Nevertheless saying it does not address the problem. 
There are businesses that by their very nature are seasonal. 
I have personally spoken to some people in that category. 
There are many factors that contribute to the seasonal economy. 
At first the emphasis was on the things it knew. 
He is happy with the change even though it meant major changes in his life. 
This report was published three years after implementation of the changes. 
The data used in its production would have been collected well before that. 
Any other purpose militates against the program acting in accordance with insurance principles.  
I want to restate and emphasize one of them.  
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
The Gaspe Peninsula is a resource region where forestry and fishing are important sectors. 
It is not our fault. 
We are trying to diversify our economy.  
There are differences that people must understand.  
I read the speeches of those who spoke previously. 
They talked about dignity. 
Logging is about providing people with building materials. 
As long as parliament is sitting, there is no problem, we would get paid. 
They would say that it is unfair. 
They would say ``We have been elected as members of parliament. 
We cannot accept another job. 
So I have an occupational impediment.  
But the government sets the rules.  
I hear members saying ``let them go catch something else''. 
``Well, then, let them catch something else, herring''. 
Unfortunately, that is impossible.  
Are Canadians prepared to do that?  
Some will say that I am exaggerating, but I am not, really. 
That is one thing. 
People will say ``They are going to work for 10 weeks''. 
In some fisheries, people manage to get by. 
Some years, the fishing season does not even last six weeks. 
It can be difficult to work 420 hours in six weeks. 
If one works 40 hours a week, that is a total of 240 hours. 
That is not enough to meet the 420 hour requirement.  
That is why I made that proposal, to give people food for thought. 
Otherwise, we will have to say that we are willing to see those occupations disappear.  
I will make another proposal. 
Is the government prepared to do that? 
But it says ``No, this is free trade, this is globalization''.  
They are paid $15 a week. 
A litre of milk costs the same in Hull as it does in Gaspe. 
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
We all know which former MP and former minister used to represent that riding. 
He is none other than Doug Young.  
I would like to congratulate my colleague for Acadie-Bathurst for his motion.  
My colleague over the way, the parliamentary secretary, was also on that committee. 
There are regions of Canada that have economies that are different from the others. 
My region of New Brunswick has many seasonal workers. 
There are people who work in the forest industry. 
My colleague from South Shore, Nova Scotia is here. 
Certainly there is an imbalance.  
I read the report that was tabled in the House yesterday by the minister. 
It is frustrating to read these things. 
He should be standing and defending those very people.  
I am not surprised. 
They are faking their illness. 
They are burnt out and yes, some must call in sick. 
However the report says people are faking.  
It is absolutely incredible.  
It says ``monitor and assess''. 
What the member for Acadie-Bathurst is asking for is this: 
The motion says immediate. 
Here, we have the word review.  
That is my intention. 
We must protect Canadians throughout this country. 
There must be a balance.  
Balance seems to be lacking in this reform. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Imagine the impact that has on a relatively small community like my riding. 
The inverse is also true. 
The impact is the same in reverse when it gets pulled out. 
And that is just Winnipeg Centre.  
I wish my colleague from Montreal were still here. 
These changes have left some staggering statistics. 
Less than 11% of young women qualify for any benefits. 
Less than 15% of youth qualify for any benefits.  
The point I am trying to make is this system is broken. 
The wheels have fallen off it and Canadians know that. 
There is no money, no income maintenance. 
Your family does without''. 
I believe it is a breach of trust.  
It is fundamentally wrong and Canadians will not tolerate it.  
Here are the changes we would like to see when the review comes forward. 
The EI fund must be separated from general revenues. 
EI must not be used as a federal debt reduction instrument. 
It must not be used for tax cuts. 
It must not be used for spending on government programs. 
It is a dedicated insurance fund, nothing more, nothing less. 
To use it for anything else is fraudulent and a breach of trust.  
The employment insurance system is in an emergency situation right now. 
It does not work. 
Canadian workers know this. 
That does not happen anymore.  
The government stopped that.  
He does not get his first two week waiting period paid for anymore. 
There are no allowances for travel or child care. 
Ms. Judy Sgro (York West, Lib.):
These industries are vital to our economic well-being. 
However, these industries by definition employ people for only part of the year. 
The old unemployment insurance system was questioned for its sustainability. 
It was not responsive to the new labour market that prevails in Canada. 
It tended to discourage attachment to the labour force.  
The effects of the EI program are being monitored continuously. 
We need to find some improvements. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that happens.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House adjourned at 6.38 p.m.)
