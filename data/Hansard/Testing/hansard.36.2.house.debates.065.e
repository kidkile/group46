Thursday, March 16, 2000 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Gar Knutson (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
That the House do now proceed to orders of the day.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Do sovereignists no longer have any place in this House? 
Yesterday, we had a discussion. 
I respectfully put my point of view to you.  
Does democracy still have any meaning in this House? 
Are they entitled to question the institution? 
In what kind of country are we living? 
What is going on? 
Does parliament no longer have any value? 
Have parliamentary principles disappeared? 
It is business as usual.  
When the Speaker leaves the chair he is replaced. 
You have all the powers. 
You, Mr. Speaker, can decide that we will discuss the real issues. 
We know this is embarrassing for the government. 
We know that it is a pain. 
We acted in such a way that we will now have to debate a motion''. 
We know that it is tedious, but it is a serious issue. 
Parliament is not at the service of partisanship. 
Parliament is here to allow parliamentarians to hold debates in a democratic fashion.  
People realized that it was necessary for their representatives to talk to each other.  
Do you know what distance separates both sides of the House? 
Because people used to fight in parliaments. 
Issues must be settled democratically. 
I must tell you that there is a political price to pay. 
What is happening here is ugly, very ugly.  
People who are watching us are outraged. 
International democracy is outraged, because this will be known.  
It prefers to present a motion to proceed with the orders of the day. 
It prefers to pass a bill that will take away the rights of Quebecers. 
The institution of parliament is in crisis. 
Today, I appeal the government's decision. 
In every forum, I will explain it very ardently to Quebecers. 
Even though we have been elected, we are second-class citizens.  
The members just have to deal with some motions about health or whatever, routine business. 
It just does not matter. 
The Bloc Quebecois, which represents two thirds of Quebec, has been cheated. 
Our rights have been trampled on. 
We want to defend ourselves legitimately. 
Clearly, Mr. Speaker, you are party to that situation. 
The Chair is now serving the Liberal Party. 
That is the message people will get if you fail to made a decision.  
The Chair is here to rule on points of order. 
This is why I have listened to the hon. member. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
It is of course not true. 
However, I think you should be aware of certain facts. 
No doubt hon. members will recall that I had allotted Monday for it, moreover.  
It will of course differ a great deal. 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
The Speaker had ruled out of order a similar motion only a few months earlier. 
At page 370 of Marleau and Montpetit he stated: 
The article finishes up: 
That is not the case before us at the moment. 
The government can do its business. 
This is the issue, Mr. Speaker. 
You have to uphold the members, not uphold the crown. 
That is your duty and it is our privilege that you do so. 
I ask you to rule the motion out of order.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be very brief with my remarks. 
I cannot imagine what could be more serious. 
We must deal with it.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, some very good points have been made. 
Again, that was related to the government's agenda. 
Nevertheless, what if there was? 
It is a matter to be managed between the Chair and the House. 
We have a procedure for doing that. 
I would just urge the Chair to take this matter very seriously.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I will be brief. 
We have listened to all those who spoke on this issue. 
I believe that both these questions are very important. 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
Yesterday, you made a decision. 
He said: ``We have an opposition day. 
There are only a few left. 
It did not do so. 
Mr. Speaker, as I was saying, we consulted the appropriate literature. 
But it is not up to the government. 
It is not a decision that rests with the government. 
It is a decision that rests with the Chair. 
It is a decision that rests with the House.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
We are supposed to be in a democratic society. 
All of us, every person who is here, should have a say in that.  
This is a very serious situation. 
That is for sure.  
I think that is the general thrust. 
I would put that in the form of an official motion. 
I seem to note general agreement for that across the way. 
I will assist in this matter at once. 
This is a very serious situation. 
Therefore, I will now suspend the sitting to the call of the Chair.  
The sitting of the House was suspended at 10.48 a.m. 
The House resumed at 11.10 a.m. 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
That the House proceed to Motion No. 59; 
The House has heard the proposal of the government House leader. 
Is there unanimous consent of the House to adopt the motion?  
I want to thank all hon. members for their assistance in coming to this arrangement. 
It states at page 146: 
I commend these words to all hon. members.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ) moved: 
I think that, in doing so, they are showing a deep respect for this institution. 
I cannot really say the same about the behavior of the government party so far.  
Here is my second point. 
This is basically our position.  
Let me remind you of the facts. 
Fanaticism has reached new heights. 
We submitted a substantial number of amendments. 
Many of them were ruled out, and we did not object. 
We had a hard time understanding what was going on.  
But we did get a ruling. 
The second item is the 144 or so amendments which we brought forward. 
This we did, and the decision was the same. 
Now we are beginning to wonder. 
Neither goal was achieved.  
We totally agree with that.  
That is our job. 
I think it is a very democratic way to proceed.  
We have had a good relationship so far. 
This is not just about you. 
It is about this institution. 
It is about our rights. 
It is about the rights of all members. 
They have their own legislative counsel. 
We become aware of their amendments when they appear on the Order Paper.  
That, in my opinion, is fundamental. 
We must be 100% sure that our mechanisms are good. 
That could have been decided as soon as Monday.  
This is what matters to us.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Why have we been elected to this parliament?  
The voice of the people could be heard through parliament.  
Parliament's role is not to support the government. 
This is what democracy is all about. 
This is what we are doing here. 
Opposition members are here to express points of view. 
We have found a civilized way of expressing points of view.  
If those actions are not good, then parliament can debate them. 
It alerts the population. 
Parliament is where the people are heard. 
Parliament should not have to serve the executive. 
The second principle is that the Speaker has to be neutral.  
I wanted to say this to you during this debate. 
You have always done this admirably.  
We are entitled to such service.  
They have always done so admirably.  
But a problem has occurred. 
The work of the legislative counsel must be absolutely non-partisan, and entirely confidential. 
This is what we are asking you, it is the aim of the motion. 
In concluding, I move: 
``on Friday, March 3, 2000,'' 
I consider it important to add it. 
It does not change the substance.  
The amendment is in order.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
This is a very serious debate. 
I still do not know what they contain.  
Mr. Speaker, you continued as follows: 
Of course, we have a proud tradition of impartial speakers. 
Your are such a speaker, and your predecessors were as well. 
I began working here on October 25, 1966. 
That is not the same thing. 
The differentiation must be made.  
That is not what the problem is.  
It ought to be, but it is not. 
That is what we are debating.  
We have taken our inspiration from the British tradition, dating back to at least 1376. 
You have powers that were vested in you by us all. 
You have powers that we have given you.  
You are the Speaker of us all. 
We all chose you. 
Perhaps additional services could be provided to parliamentarians. 
These are all important issues- 
We could also change the rules of the House. 
This is how things must work in a parliament.  
Nowhere is this written. 
If that is what we decide to do in the future, fine. 
I am not even sure a deficiency does exist. 
That is for sure.  
I am convinced you are not involved in partisan politics. 
You are fair and therefore not partisan.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Debating this issue is of supreme importance. 
Mr. Speaker, the issue of internal party discipline is very interesting. 
I have no idea what it has to do with the debate at hand.  
I do not know what that would accomplish. 
I am not the whip but perhaps he will participate in the debate later.  
The most important thing for us to remember is twofold. 
First let us not trivialize this in that manner. 
I do not think we should do that. 
Second, we should all remember that there was a free vote. 
Again, in 1997, not only were the votes free but they were secret. 
We did not even know who was first or second after we voted. 
That is the important issue in this debate today. 
We are not discussing what whip is bigger than the other whip. 
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Information was passed from the legislative counsel to the clerk. 
This is why we introduced a non-confidence motion. 
If this had been accepted, we would not be having this debate today. 
But it was turned down.  
The non-confidence reads as follows: 
This is what is in the non-confidence motion. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
I still believe we need to address the issue of confidentiality. 
It is not really about the confidentiality issue. 
They have consistently served the House with incredible professionalism. 
It is not about them in my opinion at all.  
It is not about the unruliness of the place at all.  
That is what this is about. 
That is what we are talking about today. 
This is a response to the frustration felt by opposition parties in this place. 
To summarize just briefly, I believe there are three things that make this place tick. 
The first is that partly we run this place based on the rules. 
We have rule books. 
We respect the rules. 
It is part of what makes the House of Commons work well.  
That is the only way the place functions.  
We function on the honour system. 
That is the second thing we do and have to do.  
It has been elected to do that, and I give it that. 
It has consistently failed to do that. 
That started to build the frustration.  
That is a shame because the target in my opinion is totally wrong.  
I happened to agree with Bill C-20 and voted in favour of it. 
Let us bring in a good array of witnesses. 
The government consistently brings in closure here. 
It brings in closure in committee. 
It does not allow the committee to travel. 
It restricts the witness list. 
The frustration level continues to build because of that.  
It is not about you, as far as I am concerned. 
I am going to vote against this motion, gladly. 
It is a response. 
It is because of that, sadly, that we are here today.  
It is not about your consistency in the job. 
What happens in committees? 
We have been on our feet many times about that. 
Can it force something through with its majority? 
It is a shame.  
The other bill is Bill C-23. 
Why has the government restricted the debate? 
Why has it restricted the witnesses? 
Why has it refused to travel? 
Because it does not tolerate opposition views.  
That is what is wrong with this place. 
It is not you, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
I also do not believe this is about you, Mr. Speaker. 
In fact, I plan to defeat the motion. 
I was going to defeat it the second it was brought forward.  
He is a member of the official opposition. 
His whole purpose was to say yes to the GST.  
They do not get a chance to debate the legislation as well.  
The two examples I would bring are the following.  
Members of the cabinet would have had infinite ability to amend at will. 
That is the first example.  
There are three issues.  
That motion was passed by members of the committee.  
The committee was treated with complete disdain by the government. 
The deal is done. 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
For that I feel that this House is not being well served by the motion. 
I want you to know, Mr. Speaker, that I will vote against the motion.  
I looked at the question of privilege raised by the member for Rimouski-Mitis. 
I did not find that her privileges had been violated. 
We are privileged people as members of parliament. 
We have a large body of privilege which protects us. 
Unfortunately, Marleau and Montpetit continue to say: 
Mr. Speaker, you have a responsibility every day to uphold our rights. 
I guess that would be the word. 
As members know, we have won these rights at great cost. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
That was a ruling which very much favoured the government.  
I think the motion is ill-advised. 
A point has been made and it is worthy of discussion. 
Delay has an important political function. 
Was opposition members holding up the thing too long? 
Both opposition and government had to gauge public opinion. 
We do not have that any more. 
It has been kind of parliamentary light. 
We kind of lose either way.  
You are the prisoner of the rules of the House. 
All these things need to be looked at.  
I think you, Mr. Speaker, should actually have more power than you do. 
You should also have more power over time allocation.  
I say with respect that was not the particular intention. 
I respect that although I would still argue to the contrary.  
That calls into disrepute the whole House. 
It calls into disrepute the democratic process. 
There is another point that I would like to make before I sit down. 
Unfortunately it is those kinds of parliamentary antics that get the attention of the media. 
I have always liked wrestling but I do not like this kind. 
In the meantime I think this motion is ill advised. 
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
So, I wanted to make this comment. 
I am working on amendments to a particular bill. 
I do not believe this is what my constituents want.  
I guess the hon. member for Winnipeg-Transcona can comment on the commentary.  
That is what I intend to do, Mr. Speaker. 
We will have to find another way to deal with it. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
You have done a very effective job in the House. 
It is a tough and difficult job. 
I think the member referenced this somewhat in his speech. 
There are all kinds of reasons and motivations for why these things occur.  
I did want to get the hon. member's perspective on that. 
Perhaps he would oblige the House by answering that question.  
In some respects I answered the question. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
The member for Winnipeg-Transcona knew that gentleman very well. 
People may be able to draw conclusions from knowing that.  
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I will be using the full time. 
That is a very strange issue to be discussing. 
It would not happen in any other walk of life.  
This is how much of a strange environment we work in.  
Your job is certainly not easy. 
Every time you make a decision you automatically make some people disappointed. 
Every decision you make makes some people disappointed. 
Sometimes we are disappointed in your decisions. 
We should all understand that you can never make everybody happy in your job. 
It is a very difficult job.  
The Speaker was one of our members. 
I have never seen a group of people so emotionally disappointed. 
This is very important to the Bloc members. 
I admire them for their passion. 
When we talk about helicopters or even HRDC, that does not happen. 
That is what happened here. 
We are dealing with a real serious issue. 
It is a very serious charge. 
This is the first time I have ever had to deal with it. 
We are actually discussing the removal of the Speaker from his position.  
From where we sit it appears that you do that.  
We are now being asked to consider removing you from your job. 
We do not agree with that. 
I go back to some of the issues like the emotion I was talking about. 
Many things have brought us to this point today. 
This is part of our frustration, aside from the emotions.  
The situation was exacerbated because of the nature of the bill. 
That is exactly what the government is doing now. 
The minister of public works said: 
It stopped debate at second reading. 
It attempted to restrict the power of the MPs to present amendments.  
They felt thwarted in their job. 
That should have been taken into consideration throughout the debate.  
We disagree with the decision from the Chair. 
It is a problem that we would want addressed. 
We expect confidentiality to be just that and nothing less.  
I suspect it would not have been, but I hope that is not the case. 
I emphasize trying conditions. 
We view this as extremely serious when confidential information is shared. 
We go to the legal advisers and we treat them as solicitors. 
It is a clear impediment to the way we do our work. 
However, again, it is the Speaker's right to make that decision.  
As a party and as a caucus we will work to change the system. 
After all, we create the rules. 
These are our rules. 
They are not the Speaker's rules. 
The tools are there to do this and we will use them. 
The remedy is there in committees and the Board of Internal Economy. 
Although we disagree with the ruling we accept it. 
We oppose this motion. 
We do not always like the decisions but we accept them. 
We know the Speaker does not write the rules. 
To do that they had to run over some of us. 
They had to run over some members of the Bloc. 
They had to run over some rules in the House. 
They might even vote twice on the same amendment.  
We are entitled to two votes. 
The government House leader is especially culpable in this. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
This is a very serious motion and we understand everybody's arguments.  
Second, I would like to ask the hon. member for Cumberland-Colchester a question.  
Is the hon. member seeking permission to get unanimous consent from the House? 
Is he seeking to put a motion for unanimous consent? 
Would he answer my question, please.  
Yes, Mr. Speaker, I am asking for unanimous consent that this motion be withdrawn.  
It is in order at this time to put the motion.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
There is no issue of delegation of powers to other members.  
As I said before, it would require unanimous consent first. 
I will leave it to you to debate the points of order so far. 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas-Charlottenburgh, Lib.):
There is a debate about an administrative issue, some would say a shortcoming. 
Certainly they talk to each other. 
You must admit that this is a strange point of order. 
After that he will have his chance to question if we decide to go on.  
Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent to put the motion?  
Mr. Gerard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):
I had trouble with that.  
No Premier of Quebec ever accepted that Constitution. 
However, that is not the issue we are talking about on this motion.  
He mentioned in his comments that I remarked on the emotion. 
All kinds of committees travel everywhere. 
Then there was an effort to try to restrict our ability to put forth amendments.  
It should have given them more consideration rather than less. 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
It has been an experience to go through those exhausting hours of debate overnight. 
It is in a way a trial by ordeal. 
The issue that must of course arise is, can we not do better.  
They serve the Speaker. 
I think that should be on record. 
The Speaker's staff is an extension of the Speaker himself.  
There is no reason why they should be. 
They do not necessarily have a great knowledge of parliamentary precedents. 
The staff supply that detailed knowledge, the history. 
But without that staff, the Speaker could not function. 
History has been referred to here. 
That was at a fairly early time. 
The office of Speaker has changed. 
I think it only goes back to your immediate predecessor. 
There is a judgment call here that he has to exercise.  
So we are getting into a very practical issue.  
It is interesting to note that other parliaments than our own have changed their procedure. 
They cannot do that any more in the United States Congress.  
Just imagine Mrs. Thatcher's Britain or Clement Atlee's Britain. 
the answer is yes. 
Can we have an amendment to an amendment? 
Can we not do it differently?  
Can we not agree on this? 
I would hope there would be attention to this.  
It occurs to me that not everybody has used the facilities available. 
We had an extensive debate in December. 
Was a legislative committee necessary? 
It is these sorts of matters that now can be approached by all parties. 
That would be the constructive lesson to draw from all of this.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to make a few remarks. 
I want to say at the outset where I am coming from. 
I am making that assumption at the outset.  
We must always respect that authority. 
I respect your authority, Mr. Speaker. 
As well, we must always ensure that everyone here is accountable.  
There are many ways that you, the Speaker, do this. 
Democracy needs to ensure that minority voices are heard. 
I thank the Bloc for introducing this motion. 
It allows me to bring forth this concern.  
I would like to make one more tiny point. 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member made some very thoughtful comments. 
However, it has taken away attention from the debates.  
I think that is something to consider. 
I would have one comment, though, on committees. 
The committee on the clarity bill was a legislative committee. 
You would have the encouragement and support of the House to do that.  
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I will try to be brief. 
What I would like to ask the member for Vancouver-Quadra is this. 
He is the only one who can do it because they come under his budget. 
He is the boss and he can decide when, how and what can be done. 
Is the member in agreement with this statement. 
I have every confidence in the office of the Speaker of the House. 
He must exercise his authority with confidence. 
He has the skills and he must be encouraged to exercise his powers. 
This has been going on for several decades unfortunately, but that can be changed.  
LIBERAL PARTY OF CANADA 
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
Men and women will come to discuss Canada's economic and social future. 
They will determine the choices and options to meet the challenges of 2000s.  
BRITISH COLUMBIA FRUIT GROWERS 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Farming in this country is already in jeopardy. 
Rulings like this one will only contribute to its further decline. 
Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
The hon. member for Etobicoke-Lakeshore.  
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
This meeting centred on economic development and transportation in Durham. 
We know which government is working for the people and which is not.  
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
The Snowbirds, another Canadian icon, will take to the skies to celebrate this special occasion. 
I invite all members to attend this historic event.  
HIGHWAY ACCIDENT IN SAINT-JEAN-BAPTISTE-DE-NICOLET 
Mr. Louis Plamondon (Bas-Richelieu-Nicolet-Becancour, BQ):
Three children remain in hospital, one of them in critical condition.  
PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA 
Mr. Marcel Proulx (Hull-Aylmer, Lib.):
MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
LIBERAL PARTY OF CANADA CONVENTION 
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
One may well wonder.  
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, every year the world celebrates International Women's Day. 
These women have helped to make the agriculture industry the success that it is today. 
I applaud them for their contributions.  
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
It is easy to join. 
One just needs to be an inmate at Drumheller Annex in Alberta.  
Last year Drumheller had nine escapees.  
What is CSC's solution? 
Give the inmates more perks so they will not want to escape. 
What will the minister offer victims and victims' families? 
Mr. Maurice Godin (Chateauguay, BQ):
Together, let us continue the fight, the fight for the freedom of the Quebec people.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
That is an admission of guilt. 
Why were the police not called in?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Is the hon. member saying that those ridings did not deserve those investments?  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Her department thought the law had been broken. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is referring to draft documents. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
It is shameful that the minister continues to say- 
I could not tell whether the hon. member said draft or graft. 
I assume she said draft and I hope that that is the case. 
I know she will want to continue with her question.  
They said, ``We were told to be flexible and responsive and not to lapse funds. 
I would like to ask the hypothetical minister- 
The hon. minister may reply to the allegations contained in the preamble if she wishes.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party just continues with Reform mythology. 
That is not true. 
Why do they not admit that? 
Then they said $1 billion was missing. 
That is not true. 
Why do they not say that?  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, again I reject the accusations of the hon. member.  
That is great, honey, but they are not arguments.  
Let us recognize what the hon. member for Edmonton North said. 
Yesterday she was talking about girls. 
I am sure there are not many honeys in the House. 
The hon. member for Calgary-Nose Hill.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
An act of parliament was violated but what did the minister do? 
She just shrugged and said ``Oh, that was inappropriate''.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister seems to like letters. 
I will read him part of one: 
This is public knowledge- 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
He was not paid, of course; he works on commission. 
It would really be beyond all if he had two salaries.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
I have understood one thing, though. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health.  
The minister has been reluctant to come to this conclusion. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Right now the premier is talking about amendments. 
We have not seen regulations. 
It is not even at second reading. 
Let us wait and see what happens in the legislative process.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
It is four months since the premier revealed what he intended to do.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Let us work together to renew medicare for the 21st century.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
According to the minister, they have been in touch with the RCMP. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, of course the RCMP will conduct its investigation. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
That was in June 1998. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Let me quote from the access document. 
That was two years ago. 
The minister said she wants to be transparent. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I can see why this hon. member would not like that approach.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
The owner of that company has made a $21,000 contribution to the Liberal Party.  
What exactly is the connection between the two?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, HRDC is just full of political patronage. 
This $6 million was dished out just before the 1997 election. 
The garment industry came along and said ``Do not do this. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, there is a strange coincidence in this affair.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Darn it all, there are socks to be subsidized.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Well, we feel quite differently.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Iris got the grant anyway.  
Is $21,190 the price of doing business with the government?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I reject the allegation made by the hon. member. 
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
We must be able to hear the questions and answers.  
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
Could the minister explain what exactly is happening with this tax?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's question is very pertinent.  
As Mr. Severin says, it only gets worse as time goes by. 
By the year 2004 they will pay $440 more.  
The hon. member for Peace River.  
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Let us try to get this straight. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it just happened to donate $21,000.  
That is it exactly. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.  
Is this really government policy?  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is incorrect. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Canadians can win in that environment. 
Canadians win in the telecommunications sector. 
That is the difference. 
Their walls would never work. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Was the minister not only half right? 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Fundamentally, the privatization of the entire situation is not being looked at. 
Outsourcing is certainly a possibility.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
I hope he will reconsider this policy.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Farmers in my riding are going broke supporting the habits of this minister. 
Her own department raised the issue of misappropriation in an internal document.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Louis Plamondon (Bas-Richelieu-Nicolet-Becancour, BQ):
Nevertheless, the minister paid out $9 million to the Council for Canadian Unity.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We know the members of that party are not interested in that. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
This year, the same problem arose again. 
This is really scornful treatment of the Acadians.  
My question is as follows:
When will the Minister of Canadian Heritage settle this problem once and for all?  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
As soon as he informed me, I corrected it.  
CANADIAN INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCY 
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Does the Minister have something to hide? 
Hon. Maria Minna (Minister for International Cooperation, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
The hon. member for Calgary-Nose Hill.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
The minister is being asked a very straightforward question. 
We have heard nothing about the result of this. 
The RCMP have not been called in that we are aware of. 
We are asking her about the status. 
We are also asking- 
The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Denis Paradis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
There are still too many unknowns.  
The U.S. is pursuing discussions with Russia on this matter.  
CANADIAN INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCY 
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I think the minister has misunderstood my question. 
I will therefore repeat it.  
Hon. Maria Minna (Minister for International Cooperation, Lib.):
Third, we now have a new method of payment. 
STANDING COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE AND AGRI-FOOD 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
On December 15, 1999, the committee passed the following motion: 
Furthermore, at page 855, Marleau-Montpetit, provides: 
The decision by the committee chair contravenes the rules of the House. 
And yet, Marleau-Montpetit provides on pages 856 and 857, and I quote: 
Marleau-Montpetit goes on: 
Any ruling of the Chair may be appealed to the committee. 
I quote Beauchesne, 6th edition, citation 760(4).  
The credibility of the House and of the committees is at stake.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Further on, I read the following: 
The House leader of the opposition.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
We have had day and night sittings. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
The business for the next week is actually quite straightforward. 
Friday, Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday shall be allotted days.  
I intend to raise this at the House leaders meeting on Tuesday. 
Of course that would have to be arrived at by consent. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Is there unanimous consent to table the documents?  
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
I am certain that the member who used the expression ``bras de negre''- 
This should have been done yesterday and, in my opinion, it is too late today. 
STANDING COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE AND AGRI-FOOD 
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
I am pleased to deal with both points of order. 
The first relates to the use of props. 
I know that hon. members quail at the prospect. 
She knows that it is wrong to have done that. 
A flag is a different thing from a book. 
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with my hon. colleague from Edmonton North.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We are following the same order as we do during debates. 
I have the list here. 
The Bloc Quebecois will have its turn in due course.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address this historic debate. 
It is your job, Mr. Speaker, to ensure that this does not happen. 
Few have ever been recognized as such by the Chair. 
This mocks and misrepresents the role of parliament.  
Speaker Fraser went on to say: 
At that time there was no Canada-China interparliamentary group. 
There is a litany of cases of leaked committee reports that goes unchecked and unchallenged.  
As far as I know this has never been done. 
It has always been announced in the House.  
I am sure they do. 
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
Let me caution the whip of the Reform Party. 
I would caution all members to do this with deliberate care. 
To go beyond the letter of the motion will set a dangerous precedent. 
We will be guided by our emotion and not by reason.  
I appeal to members not to do this. 
How would the member explain this?  
This is not a normal proceeding. 
This is something that comes up very seldom, as well it should.  
I stand by my words. 
This is much too serious for that.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
I think that is important. 
This is something that is huge, as my colleague has just mentioned. 
This certainly goes beyond partisan politics. 
I know our caucuses had a lengthy discussion about this. 
Everyone in the House needs to pay particular attention to this. 
I appreciate that and I respect that.  
Mr. Speaker, this motion is about you. 
I will go back several years, Mr. Speaker. 
You and I have both been in the House for several years. 
I did not get my way all the time. 
I am not complaining about everything you have done over the years. 
Frankly, I cannot imagine anyone even wanting your job. 
I respect that, Mr. Speaker. 
You know that and I honour that. 
That is ridiculous and cannot happen every second Tuesday.  
You will also remember, Mr. Speaker, a huge thing. 
Let me just make reference to the flag flap. 
We were all probably glad to get through those days.  
I think that your decisions have compromised them.  
You know they could not do that, Mr. Speaker. 
How can you say to a doctor, ``Oh, no''. 
There is something frightening about that and I think something dangerous as well.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
I remember that very well as well. 
What are we to say? 
Are we going to be questioning your right to sit in the chair? 
There is always going to be disagreement.  
I thought I made that very clear in my speech. 
I disagreed with you. 
I got my say. 
I did not get my way. 
You probably went through more pain than any of the rest of us. 
I am not sure if it was three weeks but it was a long time. 
I guess I have to go back to high school, Mr. Speaker. 
The flag flap was just one example. 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this is a very serious topic we are discussing today. 
Mr. Speaker, someone finds it disgusting. 
Someone finds me disgusting. 
I guess he is certainly entitled to his opinion. 
You were a coach. 
One cannot favour one side over the other. 
It does not work.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be using the entire 20 minute period. 
I am sure members opposite will be delighted to hear that.  
This is an interesting debate. 
It is a subterfuge; that is probably the best way I can think of it.  
It is clearly and purely partisan beyond a doubt.  
That is a fair definition of what the House expects of its Speaker. 
We have a process whereby they are approved by the House of Commons. 
Mr. Speaker, what in the world has that to do with you?  
The next closest party has 58.  
I find that particularly offensive and absolutely uncalled for.  
I must admit I am surprised to see it coming from the Bloc. 
How did they do that?  
There were well over a thousand. 
We would still be here voting.  
That cannot be called democracy. 
That can have no basis in governing this land. 
This is a blood sport and we all know that. 
This is a tough business. 
You have a job that is really a thankless job. 
There is something that goes with privileges in this country. 
It is called responsibilities. 
All Canadians understand that. 
They also understand that is a minority position in the province of Quebec today.  
In some ways I find that argument irrelevant. 
I understood its passion. 
They took their lumps. 
There are three types of members in this place. 
I am a member in support of the government. 
There is a difference. 
Government members are the cabinet. 
The Prime Minister and his cabinet are indeed the government. 
That is the role we play.  
The democratic process around here frankly is quite remarkable. 
It is just past 4 o'clock. 
I find that incomprehensible and despicable. 
He is simply saying he does not like this report. 
He released it and accused the committee of not listening to him. 
I hear members stand in their places to talk to you about this issue. 
They say that things have deteriorated around here. 
It is quite interesting. 
We have members in opposition. 
It has always been thus. 
We all have a role to play.  
They did not believe that was going to happen.  
That is a fair comment. 
I would throw that one right back over there: respect the people. 
We hear members saying that we only have 38% of the vote. 
We have 157 of the 301 seats. 
Whether or not the member likes it, it is called a majority. 
It is about saying we are the government and we have- 
You are so stupid.  
Now we have a member over there shouting that I am stupid. 
I suppose many of my teachers would have agreed with that assessment. 
Is that what we are down to? 
What is going on here? 
The symbolism of that for me says it all about Canada. 
We do not kill one another. 
Our weapons are our minds. 
Our ammunition is our words. 
That is why it gets so heated in here. 
That is why we get so partisan in here. 
The e-mail said ``I do not agree with that reporter. 
I want my MP to be heard. 
There is no doubt about that.  
Many have died for it. 
We celebrate our veterans when we bring them here. 
We will continue to fight to uphold that democratic principle.  
They are trying to shoot the messenger who is just doing a job. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
I throw this right back at him.  
That is not how I read the motion. 
Two of them had never been officially submitted.  
Two of them were not included in the total number submitted. 
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
We voted for 40 hours. 
This is what the Liberals did not want to hear. 
The bill put some clarity forward. 
Who can argue against that? 
Who can argue against a question, in all honesty, that simply asks:
Do you or do you not want to separate from Canada?  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I will try to bring the debate back to the issue.  
I can say that unequivocally as I stand here today. 
I would hold that very dear and true to my party.  
I want you to know, Mr. Speaker, that you have the respect of our party.  
The hon. member for Mississauga West.  
But once we lose in this place, we lose. 
That is the way it works. 
I have answered it. 
My problem is not with the member for Brandon-Souris. 
He should take a Valium and relax.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
It was a very good decision.  
The member referred to the flag debate. 
I was in this place. 
It was at the beginning of this parliament.  
We hear people talking about decorum in this place. 
Let us take a look at what has happened.  
He took it to his riding. 
That is real decorum, that is. 
We have the young people stealing the furniture for goodness sake.  
I do not know what they were protesting.  
I think that Canadians are a bit embarrassed. 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
That being said, I want to go back to the heart of the debate. 
Yet the government rammed it through the House, rushing through every stage. 
We rushed through every single one of them.  
Closure was imposed at second reading. 
They wanted to impose closure in committee to limit work. 
You then said, and I will quote you directly: 
You continued by saying: 
I revert to my question. 
Did they go as far as to search through the legislative counsel's filing cabinets?  
Therefore, you cannot suggest that it has always been done in the past.  
How can he know that? 
The relationship of trust has been breached. 
That is not the object of the exercise.  
There is a saying that if wishes were horses, then beggars would ride. 
This matter deserves due consideration. 
He said ``We knew what was coming''. 
But how can he know what is coming? 
You see, the relationship of trust has been breached.  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
This is the chamber where we come together to build a better Canada. 
Mr. Speaker, you are the chairman of this board. 
This is the chamber of Canada.  
In the last six years something different has happened in this Chamber. 
Could you have refused them for this reason alone?  
I am not referring to that. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have listened very carefully to the intervention from my Bloc colleague. 
This is not a partisan issue. 
I refer to my previous intervention for those who are making catcalls. 
I would like to give a positive suggestion at this point.  
The Prime Minister's Office puts those people in place. 
Mr. Speaker, my colleague from the Reform Party has raised a very important issue.  
Does it really take their opinion into account? 
That is another story. 
But at least, there is some sort of consultation.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I have only a short comment to make. 
in terms of the motion concerning the Speaker. 
I have a lot of respect for the whip, who made a good speech. 
I ask the whip to enlighten me.  
I agree with him. 
We proposed another solution before that. 
What kind of recourse do we have left? 
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
I shall divide my time with the member for Brossard-La Prairie. 
Motion No. 59, introduced by the member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie, reads: 
The Speaker shall preserve order and decorum, and shall decide questions of order. 
I would submit that you continue to display superior competence and wisdom. 
I also believe that you have been impartial at all times. 
Without it there would be chaos. 
That is a clear indication of trying to challenge the ruling itself.  
It would be a mockery of our human conscience.  
I appeal to my colleagues. 
Let us exercise due diligence and care. 
Let us summon the reason of goodwill in us. 
Mr. Speaker, I continue to have confidence in you.  
Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard-La Prairie, Lib.):
This motion was introduced by the Bloc Quebecois.  
What a coincidence, so am I. 
I thought the issue was the Chair, not the Prime Minister.  
It is a blatant contradiction of terms by the leader of the Bloc.  
This is inconsistency at its best.  
Our Parliament is an eminently respectable institution, but it was created by human beings. 
It is managed by human beings. 
This means that it is fallible. 
By essence, it can be improved.  
We have just spent almost 40 hours straight voting on amendments. 
Regardless of the content of these amendments, the process itself is totally absurd. 
Surely the operation of our institution could be improved.  
The right of all parliamentarians to debate is a fundamental right. 
But systematically obstructing the business of the House is not a right. 
This morning, the hon. member for Roberval expressed his respect for the Canadian institution. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
I cannot believe it.  
I understand that this is an emotional situation. 
But we want you to know, Mr. Speaker, that we do have respect.  
I find that you treat us all with respect. 
That is what it is all about. 
Certainly that is what this is all about. 
That is the democratic process and our colleagues have to understand that.  
I ask my colleagues to withdraw the non-confidence motion. 
That motion is not the right thing to do. 
I ask that they consider that immediately. 
Yes, we want them to be able to debate. 
I will not agree with it and neither will my colleagues. 
I ask that they withdraw the motion.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
It has led to a high level of frustration. 
I think the motion was launched on the basis of frustration, nothing more nothing less.  
You earned your way to stand in this place and represent your constituents. 
I think you have done an extremely good job.  
I was with you in a previous parliament, Mr. Speaker. 
I guess we share a commonality. 
We know what it is like to be a backbencher on the government side. 
This job by definition is frustrating regardless of what side we sit on.  
Few members have that opportunity. 
For the most part I think we do it fairly well. 
The number does not extend much beyond a couple of handfuls. 
It is a very small number of countries. 
This is a place we can be proud of. 
It is a tough and brutal business. 
The weapons we use are merely words. 
From time to time we do get exercised. 
I have become exercised, because we are here fighting for what we believe in.  
Mr. Speaker, you are merely the referee. 
You have the toughest job. 
Being prime minister is not easy. 
We elect you to referee this place and we expect you to be perfect. 
We expect you to rule every time according to the way we see things. 
You were elected by us. 
You could not, trust me.  
My personality does not lead me to be a referee.  
Mr. Speaker, you are defenceless. 
In this place our weapons are our words. 
The bells rang for 16 days. 
The Speaker was put in a very precarious position. 
The members were using the rules, as they saw them, to send a message home. 
We have seen it in the House on a couple of occasions. 
However, it is wrong of them to take it out on the Speaker. 
They are using the rules that exist. 
We are all human.  
Mr. Speaker, we support you. 
I think this House supports you. 
We want you there. 
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Cooperation, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
I asked if anyone wished to ask a question or make a comment. 
Perhaps there were others. 
Consequently he has about 26 seconds left.  
These amendments said ``This act shall come into force-'' 
Enough of these stupid remarks. 
The member has to stop insulting us, and right now. 
I hope that we can end this debate in a civilized way. 
I know that emotions are running very high. 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):
I have known you since you were an educator and an administrator. 
I thank the member for Saint John for her remarks.  
I believe that is why you are there as the Speaker. 
That is very disappointing to me.  
I know of your patience and your fairness, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I admire the member for St. Catharines. 
I think he has been a pretty good and calm individual in the House. 
He has obviously expressed his friendly relations with the Speaker. 
The issue to me is really one of the legislative counsel. 
The legislative counsel brought this concern to the House. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the question and his remarks.  
I am not a lawyer. 
I am a team player. 
I believe they have to work together to make this happen for us.  
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
I would like to know his opinion on this subject.  
However, we know what the ruling was. 
Mr. Speaker, I maintain that full confidence in all of you.  
I think there is a problem. 
I do not think it is a problem that occurred this week or this month. 
Some who are better would go back further than that.  
I think we have to do that. 
It was something that did not make me feel good. 
Instead it was ``We are not going to allow this thing to happen, regardless. 
It is not going to change anything. 
All we are going to do is obstruct''.  
It is our responsibility to do that. 
The referee does not make the rules.  
There is something else I find interesting. 
Here that is not the case. 
There were members from all parties in the House who elected you.  
It is a tough job to herd cats. 
This is a fight between the Bloc and the government in this particular case. 
We do not expect the Speaker to fix that fight. 
All the Speaker can do is referee and manage. 
We do not expect him to solve those problems. 
We set the rules. 
This Chamber sets the rules. 
This country sets the rules in the Chamber. 
It is not for the Speaker to do.  
I profess to have not much but a little experience in this area. 
I want to express my personal support and my absolute confidence in you, Mr. Speaker. 
I am very sorry we are even having to debate this motion today.  
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I was not expecting to come to the House this afternoon. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am on questions and comments. 
He and I lived together for five years. 
He and I and others shared a condominium here in Ottawa. 
I know the gentleman who occupies the chair. 
I consider him a personal friend. 
I voted for him again in 1997. 
I know this man. 
I know that he is fair. 
I know he does his job as well as anyone.  
He is a good referee. 
There is not a drop of partiality in his blood.  
What does that suggest, hon. members? 
Mr. Speaker, I will keep my comment very short. 
I believe the Bloc member has a question also.  
Certainly I underscore everything that the member just said. 
I have always respected the choice that I made.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
This is the issue. 
This is a change we were not advised of.  
Mr. Speaker, the member is right. 
I do not understand it. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Macleod.  
I would have liked to have seen less of a focus on two particular decisions. 
That would be totally unacceptable both for members of the House and for democracy itself. 
That is one observation I wanted to make about this whole thing.  
I think those comments have come forward. 
We are not very shy about putting them forward at times. 
This is not just about us. 
It certainly is not just about you. 
It must be dealt with in a way that is fair to everyone. 
We even disagree with our leaders from time to time as you well know. 
Your role is absolutely vital in the House of Commons. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, many interesting points have been made by members. 
Mr. Speaker, my colleague raises some very cogent points. 
There has to be some order and some reason for things that are done.  
The member talks about wanting to make sure the House works. 
The simple answer to that is for whom. 
I think we need to be very fair minded about that.  
It sounds like a bit of a threat. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a very direct question. 
I mentioned that in my remarks.  
I hope that responds to the member's question.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
I look upon the Speaker as a referee and arbiter of the rules.  
I am frank to admit that I gave you my vote. 
I believe there were mistakes made on both sides. 
There was obstruction going on in the House. 
I am not a solicitor. 
I know little of solicitor-client privilege. 
That is the only way I could share that information. 
It would be very straightforward.  
There are times when the team should know every word that is being proposed. 
My comment is that they cannot.  
I believe that this ruling needs to be reviewed and revisited. 
I expect that this will be a healthy review of that specific ruling.  
I will be voting my personal confidence in the Speaker tonight when we vote. 
I share those thoughts in sincerity with the Speaker and with the table officer. 
I appreciate the opportunity to do so. 
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
I think I heard the last half, with which I agree.  
A decision taken by a majority is not necessarily democratic.  
Closure used to be an exceptional measure, but now it is the rule. 
I know there is another side to this. 
I would like to hear his explanation.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
What does that do for him as a member of parliament? 
The hon. member for Macleod.  
Mr. Speaker, that does cut to the heart of the issue. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
I want to repeat my statement for her.  
The idea is that we are all members of parliament. 
We enjoy certain rights and privileges. 
We can create literally hundreds of report stage motions. 
We can grind this place to a halt. 
We can put notices on the order paper for concurrence in committee reports. 
This place could grind to a halt.  
It is not in our best interest, obviously. 
The motion before the House has to do with a very serious matter. 
I concur that it is a serious allegation. 
In a majority situation that is what happens.  
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, it is a fair question. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of Order. 
There are a few minutes left in this sitting on this motion. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have much respect for my Bloc colleagues. 
What I do not understand is the position of the Reform Party.  
I think that is very sad. 
Our symbols are the flag and this parliament and your position, Mr. Speaker. 
But I urge the Reform Party to vote against this motion.  
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
I know many of my colleagues will not be voting in support of this motion. 
I just wanted to get that straight.  
Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to hear the member opposite. 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I will just make one comment.  
The third millenium is starting in this House in a very sad way. 
It is a bit like the veto for Quebec. 
For years, we believed that Quebec had that right. 
But Quebec was faced the hard fact. 
You were chosen by your peers. 
Healthy parliamentary democracy demands its restoration. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
There might perhaps be unanimous consent for the following motion. 
That Motion No. 59 be withdrawn and replaced by the following: 
( a ) the restructuring of the service to ensure confidentiality; or 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask for unanimous consent to move the following motion: 
That Motion No. 59 be withdrawn and replaced by the following: 
( a ) the restructuring of the service to ensure confidentiality; or 
Does the hon. member have permission to put the motion?  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am in the hands of the House. 
Do hon. members want the motion re-read? 
Mr. Speaker, I ask for unanimous consent to move the following motion: 
That Motion No. 59 be withdrawn and replaced by the following: 
( a ) the restructuring of the service to ensure confidentiality; or 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I have listened to this being read three times. 
So the answer is yes.  
Mr. Speaker, I would like to have it more clear than that. 
I would like to know if the government is committed- 
We are negotiating this on the floor of the House. 
We seem to be rushed into it. 
I am going to suspend the House for five minutes. 
You have five minutes to straighten yourselves out.  
(The sitting of the House was suspended at 6.46 p.m.) 
The House resumed at 6.50 p.m. 
I am willing to give the commitment that the government would do just that.  
The hon. member for Roberval is seeking unanimous consent to put a motion. 
Does the hon. member have unanimous consent of the House?  
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
(The House adjourned at 6.56 p.m.)
