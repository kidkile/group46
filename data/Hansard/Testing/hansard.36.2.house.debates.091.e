LABELLING OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS 
EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 91

The House met at 10 a.m. 
CANADA NATIONAL PARKS ACT 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
The seven communities will remain as special places. 
We will work to ensure their continued sustainability. 
Everyone will recognize that these are not average communities. 
This will be fought by a new provision against trafficking.  
We no longer allow the commercial exploitation of natural resources within national parks. 
The plans will respect the provisions in the act. 
The communities have an important role in this and in serving visitors. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):
Indeed, the word elk implies that there are elk in the park. 
There are also bison and many other different forms of wildlife.  
My love of the parks extends over the last 40 years. 
Camping was not as much fun when I got hungry.  
I love the park. 
Saskatchewan, as members know, has many acres of flat land. 
I cannot come up with the words which could adequately describe the mountains.  
Having travelled there several times I would certainly attest to that.  
I agree with the general idea of a national parks system in Canada. 
I have always loved the outdoors and camping under the stars. 
We were preparing a youth camp for summer activities. 
That is a picture of beauty which is etched permanently in my mind. 
I will never forget it.  
We made that little compromise. 
We had wonderful times in our trailer at the campsites of the different parks.  
I was not a well paid person. 
Those were the ones that attracted us because of their proximity to where we lived. 
We were able to enjoy them. 
It is now really only for the very rich.  
We were at the campground not very long ago. 
That is a policy which is very regrettable.  
For us as a family it was a wonderful experience.  
Many of them are spending time in the area just outside the parks. 
In southern Alberta we have a couple of areas which are really expanding very quickly. 
Canmore is probably the best example. 
That is a mistake as far as I am concerned. 
I think it is a very large error which I would like to see corrected.  
We are talking today about national parks. 
I believe that we need to respect the land. 
I believe that we need to respect the parks. 
We have always done our part to keep the campgrounds clean. 
I think that is important. 
It is a matter of individual responsibility.  
That is an error.  
There are other things as well.  
People live there and tourists come from all over the world to visit there.  
That is a totally misdirected set of priorities. 
It is not a great secret that I am a person who believes in God. 
One of the songs I have sung many times is ``How Great Thou Art''. 
I do not know if anyone here knows that song.  
Please do not sing it.  
Our native friends have that same affinity. 
They often express in their religious faith the grandeur of God's creation. 
There are some misdirected points in the bill before us. 
That is a totally misdirected priority.  
There is no consultation, no input from the people, no input from the stakeholders.  
That is total nonsense.  
No, it is not nonsense. 
The member opposite says that what I said was nonsense. 
There is no requirement for meaningful consultation among the stakeholders.  
There are situations in Banff for example. 
Talk about ecology, talk about the environment. 
It would have to be debated in parliament. 
That is not the case anymore. 
Now it allows simply for orders in council. 
No public notification is required. 
I think that is an error.  
I want to talk a bit about that. 
Why would they destroy that which attracts people from all around the world? 
Tourism is so important to our country. 
It is economically important. 
I will not negate that. 
We need a dialogue between them. 
We need to come to agreements. 
Sometimes the federal government may have to give a little. 
I simply do not believe in the high handed, autocratic, dictatorial government. 
That is what we have in this bill.  
That is most important. 
I am aware that I could have more time to speak. 
The others have been blissfully silent.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
The Bloc Quebecois supports the principle of the bill. 
Let us begin with the changes to the procedure for establishing new parks. 
Bill C-27, however, proposes a new procedure involving an order in council. 
We have two comments to make on this section of the bill. 
This is very important. 
This park is located in Ontario on Lake Erie.  
The existing legislation provides fines for poaching wildlife. 
The bill contains a new offence for trafficking. 
Bill C-27 also proposes penalties for repeat offenders. 
The bill also seeks to restrict the development of communities. 
There is no assurance of an elementary respect for municipal bylaws or provincial regulations. 
This is a point of considerable concern to the Bloc Quebecois.  
(ii) in resort subdivisions, for the purpose of residence.  
Above and beyond this bill, a change in corporate culture is required. 
Unfortunately, the bill shows no evidence of this. 
The former appear first, while ecological integrity comes second. 
Allow me to quote the auditor general: 
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance):
They must also obey its spirit and intent.  
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Is it because the military has known all along what is causing the sickness?  
Mr. Marcel Proulx (Hull-Aylmer, Lib.):
Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, Lib.):
A shining example of that vitality is Greater Napanee, a town in my riding.  
Greater Napanee is an old town with a new spirit. 
FRENCH LANGUAGE EDUCATION IN MANITOBA 
Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Limoges (Windsor-St. 
MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AWARENESS MONTH 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
I encourage all Canadians to join in this effort.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
BATTLE OF THE ALTLANTIC 
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
Canada declared war on Germany on September 10, 1939.  
Canadians shared in some of the worst hardships imaginable. 
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. 
It seems Canadians want to send him a strong message. 
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
To our Canadian veterans I say, we are all in your debt. 
We offer you our humble and heartfelt thanks.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Electors find this repugnant and offensive. 
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this week is Emergency Preparedness Week. 
MINISTER OF CANADIAN HERITAGE 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
We in Quebec have a real department of culture, not one for heritage. 
My name is Richard and I am a Quebecer.  
My name is Richard and I am a Quebecer.  
Mr. Ivan Grose (Oshawa, Lib.):
Strengthened economic viability benefits not just the first nations but its neighbours. 
SUMMER STUDENT EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM 
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
Tuition fees have risen beyond our young people's ability to pay. 
Student debt is at an all time high. 
Student bankruptcies are the highest in the history of the country. 
These statistics seem to have gone unnoticed by the federal government. 
The future of the country are young people.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
There are no substantive differences between those two reports.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
The minister said that she had acted on the advice of Deloitte & Touche. 
We know she has not. 
It would be so simple to bring forward the truth.  
There is no clear underlined addressing of that in the final plan. 
Could the minister or her representative prove it? 
Read it to me. 
Where is it in that plan?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Some longer term action plans are also included that further strengthen the approach.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
Her parliamentary secretary thinks everything is grand as well. 
There needs to be a clear summary plan. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Why is she trying to undermine the work of an officer of this House?  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Canadian Alliance):
What is the explanation for this one?  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Canadian Alliance):
Now access requests are being routinely withheld. 
We are getting a little close.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We have released 24 internal audits for the perusal of the opposition. 
As usual, the way those members look at life, they harp on the negative.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
In order to call back funds we have to establish the existence of an overpayment. 
Our review of this file does not indicate that there was an overpayment. 
Therefore we cannot ask for the money back.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the covering up of tracks has gone on long enough.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
When will the minister be tabling the invoices?  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
When does the minister intend to table these invoices?  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member opposite has just made an allegation of impropriety. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
This means that medium and small businesses are losers too. 
My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are concerned with the needs of the unemployed. 
That is what we have been helping to do.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
The government has been stealing money from the workers all along.  
Sometimes in the heat of battle we say things. 
I know the hon. member did not want to say stealing.  
No, Mr. Speaker, taking.  
It was taking, of course. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
The sixth principle would be predictable long term funding. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We reject the Tory approach and the Reform approach to financing. 
We will continue to do it the right way.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
Mr. Speaker, that is nonsense. 
It started out at a 50:50 ratio. 
This is truly hypocritical of the minister, because he- 
Once again I would ask members to stay away from words like hypocritical.  
Mr. Speaker, the minister knows full well that that is nonsense. 
Will the minister act or take- 
The hon. Minister of Health.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, unfortunately the facts do not support the member's assertion.  
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
This year, we increased them again. 
The increase for the past two years is over 25%.  
We are in the process of achieving- 
He has some time left if he wishes to add something. 
Otherwise, I will hear the hon. member for Lotbiniere.  
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is the hon. member who is not making any sense. 
We went 50-50, because we wanted to accommodate the provinces. 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
The questions raised by the hon. member are quite inappropriate. 
The facts speak for themselves.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Canadian Alliance):
The CTA is not at fault. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Therefore their approach is largely a mirage.  
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to clear up this subject once and for all. 
First, sidewinder was not an investigation, it was a study. 
Second, it was not shut down, it was completed. 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Canadian Alliance):
Where is the justice in all of this?  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
I look forward to receiving that report from the committee.  
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
I do not know how it could be much clearer.  
Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Middlesex, Lib.):
Activities will be planned right across the country. 
I know all hon. members will want to join me in congratulating them.  
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, recently Stephen Truscott cleared his name on a wrongful murder conviction. 
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEE BOARD 
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Canadian Alliance):
Why does she continue this disreputable system?  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
I remind hon. members to please always address the Chair.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  
Is there a review actually taking place? 
Was the minister simply making it up? 
Who is in charge?  
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the government speaks with one voice. 
Do you want an answer?  
It will be the first one we ever got.  
Mr. Speaker, in this instance- 
I know the hon. member was addressing me and yes, I would like an answer.  
The method of that public debate has yet to be established. 
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
One thing is clear. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
They are the one source of information that links many of our smaller communities together.  
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
It would be rather untoward to dictate how it is managed.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I would have liked an answer.  
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
I do not really understand where the member is coming from on that. 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
There was nothing to indicate any wrongdoing.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Our committee can only recommend amendments to the bill. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
The government accepted the agreement.  
Yes, there have been problems. 
That has been acknowledged by Air Canada. 
The hon. member for West Nova.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
I will have to check if such a request was made. 
I will get back to my hon. friend with the fullest possible information.  
Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we will look into the audit that my hon. colleague is referring to.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for endorsing the words of the Prime Minister. 
This is great praise indeed coming from the NDP.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
It is getting a little bit rambunctious. 
Please, go directly to your question.  
That brings to a conclusion our question period today.  
They are participating in the Africa Direct Conference.  
USE OF PARLIAMENTARY SUPPLIES 
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
The letter was signed by the member of parliament for New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby. 
There is a place for partisan activity in every member's office. 
This brings into disrepute the reputation of every member of the House. 
As members of parliament, we are all offended by this.  
On that, I rest my case. 
This is up to the Hon. Member to determine. 
He does it within his own conception of what is or is not proper. 
If something improper arises, Hon. Members usually discuss it in the Committee.  
This would be extremely difficult. 
I appeal to hon. members to use their good judgment when sending out material. 
I suggest that we handle this particular case in this way. 
COMMENTS DURING QUESTION PERIOD 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):
Hansard will show that is not true, and I- 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):
Thereafter, I contacted the newspaper. 
As an assistant professor, I had absolutely no connection with the government. 
Lastly, I had a business which dealt with agricultural products. 
Is that a crime? 
He has given ample information for us to make up our own minds.  
Mr. Speaker, I have 15 more seconds.  
All right, I will give you 15 more seconds.  
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
I want to ask the Deputy Prime Minister to retract his statement. 
That is what happens in debate. 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):
I would like you to advise- 
The hon. member has advised them but I will bolster that. 
The party should be known as the Canadian Alliance. 
That is correct, Mr. Speaker. 
Does the hon. member have permission to put the motion?  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Canadian Alliance):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to table a petition bearing 5,043 signatures. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, Question No. 45 will be answered today. 
Question No. 45- Ms. Pierrette Venne: 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
I ask, Mr. Speaker, that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
CANADA NATIONAL PARKS ACT 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
On the following page, the Commission continues as follows: 
The following are some of its recommendations: 
Before the Liberals took office, Parks Canada had a $410 million budget. 
Today, its budget is $350 million. 
Its staff has been reduced from 4,000 to 3,000.  
I used this park to break the Quebec government's back. 
And I tell you I am proud of this.  
It was not me who said that.  
Such attitudes are revolting. 
The proposed legislation also provides for the designation of historic sites. 
The weather is nice and warm today. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
It is a very Canadian thing. 
It exists solely to preserve our national parks, and we must keep that in mind.  
He was saying that he has yet to run into another Canadian tourist there. 
That sort of struck me. 
We feel this is very important. 
This would streamline the process for creating new national parks.  
However, we have to treat these seven communities very differently. 
They are unique in Canada. 
People naturally crave and seek to live in those types of beautiful surroundings. 
The hon. member used the example of Dall sheep. 
They are hunted legitimately by hunters with permits, but they are also poached. 
Our national parks in Canada are in desperate need of repair.  
There has been a great deal of interest in the bill. 
We are really getting quite specific. 
That will be in the legislation. 
It will no longer be an option. 
It will be deemed to be law.  
The community plans will have to be tabled in the House of Commons. 
That would be our obligation. 
If every generation adopted that, we would move forward with some cohesive plan.  
I have already talked about the poaching penalties. 
I approve of that wholeheartedly.  
It should be viewed that way.  
The term ecological integrity comes up often. 
Nobody can argue with that kind of lofty principle.  
That is where we have to blow the whistle. 
It is not just two words thrown together. 
People recognize the term as meaning a certain thing. 
He proposed an amendment to the Canada Parks Act. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, he is the member for Davenport. 
I guess the Liberal Party was frightened by the language. 
He did not even get the support of his own caucus.  
It would have been binding in the truest sense of the word. 
We will be fighting for amendments to the act. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):
It is highly desirable that these places be accessible to people.  
The member has indicated there should be no privatization in these parks. 
We are not advocating the nationalization of motels.  
I agree that they should be accessible within reasonable limits. 
I remind him that God's creation is a very fragile place. 
Accessibility is one thing.  
Even revenue generating is not an evil thing. 
Accessibility is a dual-edged sword. 
The other side of the question was commercialization. 
That is one question. 
The second one is very short. 
Presently it requires a change in the act by parliament. 
Is the member pleased with that?  
Those provisions already exist.  
I do not see it as taking away the authority of parliament.  
We are not threatened by that. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
For instance, clause 9 of the bill reads: 
I would call that a very significant increase.  
They grew up there, as did their parents before them. 
Where will these people turn to? 
Who will be their advocate? 
They are not satisfied with the way they are represented, even if they pay taxes. 
They see no solution in this bill.  
The government of the day would do well to heed the advice of committee members.  
The fact that Canada's national parks are in decline comes as no surprise. 
The natural beauty of the area has attracted tourists from all over the world. 
However, we now recognize that this growth has not come without a price. 
I think we all recognize that something has to be done. 
Let us face it, local businesses are there to stay. 
I went to Alberta three times to visit our national parks. 
They want to be part of the solution, not of the problem.  
The federal government will have to work with these people to find a solution. 
Is it not somewhat ironic when one thinks of it? 
There are many positive elements to be found in this proposed piece of legislation. 
I have many concerns about this proposed piece of legislation. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The question is on the motion for second reading of Bill C-27. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
LABELLING OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ) moved: 
Why are we calling for the mandatory labelling of genetically modified foods? 
Why this debate and reflection?  
The answer is very simple. 
Every person is entitled to know the nature of the foods he is eating. 
Far too many questions remain unanswered.  
What is substantial equivalence? 
According to her, ``the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence''. 
Let me quote Elizabeth Abergel on this issue: 
The applications of genetic engineering to agriculture have generated a strong controversy. 
The assessment of risks remains a difficult scientific issue. 
However, the marketing of transgenic foods is accelerating, in spite of these scientific uncertainties.  
This goes against the principle of prudence, which promotes the anticipation of risks.  
The expression ``new form of plants'' includes any new variety. 
These two concepts allow assessment of the environmental risks associated with new forms of plants. 
Thus, a GMO considered sufficiently familiar will not undergo any environmental risk assessment. 
Thus, certain common foods modified by gene therapy could become dangerous.  
According to him, there are other risks: 
What would happen to birds and insects during the seeding season? 
In many years from now, the ecosystem could be facing serious problems.  
Where is the problem?  
With pesticides you can at least spray and stop there. 
The questions raised are serious, but we still have found no answer. 
The word profit is a constantly recurring one in this theory.  
Do we have the right to change nature to suit our needs? 
Are we part of nature? 
Why not adapt to nature?  
Whichever, the result is the same. 
Why, finally, should we put all our eggs in one basket with GMOs?  
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Canada quite rightly prides itself on its regulatory systems. 
The government believes that all labelling must be credible, meaningful and enforceable. 
A completed standard is expected within the next six to 12 months.  
Agricultural Biotechnology in the New Millennium''.  
The government recognizes that consumers want choice. 
We built that reputation by putting very rigorous regulatory systems in place.  
Our approval systems are science based and transparent. 
Even after a product has been approved, its case is never closed. 
The regulatory system assesses products on a case by case basis. 
The Royal Society named its expert panel last February.  
In addition, the regulatory system in place is rigorous, thorough and scientific.  
For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote against Motion M-230.  
BILL C-11-NOTICE OF TIME ALLOCATION 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
LABELLING OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS 
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):
This is a topical debate and one which I think should take place.  
This was a natural process of slow selection which had few surprises. 
There are early ripening varieties. 
However, even with this gradual process of improvement, we have occasionally had problems. 
This plant came from China. 
We have an intervention in fact, at the molecular level, going on. 
There are some scientific concerns on this issue and some scientific debate. 
What are some potential benefits of this new form of genetic manipulation? 
We could have new medicinal properties brought more quickly to the market from these processes. 
We could also see land that is less fertile bearing crops and being productive. 
Those are just some of the potential benefits. 
As I said, this is not exhaustive at all.  
What do individuals see as potential hazards in this area? 
This is actually physically happening now and we have to figure out how and why.  
It is technically very difficult to label all genetically modified foods. 
It could be done, but it would be difficult. 
I would actually propose a mechanism to label those genetically modified free foods. 
It would be a graphic label. 
Also, I would suggest that this be voluntary. 
This is where I digress from my colleague a little. 
I favour small where small will do when it comes to bureaucracy. 
I would much prefer a voluntary process driven by the market. 
As an individual, I could then choose genetically modified free foods. 
That is the process I would use.  
We should try not to have a big political debate on this. 
I have listened to some organizations politicizing this. 
Let the consumer be aware and let the consumer choose.  
What a perfect opportunity to look at the two populations. 
Scientists are, in fact, able to do that. 
My congratulations to my colleague for bringing this debate. 
I hope the House will consider it carefully. 
I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this subject.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
They are looking to government for some direction in this matter.  
It is a basic, fundamental, health issue right. 
They have made that abundantly clear.  
He actually contradicted himself in the arguments we just heard. 
How would they know without adequate labelling on the package? 
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is involved. 
Health Canada approves products with respect to quality and safety. 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada assists in food production. 
Which jurisdiction is it? 
I come from an area with a large agri-food industry. 
In Manitoba agriculture is key and paramount to the health of our economy. 
The hon. member mentioned canola oil as an example. 
One company had a monopoly on the seed stock. 
Farmers cannot do that any more. 
Perverse is the word for it. 
The jury is still out on that issue. 
We do not know. 
There have been mistakes. 
There have been recent examples which gave consumers cause for alarm. 
Europeans do not want genetically modified food on their shelves. 
They demand to know if the food they are eating is genetically modified.  
It did not want to rock the boat. 
We just do not know the kinds of things that are being done. 
It is a terrible problem.  
However, it has had to do that on its own as an individual initiative. 
Let them know what it is they are actually eating. 
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
Madam Speaker, what an interesting debate. 
I want to speak specifically to that. 
The hon. member from Winnipeg mentioned the controversy surrounding the Brazil nut. 
That is not to say that they are going to die a natural death. 
As consumers, we will determine that.  
They have been very successful in doing that.  
What happens is that this conjures up all the fears we have as consumers. 
I only have to mention mad cow disease. 
Another example of that is atomic energy. 
The same is occurring in the genetically modified food industry. 
There are so many examples of where science can do good. 
One of them is in a new product called golden rice. 
They have put it into the white rice crop with huge benefits. 
None of us disagree with the benefit side of it.  
We have to know where it will lead and where it will stop. 
The other day I mentioned what they call the terminator seed. 
It is a monopoly on seed and food production. 
That is what scares a lot of us in the House. 
It is called the terminator seed.  
Imagine the repercussions in the third world. 
Countries would be forced to buy seed. 
Those are examples of science going too far. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
