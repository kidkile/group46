The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Fifty-fifth Anniversary of VE Day 
Hon. William M. Kelly :
National Palliative Care Week 
The Late Justice Ronald Newton Pugsley, Q.C. 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
He was an exceptional student.  
In 1973, he was appointed Queen's Counsel.  
He was also a past-president of the Dalhousie Law School Alumni Association. 
He was an inspiration and he will be missed.  
He was appointed to the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in 1993. 
Honourable senators, Justice Ronald N. Pugsley will be missed. 
Airworthiness of Sea King Helicopters-Log of Pilot 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
The mayday message is often the last heard from such an aircraft.  
Not all Pan situations are caused by aircraft problems. 
Conservation of Fresh Water 
This leaves most living organisms competing for the remainder - the "accessible runoff." 
In Ontario alone, there are over 3,000 freshwater lakes. 
The water table in southern Ontario is the lowest it has ever been. 
There is no relief in sight.  
We must stop wasting it in our present wanton fashion. 
Honourable senators, read your morning papers and see the future. 
Congratulations on Receipt of Honorary Doctorate Degrees from Mount Allison University 
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
Pages Exchange Program with House of Commons 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Mark is a native of Summerside, Prince Edward Island. 
On behalf of all honourable senators, I wish you welcome to the Senate. 
May you have an interesting and useful week with us.  
Tuesday May 9, 2000 
The Standing Senate Committee on Transport and Communications has the honour to present its 
Page 10, Clause 29:
Replace lines 4 to 15 with the following: 
(a) 2,000,000 units of account; and 
(b) 175,000 units of account multiplied by 
(3) Subsection (2) does not apply in respect of 
Replace lines 31 to 39 with the following: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Proceeds of Crime(Money Laundering) Bill 
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Bill to Change Name of Electoral District of Rimouski-Mitis 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Canada-France Inter-Parliamentary Association 
Meeting Held in Paris, France-Report of Canadian Delegation Tabled 
Replacement of Sea King Helicopters 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
However, let there be no doubt that we are certainly declaring a Pan alert.  
It is just a matter of how long they will spend in prison.  
Are we in fact facing the status quo? 
Have the decisions long since been taken? 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
That program apparently is proceeding quickly and should be completed within a reasonable time. 
It is not an entirely complete report. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Ontario-Effect of Development Project on Oak Ridges Moraine 
The Government of Ontario also has expressed its concern in this matter. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I thank the honourable senator for that question. 
She wishes some very specific information about that project. 
Nevertheless, it seems to me that there is a federal responsibility here. 
It is not just a matter of helping out the Government of Ontario. 
Honourable senators, my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Can the minister state in what way the government will make that decision? 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I did not hear the entire question. 
However, I will make the inquiry on behalf of the honourable senator.  
Could the honourable senator repeat the second part of his question?  
Honourable senators, I thank the minister for his response. 
Honourable senators, I am sure the government is aware of that statement. 
I cannot anticipate what action the government or cabinet may take. 
However, at the moment cabinet has no position on the matter. 
The Minister of Foreign Affairs has opposed it, however. 
The Minister of National Defence has said that the matter is not resolved. 
There seems to be a lack of coordination between two ministers in cabinet. 
This is awkward for the government.  
Three months ago, the government had not expressed its position clearly. 
However, at one point the government will have to make up its mind. 
This is what we want to know. 
When will the government make up its mind?  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
We all want to know who is winning at the moment; who is ahead. 
Is it the Minister of Foreign Affairs or the Minister of National Defence? 
Also, who is speaking for whom?  
Response to Civil War in Sierra Leone 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
The embassy in India, a neighbouring country, has responsibility for the country of Sierra Leone.  
I believe that is the case.  
The decision is that the United Nations presence will continue. 
It is being monitored closely by the Department of Foreign Affairs. 
Children are losing limbs daily. 
The war is being fought with child soldiers. 
For example, it is a diamond issue. 
It is not a one-country show. 
We endorse the efforts of the United Nations. 
However, we will do what we can. 
I believe efforts are moving in that direction.  
Government Support for Centre for Victims of Torture 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Response to Escalating Demand on System 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
The honourable senator raises an interesting issue. 
They placed two charts next to each other. 
The concern that the honourable senator brings forward is a very real one. 
I appreciate the honourable senator raising that matter.  
How will the governments of Canada address that reality? 
Certainly, it will involve money. 
However, the answer is not only money. 
The provinces and the federal government will be discussing these issues very soon. 
These are the types of questions that must be asked. 
The issue must be canvassed far more thoroughly. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Welcome to the Senate of Canada.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. P. Michael Pitfield :
Honourable senators, it had been my intention today to speak at length about this legislation. 
I think everyone will welcome that. 
All these issues are wrapped together. 
Surely we should be able to have these questions examined by our committee.  
It represents powerful arguments with which the government must deal.  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Melvin Perry Poirier :
There are various ways to face that threat. 
I shall mention four of them.  
Personally, I think this is the worst possible avenue. 
That is the approach being taken by the Government of Canada.  
The requirement of clarity is therefore self-evident.  
This aspect of the debate has already been examined at great length. 
Thus, I will not dwell on it any longer today. 
The first to complain would be Quebecers and they would be right.  
To be sure, this bill has come in for a certain amount of criticism. 
That is a view I do not share, honourable senators.  
Honourable senators, this government is betting on clarity. 
We are comfortable with this approach. 
However, I think it is appropriate, honourable senators, to define what is meant by "nationalism".  
Above all, we have faith in the judgment of Quebecers. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, would Senator Perry Poirier answer a few questions?  
Is a single committee sufficient to study this issue? 
Honourable senators, I think Senator Prud'homme has a very good idea. 
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
In fact, they were the second largest party in the early 1980s. 
The concept of separatism may not be dead yet.  
I fully support that concept. 
That causes a fatal flaw in Bill C-20. 
Let us look at the legal aspect first. 
You may say that, in this case, we are only speaking about one province. 
Senator Fraser is the chair of our caucus, a very intelligent and worthy person. 
That is a very dangerous policy indeed. 
I must ask what is happening here. 
Will it be aboriginal rights another time? 
How about a national energy policy?  
They could demand a change in the Constitution. 
Let us go a step further. 
Suppose there is a question on the aboriginal languages in the high Arctic. 
Going on from there, the whole area becomes somewhat of a race. 
What is supposed to stop them?  
I just came back from an inter-parliamentary conference in Jordan. 
Why is it non-racial? 
We do advertize it as such. 
I agree with you.  
The Senate is here for a very good reason. 
A bill was not necessary here. 
A resolution could have been passed, a resolution within their own house. 
I do not buy that for an instant.  
Before I sit down, I want to touch on the strategy.  
They are calling for 66 2/3.  
Now they can almost hear the thundering hooves - 
He is a poet!  
One of them could end up as Prime Minister. 
Democracies do funny things. 
The strategy of this bill absolutely befuddles me. 
It is a bad bill.  
Something is wrong there. 
Hon. John G.Bryden :
Would the Honourable Senator Taylor accept a question?  
I shall be happy to entertain a question from Senator Bryden.  
I compliment the honourable senator on it.  
Yes, honourable senators, I was. 
I am glad Senator Bryden emphasized that point. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is Senator Taylor asking for an extension of time?  
Honourable senators, I seek leave for time for questions.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I also have a question for Senator Taylor. 
In general, though, committees here in the Senate seem to turn out a good product. 
That manipulation can go on and on. 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, would the Honourable Senator Taylor be so kind as to take another question?  
Does Honourable Senator Taylor recall that statement?  
They were quoted nationally across the country. 
They were even quoted in this chamber. 
He stated, "I believe in my country before my party."  
My saintly old grandmother said she always voted for the person. 
I think it should be number one.  
As far as Mr. Dion is concerned, I know of his past. 
I had a meeting with him. 
We know each other very well. 
We have attended the Calgary Stampede together. 
The bull riding, of course, appeals to any politician.  
I believe that much of this debate about the Senate is based on a mistake. 
Somebody with a slip of the pen has led to a wrong interpretation.  
Since then, I have not had a meeting with him. 
This leads to two questions. 
It is beyond credibility that any such careless, imprecise terms could be applied accidentally.  
Senator Taylor was alluding to the question that I put previously. 
The article reads as follows: 
I address honourable senators today as both a senator and an Inuk.  
We are being forced to identify ourselves as part of a single "Quebec people." 
We are being denied our rights to self-identification and self-determination. 
In any future Quebec referendum on secession, our distinct voice will be drowned out. 
These acts by the Quebec government are grave violations of our human rights.  
We have participated as interveners in Quebec secession references. 
In regard to the aboriginal peoples, this argument is simply not valid.  
Today, I am providing you with proposed amendments that would achieve that result. 
It is the chamber of sober second thought. 
Honourable senators, my point was not only one of consultation. 
It is considered to be a modern-day treaty. 
At least we had a long debate. 
I believe that the Senate did its duty.  
I am of the opinion that nothing will come of the committee study. 
It may be unfair, but that is my perception.  
In that way, Senator Watt would have the opportunity to move them again in committee.  
They do not want us to tamper with what they have already decided.  
Honourable senators know my sensitivity to the first Canadians. 
We tend to forget about that, but I have not. 
I have always accommodated them. 
They would have much more time to properly screen the matter. 
Honourable senators, I am satisfied with the answer. 
Their sense of fairness and honesty was evident then. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Are you asking for an extension of the allotted time?  
Honourable senators, I have one quick question.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
He has said he will leave matters to the committee. 
The task before Senator Watt is somewhat daunting. 
I thank Senator Cools for her question. 
I have not spoken to them all. 
On motion of Senator Joyal, debate adjourned.  
Modernization of Benefits and Obligations Bill 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
The court has said that it will take a similar approach. 
Marriage as a social institution should absolutely be protected.  
I shall explain the word's origins. 
The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary defines "conjugal" as: 
For centuries, the weight of jurisprudence and law has supported this. 
This proposed change is revolutionary and unsupported by history.  
It is important that we understand the meaning. 
In biology, "conjugation" means genetic recombination - that is, a recombination of genetic material. 
Reproduction is not a legal process, it is a biological one.  
This is the process of genetic recombination. 
It is a recombination of genetic materials from both a man and a woman. 
The two homosexuals, as the prefix homo dictates, belong to the same mating type. 
Consequently, homosexual, erotic, carnal relationships cannot be conjugal.  
About clause 1.1, David Brown said: 
I would ask the committee to study this question. 
In fact, Mr. Justice Cory mentioned those words in obiter .  
In M. v. H. , Mr. Justice Cory stated at paragraph 59: 
I am hopeful that the committee will study this matter. 
I am sure that many questions will follow.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
May I have leave to finish my speech, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
That has always been my understanding. 
In point of fact, very little law has supported "sexual relationships" per se. 
It is important that society accords protection to homosexual persons. 
That is revolutionary and unheard of.  
Hon. Celine Hervieux-Payette :
Honourable senators, I should like to ask a question of the honourable senator.  
I thank the honourable senator for her thoughtful remarks.  
Honourable senators, a couple of things spring to mind. 
One senator has indicated that she has a disabled son. 
I shall give an example. 
There are endless relationships like that.  
This bill does not speak to that. 
Perhaps there will be conjugal relationship police, I do not know.  
I submit that that question should be reviewed in a careful way by the committee. 
I see Senator Nolin looking at me from across the way. 
Honourable senators, we are dealing here with a bit of an oddity. 
Even all the jurisprudence around marriage speaks in very different terms. 
Therefore, it is very troubling.  
My understanding has been that the law has always eschewed lust.  
Honourable senators, the persecution of homosexuals did not stop at the end of the war. 
Unfortunately, the social and political pressure still remains extremely strong.  
Why, in fact, do we have a charter? 
Just what did the Supreme Court do?  
In other words, the court recognized the equal rights of both types of couples. 
I was in favour of such a measure. 
When the Canadian Parliament has to address this matter, would we be doing something innovative? 
Would we be going against some sort of natural or anthropological law?  
Still, Canadian public opinion is probably above such uneasy reluctance.  
I believe there is a legal inconsistency. 
Either these unions are equal or they are not. 
Three judges decided on the very issue of the definition of marriage. 
There is no definition of marriage in Canadian legislation. 
The definition of marriage is essentially a common law definition. 
Allow me to state clearly that I will not vote against this bill. 
To me there is a fundamental distinction. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your desire to grant leave to extend?  
Where does equality stop?  
Perhaps Senator Joyal will permit a small correction, for the record. 
However, I am afraid he chose the wrong example. 
Honourable senators, I appreciate the precision given by the Honourable Senator Pearson. 
I would say that a doubt remained. 
Those innuendoes were made about him.  
Honourable senators, I knew Herbert Norman. 
I am a friend of his wife. 
Hon. Peter A. Stollery :
Honourable senators, I have one question. 
That is what marriage means to me in terms of a civil definition. 
The last thing in the world I would want to do is impugn his reputation. 
Honourable senators, that is why we have divorce on the basis of mutual consent. 
This is today the condition of divorce. 
It is no longer indissoluble. 
It can be put to an end by mutual consent. 
That clearly shows the contractual nature of marriage.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Third Reading-Motion in Amendment-Vote Deferred 
"(2) Not more than $4,000 of the total".  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
We are confident that this amendment will receive the support of all senators.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those honourable senators opposed to the motion in amendment please say "nay"?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
In my opinion, the "nays" have it.  
And two honourable senators having risen.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
That is correct, honourable senators.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Payments in Lieu of Taxes Bill 
It produced two reports, in 1995 and 1997.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Special Senate Committee on Bill C-20 
Motion to Appoint-Speaker's Ruling-Debate Adjourned 
Senator Celine Hervieux-Payette, P.C. 
That four members constitute a quorum; 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Nonetheless, I will try to deal with each of them separately.  
The two motions are separate and distinct questions from a procedural point of view. 
My understanding of this procedure seems to be confirmed by several precedents.  
Two of the cases predate the rule changes of 1991, the third does not. 
The rule of anticipation provides that 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella , (Deputy Leader of the Opposition):
You had better move the motion first.  
Honourable senators, I move: 
Senator Celine Hervieux-Payette, P.C. 
Senator Marie P. Poulin (Charette) 
That four members constitute a quorum; 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is it your pleasure to adopt the motion?  
May we have an explanation of the motion, honourable senators?  
There are several reasons for saying that. 
It has before it various pieces of legislation. 
It is a very busy committee.  
It will take quite a bit of time and attention. 
That would be up to the members of the committee.  
One issue that I should comment on is the matter of membership. 
This could be dealt with in a number of ways. 
It is chaired by the government whip, Senator Mercier. 
It would determine the balance of membership. 
On motion of Senator Cools, debate adjourned.  
Tobacco Youth Protection Bill 
First, I shall describe the problem that the bill seeks to address. 
Therefore, the figure may well be significantly above 45,000.  
Second, the age at which people start to smoke has gone down significantly. 
Finally, there is the question of costs. 
Young people are the important target group that we must focus on. 
Bill S-20 is about young people. 
The bill addresses young people and is intended to serve young people. 
We hear the arguments of "freedom of choice" or "lifestyle." 
I believe in freedom of choice. 
Bill S-20 is about protecting our kids. 
It is not a question of freedom of choice. 
However, I feel profoundly different when the issue relates to children. 
Again, that is what Bill S-20 is about.  
In fact, I believe that there are many good things that the government has done. 
First, we have good tobacco legilation. 
I think that legislation is very useful and productive. 
However, there is still one major gap left in funding. 
That works out to 66 cents per capita. 
How do we find a solution? 
California is the state that has pioneered tobacco control.  
Dr. Bal has a sense of humour. 
His budget had been cut in half.  
His funding is driven by the number of cigarettes being sold. 
Massachusetts levied an extra 25 cents on each packet of cigarettes. 
There is no reason we cannot do it. 
There is nothing magic down there. 
They have a comprehensive plan. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
What is the wish of the Senate?  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I propose that we not see the clock. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your wish, honourable senators, to not see the clock?  
I appreciate the opportunity to carry on with my remarks.  
The point I was trying to make is a simple one. 
We have a model, a template. 
I have here a list of spending in some of the states, in Canadian funds. 
We are not alone. 
We are not inventing the wheel. 
This is not magic. 
This is reflected in the bill as well. 
We all know that does not work.  
At least the Liberal organizers know that. 
Thank you, Senator Prud'homme. 
It is not just Liberal organizers who know it. 
People who want to communicate with Canadians know it. 
We need our own programs.  
More to the point, we need to spend at a reasonable level. 
What are the important principles of the bill? 
That is in the bottom quartile of what the CDC recommends. 
That is not very much money if you think about. 
Remember Mississippi, up $6 above that. 
We can do better than Mississippi. 
That works out to 19 cents per pack or $1.50 per carton. 
It cannot plan from one year to the next. 
That louses up all of its planning.  
The bill would have a transparent decision-making process. 
Every decision would be made public when it was made public. 
We would all know who got the money. 
It is really tough. 
It is tough for parliamentarians and it is a lot tougher for the public.  
It is 10 per cent of the overall grant. 
We have talked about the number of deaths going from 40,000 to 45,000. 
It is distilled down and available for all of us to see. 
The current approach is haphazard and infective. 
There is no concept of the appropriate levels of funding. 
There is a need for a comprehensive national approach.  
Why do we need all of this? 
We need it because California has proved it works. 
In the long run, it saves money. 
It only stands to reason.  
The minister calls in the deputy. 
We all know that successful departments need that twinning. 
That is nothing unique to the Liberals or the Conservatives. 
It is true of governments everywhere. 
That is the nature of how governments work.  
We are talking about something that is not a certainty. 
No one has a good grip on how the minds of adolescents work. 
I know I do. 
That goes part and parcel with the academic and scientific process. 
We must accept that. 
They will show you the list. 
All of a sudden tobacco control becomes a political football.  
That does not make any sense. 
It does not make sense.  
It also requires evaluation so people will know where there are failures. 
There is no problem there.  
In California, the issue was passed by Proposition 99. 
In Massachusetts, the governor started censoring ads. 
He is not an expert on the issue. 
That was the whole ad, yet it was yanked by the governor. 
That is not part of the health process.  
This bill will provide the funding. 
This is not a tax bill.  
Hon. Pierre-Claude Nolin :
There are three reasons why it is acceptable. 
There have been legal rulings to that effect. 
Bill S-20 improves on Bill S-13. 
That may seem similar, but they are two completely different things. 
We must repeat the exercise responsibly, as we are capable of doing.  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, I will add my voice to that of Senator Nolin. 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (The Hon. the Acting Speaker) :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to, and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Sir John A. Macdonald Day Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
On motion of Senator Hays, for Senator Grafstein, debate adjourned.  
A Bill to Change the Names of Certain Electoral Districts 
Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
Demographics is usually the reason cited for the change.  
Some people have some concerns about this proposed legislation. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
We must put our cards on the table. 
For instance, one member represents the riding of Dollard. 
This is just an example, because Kirkland is not in the riding of Dollard.  
That neighbourhood was called Parc-Extension. 
Then it would not have been possible to forget Rosemont, where I live. 
This would create political headaches in Hampstead and Cote-Saint-Luc. 
It would become the riding of Mount Royal-Cote-Saint-Luc-Hampstead-Cote-des-Neiges. 
Everyone was re-elected. 
His name was Joe, he was Canadian and he was very happy. 
However, that is another issue.  
Senator Rompkey is proposing, without naming them, a list of very long names. 
He will have no choice but to amend the electoral map. 
I always raise the same objections. 
Parliament should have the wisdom to do that. 
When a redistribution takes place, it should remain in effect until the next election. 
This is so reasonable that I wonder why we do not do so. 
I do not want to be philosophical here. 
How much does every change that takes place between elections cost?  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
So they change names when they feel like it. 
So when such a change takes place, it affects the situation in a province directly. 
This is another matter of principle that arises. 
On motion of Senator Kinsella, for Senator Nolin, debate adjourned.  
Privileges, Standing Rules and Orders 
Fourth Report of Committee -Debate Adjourned 
Honourable Senator Austin, P.C. ). 
The committee reviewed both questions of privilege in its proceedings.  
The Senate has taken the question of a breach of privilege very seriously indeed.  
The way the process would work is as follows. 
In our report, we are making such a recommendation to this house.  
We have some additional observations, honourable senators, with respect to the practice of committees. 
Hopefully, there will be very few matters in the future.  
He referred to the fact that it would appear in the next few weeks. 
I am not doing justice to the actual text of this report. 
I urge honourable senators to read it. 
It is not a long report; it is carefully written. 
I believe this is a more workable system than the one currently in the rules.  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, I thank Honourable Senator Austin for his excellent work. 
I am looking at this report with some interest. 
He made reference in his speech to a letter from Senator Pearson. 
The report itself, at paragraph 31, refers to the letter. 
Would Senator Austin table a copy of that letter, please?  
I will then advise the honourable senator. 
I am reading from the report of the committee and it states: 
It seems to me that it is entirely in order. 
Honourable senators, Senator Pearson is here. 
Perhaps she can assist.  
I have no objection to that.  
Honourable senators, I will discuss this with Senator Austin. 
I have no objection to that letter being tabled here in the Senate. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Either you are tabling it or not.  
Honourable senators, this is an interesting situation. 
Senator Austin is saying he has some concerns about confidentiality. 
That can be left for another day.  
Honourable senators, I would reply to Senator Cools in this fashion. 
I would extend the same courtesy to any senator. 
I would make an inquiry to see whether the senator had any objection. 
It is not part of our report on the questions of privilege.  
To that extent, I welcome the kind of intense work the committee has done.  
There once was a time when one saw no such reports about the Senate. 
I am not speaking to the matter today. 
My intention was to simply put those questions to Senator Austin. 
On motion of Senator Cools, debate adjourned.  
This system uses impressively advanced technology.  
These documents reveal just how empty those assurances are.  
Peter Hain, U.K. minister of state said: 
Active missile defence raises complex and difficult issues. 
We have made it clear - 
- to the U.S. and Russia - 
North Korea's missile program is primitive by world standards. 
An historic summit between North and South Korea is looming. 
Honourable senators, NMD is the trap now waiting to be sprung on Canada.  
After careful consideration, the Canadian government of the day said no. 
That is where Canada's efforts must remain focused.  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
I should like to ask a question of the Honourable Senator Roche. 
He clearly expressed great hesitation and reservation. 
I would hate to think that officials of the Pentagon would do that. 
On motion of Senator Taylor, debate adjourned.  
Future of Canadian Defence Policy 
Honourable Senator Rompkey, P.C. ). 
I must say that my remarks will be both complementary and complimentary. 
I applaud the honourable senator for raising this matter. 
I hope that will be evident in my remarks.  
As a matter of fact, my co-chair is to my right. 
I was then in the other place, and he was in the Senate. 
Senator Forrestall was a member of that committee. 
It was satisfying for us as parliamentarians to have that reaction. 
Therefore, this limited influx of new money hardly raises the basic budget line. 
Just as important as inadequate funding is the issue of the reduction in military personnel. 
I should like to briefly address the conditions to which our forces find themselves exposed. 
One of the most important aspects of our forces is the reserves. 
I look forward to the report of John Fraser. 
As always, the bottom line seems to be money. 
This, in turn, affects the core capability and readiness of the Canadian Forces. 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
I regret to inform the Honourable Senator Rompkey that his time for speaking has expired. 
Is there unanimous consent for the honourable senator to continue his speech?  
I am nearing the end of my speech, honourable senators.  
The Canadian public is also skeptical about the forces' capabilities. 
Many MPs are now pushing for a five-year program of budget increases. 
The difficulties are well known. 
In this volatile environment, our forces have undergone massive cuts. 
Partial measures and partial successes are not good enough. 
Honourable senators, would the honourable senator entertain a question?  
I should like to associate myself with the remarks made by the Honourable Senator Rompkey. 
Honourable senators, that is a difficult question to answer. 
We are looking back at what the special committee would have recommended, had it known. 
I think that we were right in our recommendations. 
I think we established a bottom line. 
However, I do not think that bottom line has been followed. 
I think we have fallen below that bottom line. 
Having set a benchmark, I am disappointed that that benchmark has not been followed. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, I, too, have a question for the Honourable Senator Rompkey. 
First, I wish to thank the honourable senator for his remarks. 
I am tempted to ask his co-chair if he agrees. 
We are seeing that in the flight from Sierra Leone. 
Is there some merit in challenging that? 
If that is your bottom line, then let us try it. 
Let us see if it works. 
I am asking about the platform. 
We do not have that capacity. 
Could the honourable senator comment on this issue? 
Could the honourable senator comment on that kind of platform?  
I shall be glad to do so. 
I am glad that this issue has been raised. 
That is something we can do in this chamber. 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Prime Minister's Visit to Middle East and Persian Gulf 
Hon. Pierre De Bane rose pursuant to notice of Thursday, May 4, 2000: 
Multilateral negotiations complement - they do not replace - bilateral negotiations. 
Canada is one of the main partners in the multilateral process. 
We know that the refugee question is a difficult one. 
Canada has hosted two of the eight plenary sessions held to date.  
It has assisted Palestinian refugees in Lebanon to gain access to hospitals. 
We have taken part in every mission since. 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Senator De Bane, your 15-minute speaking time is up. 
Honourable senators, is leave granted to allow the honourable senator to continue?  
In Egypt, Prime Minister Alaf Ebeid publicly complimented Canada. 
We are not here to preach but to share our expertise and our experience.  
Canada's experience can be relevant. 
Our Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms inspired the Supreme Court of Israel. 
The Prime Minister did not hesitate to broach sensitive topics with his interlocutors. 
In a word, the visit was an outstanding success. 
He is the first leader of the Canadian government to undertake such an important visit. 
The entire Egyptian cabinet was present. 
Who do you think was the master of ceremonies? 
Ms Isabelle Martin of Quebec City, a young diplomat at our embassy. 
It was like that in each country. 
I was proud to see these Canadian diplomats.  
The hostility was palpable, many times descending into sheer bad faith. 
Even so, she skilfully handled the interrogation. 
This was the first official visit by a Canadian Prime Minister to the Middle East. 
I mentioned the dinner at which the master of ceremonies was Ms Isabelle Martin.  
Almost 20 per cent of the Israeli population is Arab. 
On a personal note, I want to say that I was born in Haifa. 
I saw the house where I was born. 
I had not seen it for more that half a century. 
He spoke to them. 
In so doing, the Prime Minister made history. 
I saw then that the Prime Minister had kept his promise. 
What about those statements that certain reporters branded as gaffes?  
How did the story arise? 
He indicated his disappointment. 
The Prime Minister of France also had all sorts of encounters, all sorts of problems. 
Our Prime Minister had to face only the criticism of the Canadian media.  
Neither newspaper said anything about support for a unilateral declaration of independence.  
Israel was insisting on the border being 100 metres back from the lake. 
The Israelis have never been happy with the working group. 
The final story was the alleged misreading of dress customs in Saudi Arabia.  
So, honourable senators, that ends the press review. 
On motion of Senator Prud'homme, debate adjourned.  
Hon. Peter A. Stollery , pursuant to notice of May 4, 2000, moved:

The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable senators, is it your pleasure to adopt the motion, as amended?  
Committee Authorized to Examine Emerging Developments in Russia and Ukraine
