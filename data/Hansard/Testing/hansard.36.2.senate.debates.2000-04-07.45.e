Anniversary of Assault on Vimy Ridge 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
They shared the sandwich and a bit of coffee. 
It was a simple soldier's meal for an extraordinary man. 
He was a great general with whom the Canadian troops got along very well. 
Many before had tried unsuccessfully to do what the Canadians accomplished. 
They are too near 
And by whose hand.  
Budget Report of Joint Committee Presented and Printed 
Friday, April 7, 2000 
The Standing Joint Committee for the Scrutiny of Regulations has the honour to present its 
("A" presented only for the Senate) 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Legal and Constitutional Affairs 
Notice of Motion to Authorize Committee to Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Monday, April 10, 2000, I shall move: 
Absence of Leader of the Government 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Wednesday will be an important sitting day. 
It may well be that we should give consent.  
Honourable senators, I understand the process. 
It is so important that quite a number of us wish to attend. 
A bill of the utmost gravity.  
Senator Murray has made some very good arguments. 
I think it is premature to deal with the motion now. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, my question is to the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Rule 39(1) expects that every attempt will be made to reach an agreement. 
There is no expectation of failure. 
Otherwise, why would the rule ask for the seeking and acquiring of an agreement?  
Otherwise, his statement seems to obviate any discussion at all.  
We have a "pre-notice" of a notice of motion, which is novel. 
However, we must be careful about some of the novel ideas brought forward.  
We are still waiting for a response to the last question.  
I think it is and that is why I proposed it.  
I do not intend to be. 
That, honourable senators, is my response.  
Public Works and Government Services 
This is exactly what he said: 
I have known him for a long time. 
We are not intimate friends at all... 
One can only imagine that it must have been a tidy sum.  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I have a supplementary question. 
Further, why is the government buying buildings? 
Something is very wrong here.  
Honourable senators, I take notice of that supplementary question as well.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
It had broken down or been fogged in somewhere along the way. 
We have other peacekeepers coming home. 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, my question is supplementary to Senator Murray's question.  
The Senate Banking Committee also has a piece of government legislation before it. 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, according to the list five committees are meeting. 
That is my best answer at this time. 
Level of Pay for Foreign Service Officers 
Honourable senators, my question is directed to the Leader of the Government. 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, I wish to make a suggestion. 
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
As to the others who will be accompanying him, I do not know.  
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Honourable senators, I have a supplementary question to Senator Roche's question. 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
37(4) Except as provided in sections (2) and (3) above, - 
The rule goes on to state: 
I do not have a lot to say about that. 
At page 498, it states: 
That reference explains the practice in the House of Commons. 
That is why the rule provides for a limit. 
Should that be unlimited? 
I do not think so. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Without the rules, the tyranny of the majority could undermine us. 
In our system, the rules and procedures provide that shield. 
That is why the rules are so very important.  
Clearly, we must do something about it. 
They do an assessment during that canvassing of whether there would be some opposition.  
If they feel there would be opposition, their practice is to not ask for leave. 
It is a highly urbane and civil way of proceeding. 
If this matter went to the Rules Committee, members might take that into consideration.  
That brings me to my third point, which is our rule. 
In other words, it is the contradiction of the rule. 
The rules would need to provide for that difference. 
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
It makes eminent sense.  
I am certainly open to having this matter referred to the Rules Committee. 
I will not comment on filibustering per se. 
It has been used in the Canadian Parliament from time to time. 
Is it good or bad? 
That is for individuals and for us collectively to decide. 
I come back to the rule as written today. 
I find it limiting. 
I did so from the very moment it was tabled in this place. 
Other people do very well within the 15-minute time limit. 
An exemplary senator in that respect is Senator Beaudoin. 
He makes his point logically, rationally, finishes his statement and sits down. 
He usually does it within 15 minutes. 
Other senators cannot do it on other topics.  
Honourable senators, let us come back to the here and now and today. 
That is the common-sense understanding, I am sure, of most senators here today. 
That is the way I have always understood the process. 
I am not looking for an opportunity to carry on forever. 
I am simply asking for a little extra time to finish my comments. 
I think that is what we all understand. 
I think that is the very heart of the matter. 
It is a matter of courtesy and nothing else.  
The government had no ability to bring forward government business. 
The government should have the right to place its business before the legislature.  
There was no time limit on the Question Period - no limit at all. 
It could and did go on for hours. 
The rules that were adopted in the early 1990s contained all of those provisions. 
The hours of sitting were also regulated.  
We have Routine Proceedings. 
The government side has the ability to bring its business forward. 
There are time allocation provisions in the rules. 
Hon. Herbert O. Sparrow :
Honourable senators, I do not wish to prolong this discussion. 
We have the rules. 
I mentioned yesterday that I have not seen any abuse in that regard. 
We are tampering with something with which we should not be tampering. 
The rules allow requests for leave. 
Certain honourable senators may say they are totally independent. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
I thank all senators for their contributions to this debate.  
The Speaker and I discussed this issue last night. 
We will meet with advisors on it early next week. 
Nisga'a Final Agreement Bill 
Third Reading-Debate Adjourned 
Hon. Thelma J. Chalifoux :
I am an elder in the Metis nation. 
We followed the rules of natural justice. 
In the majority of cases, First Nations will settle overlap situations among themselves. 
This is simply not the case.  
In the case of marital breakdown, British Columbia law will apply. 
The Nisga'a agreement will be subject to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
Let us now consider the question of the referendum. 
Should there have been one or should there not have been one? 
The ranchers were especially concerned. 
Some 15 per cent of the population of Terrace is of First Nation origin. 
Jack Talstra, the Mayor of Terrace, spoke on behalf of the city council. 
Yes, they have concerns as a community and as citizens. 
All of the existing fee simple properties are expressly excluded from Nisga'a lands. 
The Nisga'a Final Agreement is not a template for other treaties. 
I have worked on land claims for many years. 
This agreement embodies a spirit of compromise. 
There have been many rumours that are unfounded and uninformed. 
The circle of Confederation is now more complete. 
Our children and our grandchildren will inherent a partnership at which the world will marvel. 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
I thank the honourable senator for her question. 
I realize that the Honourable Senator Andreychuk is alluding to the Gitanyow and the Gitxsan. 
Everyone complimented the Nisga'a for their wonderful negotiations. 
They gave up a great deal to reach this conclusion. 
We must honour their decision and approve this treaty.  
It took into account what they needed. 
It was a compromise; that is something we heard over and over again. 
To the credit of the Nisga'a nation, they came to the table to negotiate. 
They knew that they would give up as well as get from the treaty. 
I believe strongly in the policy of negotiated settlements. 
It is something for which we have been fighting.  
The difficulty I would like the honourable senator to address is not with the treaty. 
In my opinion, it is constitutional. 
I followed what was happening very closely. 
I took part in the negotiations within our own nation.  
I can name those leaders, such as Harry Daniels and Jim Sinclair. 
Some senators here today remember them. 
In my opinion, we must recognize that fight. 
This agreement is constitutional.  
It has been a privilege to be part of this process. 
A number of people find this alarming. 
What does this actually mean?  
Second, the Nisga'a nation initially sought exclusive jurisdiction. 
Health services themselves, however, will be governed by provincial laws. 
This makes practical sense to me. 
It frequently ends up by being to the detriment of the population concerned.  
I doubt if any non-native would have the necessary competence to do this. 
Therefore, this seems to me totally appropriate.  
That, after all, is the nature the negotiation. 
On motion of Senator Comeau, debate adjourned.  
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Louis J. Robichaud :
The reason for that is simple. 
The are two kinds of argument in favour of this. 
Several of its own statutes operate on a different logic. 
It is the same in the union movement. 
In the latter case, a two-thirds majority was necessary.  
Quebecers, however, refuse to lose their country based on a misunderstanding. 
In my opinion, that is what it always needs to be in a democracy. 
I wish to know what the honourable senator understands by "qualitative dimension". 
Such an approach is, in my opinion, far from democratic.  
I am pleased that the senator has used the words "in my opinion". 
I do not share that opinion.  
On motion of Senator Beaudoin, debate adjourned.  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) moved: 
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration 
Seventh Report of Committee Adopted-Motion in Amendment 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I move: 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
We in this chamber are being asked to make an amendment to a report. 
Honourable senators, I understand Senator Kinsella's concern. 
I might observe that it is not a very complex issue.  
One third is paid out for each corresponding period of the year. 
Accordingly, they were short-changed in their requirements to complete their work.  
This amendment is simply to remedy that oversight. 
That is my best answer, based on the inquiries I have made.  
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
Senator Stollery is also a member, so now there are two of us here.  
We calculated the 9/27 split on the basis of 27 weeks of work. 
We had to get the budgets approved because the committees had to work in April. 
I have not been approached. 
Therefore, I find this quite irregular. 
Senator Carstairs could have come before us or called. 
Honourable senators, I thank Senator DeWare. 
Senator Stollery is here and may wish to comment as well. 
I am sure they can deal with the next week. 
That is one means of resolving the matter.  
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
Honourable senators, I would like to say one or two simple things. 
I will not get involved in the mechanics of the Internal Economy Committee proceedings. 
The Internal Economy Committee took that decision. 
Now we are faced with this crazy situation. 
We are unable to proceed with solidarity to the resolution of this problem. 
Hon. Peter A. Stollery :
We get along well and it has been an extremely good subcommittee.  
I first learned of this matter the other day. 
Apparently the letter is dated the last day of March. 
I have no difficulty with releasing the money. 
Quite honestly, I do not know where this issue arose. 
However, my memory could fail me and I could be wrong. 
Of course, the subcommittee must complete its work by a certain time. 
That is all I have to say on the matter. 
I just walked into the chamber and saw this letter. 
I do not think any one of us has a problem with that.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion in amendment?  
Motion in amendment agreed to.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Motion agreed to, as amended, and report adopted.  
Situation of Official Languages in Ontario 
Leave having been given to proceed to inquiries: 
Hon. Jean-Robert Gauthier , having given notice on Thursday, February 10, 2000: 
It reads as follows: 
As John Ralston Saul wrote in his book entitled Reflections of a Siamese Twin:
Canada at the End of the Twentieth Century : 
To be a Francophone is to make an effort every day.  
We did not have French-language schools in Ontario. 
All the rest was in English. 
The majority of us could not. 
In other words, the number of students increased in a very short time. 
The critical mass was there, but not the services, the schools or the students.  
I do not believe such a thing can be allowed in my country. 
In Ontario, this is now a thing of the past. 
This is a positive step forward for the community.  
A good indicator of the vitality of a community lies in its cultural life. 
Does he seek leave to continue?  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
The Franco-Ontarian community has acquired a network of community radio stations. 
Nor have I addressed our other concerns. 
We must be aware and positive. 
Their presence will help to unite the country.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Report of Foreign Affairs Committee on Study-Debate Continued 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
The real question, however, is whether this causation will work. 
The necessary economic groundwork had not been completed. 
The impact of the EMU on Canada was the primary concern of the committee. 
This will require an overall federal agricultural strategy in consultation with the provinces.  
A comprehensive and interrelated foreign policy toward Europe is needed.  
I would hope that the Senate would embark on a further phase of European analysis.  
On motion of Senator Stollery, for Senator Grafstein, debate adjourned.  
Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum 
Eighth Annual Meeting-Inquiry-Debate Continued 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Senator Carstairs covered that point very well. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
I am extremely interested in the subject. 
On motion of Senator Prud'homme, debate adjourned.  
Hon. Lowell Murray , pursuant to notice of April 6, 2000, moved: 
The subcommittee made very good progress. 
Therefore, as a committee, we decided to devote four meetings to the matter. 
I commend this motion to the support of honourable senators.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Senate adjourned until Monday, April 10, 2000, at 4 p.m.
