FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
The baby was born on budget day. 
That is bad news for young Joshua. 
How this was done also matters. 
No. Is it debt reduction? 
We expected all that. 
What did that internal audit reveal? 
This is not something new.  
In chapter 27 of his 1998 report he said: 
What are we to conclude from the following:
The taxpayers are not laughing.  
This is an inexcusable omission. 
This omission is an insult to the finance committee of the House. 
It is an insult to the intelligence of the whole House. 
Some taxpayers may actually read the budget. 
The taxpayers were paying while you were away campaigning.  
An hon. backbencher across the way mentioned the word taxes. 
Let us enlighten him on the subject of taxes. 
It is a great, difficult task to enlighten the hon. member.  
The family can look at its chequebook and bank account. 
The list goes on and on.  
We do not have a budgeting problem. 
We do not even have a tax problem. 
Let me get more specific on this subject. 
I ask hon. members opposite to listen to that statement. 
If my math is right, that is less than $30,000.  
This is written proof. 
Let us look at promise No. 3. 
Mr. Speaker, do you see the credibility gap that is developing here? 
Promise No. 3 is from a budget speech. 
We are getting right down to promises in the budget. 
Tax relief for every taxpayer, promised the finance minister. 
Has it got there yet? 
We could ask them that. 
Let us find out how it is working out in the real world.  
These are highly paid people. 
Here is one called ``pay raise rip-off''. 
She was promised tax relief from the finance minister.  
You are shaking your head. 
I agree, Mr. Speaker, that we should shake our heads. 
Let me read the letter: 
I have never been on welfare or received unemployment. 
It was with great anticipation that I waited for my increase. 
However, the figures on the stubs tell the true story.  
I already pay hefty taxes to the government and now it is increased even more. 
It is going directly to the government for taxes. 
This is a great injustice to an honest, hard-working citizen. 
A Toronto police constable writes: 
This is not some high income person. 
This is a person we consider to be in the middle income bracket. 
Every other purchase I make has a further 15% in sales taxes. 
When are we ever going to get a break?  
Completely and utterly ripped off.  
Here is one called ``back pay tax grab''. 
Adam Grabowski, a full time teacher in Manitoba with 12 years experience, writes: 
Five hard years later I made it. 
I am being asked by the student loan people to pay over $350 per month. 
I am only deeper in debt!  
This is not a rich person. 
These are ordinary Canadians at the lower and middle end of the spectrum. 
The taxation level in this country is killing me. 
I don't need a national day care scheme. 
I need tax relief! 
I don't want pomp and ceremony. 
I need a break.  
They obviously don't live in the real world. 
I do and I don't like it.  
How do we pick a winner from all these? 
The letter we have selected as the winner strikingly illustrates this point. 
I have enclosed a copy of my two most recent paystubs. 
The government says it is interested in productivity. 
Here is a letter from a productive worker: 
Paul Meyer is with us here today. 
We are the voice of those taxpayers and we insist that they be heard.  
We should listen to his report on these activities.  
It has been observed that there are two types of arrogance that bring down governments.  
The first is an arrogance that is rooted, sadly, in ability and accomplishment. 
Unfortunately there is an arrogance that sometimes comes with great ability, accomplishments and legendary status. 
Howe was able and accomplished and he knew it. 
Debate is on the amendment.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I think the normal thing is to proceed through each party. 
The Liberals started the debate with the minister's statement last evening. 
The official opposition has had its chance to reply. 
Now we would normally hear from the other parties.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, yesterday was a great disappointment for me. 
There is absolutely nothing in the budget to help them. 
That averages out at $600 million a year.  
In that regard, the budget is a big disappointment. 
Tax points have been in use for a long time. 
In other words, it is no longer any of the Minister of Finance's business. 
It is none of his business.  
These are not small amounts of money. 
My second big disappointment concerned employment insurance. 
The government's treatment of social housing is a real scandal. 
That sector has had an injection of $58 million. 
That would not be enough to build even half an entranceway. 
This is truly scandalous. 
The Minister of Finance has not heeded the heartfelt cries of those in need.  
I turn now to the tax cuts. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
And the count having been taken: 
I see a quorum. 
The hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot may continue.  
We condemned this injustice. 
Let us render unto Caesar what is Caesar's. 
There are none, or almost none. 
Next year there will be minimal tax cuts. 
I will give a few examples.  
So much for tax relief. 
Next year it will not be all that different.  
I also want to mention infrastructures. 
There is unanimity against the minister. 
Yesterday, in the budget, the surplus had reached $7.5 billion. 
In two months and a half, he erred by 21%.  
There is worse to come. 
The Minister of Finance has a real problem. 
The problem is that the Minister of Finance manipulates figures. 
He is a great manipulator. 
Why does he do this? 
He realizes that the actual figure will be in excess of $12 billion. 
He also could have brought in tax reform. 
He did not follow our advice. 
Large corporations are carrying forward far too much in unpaid taxes. 
The amounts involved are not small. 
Another example is Bell Canada, which owes $2.1 billion. 
Seagram owes over $2 billion.  
But the Minister of Finance does nothing.  
The amendment to the amendment is in order. 
The debate is on the amendment to the amendment.  
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I will give some examples. 
I do not recall hearing it. 
Did we hear that? 
I did not hear that. 
With the equalization payments, it moves to $40 billion annually being transferred to the provinces.  
The Quebec government receives close to $5 billion in equalization payments. 
Does he want to know about tax savings? 
That is a lot, is it not, $15 a week?  
I will give some examples, if I may. 
This is an example of the inflexibility of the federal tax system.  
The tab is $70 million. 
I could have talked about this inflexibility.  
To those who claim that federalism is beneficial to Quebec, I say think again. 
That is what is meant by federal flexibility.  
Tax points were transferred in the late 1960s. 
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Lotbiniere. 
What he has just said is quite right. 
This is over 50% of the cuts.  
We are $2.5 billion in the hole every year.  
Telling us that this system represents enrichment for Quebec is false. 
My colleague from Lotbiniere has done well to raise this aspect of the question.  
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
It will be $12 billion instead, this year.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Because we have turned the deficit corner what would the fiscal dividend be used for?  
Then came last night. 
Last night the minister rose in the House to present his budget. 
I thought for a while I had a health problem. 
I thought I had a hearing problem. 
We had a very conservative tax cutting budget.  
I checked more closely and watched the Leader of the Opposition. 
A friend of mine has some very appropriate buttons. 
What we have seen very importantly is a paradigm shift. 
There is a shift in values. 
I ask where those good old time Liberals are, the Lester Pearsons. 
Where is Pierre Trudeau? 
Where are those old time Liberals?  
Those programs are now gone. 
Where have they gone? 
Some of them are in the Senate. 
It is exactly the other way around to the way the priorities should be. 
We should be reinvesting in people.  
I want to look at some of the interesting facts. 
What does that mean?  
What is it today? 
It is no wonder there is a great deal of shame across the way.  
The Liberals are now changing on a dime. 
They are intimidated by the Leader of the Opposition, intimidated by the Reform Party. 
The federal government is not paying its fair share of the cost. 
That is the kind of vision the Minister of Finance has in mind for Canada. 
It is not the Canadian way. 
It does not reflect Canadian values. 
That is not the way we want to go in the New Democratic Party.  
We need more money for health care. 
We need more money for education. 
That did not happen last night. 
That is why the Leader of the Opposition was blushing. 
He did not know what to say. 
Where is that children's agenda? 
It is not there. 
Where is the extra money for education? 
It is not there at all.  
That is the vision and that is the direction in which we should go. 
Instead, the income gap is widening. 
There are more and more people living in poverty. 
Now we have the money. 
Now we have the surplus. 
What does the Liberal government do? 
It decreases spending in proportion to our GDP rather than increase it. 
I would like to speak about the farm crisis. 
We have had people being forced off the land. 
We have had bankruptcies. 
We have had delegations led by Premier Romanow and Premier Doer.  
That is all they got. 
There was nothing added in the budget.  
Where was that vision? 
Now that we have a fiscal surplus, what is there for farmers? 
Mere peanuts for farmers and nothing in terms of a long term vision.  
This is a paradigm shift in Canadian politics. 
It does not matter where we look. 
Take, for example, the CBC. 
There was not a penny last night for the CBC. 
There was nothing for parks.  
I want to mention taxation. 
At the same time they had to throw something to their wealthy friends. 
These things are going in the wrong direction.  
For example, we spoke with John, who is a currency trader in Toronto. 
He is one of those guys in red suspenders. 
He was very happy last night. 
It was not a bad budget for John. 
We also heard from Donna. 
Donna is not like John. 
She has children in university. 
We have a government that is even more Conservative than Mike Harris. 
We heard from Andre, who is a student. 
What is in the budget for him? 
Tuition fees will not go down, they will go up. 
They make $30,000 a year. 
Doug is from my hometown of Wynyard. 
He will make probably $2,000 or $3,000 next year. 
He may get an $8,000 payment from the federal government. 
He will not be paying any income tax. 
There is nothing in the budget for him. 
There is nothing more for farmers. 
There is nothing for their cost of production. 
There is nothing for him.  
This budget is very unfair in the way it treats ordinary people. 
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
He never gave the government credit for that.  
The Winnipeg Free Press read: ``It's payback time:
The premier of Saskatchewan was very happy. 
Mr. Speaker, I did mention indexation. 
We have advocated full indexation for our taxation system for years. 
Take a look at the government's budget books. 
Its tax cut initiatives are $3.5 billion. 
We can see what its priorities and values are. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to set the record straight. 
We are a grassroots party. 
It is true it has always been our highest priority. 
It is our number one priority. 
I wanted to put that on the record. 
Reform wanted to spend the entire surplus on tax cuts.  
The Reform Party of Canada stands for that.  
We want to bring back federal funding. 
It wants two tier American style medicare. 
That is not what Canadians want.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Ninety-eight per cent will go to central Canada and out west.  
People back home put a think tank together. 
Our people will be hit extremely hard. 
Was the hon. member aware of that? 
Mr. Speaker, the member of the Conservative Party makes an excellent point. 
I commend the member for her question.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I got a letter from a constituent. 
What is my colleague's view on this question from my constituent?  
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's constituent in Kamloops is absolutely right on. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
There have been seven budgets, we could say seven deadly sins from the finance minister. 
The government is big on labels. 
They do not believe their health care system will be there when they need it. 
That was the result of a health care budget.  
This year we have seen the tax cut budget. 
The government is working with a $150 billion surplus. 
To promote it as a tax cut is disingenuous at best.  
We are pleased with the reindexing of tax brackets. 
Other countries have embraced these global realities earlier. 
The levels of growth have been striking.  
We are stagnating while other countries are progressing. 
While citizens in other countries are getting richer, in Canada we are getting poorer. 
It used to be that high taxes redistributed income. 
That is what we are seeing.  
Do we wonder why these people are leaving?  
We are sending those people out of Canada. 
That greater country will be the U.S. 
I am afraid that he may get his wish. 
We are proud of our new technology success stories like Nortel or JDS Uniphase. 
We are proud of the new economy startups like Versus Technology, Bid.com, 
We need to do more than simply to retain Canada's best and brightest. 
We are now entering a period of growth in the biotech industry. 
In fact it is a biotech revolution. 
We still have an opportunity. 
I see our health critic here. 
This can be an opportunity for Canada. 
If we change our policies now, we do not need to be a laggard. 
They have already slipped under this government. 
This budget has virtually ignored the agricultural crisis in Canada. 
Quality of life issues are paramount.  
On infrastructure, the government's reinvestment in infrastructure is an insult to the provinces. 
Death traps in some of our provinces will not be addressed. 
Instead of cutting her allowance we are giving her more money. 
The minister has ignored this fact.  
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am quite surprised. 
I would like to focus on a couple.  
In fact, the CHST has been fully restored. 
He talked about making business more competitive. 
That is a pretty bold move. 
He talked about access to capital and incubation of small companies. 
Normally he is most informed on these issues. 
I was surprised today. 
Has the member read the budget?  
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the non-partisan intervention from my colleagues opposite.  
The hon. member asked if I read the budget. 
I did read the budget. 
Corporate tax reduction is very important. 
In fact 28 of the 31 OECD countries plan to reduce corporate taxes. 
The government is focused on five year plans. 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my colleague is trying to have it both ways. 
Let us talk about the economic health of the country. 
This government first had to put the nation's fiscal house in order. 
It would have to eliminate the deficit. 
It would have to control the economic situation. 
We have put the nation's fiscal house in order. 
We have controlled the debt. 
We have controlled the deficit. 
Now we are beginning to invest, unlike what those guys have done. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's intervention. 
He fought against every single one of those cornerstones of the new economy.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
There is a homeless crisis in Canada. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Earlier the Leader of the Opposition cited a number of examples. 
I would like to speak to Paul and Fran Darr of Calgary, Alberta. 
They need to check their facts with the Leader of the Opposition. 
Canadians deserve the facts and those are the facts. 
However, there are a number of measures I want to highlight today. 
That is a fact. 
It is not just partisan politics. 
Just ask business groups and tax experts across the country. 
As a chartered accountant myself, I can say that is right on.  
Now there is political cynicism.  
It is something every member of the House should be proud of.  
Why is restoring indexation the right thing to do? 
In other words, their incomes have not really gone up but their tax bite has. 
But the ultimate foundation for personal prosperity is a good job. 
I realize this sounds very technical and complex. 
Let me just emphasize the goal here. 
The objective here is a simple one that makes sense. 
Our bottom line is clear:
The government is not prepared to risk a return to deficits. 
Let me point out that this is not just a federal success story.  
Achieving strong finances has not come easy. 
That is a commitment we will never abandon. 
The proof is in the budget figures.  
This is the standard used by most economic observers.  
The future of Canada and its people is looking brighter all the time. 
The deficit is eliminated. 
The debt burden is falling. 
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
For the last three years of the plan, it will remain at $576 billion. 
Everyone agrees that it is the top priority.  
Where does the heroism of the government lie? 
Where is the federal money for this year?  
At the same time they argue that we should be reducing the debt. 
I can tell the House that our government is balanced in its approach. 
In the first stages they look at the mortgage in relation to their income. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
That is my comment.  
Will the hon. member please try to defend that position?  
The department and certainly this caucus reach out to talk to people. 
I do not know about members opposite.  
Let me just give the House something that came out yesterday. 
These are the facts. 
That includes tax points and cash. 
I would like the member to read the section on the transfers. 
It might inform him better.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
The member stated that Canadians would receive $58 billion in tax relief. 
I would argue that those figures are wrong. 
The member talks about the Canada pension plan. 
With respect, he still does not get it. 
Those funds go into a separate pension plan. 
They do not come near consolidated revenue. 
The member needs to distinguish between CPP and other tax reductions.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise today in reply to budget 2000. 
It really goes to the point of what I wanted to say.  
We all saw the headlines. 
It has been very good for it.  
The people do not care. 
They are not interested in all those technical arguments, I say to my friend. 
When we pull it apart, this is what we find. 
What was $58 billion is now down to about $28 billion. 
That is where we are now. 
The child tax benefit works the same way as all social programs. 
The fact is, it is not a tax cut. 
That is something for which we have been arguing for a long time. 
Bracket creep is insidious. 
It has hurt people. 
It has hammered low income Canadians. 
There is no question of that. 
We know that is the case and we are glad it is gone.  
Do people have more money in their pockets? 
If we take that out, that is $13.5 billion. 
It works out to $107 per taxpayer. 
That is not exactly a lot of money. 
It works out to about $2 per week. 
What is the net impact? 
Congratulations to the government. 
The truth is that Canadians will still be paying taxes that are far too high. 
We cannot put groceries on the table with headlines. 
They want more money. 
They want more groceries. 
I want to touch on something which I mentioned at the outset of my remarks. 
He said that subsidies to business impede growth. 
I agree with that. 
Yet the finance minister sits in his place every year and rubber stamps more cheques. 
There is all kinds of stuff going on. 
This happens at a time when the finance minister brings down a budget.  
What does the finance minister do? 
He continues to rubber stamp the cheques. 
That is unbelievable, after that record. 
There is no question that she should be fired.  
The $1 billion is only part of it. 
We were talking about health care a minute ago. 
It is disgraceful, but that is exactly what happened.  
It is only a billion. 
After all, how could they be expected to keep records.  
There are 1.1 million Canadians unemployed today. 
They know this did not really create jobs. 
Is the debt not an issue in Canada any more? 
It has gone down.  
At that rate, in another 190 years it will be paid off. 
It is going really well. 
The fact is, Canadians see the debt as an impediment. 
They see it as something which holds the country back. 
When there is debt there are interest payments. 
In Canada today we pay about $42 billion a year in interest payments. 
This government has absolutely no serious plan to address the issue of debt.  
That is what we want to see. 
Why does it not do that? 
I think Canadians are onside with us when we say that.  
I will talk for a moment about what the Reform Party would do. 
It is only fair that we lay out our plan. 
We should be funding ESSO.  
My friends across the way sit and heckle. 
I think I have touched a nerve. 
Mr. Speaker, you are a wise man. 
I appreciate that wise intervention.  
We need to lower them.  
Our plan would do three different things. 
It would extend a $3,000 deduction to all families with children. 
What would the impact of that be? 
It would mean that every Canadian would see their taxes go down dramatically. 
We would see money come back into the country. 
Under our plan it would change. 
We would get rid of that discrimination.  
More important, we would attract a tremendous amount of economic activity to Canada. 
I want to say a word about why that is important.  
It is people without skills. 
It is people without education. 
We need to help those people.  
We would do that by having an economy that moved a lot faster. 
If it did, those people would be scooped up. 
They would get the jobs. 
They could maintain their dignity. 
They could provide for their own families instead of being kept dependent by the government. 
My friends across the way should not let pride get in their way. 
Let them adopt this plan. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
In talking about our proposals he said: 
That is what our plan would do.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
What about the 1.4 million children who are hungry? 
What is the position of the Reform Party?  
The only thing my motion says is to revise employment insurance. 
They have asked that the benefits be brought up.  
I would like to hear his position on that.  
Families with children need permanent jobs, jobs that pay a good salary. 
That is what we have to focus our efforts on. 
Let us give that money back to the job creators in Canada. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
It is time to change that. 
Let us take that money and put it to good use instead.  
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am afraid my friend has beat me to the punch. 
They have already gutted health care across the way. 
We say that Canadians themselves are very generous. 
They have proven that year after year after year.  
We are a generous people. 
CAMERA USE IN CHAMBER 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
As it is now approximately 2 o'clock, we will proceed to statements by members.  
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
We all want to hear what they have to say. 
I would expect that we would all listen to what members have to say. 
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S WEEK 
Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
The federal theme this year is ``Canadian Women Taking Action To Make a Difference''. 
NIAGARA REGIONAL POLICE SERVICE 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
The plan provides immediate tax savings, that is as of 2001. 
These measures will benefit Canadian families directly. 
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
This crisis has shaken the agriculture industry to its very roots. 
Farmers need more than band-aids. 
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
Our government is receptive to the requests and needs of Canadians.  
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
His letter reads as follows: 
I am anxiously waiting for your decision.  
Thank you for your kind attention.  
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Ted was born in Belfast in 1931 and immigrated to Canada in 1957. 
He is currently Canada's representative on the International Fund for Ireland. 
Mr. Ian Murray (Lanark-Carleton, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
First, the inquiry witnesses are under oath. 
Second, witnesses may be cross-examined with direct challenges to their testimony.  
Understandably, complainants are withdrawing from the process in Vancouver today. 
Well the Prime Minister has already set the precedent, one of arrogance.  
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, yesterday's budget abandoned the promise of investing in our children.  
It does not help families find affordable child care. 
It does not help students with crushing debt loads. 
It shrugs off the despair driving aboriginal children to suicide.  
The budget is a clear example of this. 
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
This is a fine way to mark the yeqr 2000.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
THE LATE CLARENCE EUGENE HANK SNOW 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
Canada is not alone in trying to better protect the public. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
I ask hon. members to please address each other by their titles.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
However I have really discovered the answer. 
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
All departments would be called to account. 
The brakes would be put on future spending. 
The Right Hon. Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We could go on and on. 
We always have causes that need help in Canada. 
The hon. member for Medicine Hat.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, HRDC helping the homeless. 
Is that the idea?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, understand what that money is for. 
It is for the student loan program. 
That is what that money is for.  
One more step and they are going to fall off the side of the earth.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I just want to explain something. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
One of our fundamental rights surely is to be heard in the House. 
I think it is just a common courtesy.  
She spoke of lack of space, but that did not stand up. 
Mr. Goldberger, the company president, confirmed this. 
He has been the subject of legal proceedings on this matter since April 1999. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is really quite incredible. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
I would ask the leader of the Bloc Quebecois to put his question.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are not running away from the questions. 
We are quite prepared to be open in this regard. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let us go at this again. 
At that point we will be able to answer the questions of the hon. member.  
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
The House was suitably enlightened.  
What we want to know is: what exactly was that ellipsis? 
Is that what he was referring to yesterday?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the finance minister.  
Canadians' number one priority is to fix health care. 
They had hoped that the budget would reflect that. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, talk about an exercise in deception. 
Health transfers in this budget- 
I would ask the hon. leader of the New Democratic Party to withdraw those words.  
Well, Mr. Speaker, I would like to- 
When Canadians so clearly regard health care as their number one priority, why has this- 
The Right Hon. Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
There is a contradiction. 
Who is correct, Mr. Vallerand or the Prime Minister?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
From there it was the responsibility of the RCMP. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, let me try this again. 
What did they do with that information and when did they contact the RCMP? 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Well, it looks like old Rene has been up to his tricks again.  
That seems kind of strange because along comes Fugere- 
The hon. member for Edmonton North.  
Why is it that public money follows Mr. Fugere like an orphaned duck?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it wears thin. 
There is a cast of thousands involved here. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
What is clear is that this party- 
The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development.  
The hon. member for Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I responded to this question in the House earlier, before Christmas. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, it is pretty obvious that the minister does not want any investigation. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Fundamental in everything here is that these questions are old news. 
The issue that has been raised was raised by us. 
The identification that we could do a better job in administration was raised by us. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, here are a few interesting facts. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am just asking about one decision. 
Perhaps the minister could give a straight answer.  
Then Fugere showed up and money magically was shaken loose in the department.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We will continue to make that information available and public.  
The hon. minister of Human Resources Development.  
What we know to be true is that Canadians understand this issue. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the minister continues to refuse to put Placeteco under investigation. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, clearly we are prepared to answer the questions. 
The hon. member asked about an independent review. 
That is good enough for me.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
By the way, no jobs were created. 
In fact, some jobs were even lost.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, you will remember Rene Fugere. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The federal government was but one partner in these undertakings. 
There are many others. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
That $300,000 was given even though the application had been rejected twice before.  
Could she tell us what that deal is?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
The minister hired a consultant to review the Placeteco file. 
The consultant's report was damning, revealing a good dozen discrepancies.  
My question for the minister is a very simple one. 
Why did her department go ahead and pay the grant anyway?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Madam Harel would have been an approver in this case. 
The Minister of Human Resources Development Canada.  
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, yesterday's budget was good news for the Canadian Forces.  
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, now back to reality. 
Rene Fugere is an interesting guy. 
He can make bureaucrats do a reversal with the mere mention of his name. 
He can make public money available where none existed before. 
Why is it that Mr. Fugere has all of the qualities of the Prime Minister?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
And it is signed:
Rejean Lefebvre, regional president, Bloc Quebecois, and secretary treasurer of the national caucus.  
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, then why was it rejected twice? 
It seems that Rene Fugere really does well when he gets out- 
The hon. member for Edmonton-Strathcona.  
Rene Fugere seems to do really well when he gets out and about in Ottawa. 
My question is for the HRD minister and it is very simple. 
Has she ever been lobbied by Rene Fugere?  
The hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
This budget has been universally dismissed as- 
The hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
Why can the minister not see it?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
When that happens this government will be there.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
A $300,000 grant was approved.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
And this was a riding represented by an opposition MP.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I will ask the question a second time. 
The same company used up two lifelines. 
It received a grant of $300,000.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Sixty-six people are working on a very useful undertaking.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
CITEC is under investigation. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, students in this country are really hurting. 
The hon. Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am not quite sure what the hon. member would call nothing. 
I would say that increased transfers to the provinces is substantial. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
My question is about a business in my greater riding and it has to do- 
This is one question we all want to hear.  
Yes, Mr. Speaker, this question is not hard.  
That is thanks to the good management of the government.  
On page 968 of Marleau-Montpetit it states: 
Editors must ensure that the Debates are a faithful reflection of what was said; 
It then goes on to say: 
On page 769, it says: 
I will not be long but I think that the matter is important. 
The Prime Minister said: 
He then goes on to say: 
What was said in the House was quite clear.  
We have a recording of what was said and we have it on television.  
We must be ever vigilant when this type of thing happens. 
I thank him very much.  
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
This leads to a potential vacuum.  
I am wondering if that request would be appropriate.  
If a member wants extra information then I am sure it can be provided.  
Then if they want the response it should be added to it. 
In that way there would be no question about it. 
He asked me to take it under consideration. 
I am always open to advice from any member of the House.  
FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF MINISTER OF FINANCE 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Prebudget consultations have become an annual event in my riding. 
However, three major priorities dominated these consultations. 
First, 40% felt that the government should continue to repay the debt. 
Finally, 25% advocated tax cuts.  
Once again the concern is centred on the prospects of an eventual recession. 
What did yesterday's budget say about the debt? 
Beyond this the downward track must continue. 
The environment was also addressed in this budget. 
It is something that we must do. 
Budget 2000 takes action on both fronts. 
Once again budget 2000 has responded to my constituents' concern. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
It is consistent with what I get from the people in my riding. 
I would like some clarification. 
I am wondering whether the member would confirm that I heard correctly.  
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member was right. 
There were three approaches and three priorities. 
One perhaps is a little ahead, but no singular one was there alone. 
We have reduced the debt by $6 billion. 
So in fact the plan is in place.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
How does the government intend to do that? 
I do not read speeches of the Department of Finance.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Tony Valeri (Stoney Creek, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is certainly a pleasure to speak on the budget today.  
The member for Elk Island often speaks of debt reduction. 
That is foreign trade zones, referred to as export distribution centres in the budget itself.  
We provided some structural changes to the tax file. 
The reindexing of the tax system is certainly critical. 
Some 90% of all children in Canada will receive benefits. 
The ministers of health from the provinces are getting together in May. 
There is the funding of the century chairs for research excellence. 
That is the kind of brainpower we want to keep here in our great country.  
We need to exploit it in fact. 
We made some changes back in 1996. 
That was initially our response to foreign trade zones. 
We did not see it happen. 
We did not see foreign trade zones begin to flourish in this country. 
What does that mean? 
What does this really mean? 
I mentioned some cities but that is only to name a few. 
We have a geographical advantage, as I have indicated. 
We need to take advantage of that. 
It is a great opportunity for economic development.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
This budget contains some slip-ups. 
This morning, I heard what some welfare recipients had to say. 
Social housing was forgotten. 
I wish to hear his reply to this.  
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to respond to the hon. member. 
It has been made by the finance minister. 
It had the opportunity but it chose to put it to the bottom line.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Why was such a key area not addressed in this budget?  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
First, there is no real tax relief this year. 
Well, it is not the case this year.  
Finally, some claim that this government's heart is in the right place. 
I will discuss each of these points separately.  
Yet, we could level many criticisms at this budget.  
We hear it talked about everywhere. 
And what will they get? 
A mere $2.5 billion over four years.  
The Minister of Finance is playing squirrel again.  
The minister is keeping his old, less than transparent management practices. 
There is worse to come. 
That is what federalism means for Quebec. 
These tax points are not transfers. 
What does the Minister of Finance also say? 
All this is yet to be determined? 
What is Ottawa trying to do? 
Once again, Quebec is being had. 
This is unacceptable, it must be made known and condemned.  
The annual shortfall for Quebec is $1.7 billion. 
The effect is dramatic. 
What does it mean specifically? 
Why do we not have them? 
Because this government decided to cut health care and education.  
The only common denominator between all the provinces is the federal cuts.  
The Liberal member who spoke before me talked about tax reductions. 
Let us be clear-indexing is not a real tax cut. 
In fact, I think that if it listened to us more often, things would improve.  
That having been said, it could have done more. 
Yet the demands of the Bloc Quebecois were very clear. 
The Bloc Quebecois called for five main points. 
In addition, this budget contains some measures that are specifically anti-Quebec. 
I shall mention four of them. 
The first one relates to the shipbuilding industry.  
Third, there is the deduction for interest on student loans. 
That approach has worked. 
There are four anti-Quebec measures in this budget.  
Let us talk about all of this. 
I conclude on this. 
That is the cost of not having sovereignty.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened with some interest to my colleague from the Bloc. 
He lives in Canada and he serves in Canada's parliament.  
Mr. Speaker, the response to his invitation is no.  
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
The member talked about moving toward a unitary state. 
I want to address the issue of tax points. 
Individual taxes would be the same. 
His government has implemented what is called the social union. 
What does social union mean? 
What is that all about? 
Is this still federalism? 
Nine out of ten provinces are relatively okay with that having signed the social union. 
Because for them the ``national government'' is located in Ottawa. 
For them the supreme representative of their interests is in Ottawa.  
Flexible federalism does not exist in Canada.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
It is a pleasure to support this budget. 
Why did it fail? 
``The constitution'', as Lord Sankey said, ``is a living tree''. 
We were asking for $167.5 million to support the TRIUMF project. 
That was the demonstration made with the TRIUMF project. 
The federal government has never really looked back from that.  
Why do we spend this money? 
We want to keep these people in Canada. 
These are the people who expand the frontiers of knowledge. 
So that is a very positive step.  
It is a very vital task.  
The creative idea for the Foundation for Innovation comes from there.  
There has been talk of federal-provincial co-operation. 
We devised this concept of co-operative federalism. 
We will work with him if we can.  
I look at money for forestry research. 
We need research in new methods and new technologies. 
It is led by Dr. Michael Smith, the Nobel Laureate in chemistry. 
This is a most interesting aspect of the budget.  
Our mining industry needs revitalization. 
Not on your life. 
The jobs of tomorrow are there. 
They are highly paid jobs and vital to our economy.  
We can keep these people in Canada. 
We invite the provinces to co-operate with us. 
It is a two way process but the basic foundations are there.  
It comes to fruition here with a budget with the first big surplus. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I was anxious to address the budget.  
This is not the first time. 
That tax loophole resulted in the robbery of the century. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I accept the challenge. 
I have no reproach for engaging myself in boosterism. 
I explained what pure research was in the House. 
I and my office staff spent 250 hours of work on the TRIUMF project. 
The main thing is that we have made a revolution in Canadian society. 
We went to the Prime Minister and said that he must invest. 
I make no apologies for that. 
I would offer the same advice to our colleague opposite who asked the question. 
Go out and fight for knowledge. 
That is the way to do it.  
Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
The time has now arrived when we begin to repay Canadians for supporting our plan.  
A key component of my government's plan is to cut taxes. 
Core tax rates are reduced for the first time in 12 years. 
I am very pleased that we have seen its accomplishment.  
Mr. Lippert stated that the government must have been listening to him. 
There are other equally vital priorities as well. 
The initially removed moneys have now been replaced and enhanced. 
The budget also creates a revolving fund, the green municipal investment fund. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Obviously Liberal members have bought into the plan, and I understand that. 
That is part of their party plan. 
The budget has been presented. 
I suppose all of them will vote for it. 
The debt is standing at $576.8 billion. 
Meanwhile we are paying $40 billion a year in interest.  
Madam Speaker, debt reduction has always been a priority of the government. 
We prepared that song sheet. 
This budget is a result of that. 
Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):
I have been listening to the members opposite all afternoon. 
They all agree that they have spent money. 
It requires all their input.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
I look in the budget and what do I see? 
There is not one dime for agriculture in terms of a long term program. 
The budget addressed the personal income tax cut. 
I think that will be a very positive step in the long haul. 
Not one constituent indicated that we should further subsidize the NHL. 
I wonder what its priorities are. 
I see the Minister of Industry is in the House. 
I want to try to measure the budget from a fair perspective. 
The true test of progress is not in our country. 
Under this test the budget does not pass. 
What do we get as average Canadians? 
That will not not buy a daily cup of coffee.  
In my view health care has been put on the wait list. 
Education has been put on the wait list. 
We have letters from the Saskatchewan school trustees saying that this is an inadequate budget.  
Agriculture is on the wait list. 
We have tax cuts in terms of personal income tax cuts. 
There is nothing in this budget.  
Not $180 million, not even $100 million, not even $5 million. 
It has wait-listed seniors. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We are back to the days of the 1993 transfers.  
They will account for about 22% of the Saskatchewan government's estimated revenues. 
I think that is pretty fair.  
There is the agricultural aid. 
The member should be more candid and fair in his critique of the budget.  
Will that not help children?  
For every 30 bucks it has cut, it is putting one dollar back. 
And the Liberals call that reinstating funding for health care. 
We are sharing that with the rest of the country. 
There is a debt in the country. 
We have to look at the budget. 
I give the Liberals credit. 
On every occasion it is a feel good approach. 
The final point the member raised was with respect to agriculture. 
The vast majority went to Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic Canada.  
I see my colleagues from the rural Liberal caucus in Ontario. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Yesterday a lot of folks gathered here. 
They represented all kinds of organizations, particularly those in the health care field. 
People advocating for patients were here. 
People representing nurses and doctors were here. 
It was like a wake. 
They truly believed there would be something significant on health care in the budget. 
Look at the media. 
The finance minister of Manitoba said, ``This is a band-aid solution''. 
Seniors in Manitoba said, ``What about us?'' 
Is that what we are really dealing with today?  
That is putting it mildly. 
The words go on and on. 
The critique is absolutely clear. 
Maybe they will take heed of the call today for a caucus revolt. 
Today we had the ambulances in front of the building. 
Well, let's see some action''.  
Those people are looking for some backbone. 
They are looking for a bit of commitment. 
It is like a pay bonus instead of a pay raise. 
There is no question that what we saw in the budget really is a pittance. 
Some would say it is peanuts. 
Let us remember what kind of chaos they put our system in. 
Obviously they realize that they have made a mistake. 
We fully restored health transfer payments''. 
They fully restored the payments? 
Some would put it even higher. 
Then what do the Liberals do? 
They say ``Don't worry. 
You have to look at tax points too''. 
Do you know what he has done? 
He has put in everything but the kitchen sink. 
Why wouldn't you?  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
Members opposite ask ``Why wouldn't you?'' 
I say to hon. members opposite that it is not too late. 
It is time to act because we are on the precipice. 
The very future of medicare is at stake. 
We must act now. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Over the next couple of years there will be additional transfers. 
That is a 25% increase in just two years. 
Again, it is an indication of the commitment.  
They are also for post-secondary education and social assistance. 
There are the priorities.  
How would she finance increased transfers for health?  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
The Liberals are blaming everybody but themselves. 
That is number one.  
First we have this nonsense about fully restoring cash payments. 
Then they throw in the tax points. 
That is absolutely critical.  
It is absolutely clear that the federal government is not paying its fair share. 
Mr. Jerry Pickard (Chatham-Kent Essex, Lib.):
We think this is a great budget, and there is no question about it.  
The House needs a touch of a history lesson. 
It was so bad that its members divided into three groups. 
Everything cannot be completed in one year. 
That is exactly what we did.  
Now we come to a parting of the way. 
Quite frankly, at this point in time I want to say thanks. 
That has been the case. 
They are all supportive. 
I just heard some members going on about health care. 
Cash transfers last year were $12.5 billion. 
This year they are $15 billion. 
There is no question about those facts.  
We have to know the facts. 
What a deception to the people of Ontario. 
What a bad policy decision he made.  
What did members opposite do? 
They shrivelled in their seats. 
This is a good budget. 
People across the country have said that it is a good budget. 
The finance minister knows it is a good budget. 
That is an interesting point.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
I remember the term Brian Mulroney and the deficit and the rest.  
Mr. Speaker, I would love to respond to the member's question.  
I know he does not have the facts straight because he was not here. 
We did have a debt of $168 billion under previous governments.  
Trudeau started the ball rolling.  
Under Mr. Trudeau, exactly. 
That is not a problem. 
They chuckled to themselves. 
They had a huge majority government and ended up with a telephone booth of two. 
The Reform knows what they did too because the Reform called itself a different name. 
The same policy, different name ran west.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I suspect that was a compliment.  
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
It was very positive. 
They were very supportive of us.  
We do not actually control the administration of the health care system. 
I think the people of Canada are fed up with it. 
I think they want us to get on with it. 
We have an aging society. 
I think we can deal with these problems. 
Many people in our society do not understand bracket creep. 
It is an insidious tax. 
The taxation system is not indexed to address this issue. 
Bracket creep is a very insidious tax, a tax by stealth, if I may. 
This was the Tory government's idea of inventive taxation.  
It is not just me saying that. 
I will cite some of the things it has talked about in its report. 
That industry is poised to go even further. 
We are well on our way to making that happen.  
A couple of things stand in our way. 
We have to invest in research and development. 
We have done that in this budget.  
This budget addressed some of those things.  
We have made major investments in our research facilities. 
We have all talked and heard about the whole concept of brain drain. 
With the brain drain the Canadian taxpayer is really subsidizing the U.S. economy. 
This is a huge growing industry. 
The telecommunications industry in Canada is worth $72 billion.  
Why do people leave? 
These people are not necessarily rich but they want opportunities. 
We want to be part of it as well.  
That is not letting the rich off the hook. 
These are ways to make our economy more competitive with that of our trading partners. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
My question is one of curiosity. 
I would like to know exactly what helped to change their minds. 
Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to help the member. 
It is very democratic. 
The flat tax was their argument eight years ago. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I have two or three questions for the hon. member for Durham. 
They do not have to put out a contract for 12 frigates. 
We could have a phase in and phase out. 
It would be something new, different from what my government did. 
There was not a penny for shipbuilding.  
Another has to do with defence. 
People have lost their lives with the Sea Kings. 
I am really worried about this budget.  
Another is health care. 
The budget brought down an increase for health care. 
Does the government think it will gain any seats in Atlantic Canada? 
It has two or three now. 
It will not have them after the next election.  
I know she is very concerned about the shipbuilding industry. 
I share the member's concerns. 
It is not this budget alone. 
It will be continuous budgets. 
We have to deal with that too. 
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
The real gains will be felt only after several years. 
This was the start of the deterioration of health care in Canada.  
Strangely enough, that is probably when an election will be called.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
We do not necessarily have to debate this budget. 
We put an interest rate policy in place which was necessary. 
That is the backbone of our economy.  
Let us talk about the budget. 
Let us talk about the tax cuts. 
First of all, give credit where credit is due. 
Thank you, finance minister. 
Please Canada, listen very carefully. 
In 2000-01 Canadians will take advantage of some $4.6 billion of tax relief. 
There will be $2.5 billion put into health care. 
Our health care system depends on two major factors. 
The dollars presented in this budget do not take those into consideration. 
Let us talk about defence quickly and then agriculture.  
In agriculture the same is true. 
A plank of the Liberal platform in the 1993 election was infrastructure for municipalities. 
It was dear and close to my heart at that point in time. 
The member for Saint John was the mayor of her city just before that time. 
In fact this year, 2000-01, it will be $100 million. 
It is a five year program for $2.5 billion.  
Let me say right now that it is not enough. 
It sounds like it will be an election plank. 
Canadians are not that silly. 
They cannot be bribed with their own money.  
We are talking about a green infrastructure program. 
I am very concerned as to how those dollars will flow.  
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
It is $43 billion. 
This is not a promise. 
This is not a dream. 
In 1993 the total transfers to the provinces were in the vicinity of $37 billion. 
That is quite a multiple. 
In 1984 the Liberals had 40 seats. 
History does repeat itself.  
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
The budget just presented by the government takes action on what matters. 
The largest municipality has a population of 12,000 citizens. 
How will this budget affect my constituents? 
The middle class family is a big winner in this budget. 
Our senior citizens as well will see all their benefits indexed to inflation. 
I truly believe that this is a watershed budget. 
We are taking action on what matters.  
Chatham-Kent is also on the list of underserviced communities. 
Unfortunately the premier's actions did not match his words. 
Infrastructure is also of interest in my riding. 
A major overhaul of Canada's border control is also welcomed. 
If members of parliament eat at least once a day they are supporters of agriculture. 
I agree with him. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
It was nice to hear but talk is terribly cheap. 
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur:
It is a step in the right direction. 
Do we have all the dollars there that the member is asking for? 
I do not think so, but we are stepping in the right direction.  
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened to my colleague's comments with great interest. 
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur:
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Instead of concern, we got partisan scorn. 
Instead of an answer, we got hogwash.  
Who is going to read the study? 
Is it going to be credible? 
To its shame it had none. 
It was barely aware of the problem. 
It just passed the buck and hoped the problem would go away.  
Mr. John Cannis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
We are not passing the buck. 
He knows that very well. 
Let me point out for the benefit of the member what has happened. 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
I direct my question to the very distinguished Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport.  
We went through a whole lot of turmoil, debate and negotiation.  
As we know, it went on and on.  
What protections are there for the regional airports? 
What protection is there for those airports?  
What protection is there for employees that are affected by this? 
Would the parliamentary secretary please enlighten us as to the position on those items?  
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Air Canada has stated that it is satisfied with the government's decision.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
The intention of the Taiwanese government is very clear, the government of a democratic nation.  
However there are no circumstances in which the threat of war is appropriate. 
Mr. Denis Paradis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Canada continues to avail itself of opportunities to communicate its concerns. 
These concerns were also reiterated to the Chinese ambassador in Ottawa.  
Canada's one China policy remains unchanged. 
We do have extensive economic, cultural and people to people contacts with Taiwan. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House adjourned at 6.51 p.m.)
