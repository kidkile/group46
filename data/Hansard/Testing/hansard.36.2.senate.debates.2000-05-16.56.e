Tuesday, May 16, 2000 
The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker pro tempore in the Chair.  
The Late Keizo Obuchi 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Japanese people have been well served by him as a political leader. 
For one so young, he made a notable and extraordinary impact. 
British Columbia Coastal Parliamentarians 
The vice-chair of this group is John van Dongen, Liberal MLA for Abbotsford.  
The Navy League of Canada 
The Late Justice Jules Deschenes 
Hon. Michael A. Meighen :
His remarkable intellect combined with an exceptional capacity for work. 
His devotion to justice and his integrity have marked us profoundly. 
He was made a Companion of the Order of Canada in 1993. 
I attended Justice Deschenes' lectures at the University of Montreal. 
He taught civil procedure and always expressed himself with great clarity.  
He was very active internationally.  
To all members of his family I extend my deepest sympathy. 
We have lost a great jurist.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, the period allocated for Senators' Statements has expired. 
I shall recognize two other senators who had indicated their intention to speak.  
Congratulations on Recent Accomplishments 
Hon. Wilfred P. Moore :
That is an indication of where the Canadian Alliance stands in Newfoundland.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
We have former senator Theriault, former senator Stanbury and Mrs. Stanbury, and former senator Johnstone.  
On behalf of all your colleagues, I wish you welcome back to the Senate.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Air Canada Public Participation Act 
Bill to Amend-First Reading 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Legal and Constitutional Affairs 
Honourable senators, I give notice that tomorrow, Wednesday, May 17, 2000, I shall move: 
Social Affairs, Science and Technology 
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Wednesday, May 17, 2000, I shall move: 
Social Affairs, Science and Technology 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Can the Chairman provide an explanation as to the committee's pressing business?  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, we have momentarily lost the presence of the Chairman. 
I shall ask one of my colleagues to retrieve him. 
He should be back momentarily.  
Legal and Constitutional Affairs 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
These witnesses have all been arranged and have agreed to appear.  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Could I ask the Chairman, Honourable Senator Milne, a question? 
Could the honourable senator tell us when Ms Landolt will be appearing?  
We have been attempting to get Ms Landolt to appear. 
She is not available to appear tomorrow. 
I understand that she has refused to do this. 
I should hope that the committee will find a way to hear Ms Landolt. 
A brief would be insufficient.  
Could the honourable senator confirm that the witnesses understand how the system works?  
World Trade Organization-Negotiations on Agricultural Subsidies-Government Policy 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Again, the reply is general.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I thank the honourable senator for once again raising this important issue. 
Strategically, agriculture and the WTO are very important. 
We can only await their response.  
I trust Mr. Pettigrew, or someone else, will provide us with an answer.  
We are doing nothing to further agriculture. 
That is my concern. 
I ask for an undertaking to get on with that strategy.  
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
Is that in fact the case?  
In other words, we gave away the ship. 
Yesterday, this issue was raised before the Agriculture Committee again. 
Most recent were the announcements with respect to grain transportation. 
This is simply the latest measure which is substantial in nature.  
Honourable senators, the minister makes a good point. 
That is the point. 
It has already gone on for some considerable period of time. 
The recent measure is substantial. 
Possibility of Committee Study on Issues Facing Farmers 
Hon. John G. Bryden :
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
We are preparing to write a report. 
In fact, we will be hearing from the minister today.  
It is a serious question. 
This crisis is a national one at this time. 
It must be looked into. 
I could not agree more with the honourable senator.  
Honourable senators, there are many issues. 
I understand Senator Gustafson's answer. 
Has the Chairman contemplated doing that? 
If not, would he consider raising that matter with his committee?  
The world needs food.  
The country is facing a very serious national problem. 
I have farmed all my life. 
We have had good times, and we have had difficult times. 
Those safety nets must be put in place.  
The honourable senator asked if there will be a farming industry in Canada. 
Let me try one more time. 
Senator Sparrow recommended such a study. 
However, I agree with Senator Sparrow. 
I could not agree more.  
Pages Exchange Program with House of Commons 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Melanie MacGuire is from Windsor, Ontario. 
Eric Plamondon, on my left, is studying at the University of Ottawa. 
He is in political science in the Faculty of Social Sciences.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Senator Kinsella can comment or not.  
We will probably sit late tonight. 
Second Reading-Motion for Allotment of Time for Debate Adopted 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, with respect to Bill C-20, pursuant to rule 38, I move: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I did not know that, Your Honour. 
It is not a debatable motion. 
I certainly concur with you.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I agree entirely with the explanation of Senator Hays. 
We raised a number of important principles relating to this bill. 
Our position is clear and open. 
We want a sophisticated debate on a subject affecting the life of the country. 
I fully support the motion of Senator Hays.  
If so, when does he plan to do that?  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Special Senate Committee on Bill C-20 
Motion to Appoint-Debate Continued 
Senator Celine Hervieux-Payette, P.C. 
That four members constitute a quorum; 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
I do not and I shall not support this motion. 
It is a sorry motion and it is a sorry proceeding. 
Honourable senators, I object strenuously. 
This motion is both a robber and a thief. 
It purports to rob Parliament and the Senate of their sovereignty. 
It seeks to rob the Senate of its own constitution. 
Bill C-20 violates those two foundational notions of liberalism in Canada. 
Remember, three-fifths of us who are what we are voted Yes....It's 
true we have been defeated. 
By money and by the ethnic vote.  
I am one of those ethnics.  
My reaction to those words was extremely strong. 
Sovereignty is a political and parliamentary fact buttressed by the force of arms. 
It is indivisible and inalienable. 
Sovereignty is allegiance to that which and whom is sovereign. 
If it does prosper, none dare call it treason.  
That was a footnote by Sir Stephen.  
That United Kingdom act was part of Canadian law. 
Treason is a peculiar and unique offence. 
It is to be distinguished from any other offence. 
The offence of treason rests on infidelity, on unfaithfulness. 
The complex and distinct offence of treason rests in perfidy. 
Conversely, treason impairs the protection owed by Queen and Crown to subject citizens. 
Treason is most complex. 
There are high treasons and petit treasons. 
Perjury used to be a petit treason. 
I move now to those oaths of allegiance to the sovereign in Canada. 
First, let us look at the Oath of Allegiance that we senators here take. 
I ... do swear, That I will be faithful and bear true Allegiance to Her Majesty...  
Honourable senators, that is not a hymn or a sentimental piece of poetry. 
That is the current law of Canada. 
Its section XXXV said: 
Honourable senators, I cannot support this motion . 
Its section XXIII said, in part: 
Honourable senators, I oppose this motion. 
The Senate committee composition is not the whim, fancy or convenience of the government. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is the honourable senator requesting leave to continue?  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
The honourable senator who is requesting leave - 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I am sorry, Honourable Senator Hays, I could not hear your comment.  
Honourable senators, the time is up for Senator Cools' speech. 
Honourable senators will recall that we have had exchanges on this before. 
Honourable senators, I should like to have clarity on this. 
Maybe that senator does not want leave to continue. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
If it is not accepted, then no leave is granted.  
Which time period will apply? 
Honourable senators, I note that the ruling provided for a brief exchange on the matter. 
I perhaps was ahead of Senator Cools. 
With that, honourable senators, I shall let Senator Cools ask for leave. 
We shall do this correctly.  
Perhaps I could find out from Honourable Senator Hays.  
My understanding is that parliamentary proposals should take the form of motions. 
I am speaking to a motion.  
There are other provisions for certain speakers and so on. 
Very well, honourable senators, may I have leave to continue?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
It would be very interesting to know which takes priority.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I am sorry, no leave was granted. 
I did not put the question. 
Are you asking for leave?  
I made the request.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
But I did not proceed to ask, "Is leave" - 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable Senator Cools, I am sorry, the Speaker is standing. 
Will you be please be seated?  
When I stand, the microphones are cut off. 
At that time, I asked, "Are you requesting leave?" 
It was granted and you may proceed.  
I thank honourable senators.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Speaker must ask the Senate whether leave is granted. 
Without that permission, there can be no leave. 
It is the Senate that makes that decision on the question.  
Its Section VII said: 
The BNA Act's Section 31.(2) 
enacted disqualification for treason. 
If he is attainted of Treason or convicted of Felony or of any infamous Crime:...  
So did Robert Baldwin. 
These Reformers wanted strong assemblies. 
The BNA Act intended harsh consequences for treasonous senators. 
Attainder for treason has some stern results. 
Honourable senators, treason is what the Parliament of Canada says treason is.  
This opinion is misleading and menacing. 
The British North America Act was not silent on secession. 
It was virulently opposed to secession. 
Its express provisions forbid secession. 
The act viewed secession as treasonous. 
The words "during good behaviour" have a particular constitutional origin and meaning. 
Judges, too, have a duty of allegiance to Canadian sovereignty. 
They also have a duty of vigilance against treason. 
Section 99.(1) states, in part: 
Parliament, in particular the Senate, is the constitutional watchdog of Canada's sovereignty. 
It was for those reasons these powers were given to Parliament.  
These provisions speak plainly to the indivisibility and oneness of Canada. 
One dominion means that - one nation, one indivisible nation. 
The BNA Act was a very well-drafted act. 
For example, the word "one" is repeated in sections 17 and 102. 
About the Parliament of Canada, section 17 states: 
About the revenue fund, section 102 states, in part: 
...One Consolidated Revenue Fund ... 
The BNA Act is loud and clear. 
It is not silent.  
No government of Canada or a province has a prerogative to negotiate secession. 
There is no such prerogative. 
In a constitutional monarchy, the principle was that "the King never dies." 
The kingdom is forever.  
Further, no king has any Royal Prerogative to end the kingdom. 
I hope that we will get a chance to put these questions to Minister Dion. 
Law is something that should be clear, obvious and known to us. 
I know what I would have done. 
I would have told the minister to go to hell. 
Honourable senators, I oppose this motion. 
Honourable senators, I do not speak about race. 
I just serve and serve and serve.  
I believe it was Milton who said something about "they who wait." 
The Speaker and Senator Hays were earlier talking about Speakers' rulings. 
We are considering the rules of the Senate every day. 
Many jurisdictions make decisions in that way.  
Honourable senators, my natural instinct is always the parliamentary instinct, the British instinct. 
This motion is very quietly seeking to overturn a motion passed last November. 
Many people want to know my position on these issues.  
Would the Honourable Senator Cools entertain a question?  
I would be happy to take questions.  
Has she evidence of that attempt that she could share with this chamber?  
Honourable senators, I was speaking to the intended results of the motion. 
I do not recall saying words like "motivation." 
I do remember saying the word "motion."  
However, I believe that at this point in time these issues are confused. 
Perhaps, over time, we can debate these issues and clarify them.  
In her opinion, would that constitute a breach of parliamentary privilege?  
There are definitely questions of privilege. 
Yet, I have repeatedly seen a reluctance by the Senate to defend itself.  
Let us make no mistake. 
At some time we must find a way to balance and clarify these interests. 
It is a very troubling question.  
As I have said, I am not pleased. 
Furthermore, I think the situation is unfair and unjust.  
Honourable senators, this is a very troubling matter. 
At the time, I sort of chuckled and let that particular statement go by.  
The fact of the matter is that the government wants the bill passed without amendment. 
That happens quite often. 
We come to the essential question:
That is my understanding.  
Party politics as I used to know it may be a thing of the past.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, the 30-minute additional leave period has expired. 
Are there other speakers?  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I should like to speak on this motion. 
It is done openly and deliberately. 
Ask any government caucus member over there. 
Why we should be drifting to that direction is beyond me. 
We work on committees here in a collegial fashion. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
I also have a recommendation for the deputy leader. 
The motion reads that four members constitute a quorum. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
That is a disservice to the people whose names are listed there. 
Rule 85(4) and (5) of our rules state: 
(5) The notice referred to in subsection (4) above shall be signed: 
Normally, it is the whip. 
Senator Lynch-Staunton's point is a good one. 
Why is it done that way? 
That is my general comment.  
We, on this side, objected to that approach. 
I shall not repeat them.  
I think that could be a practice of the committee. 
Perhaps the honourable senator is satisfied with that. 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, could Senator Hays give some clarification? 
He said that the situation is not really different. 
That is an inescapable conclusion. 
That is my first point.  
Those changes in membership go on daily, as senators substitute for each other. 
I have one other observation. 
The system is moving in that direction in some jurisdictions. 
That speech gave my reasons for going to a special committee. 
I do not know if there is a rule or not. 
Perhaps, we can build a time frame into that. 
Honourable senators, I rise with a question for the Honourable Senator Hays. 
Senator Milne will, of course, speak for herself in terms of her time. 
I would make that offer.  
Honourable senators, this motion troubles me for two reasons. 
It anticipates that the vote would indeed be positive. 
I am concerned about good order in that respect.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Agreed, otherwise they will not be heard.  
I shall mention Senator Lynch-Staunton's amendment in passing.  
Nine Liberal members have been named. 
Fifteen members will compose the committee. 
That leaves six members remain unnamed. 
It would be for them to decide.  
Honourable senators, I find that rather strange. 
Of course, the answer to the three questions that I have posed is: nowhere.  
Some were even chairmen of committees. 
I think that it is wrong to maintain this aberration. 
It is coming very much to the fore in the present instance.  
I also hope that my remarks will not be construed as preaching for a call. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
On motion of Senator Carstairs, debate adjourned.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Second Reading-Debate Suspended 
Here we have a province calling a referendum with a so-called clear question. 
The results come in with a clear majority. 
What happens when that occurs? 
It is the fundamental question that this bill does not address.  
Put yourself in their place. 
What would you be imagining:
You have to have a little sympathy. 
After all, the day was saved because the Canadian people became involved. 
I wish again to thank them.  
As Senator Kinsella stated in his speech: 
Who is running this country? 
Could it be the Supreme Court and the PMO?  
I should like to address the issues I outlined earlier. 
There is the matter of the question. 
Imagine that process, if you will.  
Then there is the matter of the majority. 
Clause 2.1 states, in part: 
...the House of Commons shall take into account 
( b ) the percentage of eligible voters voting in the referendum; and 
( c ) any other matters or circumstances it considers to be relevant.  
It simply matters on whose side you are on. 
Who decides - the Supreme Court and the PMO? 
What if, again, the answer is no to secession? 
Does that end it once and for all? 
Should this bill not address that question?  
Then there is the matter of negotiation. 
Clause 3.1 states, in part: 
Can you imagine what would take place? 
We have such short memories. 
Of course, the negotiations would take a very long time. 
This is not the way to go. 
Outlaw any referenda that have to do with the breakup of the country. 
What about the rights of aboriginals living in Quebec? 
Should we not talk about the unmentionable? 
Should we not discuss the potential impact it would have?  
We are, after all, a gentle people. 
We do not discuss such things. 
Canadians need to face that reality. 
But I tread on eggshells here, and cracked ones at that.  
What of the impact on the budgets of other provinces? 
They will want to remain a geographic part of Canada.  
The bill is silent on all of this. 
Another devious part of this bill is the sheer brevity of it. 
Let us get positive for a moment.  
As has been said by others in this place, Canada is one and indivisible. 
You say that the other place has the final say. 
Yes, we have seen them work. 
To do otherwise would risk all.  
As I stated earlier, Canadians are a gentle people. 
We do not particularly like confrontation. 
I believe that many senators do not want to give this bill approval in principle. 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (The Hon. the Acting Speaker) :
May I have leave to continue?  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is leave granted to allow Senator Stratton to continue?  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Could the Honourable Senator Stratton indicate how much more time he would require?  
I have a page and a half left in my speech.  
Perhaps we should grant leave for a one-half hour extension.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is that agreed, honourable senators?  
Therefore, I move, seconded by the Honourable Senator Lynch-Staunton: 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
In 1980 and 1995, the Government of Quebec represented a minority of those people. 
Honourable senators, the vote on Bill C-20 is scheduled for Thursday. 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker:
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
I may be incorrect. 
I do not believe it is a hoist motion. 
We are not opposed to clarity. 
To be opposed to clarity would be anti-intellectual. 
Everyone is in favour of clarity.  
The court did not say that. 
The court said that it would be for political actors. 
The drafters have let the government down, and it is in black and white. 
Right now, they do not say the same thing.  
I share that objective.  
In their constitution, Mexico is indivisible.  
Let us not be stampeded by the petulance of anyone. 
Let us not be misguided by a false timetable. 
Therefore, honourable senators, I support this motion in amendment.  
Honourable senators, would the Honourable Senator Kinsella permit a question?  
Of course, honourable senators.  
I thank the honourable senator for his question. 
It is a fair one. 
They meet with the minister and say "Here is the general approach." 
There has been a sophisticated debate in this house. 
There would be plenty of time.  
Our committee can do it. 
There are prima facie inaccuracies within the grand principles. 
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
I rise now, honourable senators, to turn to the matter of our business. 
I hope we can return to the main motion. 
That will be her choice. 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, might I put a question to the Honourable Senator Hays? 
I am not sure what our intention is at this time. 
Perhaps Senator Hays can clarify that matter.  
Could the Table call Order No. 2, please?  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
We will return to the debate on Bill C-20 following the vote. 
Is that the understanding, honourable senators?  
Not quite, Your Honour. 
Bill to Amend-Third Reading-Debate Suspended 
First, why this bill and why now? 
It is hoped, of course, that all states eventually will do so. 
Both are expected to be adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in early June.  
Children at that age will still be able to volunteer.  
It is not sufficient that our policies are in compliance. 
The obligations must be enshrined in our law. 
This is in fact what happens. 
There is, of course, one critical exception to this integrated approach. 
More often, they are there because their other life choices have been so constrained. 
They are living in great poverty. 
They have little or no education. 
Employment is minimally available. 
There are family and cultural pressures.  
At the age of 15, she joined them. 
These are huge challenges for us all.  
The Hon. the Speaker:
Honourable Senator Pearson, I regret that I must interrupt you.  
I have just two lines left to read, honourable senators.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, these are huge challenges for us all. 
Nevertheless, the optional protocol is a piece of this puzzle. 
I urge honourable senators to support this bill.  
Special Senate Committee on Bill C-20 
Motion to Appoint Committee Adopted 
Senator Celine Hervieux-Payette, P.C. 
That four members constitute a quorum; 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion in amendment?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
In my opinion, the "nays" have it.  
And two honourable senators having risen.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Motion in amendment negatived on the following division: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, we are back, then, to the main motion. 
Will those honourable senators in favour of the motion please say "yea"?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those honourable senators opposed to the motion please say "nay"?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
In my opinion, the "yeas" have it.  
And two honourable senators having risen .  
The Hon. the Speaker :
What is your wish, honourable senators, for this vote?  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Accordingly, we are ready to proceed with the vote.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it agreed that it be a standing vote?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Motion agreed to on the following division: 
Bill to Amend-Third Reading 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
I commend the government for finally bringing this piece of legislation before us.  
Canada had a very strong role in that convention. 
Theatres of hostility can be those within Canadaas well as those outside of Canada.  
Those theatres of hostility can be within Canada, as elsewhere. 
It is important that Canada exert its leadership in this area. 
They were certainly put under the gun to use a gun.  
Consequently, it was appropriate for Canada, through many decades, to bring light to this issue. 
We have tried to bring this to the attention of other countries.  
These people could some day be the future acknowledged leaders in some countries.  
Liberia provides an example. 
He is now a legitimate leader of Liberia.  
I part company with Senator Pearson at this point. 
I think it is an admirable employment technique. 
That is the direction in which many other countries are going.  
Compliance exists within Canada, and we are doing it correctly.  
We have lost our international moral leadership. 
Canada has lost some of the leadership that we would have had.  
Honourable senators, I shall not hold up the bill. 
However, I encourage Canada to take that extra step. 
Hon. Colin Kenny (The Hon. the Acting Speaker) :
Is the Honourable Senator Pearson asking a question?  
Honourable senators, I have one question before the vote on the question.  
Honourable senators, I thank Honourable Senator Pearson for that comment. 
Perhaps this is something else I could clarify.  
We wanted to receive it.  
I cannot speak for the Norwegian government. 
The cadet program, for example, is excellent. 
We need these kinds of programs in Canada. 
I would have liked to have been in leadership without the debate. 
That is where the honourable senator and I disagree.  
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
Honourable senators, I have a few things to say.  
This is a short bill. 
It is a one-liner. 
They told us they were not empowered to deal with that issue. 
I believe that is part and parcel of what we are looking at today.  
They sent in functionaries, people from National Defence. 
I share many of the concerns expressed by Senator Andreychuk. 
We shall spend much more time on it. 
We will insist that ministers come to defend their departmental policies and practices. 
Hon. Raymond J. Perrault :
I have met with them and listened to their views. 
Let me tell honourable senators, this is a very serious problem.  
Some honourable senators who were there with me will remember those remarks. 
However, there is a price.  
Over the past year, eight - and perhaps even more - of our peacekeepers have committed suicide. 
The real impact of war on humans is absolutely dreadful.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, I feel somewhat constrained in entering this debate. 
I have been to Bosnia. 
Senator Perrault spoke of suicide. 
I know of what he speaks. 
I know that Senator Rompkey shares this view, because we have discussed it. 
When they come home, they are on their own. 
Suicide is the grace of God. 
However, the one thing we overlook is taking care of our own people. 
We send them into conditions of war and atrocity.  
I talked to Captain Jackson, who has just returned from Sierra Leone. 
There has been no counsel for them. 
There has been no place they can turn. 
I am concerned about the protocol. 
We can do better.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.  
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, we have an amendment before us. 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Very well, honourable senators. 
Honourable senators, the Parliament of Canada is indivisible. 
It is not silent. 
It said, at paragraph 148, that: 
That is very fascinating. 
That advisory opinion is extraordinary and beyond the law. 
Further, it is contrary to all constitutional law.  
Certainly, we would have known that.  
It would not have been a mystery. 
Sir John A. would have known. 
Prime Minister Trudeau would have known.  
This is a revolution, unfounded in constitutional law, custom or usage. 
But it must be there just the same ... 
Revolution, honourable senators, revolution.  
Selected Writings 1939-1996 , recalled that reference. 
Condemning the majority judges' decision, Mr. Trudeau said, at page 256: 
... they blatantly manipulated the evidence before them so as to arrive at the desired result. 
I join Mr. Trudeau in that. 
...that latter province a lever to pry itself out of the Canadian constitutional family.  
I shall speak as a senator from Ontario, the birthplace of responsible government in Canada. 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable Senator Cools, I regret to inform you that your time limit has passed.  
May I have leave to continue, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Honourable senators, responsible government was developed to correct that corruption. 
Honourable senators, the position of the prime minister in responsible government is great. 
About the cabinet and the ministry, Todd quoted Lord Macaulay, saying, at page 2: 
The ministry is, in fact, a committee of leading members of the two Houses.  
Parliament means two Houses, the Senate and the Commons.  
I cannot respond to all, but I shall respond to some.  
He will insist on Liberal Party loyalty to obtain it. 
This is an infringement.  
Its History, Structure, and Working. 
He said, at page 254: 
It is not only Neanderthal, politically prehistoric, but it is dangerous. 
Senator Boudreau said at page 813 of the Debates of the Senate : 
First, Senator Boudreau is wrong. 
The executive, the cabinet, has no prerogative. 
The Crown does, Her Majesty does, but the cabinet has no prerogative. 
The prerogative is the Royal Prerogative. 
The government leader relies on the Royal Prerogative of Her Majesty. 
About this impropriety, Lord Brougham also said, at page 331: 
...it is an impure and illicit source from which to draw favour towards the Government. 
I repeat: the legitimate use of the power of the Royal Prerogative. 
Honourable senators, I tell you that there is no such prerogative. 
There is no Royal Prerogative to negotiate the disunion of Canada. 
Her Majesty's sovereignty can tolerate no division.  
They form no part of parliamentary practice of the Parliament of Canada. 
I shall endeavour to show this.  
Senator Boudreau's language illustrates the government's problem and his own problem. 
I repeat, the prerogative is Her Majesty's prerogative. 
Further, he asks the Senate to concur.  
Clause 7 of that Bill had read: 
If parliament refuses its approval the government will have to vacate its place.  
It has come down through all these years, and parliament means both houses. 
Prime Minister Bennett also said, at page 4587: 
The House of Commons says yes and the Senate says no. 
The government has failed.  
Prime Minister Bennett concluded, at page 4587: 
But that is not this case. 
The government has risked its fate by dismissing a man from his job. 
The exchange was, at page 4587: 
The Prime Minister laughs at that, as he so often does.  
The Senate put the Macdonald government out.  
That action, I suggest, should not take the form of this kind of bill. 
That action, I suggest, would require two stages. 
- who was Mr. Fulton - 
That bill was defeated in the Senate by Liberals. 
Section 99.(1) states: 
This power is known as the power to advise; it is well documented. 
The power of the Senate to advise is unlimited. 
Honourable senators, Bill C-20 is improper and inappropriate. 
Honourable senators, for me, that is objectionable - extremely objectionable.

Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
The process typically begins with the placement of cash into financial channels. 
No country, including Canada, is immune from these activities.  
What has Canada been doing to address this problem? 
This bill meets both goals.  
I shall begin by discussing the mandatory reporting provisions of suspicious transactions. 
The centre does not have investigative powers.  
This guidance will be in the form of official guidelines issued by the new agency. 
This legislation achieves several things. 
Bill C-22 ensures that Canada meets these responsibilities. 
On motion of Senator Kinsella, for Senator Kelleher, debate adjourned.  
Federal Law-Civil Law Harmonization Bill

I shall conclude with the beneficial effects of the harmonization process.  
The areas requiring more meaningful reform were noted. 
Bill S-22 adds two provisions to the Interpretation Act. 
Bijuralism is a fact of life in Canada. 
A good example of this can be seen in the definition of a "secured creditor."  
The initiative will also have a beneficial, albeit indirect, impact on a national scale. 
Finally, the initiative will be advantageous to Canada internationally. 
On motion of Senator De Ware, in the name of Senator Beaudoin, debate adjourned.
