The House met at 10 a.m. 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
MARRIAGE (PROHIBITED DEGREES) ACT 
ENDANGERED SPECIES SANCTUARIES ACT 
I hope the bill passes. 
It would go a long way toward protecting endangered species in Canada.  
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Mr. Reginald Belair (Timmins-James Bay, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions to present today. 
The first one deals with breast cancer.  
Mr. Reginald Belair (Timmins-James Bay, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my second petition has to do with rural route mail couriers.  
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
CANADIAN INSTITUTES OF HEALTH RESEARCH ACT 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Farewells are often tinged with sadness. 
But that is not at all an accurate description of the prevailing mood. 
Instead of sadness, there was excitement. 
Instead of regret, there was tremendous optimism and hope.  
What a past to celebrate.  
The concept of the institutes is as novel as it is simple. 
The CIHR is a direct response to these contemporary challenges. 
The CIHR will be the principal Canadian health research enterprise of the next century.  
Above all, CIHR will help improve the health of Canadians.  
How will it do that? 
CIHR brings together researchers from across regions and disciplines. 
First of all, there will not be just one model of institute.  
The structure of the institutes must be simple and cost-conscious. 
There is another key element in the institutes' agenda. 
Herein lies the test of real leadership.  
This leadership will be exercised in the respect of provincial jurisdiction. 
The government shares that belief. 
And this is only the beginning. 
I sincerely believe that the institutes will set the example for the world.  
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Canadian Alliance):
If I have done my math correctly, that still leaves a considerable shortfall.  
It puts the provinces in a tremendous dilemma. 
We know what happens. 
Let us examine some of the facts in a bit more detail. 
In the 1999 budget the Canada health and social transfer was $1,005 per taxpayer. 
That is a 31% drop in federal transfers to the provincial governments.  
We know that health care delivery is a provincial matter. 
Unfortunately, paying for it has also become a provincial responsibility. 
Let me repeat that. 
That is money taken out of the national health care system. 
It represents $143 for each person in Canada today.  
It is not just in dollars that the Liberals have failed. 
First, I would like to speak to accessibility. 
Second, I would like to speak to portability. 
Full and equal services are intended for all. 
This goes on all the time across the country. 
In reality, who has created two tier health care in this country? 
How does this affect you and I, Mr. Speaker? 
We are the ones who pay for this. 
What is the net effect of this loss of money to the system?  
While it looks at the money it has failed to recognize the human quotient. 
They may be in pain or their quality of life may have been diminished. 
There are lots of ways to split up the problem. 
We could look at the number of hospital beds that have closed. 
However the Liberals will never acknowledge that this is a problem of their own doing. 
We are always in need of improvement. 
I would like to draw the attention of the House to several issues. 
It is a novel idea. 
Funding should be upon merit alone.  
The research must be valid and likewise the financial accountability must be clear as well.  
Without this support the CIHR will only be viewed as another Liberal slush fund.  
That is exactly what we did with the Canadian Alliance. 
We should always look ahead to the future, never looking backward.  
As with any organization consistency is appropriate. 
The accountability process must extend to all aspects of the CIHR. 
To do otherwise does not ensure that the allocation remains transparent. 
Canadians are demanding full government accountability.  
We all recognize that disagreements will occur. 
I am in favour of the intent of Bill C-13. 
We need to be sure to attract and keep our best and brightest. 
Our loss of these people is definitely some other country's gain. 
We cannot allow this to continue.  
Of course a major part of this problem involves taxes. 
However I will save that particular part of my argument for another day. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Let us begin by the beginning. 
The bill before us will abolish this council. 
The fact remains however that the government itself has failed to do it.  
We will have some numbers to provide on this later. 
It is especially important to recognize that health care is a provincial jurisdiction. 
This is a national average. 
This is truly shameful.  
We are facing a situation we have questions about. 
The federal government wants to invest in research and development. 
We repeated the request in 1997.  
I am convinced that my colleague, the member for Chambly, will agree. 
There is a paradox in the bill. 
We said ``Yes, let us establish institutes of health research.'' 
There is another paradox. 
Really now, that makes no sense.  
The government has failed in its duty. 
I repeat, we are in favour of the principle of this bill. 
Unfortunately, the government turned a deaf ear to them. 
I will read the letter in question, if I may, for the sake of transparency. 
I will now begin reading the letter: 
The term used here is quite strong, and meant to be. 
Could someone give me the Latin root of the word troubled? 
Does the hon. member for Chambly remember?  
It comes from the word trouble.  
It comes from the word trouble, as in troublemaker. 
The Government of Quebec is troubled. 
I will go back to the letter: 
The letter further states: 
Health is an area under provincial jurisdiction. 
With regard to research, the letter says: 
He was an ultramontane. 
I read further and I hope you will get the gist of the letter: 
I mentioned Henri Bourassa for a reason. 
This is typical of Canadian history. 
If I may, I would like to quote again Ministers Rochon and Marois: 
This is quite something. 
We have nothing against voluntary organizations. 
The letter goes on: 
I believe members get the point of this letter. 
I also want to emphasize that the Quebec government has priorities. 
It has identified areas where it has developed know-how, a specific expertise.  
I am referring also to AIDS. 
I am also thinking of cancer, which has taken an enormous toll, as we know.  
Mr. Speaker, you are indicating that I have only three minutes left. 
I will have to speak quickly of the amendments we have put forward. 
I would like to recall five of our amendments. 
We also would have liked to amend clause 4 as follows: 
-by replacing lines 23 to 26 on page four with the following: 
I will conclude on three points. 
This is a nation building bill. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
We have tried to seek changes in those areas. 
We have been unsuccessful so our concerns remain. 
This bill is about research. 
It is not just coming from the New Democratic Party members. 
Our objective at committee was straightforward and simple. 
We presented some 15 amendments, all of which were turned down by the government. 
They were hardly considered for a moment by the government. 
Does this not sound simple? 
A very good scientist.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
She was doing research on a particular drug called L1. 
As a result of that expression of concern, she was silenced. 
The whole issue of commercialization was one of our concerns. 
I see my time is going much more quickly than I expected.  
We wanted regional balance. 
We wanted to ensure that the board reflected the population. 
Did we get gender parity? 
No, it did not.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):
Therefore, it is tough for me to formulate the question that I want to ask. 
Is there a Bill Gates on the horizon in the medical area?  
I do not know whether the hon. member wants to respond. 
I believe that in the Canadian context we need to reach a balance. 
I would like that to end.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
No one is opposed to the private sector being involved in research. 
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Who basically drove the Liberal agenda? 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for that question. 
It is very pertinent to the debate today. 
We are at a crossroads in terms of where our health care system will go.  
Did you say Ralph Chretien or Ralph Klein?  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
It could be Ralph Chretien or Jean Klein. 
We are talking about two peas in a pod.  
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my 20 minutes with our deputy House leader.  
It is a pleasure to take part in this debate today. 
I am sure we all agree that this bill is long overdue. 
That is our main concern and the main reason we have introduced the amendments.  
We are suggesting that there is a better way to do this. 
The Prime Minister has been around for a long time. 
Our party cannot see where there will be any independence for these institutes. 
These are very serious concerns in my view.  
That is a very legitimate concern. 
The health care system needs money. 
The Liberals seem to run from that. 
It is something they will probably take into an election campaign. 
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
We would have liked the government to have been more open. 
First, the provinces were mentioned frequently. 
My hon. colleague from the Bloc Quebecois raised the federal-provincial constitutional and jurisdictional issue. 
This has been looked into. 
The answer is yes, it is legal.  
It forgot about that. 
We would like to see the government reconsider it.  
This includes, of course, the other house. 
It is a lot of people.  
It would have been nice.  
There could have been a certain number for each province or for each region. 
It would have been nice if parliament had been a lot more involved. 
We find that somewhat unfortunate. 
Members are appointed for three years, but during pleasure. 
They will play musical chairs. 
The membership of the governing council will be easy to change.  
This was seen in government agencies. 
We find it unfortunate. 
This is also a very complex bill. 
Reference was made to the role of the private sector. 
Who was in office in the 1980s? 
I mentioned the private sector's role. 
All our questions may not get answered.  
This is dangerous, because we will lose contact with this institute.  
It may also enter into a partnership with governments. 
These issues would not be raised if parliament were much more involved. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
It is a very important concept. 
A very important principle is being espoused in the bill.  
They will not be institutes that have bricks and mortar. 
A network of some 10 to 15 institutes will be established. 
This was echoed by many witnesses, but I thought this was well put. 
Many other witnesses also said that.  
That should not be taken very lightly. 
This is a very important bill. 
It is very significant. 
We have to do this right, though. 
In other words there will be winners and there will be losers. 
It is a possibility. 
Members should ask themselves why anyone would have concerns. 
What is the motivation?  
There are some reasons. 
In fact some of those concerns were expressed. 
We have to be honest. 
As legislators we have to ask questions about why they are raising these issues.  
It is a signal that something needs to be addressed. 
The theme comes up again. 
That is why review and evaluation are critical. 
Why can they not be consistent? 
Why can they not stand and be consistent in terms of what they believe in? 
The finance committee was meeting at the same time. 
Here again are politics coming into play. 
I am a backbench member of parliament. 
I thought there were some very interesting questions.  
It is on the record.  
I understand that these people will be of the highest integrity. 
They will be the best in Canada, guiding the shaping of research in Canada. 
They will be beyond reproach.  
We are talking about an enormous virtual institution that will be influenced daily. 
It is not debatable. 
We have to make sure that all the tools are in place. 
That is why it will operate at arm's length.  
The governing council will have the opportunity to run its own show. 
We already have mechanisms in place. 
We need to think about the governance model.  
The minister has the opportunity to make or to cancel the order in council appointments. 
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
He talked about moving Motion No. 56. 
There is no need to look very far; it is immediately obvious. 
This is something that is open to criticism.  
Mr. Speaker, let me refer the member to Motion No. 56.  
The member was not there. 
Another member is responsible for delivering that amendment.  
I found it disgusting. 
With regard to the member's comments, I understand the points. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):
I would ask the member to clarify that.  
It is rather interesting and rather amazing to hear the- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Canadian Alliance spoke second in this debate. 
If he would check the blues, he would see his information is incorrect.  
I do not think that is a point of order. 
Mr. Speaker, we do not need to debate this. 
I also want to clarify the position of the Canadian Alliance. 
We are opposed to that and will continue to be opposed to that. 
Canadians are opposed to that. 
It is important that Canadians hear that firsthand.  
Canadians tell us there is something wrong. 
The status quo of health care is not acceptable and it is not sustainable. 
That is the message which all of us as parliamentarians should be getting. 
This bill does that. 
It provides us with an opportunity for research to flourish in the country. 
It is important to look at what the bill attempts to accomplish. 
The themes of the health research will involve basic biomedical research. 
We have to look around the world to see the changes that have occurred. 
Today one in ten Canadians is over the age of 65. 
In 26 years, one in five Canadians will be over the age of 65. 
A great many people told our committee what should happen. 
He said that we must focus on outcomes. 
It is essential that we keep well trained individuals in our country. 
As an example, I have a daughter, about whom I will brag a bit. 
She is finishing her Ph.D. in Holland. 
She went looking for a job. 
She will graduate this spring. 
She had nine job offers, four of which were from Canada. 
One of them was at the University of Western Ontario. 
To our disappointment, she accepted an offer from Germany.  
She will be working in a university which emphasizes the importance of research.  
This agency should help, and that is a positive.  
The fourth item that Dr. Vaughan suggested was that we need balance. 
Fifth, he said that we must be internationally competitive. 
These are the reasons we can support the bill. 
We must also look at other factors. 
We have to look at keeping the issue of research in a non-political environment. 
That goes right down to the researchers in the lab. 
As well, we must examine the Canada Health Act. 
We talk about accessibility. 
The Canadian health care system is not accessible. 
Over 200,000 Canadians are on waiting lists. 
That is not an accessible health care system. 
We need to modernize it and work with them in a co-operative manner.  
Ask the people from Quebec what they are told when they enter that hospital. 
Ask about it being comprehensive. 
Each year more and more things are delisted. 
What do Canadians expect from their health care system? 
What do they want included and what do they want taken out?  
I have already addressed the area of universality. 
That is what the Canadian Alliance wants. 
The final area is public administration. 
We have all kinds of problems there. 
There should be a sixth point, and that should be results. 
Are we getting results from our health care system? 
That is exactly what Canadians do not want to hear. 
They do not want the status quo because it is not working. 
It is not sustainable.  
They have not funded the system adequately. 
They have cut $25 billion from health care. 
In closing, I would say that we will support this bill. 
In terms of research, we must do it. 
The health care system is broken and needs to fixed. 
All Canadians want it to be fixed. 
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Indeed, the health of people requires long term planning.  
I would like to know how the hon. member suggests this problem might be resolved? 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Joliette for his question. 
I think that applies here more than anywhere else.  
Another item of equal importance is the administration of research. 
We need to improve dramatically. 
Co-operation in this whole area will be critical for it to be successful.  
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I heard the member for Red Deer and his colleague earlier. 
The member opposite also talked about that.  
If we look at the facts, they are clear. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I am following this debate with great interest. 
Mr. Speaker, that is a very real concern. 
Some other provinces are getting slightly more if other figures are taken into consideration. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye:
This is a dead loss of some $150 million.  
I would like to know what my colleague thinks of this dangerous precedent.  
That comes from a lack of long term planning. 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
The mission of the institutes includes some interesting and innovative aspects. 
Final decisions on the institutes to be created have not yet been made. 
The approach is clearly multidisciplinary. 
Once bitten twice shy, as the old saying goes. 
This is still the case today.  
It is not the creation of the institutes that is the problem. 
The provinces have no power to choose the institutes.  
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member. 
We will now begin with statements by members.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
He is an internationally respected Canadian physician specializing in HIV infection.  
In Nairobi alone, 500 people per day die from AIDS.  
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Canadian Alliance):
What is the status of the compensation plan? 
To date, the lawyers have been paid. 
What about the actual victims who need the money? 
Well, the lawyers have been paid. 
What a sad excuse for compassionate health care.  
The government ought to be ashamed of itself.  
QUEBEC MINISTER OF TRANSPORT 
Mr. Raymond Lavigne (Verdun-Saint-Henri, Lib.):
He prefers buses instead.  
Property values on the island may also be threatened.  
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):
Daffodils are flowers of joy. 
The Canadian Cancer Society is a national volunteer organization. 
Together let us find a cure.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Canadian Alliance):
The House failed in its duty to uphold the constitution. 
CANADA STUDENT LOANS PROGRAM 
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
In fact, it is the key factor in allowing them to pursue their education.  
This program provides assistance to more than 350,000 students every year.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, March 27 marked World Theatre Day. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):
They want a party and a leader who can actually count.  
They want results in their lifetime.  
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
We capitalize on the talent of our people and the natural beauty of our land.  
We embrace and explore our cultural and ethnic differences. 
HUDSON BAY ROUTE ASSOCIATION 
Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
The message is this:
This is necessary to protect farmers against railway monopoly. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
The Canadian Cancer Society's campaign is kicked off each year with Daffodil Days. 
STUDENT SUMMER JOB ACTION PROGRAM 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
She said the deadline was March 31.  
Now all of a sudden applications are being accepted for another week.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Let us all get behind it and support it. 
It is very important and Canadians need to do their part. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
He got them $700,000. 
The brewery got its grant just two weeks after the corporation was formed. 
That is pretty slow actually by Shawinigan standards.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
From our point of view that is a good investment.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
What a concert, Mr. Speaker. 
In fact I bet that 20 people could get a job here. 
Maybe we could have the great Canadian boondoggle museum. 
There could be weekly seminars entitled ``My Time at the Trough:
Of course we know there is no shortage of accommodation for the out of towners.  
The Prime Minister said, ``It is a great Canadian story''. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
It is visited by thousands of people and it is creating more jobs than expected. 
They are expanding all the time. 
They have made another application to expand because it is a very good operation. 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):
As we know, this region has extraordinary potential for development as a tourist site. 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):
We are acting as a responsible government. 
Our priority is to create jobs. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
The matter is a very simple one. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The hon. member for Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I would like to quote from a recent article in La Presse : 
This was said by Claude Pinard, the PQ MNA for the riding.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Individual members provincially appreciate these investments. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
He told me that he wants to respect them. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
It put it for sale again and had an offer. 
I have been told that it was a normal transaction. 
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
My question for the minister is why.  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):
We have created some wonderful partnerships. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):
This is yet another example of a boondoggle in the Prime Minister's riding.  
But first, what is needed- 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, let us be clear. 
This is what we are accusing her of.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):
The financial experts said that the project was not cost effective.  
I will simply say that since 1994-95 we have reorganized our programs. 
We intervene on the basis of the real needs of all regions. 
The hon. member for Macleod.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I will repeat it in English. 
It is quite simple. 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Canadian Alliance):
My question is simple. 
Why is the government wasting taxpayer dollars to fund environmental disasters?  
Mr. Bob Speller (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade Lib.):
It will report on this issue by May 15. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, sure they have rules. 
The problem is that they break them all the time. 
That is the problem. 
Once again my question is very simple. 
Mr. Bob Speller (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade Lib.):
The hon. parliamentary secretary has the floor if he wishes to use it.  
We take them very seriously. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
In short, it is responding to the needs of a consultative- 
The hon. member for Calgary East.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Bob Speller (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade Lib.):
The hon. member for Calgary East.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):
Perhaps the Prime Minister can answer.  
Mr. Bob Speller (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade Lib.):
They report to this parliament.  
The Government of Canada is sending that message.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
We want to know why the minister is not taking action in these cases. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
What we are looking at in Canada today is private health care.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Mr. Speaker, here is a cute little story.  
The Canada Lands Company owned a large industrial lot in Brampton. 
This was a 30-acre lot. 
It decided to sell it for $1.7 million. 
One month later, it was worth $3 million more.  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
I believe Canadians got- 
The hon. member for Richmond-Arthabaska.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
This is a new beginning for labour and management relations in Canada Post. 
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank His Worship for the question.  
Hon. David M. Collenette:
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Bob Speller (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade Lib.):
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
It is true, and I believe the hon. member agrees.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is important to understand the commercial fishery of Newfoundland.  
That is a 148% increase in the time that we have been in power. 
Liberal times are good times.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Mr. Speaker, Canada's wharfs have been neglected by the government for years.  
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
I will look at the blues to see what was said. 
STANDING COMMITTEE ON CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION-SPEAKER'S RULING 
It is further stated on the same page: 
I invite the hon. member for London North Centre to put his motion.  
Mr. Joe Fontana (London North Centre, Lib.):
On behalf of myself and the members of the committee, I move: 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):
It does seem odd to me. 
It seems to me that it does require a motion to move in camera. 
That will be answered when we are in committee.  
There have been discussions that- 
We will wait for that. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I have some questions that I would like to put. 
There are some very interesting points which should be answered and should be responded to.  
I can assure you, Mr. Speaker that did not happen in this case. 
Somehow that does not seem like anything they are particularly concerned about.  
They could only have been leaked by Liberal members. 
We have done this time and again. 
They routinely leak public documents. 
Most of the budget was leaked. 
This has become completely routine, and I do not think that is right.  
Nor did I have any intention of doing anything wrong. 
That is the last thing I would do.  
I respect that, Mr. Speaker. 
I am interested in hearing the committee explain this. 
It is a very interesting contradiction, and I am looking forward to that.  
I take the decision of the committee on matters like that quite seriously.  
I do not find that to be a laughing matter. 
I take that as a serious matter.  
I would suggest very little to none. 
Through that method public reaction can come against the government. 
That seems to be the only way that we can have an effect. 
Let us look at the issue of time allocation. 
It is approaching 60 times.  
A majority of cases.  
This has become absolutely routine. 
Debate ended after a very few hours. 
It is completely unacceptable. 
This has become routine. 
Look at the relative importance of these two issues. 
What was my great crime? 
I believe I was doing nothing wrong. 
That is my great crime.  
Look at the relative importance of the two wrongdoings here. 
At the time I believed there was not. 
I made a point of that in a way which could not be easily forgotten. 
Mr. Speaker, I fully respect your decision. 
There are many more points I could make. 
It just was not working. 
With the new chair we had a committee which I thought functioned quite well. 
Mr. Speaker, you know what happened this summer. 
About 600 people came into the country illegally by boat. 
Witnesses came from across the country to deal with this extremely important issue. 
That assurance was given.  
So there we were. 
The new act was not put together in a few weeks. 
How must they feel knowing that they have been used by the committee? 
The legislation was in place before the committee even reported.  
They cared enough that they came and they spoke. 
I listened to them. 
Other committee members listened to them. 
They were completely ignored. 
How must they feel?  
The committee is functioning poorly now. 
At the previous meetings we were not even discussing a draft document. 
In other words it discussed the issue in secret. 
I am looking in particular for a response from the chair of the committee. 
What else could be more important than that? 
I appreciate having had the time to present my views. 
I look forward to hearing the views of other members.  
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker indicated exactly that in his ruling.  
It was without any concern for his duty and his responsibility. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for that question. 
She again expresses the concern about the document marked confidential.  
I explained why I believe the document was not confidential. 
The committee had improperly gone in camera. 
Why did she not do that? 
Unfortunately I was not at that meeting. 
I was away on other matters of parliamentary business.  
She talked about my not being at some of the meetings. 
I have taken part in most of the meetings of the committee. 
I am going to have no part of it. 
I am going to respect the rules of the committee. 
We are still on questions and comments of the hon. member for Lakeland.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I have a very simple question.  
He said that was decided by a majority vote of the committee. 
I am asking him to confirm that was the case. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question. 
There was no vote held to have the committee go in camera. 
All of the members of the committee allowed it to happen. 
I brought the improper procedure before the committee. 
The chair continued to call it an in camera meeting. 
That is when I decided it was improper. 
The rules were not being respected. 
That was my decision at the time. 
It was a decision which I made considering the evidence before me. 
I would suggest that it was a good decision. 
I would be interested to hear from other members of the committee. 
We cannot hold a vote when there is no quorum. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to follow up on the member's remarks.  
Would that not have satisfied the member?  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
Mr. Speaker, what the member says is absolutely incorrect. 
How could I have left? 
There was never any talk of such a motion. 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I heard you say that.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I made it very clear that I respect your ruling. 
I do not see a contradiction.  
That is not uncommon.  
No, that is not uncommon. 
He thinks what he did was right.  
There are a couple of basic principles here. 
This obviously was not the first issue we have dealt with. 
He was dedicated and worked hard. 
We had a long debate over the use of the term illegal. 
This member considers all refugees to be illegal. 
I could accept it if he was willing to stand and say ``Mr. 
If we want to talk about denigrating the democratic process, what does it do? 
The reason for that is that we are unable to sit on all the committees. 
We have to share the workloads and spread the responsibility.  
We do that before we go public with it. 
The member knows that but he continues to try to defend the indefensible.  
What word in there does he not understand? 
Confidential means it is confidential. 
It cannot be reported to the public until it has been reported to the House. 
It is a very difficult concept. 
Can anyone imagine the audacity? 
I would not have had a problem with that. 
The committee could have voted on it. 
He did not do that. 
The member agreed not to tape record the proceedings and agreed with that suggestion. 
All of this was agreed to before any press conference was held.  
I will now deal with that issue. 
Why would that happen? 
The member said that it was for approval. 
In reality it was for input. 
That is not wrong. 
It only makes sense to do that.  
Let me tell the House why it was embarrassingly obvious that it was incomplete. 
The hon. member did not even have the sense to release the final report. 
It is truly hard to understand.  
That member can call for a recorded vote. 
I made a mistake''.  
It would be absolutely brilliant to hear that from that member. 
I highly doubt that we will. 
Instead he rose to argue his case. 
He does not care what the Speaker said. 
He does not care what committee members said. 
He does not care about the opposition. 
Mr. Speaker, he just does not care.  
I still do not like the report. 
I still do not think you did the right job. 
I still do not like the minister''-whatever. 
I understand and respect all of that. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
Mr. Speaker, this member is truly very talented. 
His version of what happened at committee is suspect at best. 
That was my understanding.  
I believe that is what he said.  
That I will find out. 
I will look over Hansard later. 
I want to show no disrespect for the Speaker. 
The memory of the member who has just spoken is very interesting. 
The chair decided to go in camera to discuss that. 
That is what really happened at that meeting.  
The member is very talented, but not very factual. 
I think that would be beneficial.  
I can be as accurate as the member wants.  
They said it was a discussion of the draft report. 
It is a bit flimsy.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
Mr. Speaker, really, this is almost silly. 
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my colleague knows that I am a member of the committee. 
My colleague also knows that I have a recollection of what took place.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
The meetings are recorded anyway. 
Everything we do and say in committee is recorded. 
It is made available in the record.  
Boy, that is pretty scary.  
Scary is not the right word. 
As it was, he was no help at all.  
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
This document summarized what the witnesses had had to say. 
This document contained no potential recommendations. 
I quote my statement of March 2: 
I questioned the committee and I expressed my astonishment.  
Again, I am quoting the transcript. 
This is my interpretation or my version of these events. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Perhaps you could provide some clarification.  
This debate is redundant. 
The member might be a little confused. 
He thinks it is going back to the immigration committee.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Speaker ruled that in fact there was. 
Subsequently this debate has to do with that.  
The Chair has no recourse other than to keep us in this debate. 
Theoretically we could debate this for two or three weeks.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a very brief comment.  
That is very sad.  
The Speaker made a final determination that there has been a breach of privilege. 
Let me state one principle. 
That is my contribution to this debate at this point. 
With respect to mistakes, two wrongs do not make a right.  
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has said that it is important to follow the rules. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):
I believe that to be true.  
We know that is true. 
I have a direct question for the Bloc critic. 
He commented on the need to respect the rules.  
I want to ask him questions about the committee respecting the rules. 
I said so, and expressed my wishes for this in my statement on March 2. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Joe Fontana (London North Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I look forward to perhaps a little debate here. 
Old name, new name; it is the same old stuff.  
It is unfortunate that he does not appreciate what the chair said. 
I look forward to the opportunity of putting that case to the committee.  
That is the issue. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Was a vote held or not? 
No, no vote was held on that issue.  
However, my interpretation is that the committee was sitting in camera. 
My understanding is that the committee was working in camera regarding this issue.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):
The issue before us this afternoon is a very serious one. 
The member for London North Centre moved: 
If we vote against it then it is the end of the matter. 
If the committee finds the member not guilty then it will so recommend. 
It is a long, drawn out process.  
There is no question or debate on that part. 
It is very interesting. 
I know the Speaker made the ruling. 
We need some place of final authority. 
We may not always like it. 
I think this member has expressed his frustrations in the committee. 
I have experienced those same frustrations. 
I remember one occasion when I was substituting in the committee. 
I was substituting in committee. 
It was late at night. 
It was one of those bills that the Liberals thought they had to get through. 
It was probably 10.30 or 11 o'clock at night. 
My colleague and I said yes and no one said anything else.  
You know the rules, Mr. Speaker. 
As I recall, in our motion we were trying to amend a particular clause. 
He said ``I just did''.  
We must remember that this was a Liberal chairman of the committee. 
Every organization in this country is based on democracy. 
I objected, and I objected louder and louder. 
I would not let him off the hook.  
By then the Liberals had awakened. 
There were one or two more of them than the rest of us. 
I related the story. 
That was the end of the matter.  
He did not do that. 
He is the best chairman I have ever seen.  
Mr. Speaker, I have just related the story. 
I was there, the member was not. 
I want to talk about the issue that we have before us.  
It is on issues like this on which democracy is trampled by a majority government. 
I say this as kindly as I can to Liberal members. 
They have an obligation, as do you, Mr. Speaker, to preserve the democratic process. 
However, I have a very serious question to pose. 
No other member even knew about it, except for the chairman of the committee.  
This time that is not the way it is.  
That is the only difference.  
The last budget is a perfect example. 
There are no repercussions any more. 
Government members won the election. 
I have had conversations with people. 
There is no respect for it. 
So I said to some people that when we have- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
Mr. Speaker, please stop your stopwatch.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
I view that simply as a tactic to reduce my speaking time.  
I plead for better democracy. 
That the motion be amended by deleting the word ``premature''.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The amendment is in order. 
Debate is on the amendment.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Something came before it was ready. 
Mr. Speaker, I can answer that question. 
That is exactly why it was removed. 
I will answer his question. 
Do I understand the word premature? 
Mr. Joe Fontana (London North Centre, Lib.):
The Speaker has already ruled that there was a prima facie case of privilege. 
We were discussing options. 
We were discussing a summary of what the witnesses said. 
We must respect one another. 
We cannot sit on every committee. 
We tried to point out that was not the case. 
It was not the case. 
I hope that is the case.  
Some members are saying those are the rules of the House. 
We are trying to be helpful here. 
We are trying to learn from one another. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to formally withdraw my motion. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Speaking for the Chair, it would be an elegant way to move beyond this.  
Therefore I am not moving that my motion be removed.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I have presented the situation as I see it. 
I have pointed out some concerns I have with the way the committee is operating. 
I have also heard the ruling of the Speaker. 
Because of that ruling by the Speaker, I do apologize. 
I would never intentionally breach the rules of this House. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am losing track of to whom I am directing the question. 
Is it the hon. member for Elk Island?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for London North Centre was on debate. 
I do not know how we could come to any other conclusion.  
Does the hon. member share that view? 
Is this simply an argument of the ends justifying the means?  
This is a very important issue. 
I invited him to attend the meetings. 
He refused to participate any further in the meetings.  
The ends do not justify the means. 
To do so a member would find himself in breach of privileges. 
This kind of action is not to be condoned at all. 
We are to respect the rules of the House. 
That is what democracy is all about. 
The ends do not justify the means. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
That is exactly where we are right now. 
It just says the motion has usually been withdrawn. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I do not believe that is so. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
For the time being, the debate is still on the motion before the House.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):
Madam Speaker, I believe the debate is now on the amendment.  
It is my pleasure to rise and debate this issue. 
He has done the right thing. 
I will explain exactly what I mean. 
It was to be discussed publicly. 
What did it do? 
It did not vote to go in camera, it just went in camera. 
The chair said ``We are in camera now''. 
Mr. Speaker rose and said ``That is the way it is in committees. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am afraid that is debate not a point of order.  
Madam Speaker, in terms of debate, there is a question of relevancy to the point. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
It is a point of debate. 
Let the debate continue.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
There is no question about that.  
I have already recounted what has happened to my colleague. 
The whip sits there- 
That is democracy Liberal style. 
If they do not, they will be punished. 
This was a Canadian heritage committee protecting Canadian heritage. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Hopefully between now and 5.30 the matter might be resolved.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
People keep interrupting me.  
There is no such thing as individual rights for members of parliament.  
Completely to the contrary, we have a situation where we see an elected dictatorship. 
I hate to use that term. 
We have rules in place that impede that.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The time is getting very close to a certain magical hour. 
I would therefore ask hon. members for unanimous consent to move the following motion. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
As members say, we can do anything by unanimous consent.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Why do I say before it was too late? 
It is very brief-only three pages long. 
It would be enormous for shipyard workers throughout Canada. 
It would be enormous for the Canadian shipbuilding industry. 
The federal government was given the privilege and the opportunity to govern. 
They are measures that should comprise part of the Canadian shipbuilding policy.  
The aim of this bill is reasonable. 
It could allow Canada to enjoy the same opportunities as our competitors.  
This problem has not just developed over this decade. 
I congratulate the member for putting forward the bill. 
I hope Liberal members will see the wisdom and the importance of supporting it.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We will do this with unanimous consent. 
I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
I understand that members may be excited to speak on this issue. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All parties have already had a number of speakers. 
We either have this before the House or we do not. 
We will do it or we will not.  
Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Fanshawe, Lib.):
Canadians are very clear. 
The policy instruments used by the federal government are modern instruments. 
I know that we have agreed to a four minute limit. 
Canadians simply do not want to return to those kinds of mistakes from the past.  
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):
We could do other things. 
We could do something at home. 
Those are things which we could do something about in our own backyard.  
The Canadian Alliance believes that there needs to be a healthy shipbuilding industry as well. 
Other countries are subsidizing their shipbuilding industries. 
Canada should not be the boy scouts in this kind of situation. 
We should not stand by when our industries are being severely affected. 
The agriculture and shipbuilding industries are severely disadvantaged. 
That would only take about 10 years.  
I hear a magpie from the other end of the House. 
I assume he will have his chance to talk sooner or later.  
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
We just had evidence of that earlier, once more. 
There are thousands and thousands of jobs at stake. 
The Canadian government must bring itself up to speed.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
I am very pleased to rise to speak in support of this bill. 
It prefers to do nothing, which is what it is bringing forward now. 
It is very curious that they have decided not to participate in the debate.  
The Prime Minister shrugs and says ``Higher taxes? 
Better jobs in the States? 
The same approach is taken when it comes to an important industry like shipbuilding. 
It is like the Liberal promises on all kinds of other issues. 
That is what we have come to expect from the Liberal government. 
Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Quebec East, BQ):
At one point, the industry was thriving in Canada. 
There is no wastage. 
Why not institute a similar program here in Canada? 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
That is old history. 
I have a little more history for the Liberals.  
The government continually misleads the general public. 
What does the government do? 
It ignores its own backbench members. 
It is absolutely scandalous.  
These people are not asking for handouts. 
They are asking for jobs, jobs that other countries have. 
Other governments support their workers and industry.  
It is an absolute disgrace.  
Tomorrow we are going to have a free vote on Bill C-213. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
I am truly grateful. 
That goes for Liberal members as well. 
They wanted a debate to be held.  
I appeal to the Liberal members. 
Unfortunately, I did not hear many members from the Vancouver region.  
Because, in 1993, there were 12,000 workers in Canada's shipyards. 
There are barely 3,000 now. 
Two great shipyards are facing closure.  
As for the tax measures, they come after construction. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
I will quote from Hansard . 
That would make the provincial tax on fuel in Ontario 29 cents. 
It is of course only 14.7 cents in total. 
This had nothing to do with my question.  
I wanted to know the government's plan. 
Canada has no such plan and no such action.  
I wrote a letter to the Prime Minister asking him if he had a plan. 
If he did not have a plan, I wanted to suggest one to him. 
He could undertake to facilitate an energy conservation component. 
He could toughen up the Competition Act. 
Mr. John Cannis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
This is indeed a problem that we are faced with today. 
He referred to regulations as well. 
They exhausted the research and brought the data forward. 
One of their main recommendations was to have an extensive study. 
That is why the Conference Board of Canada has been selected to address this issue.  
Let me point out three things the government has done. 
This is an inclusive process. 
It is not exclusive. 
We want to engage in this discussion and the findings, not disengage.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.23 p.m.)
