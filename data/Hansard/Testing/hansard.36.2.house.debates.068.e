The House met at 10 a.m. 
MEMBER FOR WENTWORTH-BURLINGTON-SPEAKER'S RULING 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, of course I respect your decision in this matter. 
I would just like to make two observations. 
Second, I would just like to make one comment. 
I do believe this arises from a legitimate misunderstanding. 
The answer is, yes. 
Is that what the question is?  
I do not quite understand your ruling. 
The bill is due to come up in the next few days. 
That was the question I thought the hon. member asked. 
The response is, yes.  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Joe Fontana (London North Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would ask for your guidance and your advice on this matter.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I thank the hon. member for London North Centre for his intervention. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
The petitioners urge the legislative assemblies across Canada to do likewise.

Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam, Lib.):
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have three petitions.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
CANADA POST CORPORATION ACT 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, PC):
I understand the frustration of the rural route couriers and I certainly support their efforts.  
Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I present a petition on behalf of my constituents. 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
ALLOTTED DAY-MANAGEMENT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ) moved: 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
This is a very concrete example.  
The only problem involves $251''. 
Yet, we were talking about $1 billion. 
She has a reactionary style of management.  
His answer was really significant: none. 
Of all the previous internal audits, none had led to a full blown investigation. 
That is when everything was done wrong. 
There is no investigation, nothing.  
This is why a public inquiry is necessary.  
We wondered why the government had this attitude. 
We have seen the deficits they created. 
As we can see, they decided to turn on the tap. 
I will conclude with the example involving the minister's riding. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
I reject that premise. 
We are also entitled to expect that democracy will be respected.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Continuing with questions and comments.  
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, PC):
Thank you, Mr. Speaker- 
I had not finished my speech.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
No. We must now move to another question. 
I thank my colleague from the Bloc. 
If they could only keep quiet, perhaps I could make my comments. 
This certainly shows a serious lack of respect on their part. 
Mr. Speaker, have these chatterboxes shut up.  
This is what departmental memos are saying.  
It contains overwhelming evidence, and we can table it. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
We know full well that, from the very beginning, she tried to minimize the problem. 
People sometimes tell children that they are setting a bad example. 
Problems were found in 37 of the 459 files sampled. 
The minister tried to hide the facts and that is what concerns us. 
That was on December 16. 
However, she was aware of the auditor general's report. 
She knew about the mismanagement at HRDC.  
She knew that grants had been awarded for partisan purposes. 
I want to come back to the criteria in relation to the pockets of poverty. 
Numerous instances have been uncovered. 
These people were forced to resign because they had exposed the problem. 
The same thing happens to us here, when we raise a problem. 
We could also mention other investigations. 
The Fugere affair is another case in point. 
Mr. Fugere's lobbying activities were denounced. 
Once again, no invoice has been produced.  
I want to get back to the auditor general. 
He has expressed great concern about the mismanagement at Human Resources Development Canada. 
We are not the ones saying this, the auditor general is. 
He takes administrative audits seriously. 
The auditor general expressed frustration about the general administrative situation. 
According to him, there are other shortcomings. 
Again, we are not the ones saying this, the auditor general is. 
He has said that something is going on in HRDC. 
As a woman, I know what settling it outside means. 
I am going to stay here, and I am going to speak out here. 
I would like to move an amendment to my colleague's motion. 
The door has been opened somewhat, but I would like to open it wider. 
That the motion be amended by adding after the word ``condemn'' the following: 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
At one point she said that words failed her. 
Words should fail her, because what she was doing was in effect creating myths. 
Let me tell the House why.  
This motion is frivolous and vexatious. 
Why do I say that? 
This fact they conveniently leave out of their fine words.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The amendment is in order.  
Is the auditor general's report a myth?  
Why do we want all these programs to be clarified? 
Because we want all communities to benefit from them.  
Where has all that money gone? 
Mr. Gerard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):
The Liberals brag about being good managers. 
Today, we are faced with a scandal. 
The current minister is now responsible. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I will recognize the hon. member for Quebec for a short response.  
This is one of our responsibilities.  
We do have to look at how that department is managed. 
It is urgent to shed light on HRDC's management process.  
We are not satisfied with the minister's replies. 
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We came up with an action plan to address it.  
We did not dream up the action plan. 
I am trying to put it into perspective. 
That is 1/180 of the department's budget. 
That is 1/360 of the Government of Canada's budget. 
It has been said that we try to hide things. 
They almost reach to the ceiling. 
They have phoned me back with questions. 
It has been said that there was a lot of money spent in 1997. 
If we compare 1996 with 1999 we will say that it has gone down. 
It was not for partisan purposes. 
That is a figment of the Bloc Quebecois' imagination.  
I want to be clear. 
We are not talking about $1 billion. 
We have called it back and it has arrived. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Accordingly, one cannot really use those amounts for partisan purposes.  
We will know what they are up to with public spending.  
However, we want to shed some light on this scandal. 
Only 19 cases are mentioned. 
This is the issue we have to deal with. 
Opposition parties are doing their duty when they ask- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sorry to interrupt.  
Mr. Speaker, we know that a billion dollars is a lot of money. 
As for the point that we do not get it, it is not true. 
We do get it. 
I try to recruit them to the causes we believe in together.  
It is strengthening the right wing in the country as personified by the National Post . 
I do not understand why the Bloc Quebecois is co-operating with that.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, there is a huge scandal going on at HRDC at the moment. 
It is unprecedented in Canada's political history. 
Why not reveal all on the files we are asking about?  
He probably did not know about Gerda Munsinger. 
We have a problem of management in our grants and contributions. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
In any event, who was their lead speaker? 
It was the separatist, Mr. Biron. 
The member for Frontenac-Megantic talked about scandal. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I insist that you ask this member to withdraw his remarks. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I want to get to some of the facts. 
And the member for Elk Island sits and bellows across the aisle. 
There he sits calling people liars.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would ask you to ask the member to stick to the debate. 
They say we flirt with the Reformers. 
They applauded the Reformers, but those two were going on hand in hand.  
This sort of thing can be said for a long time- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
There will be a fair amount of debate going back and forth. 
We will all have to develop thicker skins.  
I know the kind of thorough work he is prepared to do. 
He will do it and rightfully so on behalf of the taxpayers of Canada. 
His report will come out in the fall. 
What will his report say? 
So should the bellowing member by the way. 
They should make sure they know what they are talking about.  
It is really shameful. 
There are areas of high unemployment in Quebec. 
There are areas of high unemployment in the east. 
There are areas of high unemployment in the west. 
Instead they seem intent on distorting the facts and that is too bad.  
Canadians are very smart people. 
They see through that kind of political posturing. 
Canadians see through it. 
Canadians reject that kind of right-wing nonsense. 
They want absolutely no part of it.  
I thought the Bloc was more progressive than that. 
I thought the Bloc had a better social conscience. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That is certainly not a point of order.  
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member talks about dogs. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am tired of hearing this sort of thing. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We have got to stop barking at each other.  
I thought they were good politicians. 
It seems to me she should develop a bit of a thicker skin.  
These values are intrinsic to the very core of Canada.  
We were speaking of dogs a minute ago. 
Blessfully and thankfully, we on the government side do.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We have several members who wish to ask questions. 
We will keep the question to one minute and one minute for the response.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity to speak. 
The member opposite did not address the motion. 
The debate is not on whether or not some of the programs are good. 
Some are, some are not. 
The debate is about the lack of accountability.  
I am amazed that the member did not see fit to address the real question. 
That is mismanagement of the greatest form.  
That is what we are trying to address. 
We will continue to do that. 
Mr. Speaker, I do not need a lecture from the member opposite. 
I was at the table when the auditor general's report came out. 
I was vice-chairman at that time. 
I know full well what the auditor general reported. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to get back to this morning's motion. 
Essentially, this motion recommends ``the creation of an independent public commission of inquiry''.  
What is worse is that 37 were extremely problematic. 
This was on the news last night. 
He should be a little more careful in terms of what he says.  
He should be celebrating that.  
The auditor general is an officer of the House. 
What do the Reformers do? 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
The government's answer to accountability is damage control. 
Where there is a dictatorship there are politicians directing the police. 
The solicitor general of the day said: 
I asked the following question on September 24, 1998: 
There is no level of inquiry. 
That is what the public complaints commission can look into. 
It is strictly a snow job that the solicitor general is doing- 
The solicitor general again said: 
I quote the Prime Minister, who said: 
I must say that Commissioner Ted Hughes has a tremendous task ahead of him. 
However, forget that, the commissioner is trying to do his job. 
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
The Liberals have great difficulty telling what is non-partisan. 
I think that, if he could eliminate us, he would do it in a flash.  
That is all we want. 
Priorities will be identified later.  
These audits identified persistent shortcomings.  
He further wrote, and I quote: 
Mr. Speaker, our party will be supporting the motion for the reasons I stated. 
Clearly there must be a full independent public inquiry into this affair.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
That is not the issue. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
That ought not to be happening in a liberal democracy under the rule of law.  
We have uncovered more and more information as the weeks have gone by. 
Some members may recall having seen a graph. 
I find this to be really quite reprehensible.  
There is further evidence. 
This is more political interference.  
I am sure that is just a coincidence. 
There was no political pressure. 
If members buy that, I have a bridge in Brooklyn for them.  
Canadians do not buy that kind of evasion. 
We see this pattern over and over again. 
I am talking about senior ministers' ridings and the Prime Minister's riding. 
Grants have been forced to be approved and announced immediately before election time. 
Not because these programs create jobs. 
We hope that he will respond. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
He seems to be indicating that the programs are not creating jobs. 
My question is for the hon. member from the Reform Party. 
I would like him to be somewhat clearer than his colleague.  
It is not the program that should be criticized, but its management. 
We would like to get to the bottom of this. 
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
Where would he draw the line? 
Mr. Speaker, I am not addressing grants for the severely disabled. 
I worked for organizations raising money for the severely disabled. 
However, that is not what we are talking about. 
Those are two entirely separate issues and we ought not to confuse them.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
What was needed, supposedly, was something to try to get some jobs back.  
I put questions twice in a row to my Reform colleagues. 
This is not normal. 
We have to look into this.  
Is this not an issue that should be looked into?  
We are sick and tired of these lies that are offered up day after day. 
Is the Prime Minister afraid of the truth? 
This sort of thing looks bad. 
It is the sort of thing that is going to lose us programs. 
These things have to stop. 
It is high time this matter was cleared up once and for all. 
Today, the Reform Party would like that program eliminated. 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas-Charlottenburgh, Lib.):
Today this distribution centre in Cornwall has around 250 workers.  
This is a case in point.  
It could have gone to Toronto.  
The hon. member says the company could have gone to Toronto. 
It does not matter, that is Canadian.  
What is important is that we are creating jobs''. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague the member for Acadie-Bathurst for his remarks.  
It is a very limited format. 
The deputy minister was there for a couple of hours. 
A member gets one or two questions. 
The limits of that format really prescribe that we will not get at the truth.  
We support the motion.  
We in the NDP philosophically have always strongly supported job development programs. 
The marketplace is the greatest instrument of inequality in the country. 
What have Reformers been doing? 
We have a very different view and perspective on the issue. 
The Liberals have played right into the hands of the Reform Party. 
One way to do that is through a public inquiry.  
What would a public inquiry do? 
The first is administration. 
Accounting was not done. 
It is the single largest federal government department. 
That would be the first major issue in terms of a public inquiry. 
That is the political nature of the grants and contributions.  
We are all elected representatives. 
We are political creatures. 
I have been involved in politics for 25 years. 
That is another reason an independent public inquiry is needed.  
We in the NDP want to know exactly what are the rules. 
I asked Mr. Cappe that a few minutes ago in the committee. 
We have got to get to the bottom of that.  
We said fine, if that was the rule we could live by that. 
Then we found out that in other areas exceptions were made. 
Warning bells went off in my head when I heard that.  
We want there to be clear rules. 
We want there to be an end to the politicization. 
We also want to get at some questions of where public funds should go. 
I say that it is a matter of who gets the money.  
That is the question. 
Why would we support a program that puts other businesses out of work? 
There are some very major questions.  
At the end of the day we represent the Canadian public. 
It is the government's duty to be accountable.  
We support the motion. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
We heard the minister say it existed for a period of time. 
My question is clear and I want the hon. member to answer. 
I think this is important. 
Then we heard about pockets that exist. 
This is what we want to get clear. 
We want to have fair rules for everybody. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I really appreciated the remarks by my colleague from Vancouver East. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question from my hon. colleague. 
If this is happening in HRDC, where else is this taking place? 
For that very reason alone, an independent public inquiry is required.  
We support the motion on that basis.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
The government has tried to downplay what has happened in HRDC. 
Was that a mistake? 
Obviously, on our part, it was not. 
This was supposed to be buried underneath the carpet. 
We certainly were not aware that there was an audit going on. 
It did well in keeping us in the dark. 
When I called for my copy, I received it. 
I did not destroy it. 
Is that not a shame? 
I received the second cover sheet. 
The date has been deleted. 
This is a major cover-up. 
This is the biggest scandal in Canadian history. 
From the very beginning everything that has gone on has been tainted. 
The government has tried to cover up important information from the Canadian taxpayer.  
Every opposition party goes through it. 
We have been working hard to try to get to the truth. 
We even asked for the audits for 1991 and 1994. 
Why have we not received anything yet? 
Let me tell you why.  
Cheques get to Shawinigan faster than that.  
Canada is a bilingual country. 
I think we all agree on that. 
It took nine years to translate them.  
They had not been translated into French. 
It is absolutely incredible. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien:
Shame on all of you.  
Forget the application, it is not needed. 
Many files that were opened did not even have an application. 
As a matter of fact some of the files were empty. 
I am talking about billions of dollars.  
The premiers of Canada were in Quebec City demanding- 
Whatever the provinces say does not matter to the government. 
The Liberal government in Ottawa turned a blind eye and closed its ears. 
It is absolutely unbelievable.  
The member says baloney. 
The minister of health certainly does not say baloney. 
It represents three days of hospital care for New Brunswick. 
Will that fix the problem?  
We all hear about the privatization of health care. 
It is even forcing people to go to other countries for care. 
What exactly are Canadian taxpayers looking for today? 
Canadian taxpayers are looking for transparency. 
We have had the Prime Minister flip-flopping in the House of Commons. 
How can we believe this? 
I find this absolutely incredible. 
We have every right to be upset here in the House. 
It does not make any sense. 
Nobody knows what is going on, and even the minister knows nothing at all. 
And what is going on here is not nice.  
I am a father of two. 
What am I doing here today? 
What we are trying to do here is to protect that federation.  
We heard the testimony of Mel Cappe. 
I had the opportunity to ask him questions. 
What have they done right from the start? 
What are the Liberals up to? 
They do not know what is going on.  
Mr. Cappe said he did not know. 
I asked him if it was not his duty to be informed. 
His response was no. 
It was not his duty to know what was going on. 
That is what we were told, here in the House. 
The government is out of touch. 
The government is arrogant, but the HRDC scandal will stick. 
I am anxious to see when the Prime Minister will call the next election. 
The hard earned money of Canadians has been ripped off. 
Canadians pay heavy taxes. 
Canadians work hard for their money. 
Canadians want their money to be well invested. 
Their money has not been well invested. 
Their money has been mismanaged. 
It is a lot of money.  
Job creation has not been going on in the government. 
In turn, we will be supporting the motion by my colleague from the Bloc.  
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia, Lib.):
The hon. member sounds to me a bit frustrated. 
He did not touch Cappe. 
Mr. Cappe performed extremely well. 
This is comments and questions. 
The minister has said on a number of occasions that they have a management problem. 
The more mud they can throw, the better for them. 
They will not fall for it.  
Mr. Speaker, I have to comment. 
I am glad the hon. member was at committee. 
It is the first time that I have seen him there. 
I have never seen him there before.  
I am not a member.  
That is probably why. 
It is obviously not important to the government. 
It would rather see this swept under the carpet, and quickly. 
It is not going to be swept under the carpet.  
We are concerned and Canadians are concerned about where the money went.  
Hopefully the hon. member will ask the Prime Minister to name him to the committee. 
Then we will see how productive he can be.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
He has a very good reputation in New Brunswick. 
The Prime Minister mentioned 37 cases. 
There are now 19 files under investigation by the RCMP. 
Today, 19 cases are under investigation by the RCMP. 
I do not expect the Liberals to do so. 
Yes we will vote together and hope that we will bring down the government.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
I would like to put a question to him. 
I wonder whether my colleague would support an update of this law.  
I would like to congratulate my colleague.  
Often, we can wait months, or even years.  
We rarely get all we asked for. 
I would indeed be pleased to review this law at some point. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It is a tough road.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Obviously, the minister received a very bad legacy from her predecessor. 
How could the minister imagine for one moment that we believe her? 
Listen carefully, you will be enlightened.  
Placeteco is a manufacturer of plastic casts. 
What did Mr. Gauthier do with his $1 million? 
He paid off a loan at the National Bank, Placeteco's main creditor. 
That kind of behaviour is called misappropriation of funds.  
Let us not be naive. 
The Prime Minister prides himself on being a good member of parliament. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
According to observers, this scandal might involve an amount of up to $3 billion. 
This is money that has allegedly been handed out here and there.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Frontenac-Megantic.  
Another investigation by someone from Toronto, whom she probably knew very well. 
Perhaps it was a friend of the government, who knows? 
Now the Rosemont affair is in the hands of the RCMP.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
He will investigate it in a very meaningful way. 
The HRDC committee is also doing it, as is the minister.  
``Persistent'' is the term used by the auditor general.  
The member should stop giving me this fancy footwork about the auditor general. 
It all depends on what the government will do with the auditor general's reports. 
We will use the money kept in Toronto when we really need it. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Instead, they looked the other way. 
But there is more to tell. 
Where is that company located? 
In Saint-Elie-de-Caxton.  
Who is Confections Saint-Elie? 
The grant received with the help of Mr. Chretien allowed us to do that''.  
This is from the president of the company called Confections Saint-Elie. 
This is completely unacceptable.  
What became of the money? 
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
We have the committee process, as was alluded to by my hon. colleague from Winnipeg. 
When I hear duplicitous comments from the Bloc opposite, it really is outrageous. 
I was interested in reading Le Soleil not so very long ago- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sorry but time flies.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We want an independent inquiry.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and Youth), Lib.):
That is one of the advantages of being part of the Canadian system. 
As a result, we have been successful. 
It is a good plan and it is a solid plan. 
It includes improved reviews of administrative procedures. 
The plan will work, but we must give it time to work.  
First, politics is not the criteria by which we determine HRDC funding. 
The money goes where it is most needed. 
The people of that province need federal program support. 
The unemployment rate in Quebec in 1997 was 11.4%. 
The numbers speak for themselves. 
When we look at the facts it is pretty hard to see any political favouritism. 
Again, probably that is a big waste of time and money. 
It is not only that, but it is a bit like reinventing the wheel. 
HRDC will be an active participant.  
That committee includes members from all parties in the House. 
The committee can call the witnesses it feels would add useful information. 
After seven years in that department I know those individuals. 
They believe in these programs. 
That is what HRDC is doing.  
It seems however that not too many MPs are really serious about getting the facts. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. secretary of state.  
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:
There is clearly no need for the inquiry the motion proposes.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
I do not expect her to explain that away.  
A couple of things really bother me. 
Yet the government will not move. 
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:
In turn that program allowed over 25,000 aboriginal people to get jobs. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:
There were 10,000 pages of hard copy.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would ask the minister to take back her words. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It is hardly a point of order.  
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:
They are on the presiding committee. 
We are making a concerted effort to have all the information available to them. 
How they use it is entirely up to them.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:
I would like to have more specific references than that. 
There is a process that is fairly public. 
We are not hiding behind anything. 
There is the information. 
How they use it and if they use it is entirely up to them.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Her autobiography would be a huge volume.  
THE LATE LYAL HOLMES 
Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my good friend Lyal Holmes passed away on March 16. 
My heart goes out to his loved ones and his friends.  
1ST BATTALION ROYAL CANADIAN REGIMENT 
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the greatest atrocity of war is the suffering of innocent children. 
She had to be resuscitated twice, but her condition eventually stabilized.  
Once again our Canadian heroes have gone above and beyond their duty. 
Their efforts to mend these shattered lives bring great pride to our country, Canada.  
RIDING OF SAINT-MAURICE 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay-Boundary-Okanagan, Ref.):
Many prominent people are starting to realize the error that parliament has made. 
We support aboriginal self-government, but at a municipal level.  
Inclusion of that provision was a mistake. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Instead, they chose not to ask even one question about this all important issue.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Will the Quebec federal Liberals take notice of this message from the coalition? 
There is still time. 
Parliamentarians must refuse to play the Reform game. 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
For 30 years, Alex Pauk has been championing the cause of new music in Canada.  
This is an award that is well deserved.  
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
The Pronghorns were led by pride of Magrath, Danny Balderson. 
LIBERAL PARTY OF CANADA 
Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
The hon. member for Halifax West.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Subsequently, Canada was one of the first countries to show its support.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the Liberal government has done a fine job ignoring the reserves. 
What would Canadians have done without the reserve forces in these situations?  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
I am a dog that gnaws his bone, 
I couch and gnaw it all alone.  
A time will come, which is not yet, 
When I'll bite him by whom I'm bit.  
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
When the last child cries for a crust of bread 
When the last man dies for just words that he said 
When there's shelter over the poorest head 
Then we shall be free 
When the last thing we notice is the colour of skin 
And the first thing we look for is the beauty within 
When the skies and the oceans are clean again 
Then we shall be free 
There is no question that racism exists in Canada. 
We have embarked upon a new millennium. 
Let us all continue in the fight to end it.  
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
It is also a new season. 
Spring is upon us. 
It is with this optimism that I would like to share these words of prayer. 
In my first language I would like to say: 
Member spoke in Cree and provided the following translation: ] 
In the Creator's name, may we live in respect.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
How does the minister explain this contradiction?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
This morning Mel Cappe blew her cover on that subject.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
That is not the view on this side of the House.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
My question is, who should Canadians believe?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, talk about trickle down. 
Today Mel Cappe blew the lid off her excuses. 
We would like to know today who is telling the truth.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
There are two different stories here and Canadians deserve an answer. 
Who should we believe?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
These were consistent with the transitional jobs fund program.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
If the minister wishes to respond, she may.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let me reiterate the facts. 
In the early going there were issues and problems at Placeteco. 
There were 64 people employed there. 
Over the course of time there were upwards of 135 people working for this company. 
Today there are 78 people working there and there are prospects for increased opportunity.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Why such a difference in the way the two files are being handled?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have looked at these files. 
I have made that public in this House on a number of occasions.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
They have serious questions. 
When will the government respond?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the first thing is that we should have a law. 
The members of the opposition in the Liberal Party are strongly opposing the bill. 
I presume that the members of the NDP are also opposing it.  
We will wait for the result. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, while the government dithers, Klein privatizes. 
Now we have the health minister who is shadow boxing with Ralph Klein. 
These are supposed to be the two flowers of the federal cabinet.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
I think the minister has some explaining to do.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The hon. member talks about credibility. 
The hon. member for Calgary-Nose Hill.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let us review the facts again.  
I would ask the hon. member what she would have had us do, nothing? 
Take the money back? 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Who are we supposed to believe, Canada's top public servant or the politician?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Many of them were ridings of the Reform Party.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I categorically reject the assertions of the hon. member. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
That is the minister's explanation.  
The question is in order. 
The Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The Government of Quebec supported these undertakings. 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
That is no interest and no payments for up to 55 years. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
It is a very fine institution that has actually made money year after year. 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, here is a case in point. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the EDC makes money from the loans it makes. 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the conference board has existed since 1954. 
It is made up of about one hundred members. 
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we recognized Mr. Parsons' efforts in a number of ways.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Why is this Liberal government hiding the details?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let me be very clear. 
The auditor general has access to the board of directors' minutes- 
We will hear the minister.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
Mr. Speaker, some people really do not like good news in the House.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
What is the government hiding, another get rich scheme for Liberal cronies?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
I would invite the hon. minister to be very judicious in his choice of words.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
Mr. Speaker, Canadians have the right to know. 
Let me be clear for the seven year old Reform Party. 
The EDC does not give out money or subsidies. 
That is what it does.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister could not have been clearer. 
In fact, the evidence is that it will not. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
The hon. Minister of Health.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
However, Premier Klein's challenges go far beyond me. 
We hope that Premier Klein will listen to the people of Alberta. 
Perhaps he might decide to withdraw the legislation.  
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
High interest rates mean higher debt service charges. 
It is very simple. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I can hardly believe my ears. 
The hon. member is talking about high interest rates. 
This is a different country from the one we took over in 1993. 
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Revenue.  
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for his very important question.  
We all remember that we launched the agency last November 1. 
The aim and goal was to provide the Canadian population with better services. 
That is good Liberal government. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Let us see what a fine institution it really is. 
China's Three Gorges Dam is built on an earthquake fault line. 
It was shunned for funding by both the U.S. government and the World Bank.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let us be clear about this deal. 
It is not the only institution. 
Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):
The committee wonders if that is acceptable.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the caucus committee recommended that we undertake such a study. 
We are convinced that, based on facts, better political approaches can be found.  
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
The minister is responsible for economic development in the north. 
Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
We think it is important to work on economic development for northerners. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
STANDING COMMITTEE ON CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION 
I would now invite the hon. member for Lakeland to do so. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
I will begin my statement by quoting from the constitution of our country. 
The committee did not make the decision. 
The chair made the decision unilaterally. 
That is what the discussion was on.  
There was no apparent reason other than political considerations. 
After all, all the witnesses were heard in public. 
I fully expected of course then that the next meeting would be a public meeting.  
I would be happy to table this document, the minutes of proceedings.  
That was your ruling, Mr. Speaker. 
Therefore I was providing public information to the public. 
I am not in contempt, in my view.  
We are here on a question of privilege. 
I would prefer not to have any interruptions. 
I want to hear what the member has to say. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
That is the respectful thing to do.  
Of course, I would like to refer to just three dates in the critical path. 
I ask the Speaker to rule at his earliest convenience. 
I do not want to get into a debate. 
I will hear the hon. government House leader.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
The fact still remains that citation 877 of Beauchesne's still applies. 
It says very clearly: 
That is the equivalent of a standing committee in the British House.  
I read further where it says: 
First, those two concepts are not mutually exclusive. 
Second, it is immaterial. 
The hon. opposition whip was on his feet. 
I will recognize him.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
I would ask that he retract those words. 
It is despicable that he would- 
I would first like to deal with this point of privilege. 
If such a thing occurred, then I did not hear it. 
We will hear one side and then the other. 
I do not want to get into the debate. 
Is there more information to offer?  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
Mr. Speaker, I believe there is a clarification. 
That is a separate issue. 
That never happened and the record will show that.  
We are getting into debate. 
I am looking for new facts on this particular matter.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
I knew nothing of the concerns of the hon. member for Lakeland. 
Mr. Joe Fontana (London North Centre, Lib.):
I will not recite the citations. 
Everyone's rights have been breached. 
That is the additional piece of information.  
It is an embarrassing matter.  
I point that out to the House.  
I think we are getting into debate. 
I will go now to the hon. member for Mississauga West.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
The member for Lakeland mentioned the meeting on March 2. 
That was the kind of intimidation tactic frankly that we were faced with.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
Therefore, as a member I feel aggrieved.  
Now we have had interventions by at least another five members of parliament.  
ALLOTTED DAY-MANAGEMENT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT 
The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the amendment.  
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to participate in this important debate.  
It does not seem to matter that she has established a website. 
It is essentially a feeding frenzy. 
HRDC is a very big department. 
When government tries to address these problems, it does an uneven job. 
Usually the focus is on some area of high unemployment. 
That is what it boils down to.  
It audited something in the order of 459 projects. 
Frankly it does not work all the time. 
What is the insight there? 
How about the West Rouge Community Centre? 
No one wants to talk about that. 
It was not in the Scarborough Mirror . 
It was not on the local Shaw Cable. 
Does anyone want to talk about the Scarborough Philharmonic Society?  
These are ways in which government civilizes our communities.  
Classically businesses are not interested in this sort of stuff. 
To be perfectly blunt about it, businesses want to make money. 
That is their area of expertise. 
Some of the grants are problematic. 
I am prepared to admit that. 
The government depends on the community, the province and local businesses to generate the projects. 
Clearly not all projects are equal. 
Clearly the conception of the project may be different from its execution. 
Good news is no news. 
It does not hit the headlines.  
No one really wants to hear the facts. 
When the issue can be explained, that is it. 
It dies and it is gone.  
The second category is more problematic for the government. 
The question becomes the size and the percentage of impact. 
I understand that the opposition is criticizing the spending in HRDC. 
At this point in time what is known is what I reiterated earlier. 
This is an interesting exercise. 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
The employer has been paying his share too. 
The government is faced with an unhappy situation in that riding. 
Since it is a pocket of high unemployment what is the government supposed to do? 
The only places they would be available would be in Liberal ridings.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
The motion reads as follows: 
There is also an amendment, which reads as follows: 
That the motion be amended by adding after the word ``condemn'' the following: 
There were several protests. 
He may be a Liberal but he witnessed those protests.  
A subcommittee had been set up and on the last day we went to Bathurst. 
That was Doug Young's riding. 
Protesters were particularly vocal there. 
But the minister did not come on that day.  
This was because there were real problems. 
The wives of fishers came to testify. 
These programs were necessary in the so-called seasonal unemployment regions.  
Because, she said, there were pockets of poverty.  
There are pockets of poverty in my riding. 
There is still one right now. 
Only the Liberal members heard about it. 
Luck was on their side.  
The hon. member has said that there were partisan attacks from the opposition. 
Why are there such attacks which he calls partisan? 
The facts are even more worrisome. 
He even included a quote from the business owner in question.  
The one in Montreal they left there.  
They streamlined, and where did the office go? 
Once again, to the riding of the Prime Minister, the riding of Saint-Maurice.  
It seems to him that the members of the Bloc Quebecois are making partisan interventions. 
These facts are never contradicted. 
For me, the evidence is very clear. 
Since I find that scandalous, I add my voice to those who are protesting.  
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
That is an indisputable fact. 
It is a very partisan position that Bloc members take at the committees.  
For instance, the Anjou riding was held by a Bloc Quebecois MP. 
It is a fact. 
We noticed how focussed it all was.  
They have bled the unemployed dry in order to doll out grants for electioneering purposes. 
This is a vicious, undemocratic attack. 
I thought those days were long gone. 
It wants to use public money for partisan purposes, which is unacceptable.  
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
However, we must do it since this is about taxpayers' money.  
I will not name them all because there are a number of them. 
There is one in particular that really gets me fired up. 
It is not always pretty. 
Politicians have a very poor reputation. 
This is a profession for which support is among the lowest.  
Politicians are all liars''. 
This is a very pervasive belief and I think it must be taken very seriously.  
They saw it as one more scandal and nothing new. 
Approximately seven categories of programs were investigated. 
The motion reads as follows: 
I totally agree with that. 
To me, this is a serious threat.  
The taxes of my fellow citizens end up here in Ottawa. 
If we cannot get answers here, where are we going to get them? 
I think this issue must be brought to light. 
I am disappointed by this whole scandal. 
A zero deficit and balanced budget policy was instituted. 
It all seemed to be above board.  
The reason why the public has less and less faith in politics is obvious. 
I have no more time left. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to be able to respond. 
Would the hon. member have any comments on that?  
The harm has been done and that is the way it is.  
There are already several investigations underway, particularly in the Prime Minister's riding. 
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I too commend the interpreters. 
He also used the words scandal and democracy. 
The facts are very clear. 
There was no misappropriation of spending.  
That would only make sense. 
Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, Lib.):
I thank the hon. member opposite for bringing his motion before the House. 
I totally reject the substance of this motion. 
Is the hon. member being constructive? 
They would let the auditor general do his work. 
Something should be said about the public servants in the Department of Human Resources Development. 
One thing that is sadly lacking in this whole discussion is an informed debate. 
The result was the new employment insurance, the EI system. 
Each region was allotted funds based on two specific criteria. 
Built into the program was the need for regional decision making and flexibility. 
That is what the TJF did. 
As I said, I am pleased to have the opportunity to clarify this issue. 
I hope hon. members now have a better understanding of how the TJF worked. 
Small amounts of funds were invested in many facets of our town.  
Some of the funding involved local partners. 
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I have a few questions for the hon. member. 
According to the report, some people had not even filled in an application. 
The answer we are getting is that they trust the auditor general. 
One must know how an audit is conducted. 
Madam Speaker, my colleague leaves a little bit of room in his questions. 
However, the audit in HRDC was brought forward by the HRDC officials themselves.  
There are dozens and dozens of people there who are professionals in investigating this.  
The audit that has been done so far did not point to any political interference. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Ms. Judy Sgro (York West, Lib.):
It is an issue of management and administration.  
I will give a couple of examples. 
These are not government MPs that I am quoting. 
A motion like this one before us will not help these people. 
These people do not care about the kinds of issues raised in this opposition motion. 
It will simply delay any help that those families are waiting for. 
They are concerned with real answers and answers to real problems. 
How would a public inquiry help them?  
They are not asking for public inquiries and neither are we. 
A public inquiry would not help any of the HRDC clients become more literate. 
It would not help a person with a disability to find a job either. 
In fact, it would interfere with our ability to do these things.  
It is the responsibility of the federal government to do this. 
I applaud our government. 
Let us continue on with helping people in Canada.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
I will read it to her. 
We are criticizing the mismanagement of that program.  
What does the member think of that? 
Does she find that normal?  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Does accountability not enter her vocabulary? 
I am talking about accountability for taxpayer dollars. 
Does this not bother the member?  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
We knew nothing about the pockets that everybody has referred to. 
Is the hon. member aware of that fact?  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I likewise want to congratulate her.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay-Boundary-Okanagan, Ref.):
I agree with that. 
The government has a habit of having independent inquiries. 
I think we should look at this. 
We do want to get some kind of inquiry on this. 
The government named Robert Nixon, a close friend of the Prime Minister. 
Even at that, his original report conflicted with that of the government.  
The original Nixon draft report still conflicted with the government. 
So much for independence.  
We know he is a close friend of the Prime Minister. 
Aside from that, what did he get when it was finished? 
He became the chair of Atomic Energy of Canada. 
We really like that.  
What did this independent inquiry cost us? 
This is the way the government works.  
It was certainly an interesting performance.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I believe that the hon. member is getting very close to the fine line. 
I will advise him to please try to be more judicious in choosing his words.  
Madam Speaker, I will and I apologize. 
I certainly should not have characterized the hon. member in the way that he acted. 
That was standing to justification.  
There was some one handed clapping on the other side as a result of this. 
That is not true.  
Far be it from me to argue with him on that point.  
This program is supposed to be about job creation. 
There is job creation at its pinnacle. 
The government is filling a need. 
First it creates one and then it fills it. 
It is absolutely unbelievable.  
I will be the first to say that my riding has done very well. 
Why is it a success? 
I have worked with the HRDC people in my riding. 
They are good people. 
There have been no scandals or cover-ups. 
Criteria have been laid down. 
What kind of things have been going on in the minister's riding? 
Companies have been lured away from a neighbouring riding. 
That is good job creation. 
That is an interesting conflict. 
Is that not interesting.  
Now we hear all the cries from the other side. 
The crocodile tears are coming down. 
They want to appoint the person who will make the inquiry. 
They want a draft report to see if it is appropriately done.  
The government should take responsibility for its mistakes when it makes them. 
Nobody expects it to be perfect. 
They should say ``yes, we made some mistakes but we are going to correct them. 
Let us move on. 
We are sorry and we will not do it again''. 
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
These typical ultra right-wing positions, this rhetoric is divisive. 
The Reform Party is very clearly trying to divide Canadians.  
It is not right. 
We saw the drop it took in the polls.  
There has been enough right-wing rhetoric and political posturing. 
It is just not right.  
Madam Speaker, I would be more than happy to respond to the hon. member. 
I was kind of smiling. 
When I hear nonsense I do tend to laugh at it. 
It is considered the best defence.  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I do not think that the word nonsense is unparliamentary.  
Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, Lib.):
The audit was done early on in my riding. 
It was completely clear and there was absolutely no problem. 
The program has resumed.  
It is interesting listening to the hon. member who spoke out previously. 
He does not want to listen. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
That is the beginning and end of this motion. 
This is not the government's money. 
Where were those jobs created?  
One example is in the minister's own riding. 
It has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country. 
The Minister of Human Resources Development received grants that were three times the national average. 
We have seen the devastation that has been wrought upon the farmers in the prairies. 
It is not only HRD. 
Let us take a look at the Export Development Corporation. 
But who does it lend to? 
That is what the EDC has done. 
That is what the government has done with the taxpayers' money. 
What justification is there for that?  
We have given money to it to do what? 
It is rife with corruption. 
Yet what does the Canadian government government do? 
We do not have enough money to buy choppers. 
With respect to the money, there is $22 billion in outstanding loans from EDC. 
Who is on the hook for this? 
What does the EDC do? 
It loans money on the good name of the Canadian taxpayer.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:
There is a profit.  
The Minister of National Defence says it earns a profit. 
The public cannot find out what is happening in EDC with their money. 
Parliament cannot find out what is happening in the EDC. 
They do not even have enough money to put their cars on the road. 
In Vancouver they do not have money to put cars on the road. 
There is an acute gross shortage of police officers in this country. 
Because there is not enough money. 
What does the government do? 
I could go on and on but I welcome questions from the other side. 
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
We know that the future always depends on the past. 
They have no money to care for patients.  
If the money in HRD was spent wisely, we would not have a problem. 
We hear the question:
Why waste billions of dollars through HRD, EDC or CIDA? 
I would extend it to involve CIDA, HRDC, EDC and aboriginal affairs.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the comments made by my hon. colleague. 
I would like him to comment on one thing.  
Yet, the question is obvious. 
Why have these things taken place if in fact there is no problem?  
Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Elk Island for his very germane question. 
He is absolutely right. 
The auditor general is an apolitical institution. 
Is his advice ever adhered to? 
In fact, that is part of the problem. 
Despite the very effective solutions which the AG puts forth, the government completely ignores them. 
Because the disposition of money has become highly politicized within the government.

Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
The hon. member deserves a great deal of credit for taking the initiative.  
This is a piece of legislation that is worthy of support in the House. 
However, this legislation would prevent that refusal. 
Let us draw a similar analogy. 
There is also the timeliness. 
This has caused concern across the country. 
We have received numerous letters in support of the legislation. 
The list goes on and on. 
There is very broad support for the bill brought forward by the hon. member. 
We in the Conservative Party are in complete support of it. 
Individuals should have confidence that the system is there to support them. 
Integrity and safeguards are in place. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
It is very timely and effective. 
The blood samples will help them. 
They would encounter shock. 
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
I think it is a very timely piece of legislation.  
We have to be a bit careful in terms of describing this as a panacea. 
Issues need to be hammered out. 
However, absolutely those concerns are very minor compared to the thrust of this bill.  
I congratulate the member for Fraser Valley. 
I will be supporting the bill. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I wish to mention two cases in particular. 
He was a good Samaritan who had just done his job as a good citizen. 
I want to thank her tonight. 
She is up in the gallery.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would like the record to- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
My question was the following: 
It is now about $28 billion.  
That is what the government said.  
In Canada, only 30% of women qualify for employment insurance.  
Do you know what this means? 
Those people contribute to the EI fund. 
They pay contributions, yet they are not eligible to benefits.  
I would like to have the opinion of the government on that. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
This is the lowest rate since April 1976. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
In 1999 the banks in this country made $9 billion in profits. 
This tells us the priorities of the banks.  
In the other case two of them will be amalgamated into one. 
The people in these communities will have service available to the community.  
There are 63 people working in these 17 branches of the Bank of Montreal. 
Some of these branches are very small. 
One only has one employee. 
This is a move in the right direction.  
Maybe we should look at what the United States has done. 
This is very important.  
This is also very important.  
The banks can afford to be more generous and more flexible. 
They can afford to concentrate more on service. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
He calls upon the government to prevent job losses and branch closures.  
This goes also for financial institutions such as banks. 
A strong, efficient and profitable financial sector is essential to our economic well-being.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
(The House adjourned at 7.20 p.m.)
