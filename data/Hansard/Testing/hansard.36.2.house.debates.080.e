EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 80 
Thursday, April 6, 2000 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEE PROTECTION ACT 
(Motions deemed adopted, bill read the first time and printed) 
I hope to get the support of the House for this private member's bill.  
The bill adopts a new approach to agreements between competitors. 
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I have several petitions to present today.  
The second group of petitions contains 249 signatures. 
The third set of petitions contains 75 signatures. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
They are calling upon parliament to take the appropriate measures to abolish the Senate.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance):
I am pleased to present these petitions on their behalf.  
Mr. Speaker, I suggest that all questions be allowed to stand.  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
PROCEEDS OF CRIME (MONEY LAUNDERING) ACT 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
The disclosure of information by the centre would then be strictly controlled. 
This mandatory reporting is a step certainly in the right direction. 
These will certainly flesh out the substance of the bill.  
The current system of voluntary reporting of suspicious transactions would be replaced with mandatory procedures. 
Certainly ethical considerations already apply for all lawyers and accountants. 
Penalties for failing to report suspicious transactions are quite heavy. 
They can be up to $2 million and imprisonment for five years. 
This certainly expresses the seriousness and the punitive sanctions reflect this.  
The Liberal government has given the Americans much evidence to validate their concerns. 
It is an embarrassment for our country. 
We cannot have the reputation of being soft on crime. 
Let us put this into perspective. 
Some 62% of this new money will not be available until 2001-02. 
We suggest this is still not enough.  
In rural areas this is of extreme concern. 
Granby, in the riding of Shefford, is facing this threat. 
This is part of a larger problem. 
The breakdown in communications and not sharing information is certainly counterproductive.  
The RCMP calls it long overdue. 
There are many concerns that the Conservative Party of Canada has. 
There are all kinds of other ways to improve this legislation. 
What about the exemption for retailers? 
There may be others with whom this information will need to be shared.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Kings-Hants. 
I know he is greatly concerned with this issue. 
The question was very probing. 
I would suggest that establishing the centre is a step in the right direction. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a long history in this kind of issue. 
I sat for 10 years on the Waterloo Regional Police Commission. 
I know that he has a very strong interest in this area. 
It is often a question of priorities. 
I am sure he will say yes. 
We will not follow that path. 
The centre can be a centre of excellence. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Canadian Alliance):
I would like the member to comment.  
Mr. Speaker, I could not agree more with the hon. member. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Canadian Alliance):
I do not understand.  
It is important that the government get on with it. 
It is a real threat to the way of life we have in this country. 
It is that serious''.  
That was a quote by an RCMP deputy commissioner. 
You can't smell it. 
That is where we are. 
Why has the government delayed and delayed the introduction of the bill? 
They and their families are directly and personally threatened by organized crime. 
They launder money in order to continue their illegal operations. 
Financial transactions conceal criminal profits to make them appear legitimate.  
What about those investors?  
Capital investment is what builds an economy. 
According to the Ottawa Citizen of Monday, March 27, 2000: 
This is an exceptionally serious issue. 
Some concerns have been raised about the legislation. 
A writer in the Financial Post , Terence Corcoran, indicated: 
There are protections under criminal law. 
I have read that: 
This allows the police to arrange ``sting'' operations.  
That is not the point. 
Let us deal with the funding issues of this legislation. 
Those people also put their lives on the line. 
We will be supporting this legislation but not blindly. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Should other countries in the world be assisting in this area?  
I will be interested in his response.  
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question from the member. 
I take it as being a very responsible intervention. 
I cannot resist the temptation to say, for a change.  
I will be answering his question, but I do want to make this statement. 
My criticism is that the government has not acted in a timely fashion.  
How much time is required? 
The RCMP has reached a point of rust-out. 
It is a start but it is late. 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
We are well aware that these notes were used by organized crime. 
The issue was also part of our platform in 1997. 
Mr. Speaker, of course we are in agreement. 
This brings the importance of this to the attention of the House.  
I commend the Bloc Quebecois for that. 
The subcommittee was struck just two days ago. 
The committee chair has been named and we will start to work on this issue.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
This means that, like crime, justice must be organized. 
Stiff measures are needed and they must be organized. 
But all this is not easy-far from it. 
Organized crime is not just the occupation of a few influential masterminds. 
Members will therefore understand that the phenomenon we are now seeing is extremely complex. 
What exactly is ``money laundering''? 
What weapons did we have, then, against such a huge problem? 
A brief overview of Canadian legislation would be appropriate here. 
However, this was left to the discretion of the institution.  
There is a problem.  
Finally, the government seems to have understood with Bill C-22.  
Let us examine these mechanisms and the centre. 
He can decide to go back to his country of origin.  
As I said earlier, the government opposite should have acted sooner. 
The government should have been much more proactive. 
It should have listened to the Bloc Quebecois.  
I have already mentioned the $1,000 note. 
That is a bit risky.  
However, this limitation must not be exercised outside certain rules. 
Bill C-22 must comply with certain basic procedural rules. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
I have some concerns about that. 
I have some concerns about that. 
I am also concerned about the budget of the agency. 
I have some concerns about Bill C-22. 
Only if systemic abuse is suspected would the minister be able to intervene. 
This would help Revenue Canada or the new Revenue Canada agency pursue the individual. 
That is absolutely, fundamentally wrong. 
The two agencies have to be separate. 
I would assume that would be the case but it has to be spelled out. 
Those are my cautions. 
We are supporting this legislation with some concerns. 
Again these border on questions of resources. 
A lot of these technologies exist in the private sector. 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):
I am thinking of parliamentarians in South America. 
The cartels have their own air forces. 
This is a scourge on our society.  
Money laundering is only one part of it. 
I want to broaden the debate. 
We see bribery and corruption in all parts of the world. 
There are horrendous problems in South America. 
Members may have read about it in the paper. 
We read about it in the papers in the United States. 
Numerous elected officials in senior positions have been bought. 
China has acknowledged that corruption is a major problem.  
I would hope that we would start to do something about it. 
Transparency and openness is how to deal with bribery and corruption. 
If a transaction cannot stand up to the light of day, it is likely illegal. 
Look at what has happened with the HRDC scandal. 
Numerous audits were done and none of them were brought out into the open. 
On January 20 the last HRDC audit became part of the public debate. 
What has happened since then? 
Why were they not done properly before? 
Because there was no openness, no accountability and no transparency. 
We need economic development. 
We want to help the poor not only in this country but around the world. 
These are small beginnings.  
Then they would continue their daily routines.  
It is a core part of policy making. 
When they make policy the environment is a major consideration.  
Human rights is the same. 
Today we have war crimes tribunals. 
We have agreements and protocols. 
We insist on human rights when we enter into other agreements. 
Human rights is now a core principle of democracy.  
I have heard numerous examples, small and large. 
Is the House ready for the question?  
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
I declare the motion carried. 
Accordingly the bill stands referred to the Standing Committee on Finance.  
INCOME TAX AMENDMENTS ACT, 1999 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The fundamentals of our government's tax policy are crystal clear.  
The government remains committed to providing substantial tax relief to Canadians on an ongoing basis. 
Low and middle income Canadians are the ones who will benefit most from these measures.  
I have more examples. 
Even then, these arrangements are only effective for certain types of income.  
The bill also deals with misrepresentations by third parties. 
In both cases, these distributions are included in the income of beneficiaries. 
The 1999 budget removes this restriction. 
The discrepancy in interest rates only makes matters worse.  
Many provinces provide similar assistance. 
The measures in Bill C-25 are not contentious. 
They are well thought out and all adhere to the principles of tax fairness. 
Each improves the operation of the tax system. 
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, it is April and it is snowing outside. 
Voters must understand that Liberals cannot manage. 
Fiscal decisions are measures of how a government attempts to influence the economy. 
The comparative picture is not great. 
The NDP have done fairly well with its politics of envy. 
The Irish might now have higher incomes than Canadians.  
There is a brain drain from the universities. 
Inflexible unions and rigid labour markets hold us back. 
Sadly, we still have a cultural hostility to economic success.  
The Canadian Alliance clearly says that we could do so much better as a country. 
We should have been accomplishing more in reducing the national debt. 
It means paying down debt to reduce interest payments. 
This applies to the country as well. 
That again is the Liberal record.  
This approach has two problems. 
High taxes discourage risk taking and tend to send investment offshore. 
That means no growth. 
Our permanent outstanding debt is more than $570 billion. 
It was a wrong choice.  
All the sacrifices of the past few years will have been for naught.  
We are not out of the woods. 
Our national balance sheet is far from strong. 
They want more groceries. 
Instead of giving Canadians a fake break, we should give them a real tax break. 
The preferred choice is solution 17 of the Canadian Alliance. 
Truer words were never spoken.  
We found all kinds of unbelievable things especially in Liberal ridings.  
The more we have dug, the worse it gets. 
There is even more money in the budget going to the human resources minister. 
There is no question that they should resign.  
They made a cruel heartless choice. 
That is what it appears to be.  
Repeat that word picture a thousand times across the country. 
The Liberals call these schemes job creation. 
Many of these programs likely hurt more than they helped.  
This puts a blemish on this taxpayer friendly budget.  
Reducing debt today cuts tomorrow's taxes.  
The CHST allocation hardly revitalizes the system. 
The Prime Minister calls it a minor administrative problem.  
The budget should be balanced every year, save for times of national emergency. 
The basic economic freedom of Canadians is too tightly held by the government. 
We still have the overwhelming crushing tax burden faced by Canadian taxpayers and businesses. 
What is wrong with this? 
There is a massive disincentive to work and save and invest.  
It leads to accounting gymnastics. 
Every Canadian would see lower taxes under this plan. 
It would maintain all existing deductions and credits, with three significant exceptions. 
That is what would be achieved under our single rate plan.  
A single rate system of taxation would do something else. 
It would end the penalty for hard work and success.  
Our current multiple rate system penalizes extra work. 
This marginal tax penalty would be removed under a single rate system.  
The Canadian Alliance is the real family friendly party.  
The benefits of a single rate are obvious. 
It would increase take home pay. 
They are wasting it and mismanaging it.  
I see the hon. member has finished his speech. 
FRENCH-SPEAKING MINORITY COMMUNITIES 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):
But the Langs are people of extraordinary faith. 
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
Now they will both be stamped `Made in Canada'.''  
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Andy Scott (Fredericton, Lib.):
I encourage all to attend.  
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):
My lesson today for the solicitor general is simple. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
The rate of occupational related diseases for firefighters is among the highest.  
In particular, I am talking about the CPP section of their request.  
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Canada has a long tradition of solidarity and openness. 
We cherish these values. 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
Meanwhile, the federal government is acting like a hypocrite. 
The hon. member for Egmont.  
Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):
A good transportation system is vital to a region's economy. 
Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):
Sana Mubarak and Nawroz Mubarak .  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Speaker, today Canadians of Scottish descent are celebrating Tartan Day. 
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, editorial cartoonist show politicians in a most humorous fashion. 
As politicians we have a deep affection for these cutting editorialists. 
Canada's editorial cartoonists are among the best in the world. 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Many of our witnesses strongly suggested this as a real means of control. 
The second is a safe third country. 
It is mentioned in the bill but that is all. 
Appointments to the IRB are still political. 
This is a job that requires a very special expertise, not a political connection. 
Unfortunately this issue is not addressed in the bill. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):
The ethics counsellor answers to only one person, the Prime Minister.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this matter is in the hands of the ethics counsellor. 
It is up to him to say when he has finished his report. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, according to the best information I have, the hon. member is not correct. 
The report has not been done for the period he mentioned. 
The Prime Minister has not received the report. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):
Why have we not seen that report? 
Why are we not hearing that- 
The hon. Deputy Prime Minister.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
I would like to see if he is quoting from it in context. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, here is another document, just to show the seriousness of this issue. 
The Minister of Finance was on the board of directors at that time. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):
The question as stated is out of order.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
The provision of health services is, naturally, a provincial responsibility.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, that was not the point of my question. 
Is this the minister's idea of an enlightened partnership?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Unfortunately, the provinces-including Quebec's Mrs. Marois-refused. 
They only wanted to talk money.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I totally agree with the hon. member. 
We must consult, we must work together, that is clear. 
I am prepared, starting tomorrow, to meet my counterparts to discuss the matter.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
For the rest, we will discuss the matter with our counterparts, and we will see.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I did not raise the comment about the old boys' club. 
Former ministers of health have called attention to this. 
We are at a critical point. 
It is time for the minister to act in that same tradition. 
Will he do so? 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Let me correct something the member said. 
He refers to 12 principles being signed onto. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has an unusual attitude. 
To that party it was dead. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, let us set the record straight. 
Maybe the finance minister should bring his cheque book with him.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, next year transfers to the provinces will be $31 billion. 
That is an all time high. 
Transfers in terms of equalization will be at an all time high.  
The hon. member for Red Deer.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):
Perhaps that was before he had read those minutes. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is ludicrous. 
That is exactly what happened.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, let us look at what is ludicrous. 
That is pretty high priced help, I would suggest.  
The finance minister no longer sits as a director of CDC. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
The problem in this file is the invoices.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Canadian Alliance):
He later helped make the Liberals' decision not to provide- 
We will hear the question.  
Why has the government failed to deal promptly with this clear issue?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Canadian Alliance):
The minister himself promised to make relevant documents public. 
There are some real credibility issues here. 
Canadians need an answer.  
I did not hear the last part of the question because of the noise. 
I believe the Deputy Prime Minister was on his feet. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
It did not say he had concluded his report.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
His response was that he would read the letter and then respond to it.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
There is an absolutely scandalous rumour going around that CFB Petawawa could close. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is absolutely right. 
It is a scandalous rumour. 
We have no intention of closing it. 
It indicates the importance of that base.  
We should be congratulating them for their great work.  
CFB Petawawa will continue to be a major base in the operations of our military.  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):
We are talking about the CDC minutes. 
The Minister of Finance knows he has the minutes. 
When will he produce the minutes?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let me repeat what I have said.  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
We would like to hear the questions and the answers.  
Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
That same allegation was made yesterday on national television. 
I repeat my question and would appreciate an answer. 
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
It is a strong piece of legislation. 
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
Is Here and Now about to become ``there and gone''?  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Will she commit to it here and now? 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY 
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
Hon. Claudette Bradshaw (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
That is what the CRTC wants and that is what Canadians want.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
I would ask the hon. member to please address her questions through the Chair.  
Mrs. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is obviously running out of questions. 
I have already answered that question three times.  
Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, more and more countries are opting for the compulsory labelling of GMOs. 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I share the member's frustration. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
They sat down and decided the rules. 
I am their servant. 
They are my boss.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
It does occur every now and then.  
Someone is trying to correct me. 
This afternoon we will have the following business. 
Bill C-19 is the bill regarding war crimes. 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas-Charlottenburgh, Lib.):
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
INCOME TAX AMENDMENTS ACT, 1999 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Hon. members need only to look at the figures. 
This means a difference of $2 billion in just a few months.  
That was at the end of February. 
It places the surplus for this fiscal year at nearly $12 billion. 
That is a bit of a difference.  
There is no doubt about it. 
When the Minister of Finance makes forecasts, he has always been wrong. 
They have not been minor mistakes. 
This does not give us the range of options. 
This is what the minister is doing.  
Let me give you an example. 
This will not even buy a cup of coffee.  
You are a middle income earner. 
In two years, they have saved $7,500 in taxes. 
Hon. members see the imbalance here. 
This could have been brought back into balance. 
Yet he has done nothing.  
He has pushed them into poverty. 
He has thrown them into the pit of poverty. 
Six out of ten unemployed persons are excluded from the employment insurance plan. 
He could have changed the plan.  
We can see too how this department treats friends of the party. 
They grease their palms, they give them hush money. 
The friends of the party are not treated like thieves. 
We have the HRDC scandal to prove it.  
On another topic, the Minister of Finance could have overhauled the EI scheme. 
When will he do so? 
They are being reduced to poverty, put out in the street, driven to suicide. 
There are people living out these tragedies today.  
This is not just unacceptable, it is completely revolting.  
Until then, the sharing was based on a number of criteria, including population. 
Half of the $2 billion adjustment went to Ontario. 
Ontario won the prize. 
The Liberals make political hay with it. 
They play petty politics.  
They gave Quebec a $1 billion adjustment in equalization payments. 
I talked of the new formula for allocating the Canada social transfer. 
The Minister of Finance informed us ``No, you are not entitled to it''.  
The Government of Quebec also collects the GST on behalf of the federal government. 
There is a limit to what a person can put up with.  
We will vote against Bill C-25 at second reading. 
We are still waiting for a reply from the Minister of Finance. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
I will quote Mr. Asper.  
The Canadian tax system that we're living under was last reformed 32 years ago. 
It is obsolete and the world it was designed to deal with no longer exists.  
The (system) is a nightmare of complexity, a sea of uncertainty...The 
tax system is now anti-business, anti-private sector and anti-entrepreneurial.  
We heard from a number of individuals who were participating in the conference yesterday. 
A gentleman by the name of Tom Axworthy spoke to the group assembled. 
They are staying in the U.S. 
These are very troubling and not simply anecdotal experiences. 
These are signs of a greater truth. 
These types of statistics are very troubling for Canada.  
In fact over half of Canadians voted against free trade. 
That step was one of vision and of leadership. 
I would argue that on the GST there was a consensus. 
Unfortunately, it was not a consensus that was positive for my party in 1993. 
That is the best part of your speech so far.  
One of the Liberal members opposite has commended me on my oratory today. 
It is tremendously kind.  
This government is clearly failing to recognize the opportunities and challenges of this new economy.  
Canadians deserve much better. 
The 1999 budget was the health care budget. 
The year 2000 budget was the tax cut budget. 
What about corporate taxes? 
Every time the dollar drops, Canadians have a pay cut. 
I will speak to some specific issues in Bill C-25. 
We support the demutualization of life insurance companies. 
That is a step in the right direction. 
It should have been done earlier.  
In the 2000 budget there was a commitment to decrease it by 1% per year. 
It will benefit countries other than Canada if we are not very careful.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY ACT 
This brings to mind the horror that takes place in this world of ours. 
Stories from Rwanda by Philip Gourevitch. 
The Hutu kids were told to leave and the Tutsi kids were murdered. 
It is so important that we begin to establish the fundamental principle of accountability. 
We can no longer accept that as being a basis for international law. 
That is why we are debating Bill C-19 at second reading. 
That is the basic question we are here to decide.  
It begins to establish basic principles. 
It is a huge step forward for humankind in developing this kind of institution.  
It sometimes leads to selective justice and is not universally applied.  
The creation of a permanent, independent institution can overcome these weaknesses. 
Some 120-odd countries have already signed the treaty. 
Eight have now ratified it. 
The act will create new offences of genocide and crimes against humanity. 
It begins to apply accountability to all individuals.  
That is really the break from the past. 
It is fair to say there has been a groundswell of support. 
I hope that we can do our part in the House today. 
They said that the Hutu could leave and the Tutsi must stay. 
However, this time there was a difference. 
They too were murdered by the genocidaires.  
Humanity can stand up to crimes. 
We can stand up against violations. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):
He did a great job. 
I have learned a lot and continue to learn a lot from them. 
I hope they will assist me when I need their help.  
We understand that no nation stands alone in the global arena. 
This is a very important justice issue. 
Criminals must be brought to accountability.  
Very few Canadians have had firsthand experience. 
We know that when crimes are committed against an individual we feel for that victim. 
Ethnic war is wrong.  
I lived in Liberia, a country in west Africa, for about eight years. 
I also had business there. 
I had close contact with youth who were studying at the university. 
I have two sons who were born there. 
Now they are 17 and 14 years old. 
The civil war was based on the ethnicity of the people. 
They were killing people. 
When we look at pictures we can see that they were not even fully dressed. 
Because someone was leading them. 
Canada should recapture its role and show leadership in the international arena.  
The Canadian Alliance supports the bill in principle. 
Our support is conditional. 
They did not think that any of the major offending countries would sign it. 
They did not think the Americans would sign it, our neighbours. 
They could not answer questions about the make-up of the code at that time. 
I cannot understand how the government could do that. 
We should not be part of a rubber stamp process. 
Without belligerent countries signing on this treaty will be meaningless.  
The foreign minister did not answer these questions. 
Now he is not here to listen. 
He left the Chamber.  
What would the bill do? 
There are many good parts to the bill. 
It places further emphasis on guaranteeing the interests of victims. 
The judges and prosecutors will be completely independent. 
The establishment of the international criminal court would bring legitimacy to international justice. 
That will definitely contribute to the quality of this bill.  
This has always been the case in Canadian law.  
I will quickly go over the organizational component of the ICC. 
It will be seated in the Hague, Netherlands. 
The registrar will be responsible for administration of the ICC. 
I will now go back to the part about the costs. 
As of February 7, 2000, 94 countries had signed the Rome Statute. 
We can see how the cost operates.  
There are some questions relating to the ICC. 
The ICC has been structured so that the sovereignty of nations will remain primordial. 
Bill C-19 is Canada's version of this legislation. 
There are some other problems. 
The ICC could lead to judicial activism on a global scale. 
Global judicial rulings should not be deemed regressive. 
It gives them mechanisms and international support to achieve justice.  
It ensures continuity and consistency of international law. 
Let me mention something about our neighbours, the United States. 
Some may argue that this makes the court ineffective. 
The need for international justice can still be carried out.  
This involvement in the process could lead to their acceptance of the court.  
Parliament should participate in serious consultations with regard to those negotiations. 
We know that the negotiations are secret. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
We will take care ourselves of the massacre of the cockroaches, the Tutsi. 
We demand that we make a list of all those people. 
What are we waiting for decimate these families? 
No matter what you do, do not let them get away.  
Canada must not be a haven for people like Mugesera Leon. 
Canada must not just deport this individual. 
I support the bill. 
I salute the government not just for bringing the bill forward. 
It is not just of our government. 
I want to signal as well the contribution of many NGOs. 
The Canadian Network for an International Criminal Court included a broad cross-section of NGOs. 
It included many churches. 
It included the International Centre for Human Rights and Democratic Development. 
It included Amnesty International and many other Canadian NGOs.  
His book was entitled None is too Many . 
Those are very important provisions. 
We can be proud of our role, but there are inconsistencies in our approach. 
We cannot have it both ways. 
I believe we have to take that very seriously.  
We look at some of the allegations made about the conduct of that war. 
A bridge was bombed by NATO in broad daylight. 
I want to be very clear. 
Denis Halliday said that we are destroying an entire society. 
It is as terrifying and as simple as that.  
I think it is important that we recognize and understand that.  
So far I believe seven countries have ratified this treaty. 
Sixty are needed before it comes into force. 
I hope we continue to take a strong position on that.  
Those are our concerns. 
That has been the truth too long on our planet. 
Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
It is on that score I would like to ask him the following question. 
It would seem to me there is an interest there. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson:
Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his question. 
I am very hopeful about the response of Canadians on these issues. 
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
Mr. Svend J. Robinson:
Mr. Speaker, this is a profoundly important question. 
The sanctions in Iraq are the most glaring example of that.  
In fact it is an illegal blockade which has been condemned by the United Nations.  
Is the House ready for the question?  
The House resumed from February 21 consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
These ideas are laudable and they reflect Canada's concern for the affected populations. 
UN staff involved in this field learn how to interpret available data.  
Canada will continue to provide support to enhance the capacity of existing organizations and systems.  
The role played by diplomats in prevention and conflict resolution is undeniably important. 
The task force submitted its recommendations to the council on March 15, 2000.  
We intend to participate very actively. 
Engaging in another process at this point would not be very useful.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):
I would like to move an amendment to the motion as follows: 
The amendment is in order. 
The question is on the amendment.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
These restructuring programs were not restructuring programs. 
This sort of thing continues to this very day. 
When push comes to shove, capital must be protected. 
It really does not matter as long as it is indirect. 
They had a name for this in the Bible. 
The motion also mentions the United Nations. 
One could make a whole speech about UN reform.  
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
A way must be found to reform all these international organizations.  
These issues are not always very obvious.  
When these organizations meet, there are many demonstrations. 
I think the hon. member's motion suggests that we look into these issues. 
These changes did not prevent poverty from becoming more prevalent here in Canada. 
There are 37 federal-provincial programs, yet the problem of poverty keeps growing.  
A number of European countries are also taking an interest in that option. 
There are many who question its existence. 
He managed to have the UN put in charge of the operations. 
I think this is an important step.  
It is important that international organizations be reformed. 
Everybody is concerned about what is happening in that area. 
I am sure our own organizations should review their practices.  
Perhaps we should make a greater use of NGOs. 
I think we must give that very serious consideration.  
I think we must give this motion all the consideration it deserves. 
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Canadian Alliance):
The status quo has become unsustainable. 
This is where Canada is letting down the international community. 
This has literally gutted the Canadian armed forces.  
The result of the massive cuts to defence spending was predictable. 
As we know, manpower is an essential aspect of combat capability. 
The army is particularly hard hit with personnel at only 65% of what is needed. 
The idea is unworkable.  
Soldiers on the ground are what the army needs. 
In conclusion, preventing conflict before it begins must become an international priority. 
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
These changes continue today. 
The IMF is therefore placing a higher priority on the social aspects of adjustments.  
The bank also has a long history in post-conflict assistance. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):
To refresh everyone's memory, I will read the amendment: 
I will reiterate the three main points and elaborate a bit on them.  
He suggested a spot in Canada.  
I will go back again to the first point on the early warning centre. 
When we think about the need in society, this is quite an initiative. 
If a conflict is raging it would require a co-ordinated response. 
Certainly there have been co-ordinated responses in the past. 
Unfortunately sometimes they are not as rapid as they should be. 
There is a conflict raging right now in Sudan. 
No one is involved but it is being monitored. 
I can see Canada playing a role in the diplomatic, economic and military initiatives.  
I am going to touch on the military initiative. 
Canada should build its military up to that point. 
However we do not fall into that category at this point in time. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House adjourned at 6.17 p.m.)
