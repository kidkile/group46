EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 84 
Wednesday, April 12, 2000 
The House met at 2 p.m. 
Members sang the national anthem ] 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
C.A. so it seems 
Are still living in dreams 
As they continue to strive 
Still makes them the same 
Won't help them much either.  
With Klees backing out, & Long jumping in 
The battle within is about to begin.  
So it's east versus west 
And so we must wonder 
When we'll see their next blunder 
'Cause as sure as the sun 
More errors will come.  
So it's back to the west 
With pretensions of zest 
After leaving in their wake 
``What's the difference'', you say 
As Canadians all know, 
They're the ``same ole'', ``same ole''.  
Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Canadian Alliance):
Only 13% of law-abiding owners have licensed their firearms. 
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):
This year marks the 85th anniversary of the Armenian genocide.  
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
For many the name Katyn has little meaning. 
However, to the Polish community the name is associated with a crime without parallel.  
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
I am positive that our colleague from Windsor-St. 
The constituents of Windsor-St. 
Congratulations to our colleague on his first anniversary.  
THE LATE TERRY FOX 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Canadian Alliance):
What made Terry a hero? 
Thank you Terry for daring to dream and daring to do.  
Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, Lib.):
Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):
This is not David Laflamme's first such success. 
There is no doubt that his passion- 
The hon. member for Okanagan-Shuswap.  
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):
The leader of the Bloc is concerned about Canada's international reputation. 
Let's get serious. 
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
it's the thing you held most dear to you, 
what you called an emptiness or a genuflection, 
having made your bargain with the oval night 
with the shuttle in the darkness of your loom...  
and the way you were startled by the brittle air 
when it call came back to you, 
what you called a song from a room 
while you did a perfect pirouette before a mirror, 
when a whole new language 
when another way of reckoning appeared 
deep inside the crevice of your knowing...  
O turn turn and turn again 
were the words, you wrote, on the sky 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
Canada is certainly not in the lead pack. 
Really, the Liberals' will is nil.  
Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre-Rosedale, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Canada's Middle East relationship is important. 
Canada is a trading and peace-loving nation. 
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
It welcomed the participation of the federal government and the private sector.  
The region's economic health and development are at stake.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):
He is not taking the high road of diplomacy and fairness.  
The Prime Minister is writing Canada's foreign policy on the bus between luncheons. 
He should have listened to Canadians, done his homework and delivered Canada's message.  
He is not fit to lead. 
He is damaging the peace process rather than making progress in the region.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
The auditor general has revealed widespread organizational and financial problems in the RCMP. 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
Perhaps with another six point plan, Mr. Speaker. 
The auditor general has made many of these same complaints year after year. 
Millions of Canadians count on them as their only local police force. 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
This government is committed to the RCMP. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
It is a matter of priorities. 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, what this government is committed to is public safety. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Canadian Alliance):
The auditor general said: 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, we have finally found out what happened to the Placeteco grant.  
That is how it shapes up.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
There is no basis for an overpayment. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
What is going on here is troubling. 
There is a contradiction.  
And despite what the owner himself says- 
The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We are talking about 170 people who otherwise would not be employed. 
We think that is the right thing to do.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, it is a real shame. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We have the invoices. 
We have people working. 
I think we have chosen the right approach. 
I think the Bloc's approach is wrong.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
This is exactly what the Videotron group did.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We have investigated this file thoroughly. 
The invoices are there to support the investment, and men and women are working.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is a little behind the times. 
Why should this issue be any different?  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Once again, our message has to be heard. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Mr. Speaker, that makes three strikes in three days. 
If it were baseball, the Prime Minister would be out.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
We will hear the answer of the hon. Deputy Prime Minister.  
AUDITOR GENERAL'S REPORT 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Canadian Alliance):
What a gift for the criminals. 
What is with this solicitor general?  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
We are well aware it needed to be updated and put in shape. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, let us talk about that $115 million. 
The auditor general says: 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
There is no basis for an overpayment to be established. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
AUDITOR GENERAL'S REPORT 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the minister of Indian affairs. 
Yesterday the minister admitted that he is failing aboriginal children.  
The minister has had 24 hours to do his homework. 
What is his defence today?  
Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, the auditor general emphatically disagrees with the minister. 
Why should anybody believe the minister? 
Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
These criminals will confiscate land and again terrorize thousands of farm families. 
Nothing will have changed, despite the government's promises.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
We will continue to do so. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
AUDITOR GENERAL'S REPORT 
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance):
The auditor general could not figure out where the money went. 
Maybe the minister would like to tell us, if he can and if he will.  
Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Those funds are all based on a per capita basis for education purposes.  
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance):
Will it be the provinces and the bands?  
Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
A caution warning has been issued to mariners throughout the entire system. 
As well, internationally designated safe harbours are not accessible. 
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for Essex. 
I will certainly consider her representation and see what options exist.  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):
My question is for the Minister of National Revenue. 
That is very clear.  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I think political interference is everywhere. 
The RCMP is investigating in the Prime Minister's riding. 
Mr. Speaker, obviously that member of the Reform Party must be dreaming. 
We look at expenses and then they are given the credits. 
It is as simple as that. 
It is impossible to be politically involved in such a process.  
Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
We on this side of the House think it is important.  
Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we now have these apologists for socialism explaining their position. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
The CBC is looking at closing down English language TV studios in Montreal. 
Does that not have a nice Quebec flavour. 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
My question is simple. 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
LIEUTENANT GENERAL ROMEO DALLAIRE 
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Rwanda has left a mark on him and on his life. 
The hon. Minister of National Defence may continue.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:
He has been a great soldier, a great patriot and a great humanitarian.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I have already answered that question. 
I have a question for the opposition. 
Today, they are using that report to score cheap political points. 
Where were they when it was time to work together with- 
I remind members that they must always address the Chair.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
When we first took office we substantially tightened up the program. 
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the minister responsible for energy.  
Is the Government of Canada willing to assist financially in building that line?  
That work is ongoing. 
In the meantime, I would make the point that no financial commitment has been made.  
TABLING OF A DOCUMENT 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Canadian Alliance):
Would he be able to table that document for the House?  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. Deputy Prime Minister was quoting from the Jerusalem Post newspaper online. 
This document is not translated. 
The hon. House leader has said he has the document. 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas-Charlottenburgh, Lib.):
Is there agreement to proceed in such a fashion?

Mr. Speaker, I am thrilled to see you in the chair.  
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau-Mirabel, BQ):
This petition has to do with petroleum product price increases.

Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Middlesex, Lib.):
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Canadian Alliance):

Mr. Charles Hubbard (Miramichi, Lib.):
The petitioners are concerned with the high incidence of breast cancer in Canada.  
Mr. David Iftody (Provencher, Lib.):
The first petition deals with section 43 amendments to the criminal code. 
Mr. David Iftody (Provencher, Lib.):
Mr. David Iftody (Provencher, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions. 
The first is on the subject of breast cancer.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Question No. Q-80 will be answered today. 
Question No. 80- Mr. Peter MacKay: 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
I ask, Mr. Speaker, that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like Motion No. P-17 to be called.  
Motion No. P-17 
The motion is transferred for debate.  
Motion No. P-10 
I would therefore would ask the hon. member to withdraw his motion.  
Hon. Ralph E. Goodale:
The motion is transferred for debate.  
BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 2000 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Budget 2000 is an historic budget. 
He said that the days of deficits are gone and they are not coming back.  
If we delay, it is Canadians who will suffer.  
I would now like to discuss each of these 10 measures in some detail. 
These are the highest priorities of Canadians and they are ours.  
It is also the largest federal transfer. 
Another key measure in this bill concerns child tax benefits. 
Budget 2000 does exactly that. 
This means that benefits to middle income families will be substantially increased. 
This bill ensures that money will be available to students in need.  
Money will be available for student borrowers and there will be no interruption in service.  
I want to assure students that there will be no significant changes to the program. 
I am sure hon. colleagues will support this measure.  
Let me explain the background to this change.  
Contribution rates are increasing in a phased manner. 
Bill C-32 also addresses first nations taxation. 
The Excise Tax Act is also amended in the bill. 
Canadians across the country are awaiting the benefits. 
We all know why this bill has to be passed quickly.  
I urge my hon. colleagues to accord speedy passage to this legislation.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):
He said some things that really need to be responded to. 
I would argue that if we did that, we would be passing it with waste. 
We have a crisis in health care. 
Canadians across the country are required to line up, queue up to get basic services. 
We are a country that spends a lot of money on health care already. 
In the interim they cut it down as low as $12.2 billion. 
What about tax points?  
I hear my hon. friend. 
That agreement was made 23 years ago. 
At what point does that money belong to the provinces? 
I do not think that is dealing with the problem. 
I would argue it is trying to shift the blame to the provinces. 
It has completely abdicated its responsibility.  
What are other examples of huge problems which the government did not address? 
I would argue that the government is not telling Canadians the whole story.  
What are some of the other problems that are not addressed in the budget? 
It has finally risen about 5% over the last 10 years. 
Does the budget deal with that problem?  
Let us go through the numbers. 
My friend talked about the child tax benefit. 
What is the definition of a tax break? 
It is when the money is left in people's pockets in the first place. 
That is not a tax break. 
That is a social program. 
Those are social programs. 
They are not tax cuts. 
We cannot call that a tax cut. 
What about bracket creep? 
Is that really a tax break? 
All that does is cancel future tax increases.  
We are happy the government has done it. 
It picked the pockets of Canadians for a long time and milked the cow dry. 
That is exactly what it does. 
That is the real tax relief. 
We could go to Starbucks and it would be spent in a week. 
That is not very much tax relief.  
I will get into that in more detail in a moment.  
Let us talk for a moment about Canada's competitive position. 
It is time for it to start to happen. 
It truly is a concern.  
It is a problem for a number of reasons. 
In many cases, unfortunately, that means moving to the United States.  
It had to move out of British Columbia to Seattle. 
Clearly Canadian is now clearly not Canadian. 
It was driven out by the tax policies of the government. 
When people go south of the border they win economically in four different ways. 
There is a huge attraction to the United States.  
Bill C-32 simply does not do that. 
In France it grew three times faster. 
The government should be ashamed of that.  
That should be a wake up call. 
We have an educated nation. 
We have a history of being innovative. 
These are our great natural advantages. 
It should put limits on itself, because governments cannot do everything. 
They do some things well. 
They can be very helpful even in redistributing income. 
Truer words were never spoken. 
That is a lousy trade-off. 
We would put it into higher education. 
They want an educated populace in the country. 
We could put it into health care. 
Let us make those kinds of fundamental choices. 
That is the first thing we do.  
What would we do with that $150 billion?  
It is their money.  
People work very hard. 
All they want is to be able to keep the money they earn.  
That is all they ask. 
They are not asking a lot. 
They just want to keep the money they earn. 
That is what happens too often today in Canada.  
How do we do this? 
The Canadian Alliance has a solution. 
We call it solution 17. 
It has three major elements. 
It is not the only one. 
Would there be a tax cut for people in the middle? 
We want to keep them here.  
The top 10% produce around 50%. 
Do we want to alienate those people and drive them out? 
Those people are the entrepreneurs, the innovators, the people who form the new economy.  
It encourages an environment where there is capital accumulation.  
Venture capital is extraordinarily important in ensuring that new companies get off the ground. 
Solution 17 recognizes that we are in global competition. 
There is nothing wrong with that.  
I do not believe in the politics of envy. 
Does it punish people at the high end? 
It drops the rate at which they have to pay and encourages them to stay. 
In fact it will draw people back. 
I mentioned Ireland a few minutes ago. 
Ireland is an amazing success story. 
What did it do? 
Ireland put more money into education. 
Another thing Ireland did was it bought some labour peace. 
It had had problems with squabbling between the private sector unions and employers. 
It dropped corporate taxes dramatically. 
It dropped personal income taxes and capital gains taxes. 
What was the impact? 
As I mentioned, its standard of living has jumped through the roof.  
Ireland is a country that for 150 years lost population. 
Its biggest export was people. 
Canada was one of the great beneficiaries of that problem. 
In fact, my own ancestry can be traced back to Ireland. 
When Ireland figured that out, what happened? 
Now its population is growing for the first time in 150 years. 
It has a growth rate which is through the roof.  
That could be Canada in North America. 
We could be what Ireland is to Europe. 
We could be the place where all the money flows to. 
The United States does not have to be seen just as a big competitor. 
It can be seen as a big market, as an opportunity. 
Why do we not mine it by making proper public policy decisions?  
It boggles the mind. 
Ultimately it picks losers and the result is we are all impoverished for it. 
That is so wrong.  
Well, thanks very little. 
I am not interested in that.  
Those are the types of public policy decisions we should make. 
Solution 17 is part of that. 
I have talked a bit about solution 17. 
I want to talk about some of the other changes that we would make.  
We should pay down that debt more aggressively. 
Some revenues are starting to come in. 
Let us make hay while the sun shines. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It is hardly a point of order. 
Nevertheless we will put the question to the House. 
Is there unanimous consent?  
I appreciate my friend's intervention, Mr. Speaker. 
Let us hope that they do not get a chance to. 
Let us hope we have an election before then.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
We heard many things, because budget surpluses give ideas to people.  
Some wondered ``How will the government strike a balance? 
Will there be tax reductions? 
Will the debt be lowered? 
Will social transfers finally be increased?'' 
The Minister of Finance once again mislead the public with truncated budget forecasts. 
The minister is releasing $2.5 billion for transfers to the provinces. 
This amount is both inadequate and a one time measure. 
The $2.5 billion announced for the provinces is far from enough. 
The budget for 2000-01 is charged to 1999-2000. 
This is a ridiculous level of social transfer, frozen over four years.  
As we can see, the minister is continuing his old practices of transparent management. 
There has been a lot of talk of clarity this spring.  
Quebec comes out a major loser in this entire political masquerade. 
Since 1994, the government has been withdrawing from housing completely. 
In fact, no longer do we hear anything about new social housing. 
For Quebec, this comes to less than $20 million a year. 
As for tax reductions, they will only come later. 
Let us make no mistake, indexing is not a real tax cut. 
In fact, with indexing, a taxpayer pays no more or less tax.  
We have to know where the responsibility lies. 
A black hole of $10.4 billion is no trifling matter.  
It is almost incredible.  
Where has the money gone? 
Was there political patronage? 
These are questions without answers, and this budget will not change a thing.  
Where has the money gone? 
Was there political patronage?  
This is worrisome enough when just one department is involved. 
The following comments are from the report: 
I will come back to immigration in greater detail.  
Spending is still a concern. 
The auditor general has found that there is a complete lack of control over spending. 
He is sounding an alarm. 
The report also reads as follows: 
What does tightening the rules mean? 
If the results take forever, there is a problem. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sorry to interrupt the member. 
The hon. government House leader.  
I am now pleased to table this article in both official languages.

NATIONAL DEFENCE AND VETERANS AFFAIRS 
I also thank the hon. member for Louis-Hebert for her indulgence.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 2000 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I will now discuss immigration.  
I continue with another quote on immigration: 
Moreover, there is no reliable computer system- 
This is almost unbelievable in the year 2000.  
-to track down all the moneys collected by foreign offices for visas.  
Another risk for Canadians is the uselessness of the medical tests imposed on newcomers.  
I cannot get over it. 
In my riding, I have the honour to have many immigrants. 
I had a look at what this budget reveals. 
There is nothing to rejoice about here. 
Their letter reads in part: 
The letter goes on to say: 
This is not the first reference made to stripping of responsibility and to impunity.  
They were so concerned that they felt they had to speak out. 
Quoting again from the letter: 
We do not test these products ourselves. 
You asked whether we are prepared. 
that consumers know what they are eating.  
I have been advocating this for a long time. 
I have been asking for the mandatory labelling of transgenic foods for a long time.  
I noted that projected expenditures for the year 2000 are $266 million. 
There is cause for concern.  
I also wanted to talk briefly about agricultural subsidies. 
I had also prepared a brief speech on small farms. 
The same is true here. 
Here, they have not even been defined. 
What are we to make of this? 
There are no programs for it. 
The department's budget is also getting smaller. 
As a citizen, I have no reason to be happy with this budget. 
The Liberal government is not controlling its spending. 
We are all demanding a return to the social transfers of 1994. 
As the agriculture critic, I am equally disappointed. 
These are ad hoc measures. 
They are not long term measures. 
I have tried to paint a clear picture. 
I would like the government to remember the important points. 
Wastage bothers me just as much. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
We have had a budget before the House for quite some time. 
It will probably be more than that. 
In many ways it is very difficult to project into the future. 
We have to work with the numbers we have. 
That is an awful lot of money, and we have problems in health care today.  
That is not the right priority.  
That is not the case.  
Therefore that is a dangerous precedent to set.  
After the seventies it started to pull back, to withdraw. 
We have a public health care system in this country. 
That should be our number one priority.  
Knowledge is extremely important in terms of building a strong economy. 
The government across the way is the real Conservative Party. 
We need a public system of health care. 
We need real progressive change. 
We need some social democracy. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, most of what this member said is ridiculous. 
I would like to simply ask- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I assume he was referring to health care. 
My answer is no, that is not what Canadian people want.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):

These are all worthy goals and objectives. 
A very important case for jurisprudence recently took place in the case of Mr. Francs. 
The judge rightfully came down like a tonne of bricks on the enforcement authorities.  
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
It definitely has my support.  
I agree, it is a non-partisan matter. 
In Canada we already have numerous measures against family violence in place. 
Let us look at some of them. 
As we are all aware, however, these laws have not always worked. 
In the past our society has been far too accepting of family violence. 
However, we have recently made some progress in this area. 
That is a move forward.  
Historically, family violence has been hidden in silence and denial. 
Human Resources Development Canada co-ordinates this joint federal, provincial and territorial ad hoc initiative.  
The reasons for this are clear. 
Therefore, it must be a measure of last resort. 
This brings me back to the issue of Bill C-223. 
It is very much a program with a specific law enforcement purpose. 
It is typically used in matters of organized crime.  
However it is only one among a number of options. 
We should allow for the possibility of a multitude of options. 
Spousal abuse is a serious issue. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Domestic violence and spousal abuse is a very serious problem. 
My wife and I have taken in a number of foster children. 
I can recall a situation involving one young girl we were looking after. 
She was around 15 years old at that time. 
Her father had an alcohol problem. 
It was a very sad situation.  
I would like to provide some background with respect to the bill. 
The Witness Protection Program Act was passed by parliament in 1996. 
They are not covered under the definition of witness in the current act.  
Accountability is very important.  
It provided for protection agreements to be entered into and specified their requirements. 
The act established a criteria and process for terminating protection. 
Bill C-223 would improve upon that situation.  
It is not one or the other. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Canadian Alliance):
This bill would do that. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
This is a very worthy and worthwhile endeavour. 
This is a very arrogant and I would suggest deceptive tactic that breeds further cynicism.  
The slow reaction time of the Department of Justice unfortunately is legendary. 
There are many safe houses set up across the country. 
It would broaden the mandate.  
Other members have alluded to it.  
There are programs that promote this type of protection. 
There is often a great deal of intimidation and threatening behaviour that follows. 
It very much furthers the interests of justice. 
Forwarding the bill to the committee is a very worthwhile venture. 
It is a very sound, common sense initiative. 
It furthers the protection of victims in most severe cases of spousal abuse.  
The Progressive Conservative Party of Canada wholeheartedly supports this initiative.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Without getting into too much detail there is a cycle. 
Then there is the denial and then there is the make-up. 
Here are some of the more common responses. 
They hope that the relationship will get better. 
They do not want to break up the family. 
She fears for her own and her children's safety. 
She depends on her partner's income. 
She has nowhere to go. 
Her partner has threatened to harm her if she leaves.  
That is very significant. 
Both of them need help.  
This is one opportunity. 
I thank the member for bringing forward the bill. 
I believe he has some support. 
I am sure we can work out how to do this. 
Again, I thank all members for their support.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Canadian Alliance):
It was with the recognition that this is only one tool.  
I would suggest just the opposite. 
It does not just affect adults. 
It being 6.15 p.m., the time provided for debate has expired.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Perhaps I should not have been surprised. 
This Liberal government has gone out of its way to ignore these brave Canadians.  
The issue remains on the table. 
Other governments have had the ability to convince the German government to provide appropriate reparation. 
Our government has failed itself and failed these brave Canadians miserably.  
Over eight years later I should say it is almost too late.  
I ask the Liberal government to respond now to this issue. 
Let us talk about this issue.  
Mr. Bob Wood (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):
I now want to address the issues of compensating Canadian airmen who were- 
I am afraid the hon. member has run out of time.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
However we do hear about it from time to time in communities.  
I found this really fascinating.  
There appear to be linkages. 
Mr. Bob Wood (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):
Since 1980 the overall rate of SIDS deaths in Canada has steadily declined. 
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.26 p.m.)
