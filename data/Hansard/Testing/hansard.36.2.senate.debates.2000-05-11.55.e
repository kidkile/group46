Thursday, May 11, 2000 
The Senate met at 1:30 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Provincial French Language Competition 
Hon. Jean-Robert Gauthier :
There are 100,000 francophone students in Ontario, 26,000 at the secondary level. 
What a promising upcoming generation. 
As Le Droit would put it: "It is a fine batch." 
Clearly this competition encourages and motivates our young people to strive for excellence. 
As the proverb says, to participate is to be a winner. 
International Association of Firefighters 
Hon. Erminie J. Cohen :
The site remains one of the most toxic in Canada.  
Canada has no comparable authority. 
Discrimination Against Aboriginal Women 
Hon. Thelma J. Chalifoux :
The victims have suffered many years in silence. 
In a letter to the editor, one of the victims stated: 
This whole rape thing has really screwed up my life. 
It really affected me, my children and relationships. 
Jack Ramsey would not be able to tolerate all this pain. 
Honourable senators, aboriginal justice is another option. 
Aboriginal women have been crying out for help for far too long. 
Will Canadians ever listen? 
Nurses are undeniably the support behind the health care system in Canada. 
These measures will undoubtedly help alleviate the current crisis somewhat.  
However, we must tackle the real problem if we want to solve it. 
The nursing profession is doing its best to cope with the crisis. 
It seems that the governments are turning a deaf ear.  
However, it is not up to the nurses to act. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Her commitment to the literacy movement in Canada is both exemplary and total. 
I wish to both thank her for her gesture and congratulate for her efforts.  
At the time, I did not hide both my appreciation and my embarrassment. 
The publication, which, unfortunately for her, is within blue covers, is entitled "Engaging Canadians:
Report of the National Policy Advisory Committee of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada." 
Notice of Motion for Allotment of Time for Debate 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
That four members constitute a quorum; 
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
I note in reviewing Hansard that Senator Kinsella was prescient. 
Federal Law-Civil Law Harmonization Bill 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Legal and Constitutional Affairs 
Notice of Motion to Authorize Committee to Study Sentencing 
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Tuesday, May 16, 2000, I shall move: 
That the Committee report to the Senate no later than June 21, 2001.  
Leave having been granted to return to Notices of Inquiry: 
Delayed Answers to Oral Questions 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
(Response to question raised by Hon. Roch Bolduc onMay 2, 2000) 
The Government will make its position known at the appropriate time.  
Canada's security interests for North America; 
The Government will make its position known at the appropriate time.  
Point of Order-Speaker's Ruling 
The Hon. the Speaker :
This is a subject that is best studied by the Rules Committee.  
There is no doubt that the current rule is restrictive. 
Only rarely are these requests denied. 
Senator Hays has raised his point of order to suggest a solution to this problem. 
Honourable senators, I might make one additional comment, which is not part of the ruling. 
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
We were listening to an exchange between Senator Joyal and Senator Murray.  
Second Reading-Debate Suspended 
...that the Attorney General does not claim secession cannot be achieved unilaterally.  
She claims only that it cannot be achieved unilaterally.  
However, secession could be achieved by constitutional means. 
Does this distinction have any relevance to Senator Joyal's thesis?  
The questions were clearly stated, of course, in the reference Order in Council. 
We all know that the court said no to that question. 
In no way did the ruling diminish the importance of the ruling. 
That is the unanimity clause, in other words. 
What is the first subject covered by unanimity? 
We know what unanimity means. 
Honourable senators will remember the debate that ensued.  
The Government of Canada bound itself a degree further in the amending formula. 
We all know its impact. 
I refer here to British Columbia, Alberta, and Manitoba. 
That has not changed. 
It is the convention of the government. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I should like to pose a question of the Honourable Senator Joyal. 
The other two federations also operate on the basis of those same principles.  
Would the honourable senator care to comment on that experience? 
Honourable senators, I thank the Honourable Senator Kinsella for his question.  
Those are the most telling references that one can have on this matter.  
There are different systems to achieve the same result. 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Might I ask the Honourable Senator Joyal for a clarification on that same point?  
Could Senator Joyal clarify that? 
He is saying that the indivisibility of Canada is inherent in that preamble. 
I agree with him. 
I also believe that the indivisibility of Canada is inherent in every single provision. 
Could the honourable senator clarify this contradiction for us? 
They put essentially the whole of the exercise on good faith. 
In other words, they did not commend the result. 
What have they recognized, in fact? 
They have recognized a principle of democratic expression. 
It did not order the dismantling of Canada. 
That is where the sovereignty of the country lies. 
Do not knock at my door on Monday morning. 
I am not there for this. 
It is not on the agenda of the day."  
That is where the principle of indivisibility of our country lies. 
This is a very sensitive issue. 
If you do not have a mandate, you are not authorized to do so. 
Honourable senators, I do not disagree with the position taken by the Honourable Senator Joyal. 
As a matter of fact, in paragraph 88, the court states: 
At another point in the ruling, the court states: 
That is the fundamental element of our democracy.  
I agree, but the court does not.  
The court made a comment to that effect. 
Where do you get the mandate? 
You get the mandate from the people of Canada. 
I do not read that in the judgment.  
Honourable senators, I find the arguments developed by Senator Joyal very persuasive. 
I have no difficulty in subscribing to the same objectives.  
This debate has been one of the better ones in which I have participated. 
The debate has been at a level that speaks proud of this institution.  
These principles are critical. 
They are about the life and death of Canada. 
We could leave this place knowing the country will be around for another 133 years.  
However, we have what we have, honourable senators. 
I thank the honourable senator for his suggestion. 
We have had a lengthy debate here. 
This chamber has listened carefully to each one of the speeches that has been made. 
It is a free, open and totally credible process so far. 
On the other hand, the bill is here before us. 
It has been debated and amended in the other place. 
There are other senators who have concerns. 
The aboriginal senators have spoken to their concerns. 
My colleague from Ontario, Senator Gauthier, has expressed his own preoccupations. 
The debate is taking place with all of us participating.  
I feel each one of us has to listen to the various arguments.  
The piece of legislation has been amended. 
It has some important elements. 
Each one of us might have a different opinion on it. 
I thank Honourable Senator Joyal for his remarkable contribution to this debate. 
This controversial question will have to be revisited. 
I agree with the honourable senator on this point.  
We must bear in mind that this is not part of the amending formula. 
It seems to me that this is what he is saying. 
I can scarcely imagine how there could be negotiation without a referendum, mind you. 
Does the honourable senator agree with this assertion?  
It has a vital link to the political and constitutional structure of our state. 
In the United States, the Supreme Court stated that the federative union was indissoluble. 
Rene Levesque let it go through.  
Some provinces wanted to be formally bound. 
In constitutional terms, referendums are not binding on governments.  
Hon. Jean-Claude Rivest :
I find the honourable senator's theory interesting. 
I remember one such case. 
In an article, Professor Fremont surveyed these issues. 
It might still make its wishes known, but this would be illegal or not allowed. 
This does not dispose of the secession issue. 
The exchange has been quite stunning and certainly very informative. 
I am listening to this debate. 
I thought I had an answer, but I became perplexed again. 
It could take place here. 
I loathed the procedure we used in Quebec. 
I do not want that ever to happen again. 
I want fairness and equity and clarity. 
I come to my bottom-line question.  
This bill is called "clarity." 
We should have a clear question; that is right. 
We should know what the majority should be; that is only normal. 
Or is that not enough?  
That is my dilemma. 
How do I vote? 
Am I satisfied if we amend this bill to include the Senate?  
I thank the honourable senator for her remarks. 
I feel that the Senate should be included for fundamental reasons. 
I stated them yesterday. 
I believe that the honourable senator has had an opportunity to reflect on them. 
I will listen to the experts. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Are there any further comments or questions?  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, I have listened to, studied, and reread the speech by Senator Joyal. 
It often occurs in the House of Commons that decisions are reached prematurely. 
Advice has been given that a committee will be struck. 
I should like to have a comment on that, if I may.  
As such, it is in the hands of the Speaker to interpret our rules. 
I shall certainly defer to the learned opinion of the Chair on this.  
Do I interpret that decision in one way or the other? 
Senator Joyal : - in relation to the organization of our own work as a team. 
Most of us "pour faire droit au statut de l'honorable senateur."  
Honourable senators, I wish to ask Senator Joyal one question.  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, may I interrupt the debate? 
Do I have permission?  
I will be absolutely happy to defer, Senator Hays.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
If it is not controversial.  
It is non-controversial to me.  
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Noel Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I am able to concur with that agreement.  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, just a minute. 
This is a beautiful show of friendship between people, and you talk about "consultation." 
I asked Honourable Senator Hays if there were any surprises. 
Senator Joyal just hinted at how strongly he debated this issue. 
There are five of us who are not yet organized in a caucus. 
I do not speak for my colleagues; I speak for myself. 
There will be other speakers on this order. 
I will not object, so honourable senators can relax. 
However, the same thing always happens. 
At times, independent senators are consulted, while at other times they are not. 
If that were the case, then I would be at fault. 
I would have appreciated knowing about this.  
Honourable senators, I confirm the agreement on this side of the chamber. 
I am confirming that agreement, honourable senators.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I thank the Honourable Senator Kinsella for having raised this point. 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
The Hon. the Speaker :
The motion being discussed states, in part: 
Honourable senators, is that the motion about which we are talking?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
When will the motion be debated, honourable senators?  
It will be called every sitting day until Tuesday. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Whether or not it has been debated, I shall call for a vote. 
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
Therefore, the question will be dealt with on Tuesday. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
We vote against the motion!  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
Honourable senators, I rise on another point of order on this matter. 
I am not sure when that report will be made to the Senate. 
I am hoping that it will be as soon as possible. 
That report would then come to the Senate for approval and a voted.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
That will be the end of it.  
Hon. Jean-Robert Gauthier :
Honourable senators, I seek clarification. 
I have been here all afternoon listening to the debate. 
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
Honourable senators, I should also like to have something clarified. 
Do those names have anything to do with the motion?  
The Honourable Senator Taylor has asked two questions. 
The answer to his first question is yes. 
The motion is to strike a 15-person committee. 
In accordance with the division of 15-person committees, we have named nine government senators.  
Honourable senators, I have two points of clarification. 
That leads to the second point of clarification. 
What are we agreeing to here?  
Honourable senators, that is a hypothetical question - and many such questions might be put. 
I do not know how much detail to go into. 
This has occurred in the Senate before and we have rulings on the issue. 
Perhaps we could have occasion to go over that. 
I do not think it is a problem.  
You were told that before the referendum last time.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, perhaps I can help Senator Taylor and his colleagues. 
Therefore, applications on the other side are more than welcome.  
Am I able to apply as well?  
Send your name in with three references.  
We need a reference from your chairman.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Let us come back to the procedural matter.  
We could do that, or I simply will not move the motion. 
If I were you I would leave it there.  
My preference would be to leave it there.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
That is the agreement. 
The house is agreed. 
We will proceed on that basis.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The house has agreed. 
That is the understanding.  
I should now like to move to another matter of importance. 
It relates to item No. 4 under Government Business.  
Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) Bill 
Second Reading-Order Withdrawn 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
There are several of them. 
Accordingly, what we have referred to in Item No. 4 is not correct. 
The error appears to be of a clerical nature, but it is a substantial error. 
I would propose that we deal with this through unanimous consent. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, as a word of explanation, what does this imply? 
I will cooperate on this issue.  
I appreciate your agreement to cooperate, Senator Prud'homme.  
The difficulty, senator, is that you must realize that senators talk to each other. 
Some say that I am shy. 
Thank you Senator Prud'homme. 
It was given first reading on Monday.  
They are referred to in the second report of that committee. 
There are several of them, and they are substantive. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, I thank Senator Hays for that explanation and for that hasty correction.  
Perhaps someone could move the adjournment.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
We now move to further debate.  
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Therefore, I will not attempt to replicate or retrace too extensively his arguments.  
How can one not support the objectives of such a measure? 
Yet, a devil lurks in the details. 
The drafters of this bill neglected the Senate. 
The legislative role of the Senate is undisputed. 
Yet, this bill mysteriously fails to follow the express provisions of the Constitution.  
Honourable senators, what are we to do? 
This surely is a most dangerous course for the advocates of this bill to follow. 
Honourable senators, let us look at the validity of this bill through different prisms. 
What of constitutional conventions? 
What of the express powers and privileges of the Senate? 
Are these binding resolutions, in pith and substance, legislative acts? 
This bill, Bill C-20, is not an exercise in political science. 
The resolutions sought may lead to the dismemberment of Canada. 
The law, Roper, the law. 
I know what's legal not what's right. 
And I'll stick to what is legal...  
So now you'd give the Devil benefit of law!  
Cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil?  
I'd cut down every law in England to do that!  
Honourable senators, this bill embarks us on a historic voyage. 
We should navigate with caution and with care. 
The country may be at stake.  
With the honourable senator's permission, I wish to ask him a question.  
What amendments can we make that would repair that difficulty?  
We had a full and fair hearing. 
We had all of the views reflected. 
At the end of that process, I would expect to come to an appropriate conclusion.  
My preliminary belief is that this bill is flawed. 
That was my next with question.  
Who are we to stand up against the Supreme Court of Canada? 
Well, I will tell you who we are. 
Indeed, Senator Joyal was, I thought, at some pains not to do so either. 
Perhaps that reflects their professional training.  
No one wants to criticize the court unnecessarily, I least of all.  
Let me take up one point that the honourable senator made. 
The good news is that it is advisory only. 
I have the opinion here. 
I believe I am quoting almost word for word.  
What does my friend make of all that?  
Honourable senators, there are three issues. 
I will try to deal with them shortly, if I can.  
It is not a judgment; it is an opinion. 
An opinion is much different from a judgment. 
I do not think they are bound by stare decisis .  
I was the only senator who attended at the final arguments on the advisory opinion. 
Speaking for myself, I was displeased with the argument that was made at that time.  
By the government and by the parties to the opinion. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I do not understand what just happened. 
Was that a motion of some kind? 
It seems to me that the request for time should come from Senator Grafstein.  
Senator Cools has asked whether or not this is proper. 
The ruling states at page 4: 
We cannot, however, discuss and debate a ruling. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
A 15-minute extension has been granted to Senator Grafstein.  
Thank you, honourable senators.  
Let me conclude on the third issue. 
I have covered the first two.  
I find the bill curious. 
It can mean "an opinion." 
With the House of Commons, the executive can seek a non-binding resolution. 
The two Houses do that all the time.  
This resolution is different. 
Is this resolution, in pith and substance, a legislative act? 
I believe it is. 
If it is not, I have no quarrel. 
Honourable senators, this is an important point. 
It goes to the question of the powers of the Senate. 
It goes to the question of the prerogatives of the Senate. 
That will take time, senator.  
It will not take that much time. 
I do not believe it will be a laborious exercise. 
For me, it will not take much time.  
Will the Honourable Senator Grafstein take a question?  
I believe Senator Murray is absolutely right. 
That is not my question. 
I understand that constitutions operate positively, not negatively. 
My question to Senator Grafstein is whether he has addressed this particular question. 
I have two points, and I will not be exhaustive. 
It is very wrong.  
Senator Grafstein : - that they are bound by an advisory opinion. 
I leave that for this government or future governments to address. 
In my view, they are not bound by the opinion. 
It is an advisory opinion.  
The Province of Quebec has been on all sides of this particular question. 
They agree or disagree depending on the time of day.  
Senator Cools raises another interesting question. 
As quickly as they could, therefore, they established Congress. 
They insisted that Congress adopt the articles that were presented by the convention.  
Who speaks for whom? 
Who speaks for the new or the old? 
I shall tell you who speaks for Canada. 
The Parliament of Canada speaks for Canada. 
I agree absolutely with Senator Grafstein. 
I thank the senator for his addition to the subject.  
Honourable senators, I have studied a fair amount about the American Civil War. 
There is then a safeguard for the limitation of the executive's prerogative. 
That question should be raised and carefully explored by the committee.  
On motion of Senator Hays, for Senator Cools, debate adjourned.  
Third Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
The main registered political parties must maintain transparent financial activities. 
To that end, the present legislation requires each registered party to have a chief agent. 
National parties are required to submit detailed reports. 
The Lortie commission and the Chief Electoral Officer were even more specific. 
What they asked is not complicated. 
They asked for transparency. 
There is transparency at the national level. 
It is so good that our system serves as a model all over the world.  
However, there is a grey area. 
The Chief Electoral Officer said so in his 1996 report. 
What happens when a riding association changes executive? 
This is a very slippery slope. 
And it is a good thing we did.  
If I like them, I will support them.  
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
( a ) by replacing line 27 with the following: 
(1) A registered party shall, subject to"; 
( b ) by replacing line 32 with the following: 
"registered party shall appoint a person, to be"; 
( c ) by adding the following after line 36: 
"(3) The registration of an electoral district agent is valid 
( a ) until the appointment of the electoral district agent is revoked by the political party; 
(4) Outside an election period, the electoral district agent of a registered party is: 
( a ) responsible for all financial operations of the electoral district association of the party; and 
(5) The annual financial transactions return referred to in subsection (4) must set out 
( b ) the number of contributors in each class listed in paragraph ( a ); 
(i) disputed claims under section 421, and 
Honourable senators, I move, seconded by the Honourable Senator Prud'homme:

(ii) by replacing line 20 with the following: 
Honourable senators, I move, seconded by the Honourable Senator Prud'homme: 
"registered party or to a registered agent of that registered party in the".  
Honourable senators, I move, seconded by the Honourable Senator Prud'homme: 
Honourable senators, I move, seconded by the Honourable Senator Prud'homme: 
(a) by replacing line 18 with the following: 
"ceipt with the Minister, signed by the chief agent or a registered"; and 
(b) by replacing line 25 with the following: 
" (a) by the chief agent or a registered agent of a registered" 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, is leave granted for Senator Nolin to present seven amendments?  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Shall I dispense with the reading of the seven amendments?  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
This is an initiative with which I am not totally unsympathetic. 
At the heart of that is the way in which we elect our representatives. 
Senator Nolin referred to the important role of the Chief Electoral Officer. 
Therefore, I urge honourable senators not to vote in favour of them. 
I would be happy to answer questions or receive comments.  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators know that I was elected nine times. 
I never spent more than $25,000 to get elected in any election. 
The Liberal Party should be thankful that he was president. 
There are others here in the Senate who held the same position.  
I was probably a smaller apparatchik of my party. 
I see that Senator Milne is also here. 
She is highly knowledgeable about the hanky-panky of politics. 
I do not expect Senator Hays to support the amendments. 
I seconded them for the pleasure of discussing them. 
Does he agree that something will have to be done? 
I do not think that is fair or correct. 
Everyone is agreed that something must be done. 
Honourable senators, Senator Prud'homme is right. 
The honourable senator asks if I agree that something will have to be done. 
He refers to the precedent of the provinces. 
His own amendment indicates the direction in which we are going. 
That is the economic accountability issue to which I referred.  
I think our democracy is healthy. 
That is the best answer I can give, honourable senators. 
It is already improved in the provinces for 80 per cent of Canadians.  
They were comments intended to describe parties in a generic or an abstract way. 
We would feel better about it then. 
This question arises again and again in public life:
Who should be exercising power? 
If these parties do not know what is happening, they should. 
I believe that for the most part they are knowledgeable. 
Do they have every bit of knowledge that they should have? 
Would they have it if your amendment were passed and in force in five years? 
The system is working well. 
It is healthy and improved. 
At the next revision of the act, we will see another measure of that progression.  
We will require greater disclosure and accountability. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, I want to make a comment on this particular bill.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is permission granted, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
She said, "I have been accused of hanky panky." 
I hope she was not referring to one of us. 
Perhaps it came from her neighbour. 
It did not come from this side.  
I am at the age where I could consider that a compliment!  
On motion of Senator Taylor, debate adjourned.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
