CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY ACT 
Bill C-19. Second reading 
EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 86 
Friday, April 14, 2000 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY ACT 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
I repeat ``gives the new institution a chance to survive''.  
-and to progressively develop its activities and authority. 
The term ``international criminal court'' is an unusual one in itself. 
The truly revolutionary aspect of it is the combination of the three. 
This is our hope and objective.  
What crimes will the international criminal court deal with? 
There are four different types. 
There is the genocide, which is defined as follows: 
Crimes against humanity are also included. 
War crimes are defined as: 
(a) grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949- 
All manner of horrors were perpetrated.  
How did this idea of an international court arise therefore? 
In fact, it was the first international criminal justice organization.  
At Nuremberg, victims were only witnesses, not complainants or civil parties. 
It was the states that judged.  
The project was the result of certain events, it must be said. 
The international law commission was making no progress. 
It is important to keep these two conditions in mind. 
The first reason given is to ensure justice for all.  
I will quote Kofi Annan: 
And yet they have. 
In Cambodia, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in Rwanda. 
Justice for all means the end of impunity.  
That is what impunity is all about.  
There is nothing that we can do against these people.  
How can they say that? 
Some claim that the Rome Statute could deter future war criminals. 
What progress has been made to date? 
Eight countries have made the move.  
Which countries have ratified this treaty? 
On July 20, two days after the treaty was adopted, she wrote the following: 
The new international criminal court is a very incomplete step in the fight against impunity.  
She poses a number of questions. 
She goes on to say: 
Where would the jurisdiction of national courts end and that of the international court begin?  
Again quoting Lise Bissonnette: 
The most sordid recent example- 
It dates back to 1998. 
This is a harsh judgment, but one that is worthwhile. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
These include genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. 
Too many lives have been taken. 
In response to this problem, Bill C-19 is a great achievement.  
Offences within Canada are encompassed in clause 4 of the bill. 
Obviously there is the burden of proof on the crown. 
After the war Mr. Finta fled to Canada. 
The burden of proof here relies very much on the qualification of the unlawful act.  
The hon. member will have 12 minutes remaining after question period.  
NATIONAL DAY OF MOURNING 
Mr. Rick Limoges (Windsor-St. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Canadian Alliance):
This is $4,000 more than the government's failed AIDA program.  
However, this government appears to be deaf. 
The Liberals still refuse to act.  
Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):
Joe served five terms as a councillor in the former City of Scarborough. 
Let's build a better community together.  
He worked tirelessly on many election campaigns at all levels. 
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia, Lib.):
The rest is just survey stakes and politics''. 
Our west was opened with treaties, not wars. 
Heston says ``We share a border that's more a myth than a fact''. 
Charlton Heston may think that our shared border is a myth. 
We do not want the American gun culture crossing that line.  
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
This is great news for rail passenger service in Canada. 
This is no longer the case.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):
His spin doctors are panicking and working overtime. 
The Prime Minister does not understand what he is talking about. 
I do not have to discuss the situation between those two countries''. 
For him, any two countries in the region.  
Mr. Marcel Proulx (Hull-Aylmer, Lib.):
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
With its surpluses, it could renew strategic agreements for highway improvements with the provinces.  
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
This is a strong step forward to protect the biodiversity of our natural environment. 
I congratulate the minister for his work thus far.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. John Maloney (Erie-Lincoln, Lib.):
``THE TRUE NAMES OF BIRDS'' 
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
There are more ways to abandon a child 
than to leave them at the mouth of the woods 
Sometimes, by the time you find them they've made up names 
for all of the birds and constellations and they've broken 
their reflections in the lake with sticks 
With my daughter came promises and vows 
that unfolded through time like a roadmap and led me 
to myself as a child, filled with wonder for my father 
who could make sound from a wide blade of grass 
Here, in the stillness of the forest, 
the sun columning before me temple-ancient, 
that wonder is what I regret losing most, that wonder 
and the true name of birds 
PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA 
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, ``You may see problems, I do not see any''. 
Those are the words of our Prime Minister in his travels in the Middle East. 
Never have we seen the cartoonists having such a heyday.  
We would laugh, if it were not so pathetic. 
The rest of the world can now bear witness to the fact.  
Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre-Rosedale, Lib.):
No issue was too small to merit their attention. 
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Therefore, diabetes is a major public health issue.  
THE SECOND BATTLE OF YPRES 
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
The most disastrous and horrible battle took place at Saint-Julien. 
Canadians must never forget the sacrifice made by the victims- 
The hon. member for Edmonton East.  
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, congratulations to Edmonton North District Area Council Two. 
Volunteers give freely of their daily lives. 
I extend a sincere thanks to everyone for their good efforts.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Canadian Alliance):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Canadian Alliance):
She rejects an inquiry. 
She rejects revealing all the facts. 
She even rejects access to information requests.  
She has had a day to think about it. 
I would like to know what the explanation is today.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
It served the community from May to October 1999. 
The next thing we will find out is that the member is opposed to bookmobiles.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Canadian Alliance):
Now we see how Canadians are benefiting. 
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The people who live in those regions know that these programs are valuable to them.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, this is incredible. 
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister's trip continues to make waves.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
What a flip flop.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
This is nothing new.  
What will Mr. Bouchard have to say about that?  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I urge the member to reread Hansard .  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, some people must be very busy.  
That was his goal.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health.  
We think it should have happened a long time ago. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, first, there are differing points of view on that question. 
The hon. member has expressed one, there are others.  
That is what we are doing.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Let me be very clear, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Campbell is a former colleague and a long time friend.  
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Canadian Alliance):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Canadian Alliance):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the minister did not reject the need for a public inquiry. 
We are having one. 
The public has not asked for this. 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):
Instead, the Prime Minister damaged it.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
I am sure this will continue to be the case.  
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Canadian Alliance):
-suggest someone who has not fully grasped the subtleties of the different positions...In 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
The Prime Minister's mission is going very well. 
He is having very successful talks with leaders of the Middle East. 
The hon. member has quoted one person. 
That also has weight.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
The government cannot keep sticking its head in the sand on this one.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The hon. member for Vercheres-Les-Patriotes.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, such arrogance. 
The Groupe Videotron was forced to pay back its grant.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We have done that in some cases and the money has come back.  
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Canadian Alliance):
He has aggravated our allies and he has threatened a delicate diplomatic balance. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
The Prime Minister's talks are going well. 
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Canadian Alliance):
Today is day five of the Prime Minister's Middle East travel. 
We might ask what two countries. 
For the Prime Minister, it could be any two countries in the region. 
Why will not the Prime Minister just come home?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
That is the guy who should have been brought home.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Two-thirds of our new family supplement recipients were women. 
Women have done well by our reform.  
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry. 
That is exactly what Bill C-471 will do. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
The hon. member for Macleod.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):
Yesterday we got the documents. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member is criticizing the report of the ethics counsellor. 
The ethics counsellor looked into the matter thoroughly. 
In general, the ethics counsellor found that the Minister of Finance had not- 
The hon. member for Nanaimo-Alberni.  
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Canadian Alliance):
Why does the government refuse to issue those board minutes?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I understand that certain documents belong to private corporations. 
They are not under the control of the government. 
The decision of whether or not to release them belongs to the companies in question.  
Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
Can the minister tell us how much plutonium is coming from Russia? 
When is it coming? 
How will it be transported to Chalk River? 
That methodology as described by AECL at that time was approved. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
That province has been particularly well served by that agreement. 
I am surprised the hon. member was unaware of this.  
Other countries in the world are supporting their passenger rail systems. 
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Why is there a double standard?  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
This is why we have had all sorts of tax incentives made available to students. 
We have enhanced them fulsomely. 
This is why we brought in the millennium scholarships.  
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Mr. Speaker, was that an answer?  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
All of these have been enhanced in a way to make it possible.  
We do not believe- 
The hon. member for Essex.  
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the report released yesterday contains both good news and bad.  
On the positive side, the incidence of some cancers is down. 
But there are also troubling signs. 
The signals are clear. 
The hon. member for Battlefords-Lloydminster.  
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Canadian Alliance):
He has no independence and no incentive to come clean about his findings. 
Only two pages of minutes from six years of meetings, that would be an embarrassment.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
If I am wrong in this, I will be happy to correct my statement. 
That is the important point.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
We have been investigating and looking into it on behalf of the pensioners. 
We have brought a claim against the receiver. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Mr. Lawrence D. O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
We have eight more agreements in principle in negotiations right now. 
We are making great progress in concluding agreements.  
We will continue to release information as it becomes available. 
But most important, we will conserve our stocks- 
The hon. member for Ottawa Centre.  
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would not mind at all.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
I said just the opposite.  
The hon. member ought to take another look at the premise of his question. 
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
Hon. Gilbert Normand (Secretary of State (Science, Research and Development), Lib.):
We are currently looking at the issue and we will protect the public's health.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, problems continue to mount inside the Canadian Grain Commission. 
How has it deteriorated so much- 
The hon. Minister of Natural Resources.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my point of order arises out of Standing Order 31. 
I think this is something that the Chair might perhaps want to comment on. 
I just wanted to register my own concern about that particular event.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, it is interesting that this issue has come up. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
The Chair is ready to at least say something on this subject. 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Rick Limoges (Windsor-St. 
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Vaughan-King-Aurora, Lib.):
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions to present to the House today.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Canadian Alliance):
This is a wonderful petition.  
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):

Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I have three petitions to present. 
The first petition comes from a large number of people in my constituency. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance):
I am, as well. 
The last petition I wish to present is related, as well, to Bill C-23. 
I see that it was.  
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I have three petitions to present today. 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, Question No. 57 will be answered today. 
Question No. 57- Mrs. Michelle Dockrill: 
I am informed as follows: 
QUESTIONS PASSED AS ORDERS FOR RETURNS 
Question No. 25- Mr. Charles Caccia: 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY ACT 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
It is no joking matter. 
As such, the bill applies retroactively.  
The Conservative Party supports this idea. 
There is potential for prosecution.  
This is a good provision.  
Obviously there is potential for further legislation. 
The Progressive Conservative Party also affirms this principle. 
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Canadian Alliance):
There are some very vague definitions and in other cases, no definitions at all.  
However, we have some serious reservations about the international criminal court. 
We see the same problem in what is before us today.  
Therefore, we support in principle the idea of war crimes tribunals. 
That would be the primary intent of certain of those who are involved. 
There were secret meetings off to the side. 
This situation is no different.  
The international criminal court will have power to investigate. 
This is the direction many individuals are pushing this to go. 
Obviously we do have concerns about some of that.  
We should not give up our sovereignty.  
The letter from Judge Eli Nathan states: 
This was, Mr. President...our 
The letter goes on to point out and make the particular point: 
That refers to the resettling of people as they have done in the Middle East. 
That gets to the nub of it.  
One of the delegates, this esteemed judge from Israel, goes on to say: 
He further talks about his frustration at this politicization of the statute and the court. 
I mentioned before the matter of overriding our national sovereignty. 
legislature is presumed to respect the value and principles enshrined- 
In whatever international law happens to be out there.  
I also draw attention to something which may be of interest to some. 
That was a new one to me. 
What is enforced pregnancy? 
I think this is a beautiful and wonderful thing. 
Such tribunals would not be permanent. 
In effect we are signing a blank cheque. 
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I listened with interest to the hon. member for Wanuskewin.  
Genocide and war crimes are defined in the bill. 
Madam Speaker, I certainly appreciate the question asked by the hon. member. 
We look at some of this stuff within the International Criminal Court. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
They were not adequate during Kosovo. 
We bumbled our way through the Balkans. 
We talk in terms of aggressions that are undefined. 
What exactly do we mean by that?  
We have no way of recalling those people. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):
I will do an overview on the purpose of the International Criminal Court. 
It is designed to be complementary to national criminal jurisdictions.  
The contours of that future are emerging. 
Also enhancing human security requires establishing new legal instruments. 
To my mind that would be appropriate.  
When there are extra country bodies there is a concern about national sovereignty.  
There seems to be a bit of an imbalance in that debate.  
National sovereignty is a concern. 
I am not certain that I have the answer to that. 
I pose that more as a question than as a statement of fact.  
The second big issue for me is accountability. 
That is a buzzword phrase these days in politics. 
In my reading of this issue that is another question mark. 
It would be a very foolish politician who said ``Here is a blank cheque. 
I will use the specific example of expansion. 
I said before that one of the big crimes was crimes against humanity. 
That is a very broad categorization. 
During war crimes rape is one of the horrific crimes. 
No one would argue with that.  
Another crime under crimes against humanity is enslavement. 
To bring people under bondage is a crime against humanity.  
What if the definitions went a little further? 
I have heard from members of Arab nations that they have concerns in that regard. 
How would I prevent those definitions expanding? 
I mentioned briefly the issue of globalization. 
The bill may end up being supportable. 
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I value the opinion of the member opposite. 
I have always found him to be a very fair and balanced individual. 
The definitions of the war crimes would need to be pretty specific. 
They would have to exclude some things that activists might go after. 
Perhaps the eternal optimist in me is showing.  
I do not think my concerns are insurmountable. 
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Canadian Alliance):
Madam Speaker, I believe those definitions are not specific enough for me. 
I think my colleague is moving in the same direction as I am. 
If we are to define crimes against humanity, let us be specific. 
Most of us understand that these are major crimes such as genocide. 
Wiping out a population for political purposes is absolutely against everything I believe in. 
Let us not go down the road of politicization. 
I have real trouble with that in my own family. 
I sometimes think my teenagers practise mental cruelty on me. 
I hope I would not be confined for that.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Canadian Alliance):
This court is intended to be a permanent court with a permanent bureaucracy. 
That is a serious consideration.  
Even between ourselves and Europe there is a difference in how criminal justice systems work. 
The United Nations just does not have that capacity. 
I do not think the world is ready yet for a world government. 
Not every country that appoints people to this court would be democratic. 
Many countries in this world are still run by dictatorships.  
It is of very serious concern to all of us.  
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
Does this international court not have a good deal of accountability? 
The member said that we were buying a pig in a poke. 
That is a good metaphor but where is the pig and where is the poke? 
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Canadian Alliance):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance) moved: 
I. That Standing Order 36(8) be amended to read as follows: 
That the Standing Orders be amended by adding new Standing Orders 36.1, 
36.2 and 36.3:  
(2) The committee's report shall be in the form of either 
( a ) a bill for an Act which, if adopted by the Parliament, or 
( b ) a motion which, if adopted by the House, 
That the Clerk be authorized to make consequential amendments to the Standing Orders.  
I just submitted three petitions today. 
That will fall on deaf ears. 
I will give a brief background about petitions and what they are used for. 
Virtually everybody in the House has submitted petitions. 
That is the end of the deal.  
I believe the issue has a great deal of support in the House of Commons. 
What was I proposing in the motion? 
Let us see how harmful it is, if it is at all. 
It is as simple as that.  
This is not happening today. 
They have come into the House and nothing has happened with them.  
They want to get a petition together and ask for help in wording it. 
They want to take it door to door and make a change in Canada. 
It is not a good process whatsoever.  
The motion is not votable. 
We talk about citizens initiative. 
That is what a petition really is. 
It is a citizens initiative to invoke change.  
When it reaches a certain threshold.  
Yes, I agree with my colleague. 
It makes sense to most people.  
I hope this does not fall on deaf ears after today. 
Hon. David M. Collenette:
The minister says I am cynical. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Madam Speaker, it is with pleasure that I rise to speak to Motion M-128. 
There are a number of things that need to be done.  
In a representative democracy this is a very important issue.  
What is the magic of a 2% threshold? 
It is an arbitrary figure. 
At present the House requires 25 signatures on a petition. 
All members take very seriously the petitions presented in the House. 
We should be using the private members' process, as should the government. 
My concern is with who would use this provision. 
I have a number of concerns. 
The hon. member has spoken a number of times about the importance of his constituents. 
One was the free trade agreement. 
Populism is the natural enemy of representative democracy. 
It has criticized the charter of rights and has referred to it as judicial activism. 
I could go on an on about this motion. 
It clearly will not work.  
The British House of Commons, therefore, served in a quasi-judicial capacity.  
This is still true today.  
Second, the standing orders require the responsible department to respond to petitions. 
One never knows what might be recommended back to the House.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
So petitions made this possible.  
And then nothing further is done.  
What did this deep desire for change translate into? 
The federal government has done absolutely nothing.  
I wonder how this could be done. 
Points 3 and 4 stipulated that: 
(3) the House undertake to be guided by this reality; 
Even the House is paying no attention to this motion. 
We are open to discussion. 
I believe that Motion M-128 opens the debate on participatory democracy. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
I had never intended to speak on this debate. 
I remember classically the words. 
So the member for Langley-Abbotsford I think touches a real nerve. 
I remember that statement vividly. 
Earlier today, I presented three petitions in the House. 
In the final analysis there is nothing wrong with this. 
They still have to have a voice in this place.  
I think that parliament is in the process of being reformed. 
One way it is being reformed is by opening up Private Members' Business. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance):
I want to make a couple of comments about the comments that were made. 
Is it any wonder people do not vote Progressive Conservative today. 
That should be quite irrelevant. 
It is what the majority of Canadians think that matters.  
The bottom line is that petitions are indicators in our society that people want change. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The time provided for the consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
(The House adjourned at 2.22 p.m.)
