The House met at 10 a.m. 
STANDING COMMITTEE ON CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION 
Mr. Joe Fontana (London North Centre, Lib.):
OTTAWA, Thursday, 16 March 2000:
This report titled, ``Refugee Protection and Border Security:
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, very briefly, I am a member of that committee. 
I see the hon. member getting to his feet. 
Does he have more information that he can give to the Chair?  
Second, yes, there was a confidential draft report that was produced. 
That would leave us with at least two things to consider. 
Second, has this been dealt with in committee? 
ALLOTTED DAY-HEALTH CARE 
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC) moved: 
I cannot stress enough the importance of this motion and this debate. 
We have to look at the motion very carefully. 
We are not suggesting that. 
It has to take a leadership role.  
I want to mention another important thing. 
We have a good system in Canada and we do not want to lose it. 
We have to acknowledge that. 
We have to move beyond the finger pointing.  
Too much of that has gone on for years and years in this country.  
We have a universal system. 
We want to protect the universality of our system.  
Truly, the taxpayers are getting a deal. 
I think most of us have to stand in our place and acknowledge that.  
There will be arguments over figures on this issue. 
I hear members opposite saying that it is 33%. 
I do not want to get into a rancorous back and forth. 
I want to hear some intelligent debate today.  
Most of the provinces cannot live with that. 
Madam Speaker, I am going to ask my colleagues to tone it down a little. 
We have a problem in this country. 
It is a funding problem which we cannot walk away from. 
The federal government cannot walk away from it.  
That $2.5 billion sounds pretty good, but let us put it into perspective. 
It is the prerogative of the provinces to spend it where they will.  
That would keep our system running for one day. 
That is what I see happening in this case. 
It will solve it six months or a year from now, leading into an election. 
The government would call it political opportunity. 
There was a lot of political opportunity in the budget which was presented. 
Let us talk about what we would do.  
Those are only a few of the things we could do. 
I look forward to the debate.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
This proves that people are silent when faced with the truth. 
I am extremely proud of my colleague.  
That was before the provincial budgets.  
We will wait for the final outcome.  
On this point I think the Minister of Health is right. 
This is co-operative federalism. 
So you have no funding problem. 
You have a program problem''.  
There are five basic principles that have guided us for years. 
What we are saying-Mr. 
If I give you more money, the choices that you will make will be different. 
It makes it easier to decide and to plan. 
Should we add one or two principles to the five fundamental ones? 
We should have a good debate.  
There are surely good ideas in Alberta. 
But why wait until the fall? 
We will look at the system in general, at the fundamental principles. 
Let us not try to go at it backwards. 
Of course we think that transfers should be adjusted. 
This is a responsibility that must be shared by all partners.  
Hospital boards are appointed by the local population. 
Then there is the issue of regional health boards. 
We are trying to involve the grassroots. 
I wish to move an amendment to the member's motion.  
That the motion be amended by adding after the word ``House'' the word ``strongly''.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The question is on the amendment.  
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Eglinton-Lawrence, Lib.):
It can only reflect our concerns.  
What is the solution they would wish our government to follow? 
That province took $800 million. 
These are difficulties that we have to address. 
As we indicated in the last budget, we are willing to do even more. 
We have increased funds for various projects. 
We have discharged our responsibilities to those in our care. 
How much are we talking about? 
Is it $8, $10, $12 or $15 billion in the bank? 
Could you tell us how much? 
You could talk to your partners about it. 
You could perhaps find a solution.  
They even went after Brian Tobin.  
I believe it is a matter of attitude. 
A different way of doing things.  
There is still some left''. 
If so, put the money on the table, and maybe solutions will be found.  
He has to put the money on the table. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
It is obvious that the status quo, the current situation is unacceptable. 
I will first deal with the plan. 
We are open to ideas and proposals that the provinces themselves will bring forward.  
Let me now deal with money.  
That is not true. 
The hon. member is mistaken.  
In Nova Scotia it is 47 cents. 
In Prince Edward Island it is 64 cents. 
In Newfoundland it is 52 cents. 
In Quebec it is 47 cents and in Manitoba it is 48 cents. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Would he agree to table those documents?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am afraid that is not a point of order.  
That is its policy. 
This motion is wrong because its premise is fundamentally flawed. 
We say that is not the answer to the problems we confront.  
There is a third option. 
The Prime Minister has now written to the first ministers. 
The Prime Minister has given us a timetable. 
Canadians have given us a mandate. 
The provinces have shown that innovation can work. 
Let me close by saying that this is something we can do. 
We need the focus. 
We need the commitment that is necessary. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am sharing my time with the Minister of Health. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
Let us get that straight. 
These are not figures we are pulling out of the air. 
I encourage the member and his party to join us in that effort.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
That is the figure that is accurate and reproducible.  
Those are the two figures that tell the tale. 
Transfers this year to the provinces are at an all time high. 
Let us focus on both. 
We are ready to get to work on each of those elements.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
I ask him what he wants to do. 
Madam Speaker, the government has already stated its position on this. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my questions are simple. 
Mr. Speaker, we have had this exchange before. 
The premier himself is speaking about amendments. 
We do not have the regulations. 
Finally, I have not been shy about expressing the government's grave concern. 
We do not agree with the policy of private for profit clinics. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
Does the hon. member have unanimous consent to table the document?  
Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma-Manitoulin, Lib.):
Simply put, the ecology of the Great Lakes Basin is too fragile.  
These are firm actions by the government to protect the Great Lakes- 
The hon. member for Kootenay-Boundary-Okanagan.  
Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay-Boundary-Okanagan, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have good news and bad news.  
Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):
That money could be used to enhance health care in Ontario. 
The constituents of Hamilton Mountain have spoken. 
They want and need this hospital. 
The federal government has shown its commitment to health care. 
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
LIBERAL PARTY OF CANADA 
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the member for Joliette once again displayed his ignorance. 
Nothing was done unbeknownst to anyone.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the people of Toronto saw a strange sight this week. 
Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Fanshawe, Lib.):
That trickle became a river during the 18th and early 19th centuries. 
Today some four million Canadians are of Irish ancestry. 
The hon. member spoke Gaelic ] 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
``There is an inexorability about the Anglo-Saxon steam roller.

HIGHWAY ACCIDENT IN SAINT-JEAN-BAPTISTE-DE-NICOLET 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
LORD BYNG SECONDARY SCHOOL 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
I come from the most Irish city there is in Canada. 
That is why I am wearing the green.  
Members sang when Irish Eyes Are Smiling ] 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
HIGHWAY ACCIDENT IN SAINT-JEAN-BAPTISTE-DE-NICOLET 
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
Our prayers are with them in this time of great suffering.  
Whereupon the House stood in silence.] 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
She has dodged this before, but let us try again. 
Mr. Speaker, the majority of the so-called 19 investigations concern ACOA. 
Three of them involve only provincial government shares in those particular grants. 
Only two of them involve money that was only from ACOA. 
In both those cases no money was disbursed. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
In other words, the minister's department thought that the law had been broken.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
It was an error done in good faith by an employee. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Fully one-third or 33% of the recipients donated to his campaign. 
This is all about political interference.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, these questions are absolutely incredible. 
Why were there $52 million in Nanaimo-Cowichan?  
They are there to support Canadian individuals who have disabilities, young people, those who want- 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
There are very few places where that kind of incompetence is applauded. 
I am sure she will get- 
We will hear the question from the member.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the information comes from the minister's own employees. 
She takes it as an opinion instead of doing something about it.  
We do not ask these questions just to watch the minister blush. 
Why did she not inform the police? 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Why do they not say that? 
Why do they not say that?  
If they have information then bring it forward or else- 
Hon. Jane Stewart: -admit they are wrong.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, several aspects of the Placeteco affair remain rather troubling. 
Will the minister tell us whether she intends to call for an investigation into Placeteco?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I am a bit surprised by the minister's answer.  
She told us to get in touch with her department for information, which we did. 
Who is telling the truth in all this? 
Why is it that we are being told that the project is under investigation?  
It is her department that has answered us. 
I will send her the letter. 
She tells us there is no investigation. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have answered questions almost on a daily basis on this file. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, this gets harder and harder to understand.  
Will the minister tell us whether there is an investigation under way, yes or no?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the minister presents a sorry spectacle.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Employees are working where they would not otherwise. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
The hon. Minister of Transport.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Perhaps that is through the standing committee. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Nothing has come forward so far.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
The standing committee talked about the renaissance of passenger rail. 
The government is committed to the renaissance of passenger rail. 
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
Will he personally intervene to make sure that these victims get their compensation?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We want those cheques in the hands of the claimants as soon as possible.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
That is a dog ate my homework excuse if I have ever heard one.  
We do not want platitudes. 
What is the minister going to do specifically? 
The lawyers got paid. 
Why can the victims not get paid? 
How long is this performance going to continue?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will tell you what we have done. 
We found a solution. 
The court has now approved that. 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Within weeks, two firms in the same sector had to shut their doors. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
We know that the industry association- 
We are going to hear the question.  
The minister just told us that. 
It was scaled back to $6 million. 
We also know that Iris Hosiery gave the Liberal Party $21,190.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member makes reference to Liberal delegates. 
Canadians understand what this issue is all about. 
They also know the importance of grants and contributions in the lives of Canadians. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
I imagine she has an answer by now. 
Could she tell us whether Placeteco is being investigated, yes or no?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I can confirm that there is no investigation under way. 
Again I will confirm that there is no investigation. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, we have a bit of a problem. 
Did yesterday evening's revellers- 
There is another problem. 
Could she explain the misinformation?  
Is there a directive from the minister to have- 
The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
She chooses to boast that Iris lived up to half of its expectations.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, let us try something else.  
It chases somebody right to the grave. 
It is called Revenue Canada Taxation.  
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
There is no investigation. 
I am looking into why the communique was given to the Bloc. 
I will respond to the Bloc when I have that information.  
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will verify that.  
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
The Prime Minister's riding got more money than the entire province of Alberta.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
The question is out of order. 
If the hon. Deputy Prime Minister wants to answer it I will let him.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member is making an assertion for which he has no facts whatsoever. 
Is his riding under investigation? 
Give us the facts.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
When I write something in a letter, I stand behind it.  
My question is for the Minister for International Trade. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this human resources boondoggle has hurt so many people. 
Why does being a Liberal mean never having to say you are sorry?  
The question is out of order. 
Go to the second question.  
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
The question is in order. 
The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
However, we do not know whether Bill 11 will become law. 
Premier Klein may yet qualify it. 
He may yet amend it. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
What is this minister afraid of? 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is quite wrong of course. 
She knows of this government's commitment. 
She knows the action we have already taken. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
They were even going to do away with the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Right now AIDA is seven times that amount in administration costs.  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
When does the minister expect to receive her Oscar for smirking arrogance?  
Those words, at the very best, are borderline. 
I see the Deputy Prime Minister on his feet. 
If he wishes to answer, I will let him.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
When it comes to his questions, he used the same language. 
His questions are all gornisht and absolute narishkite .  
I have no way of knowing whether or not those words are parliamentary.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
The high cost regions must be respected and kept connected. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
LIBERAL PARTY OF CANADA 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
My question is for the Minister of Industry. 
Will the minister be supporting this resolution? 
If it does pass, will he be ignoring it as he has- 
I cannot find a connection here to the administrative responsibility of the government. 
This has to do with a convention. 
I see the hon. Minister of Industry rising to his feet. 
I judge this question to be out of order. 
If he wishes to answer it, he may.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
The simple answer is not as easy as the hon. member might think. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
It arises out of question period.  
I would ask that she table that letter now. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
I will endeavour to ask whether the document can be tabled in the House. 
The minister is with us right now. 
All she has to do is answer the question. 
Is the letter translated?  
Mr. Speaker, I would be glad to have the letter translated and present it.  
When the letter is translated it will be laid upon the table.  
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
I was a bit surprised and I would like clarification.

Mr. Gar Knutson (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):

COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma-Manitoulin, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions to present. 
The first one is signed by hundreds of folks from Manitoulin Island.  
Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma-Manitoulin, Lib.):
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
They urge parliament to fulfil the promise of 1989.  
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
It can affect normal plants in the surrounding areas through the spread of pollen. 
They also point out that there may be long term genetic effects as a result.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Mr. Gar Knutson (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
ALLOTTED DAY-HEALTH CARE 
The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the amendment.  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
Key to our health is the food we eat. 
They distribute the good food box to thousands of residents throughout Toronto. 
We salute them for their work.  
The farm crisis in the country is real. 
Some people blame the farmers. 
Just think about the food processing sector. 
It is not serving Canadian consumers either. 
Wheat prices have not changed either, but bread prices have tripled. 
This says something about the efficiency of our farmers.  
In contrast, processors and retailers have tripled the prices they charge for their services.  
First, we need to maintain Canadian control of key industries. 
Canada is about to lose its railways. 
We may also lose control of our grain companies. 
We are down to one company that is making tractors in this country. 
We are losing that control. 
We must act now and immediately to renew the Competition Act. 
There are several ways to do this. 
It has just been unbelievable. 
The linkage between food and health care is undeniable. 
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I listened to the member speaking about the health care system and nutrition. 
We know that a good diet is necessary to prevent disease. 
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question from the member for Shefford.  
I do not believe that is the way to go. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the member's comments. 
It has jumped sixfold in the last couple of years.  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
I know that the member thinks that would be a real challenge.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Crisis is a strong word. 
It is not a word that I use lightly. 
Where are we with funding? 
Figures can be used to disguise facts. 
They can take the figures any way they want.  
Is it spending a share that allows it to call the shots? 
In fact in much of Canada it is not.  
The issue of funding is one which the public needs to be aware of. 
I do not see anything of that kind of commitment from the federal government. 
That is a component which needs to be discussed. 
I believe the funding needs to be predictable. 
Innovation is the second big topic I want to address. 
That is the minister's solution. 
This is the innovation the Minister of Health has specifically spoken of. 
The third area I want to talk about is co-operation. 
That is a fair comment and one which I share. 
The provinces are ready to look at alternatives. 
This fits with the principles of our health act.  
This is an issue that has received vigorous condemnation from many Canadians. 
What exactly is Alberta's Bill-11? 
I have a copy of it here and I have gone through it carefully. 
It sounds pretty straightforward to me.  
It would not be a full service hospital. 
This bill specifically makes it illegal to queue jump. 
It also makes it illegal to charge facility fees for insured services.  
The cataract surgery would be upgraded and made more expensive. 
The person can back out if he or she changes his or her mind. 
Any contract would be made public.  
He has said that in his opinion it is bad policy.  
They have not received a nickel. 
The lawyers have now been paid substantial amounts of money. 
The legal route was not the best way to see those patients cared for. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
I think I already know that answer.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I would ask all of you to please be as brief as possible.  
Madam Speaker, this is a stakeholder driven issue in many cases. 
The nursing profession has a huge issue in terms of health care. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
The member well knows that.  
The member needs to comment on the issue of accessibility, portability and comprehensiveness. 
Two of those doctors are in the Mississauga hospital in my own riding. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the member for his question. 
That is the real question. 
This is a multifaceted concern. 
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
There was no legal wrangling involved there. 
These funds were laid out and dispersed very quickly.  
The regulators let these individuals down. 
The tests were available. 
Krever said that we should give them help. 
This is a dreadful saga in Canadian history.  
Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, bill 11 contains an explanation of enhanced medical services. 
First off, should the government be the one that delists services? 
In my view absolutely not. 
The nursing and medical professions should certainly be involved. 
That is a very good and significant point. 
Here is my simplistic way of looking at it. 
They would then look at the bill. 
They would have to pay one nickel of the bill. 
I would like to address that.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
I will have the opportunity to get back to that later on. 
I think that is a mistake.  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
However, I do not see a quorum in here.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
We will check for quorum.  
And the count having been taken: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
We now have a quorum.  
Madam Speaker, I invite all my colleagues to take their seat. 
I have prepared an excellent speech that I would like to dedicate to them.  
We are waiting for the popcorn.  
They keep on popping.  
Let us stay calm and continue. 
Members can imagine how destabilizing that must be for the provinces. 
On a yearly basis, that amounts to one billion dollars.  
Madam Speaker, could we have some order? 
I feel so upset. 
I am a sensitive man and I need serenity to be able to work.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Madam Speaker, I ask that the clock be reset. 
We believe it is not.  
Look at what is going on in health care. 
Under the constitution, the federal government has two main responsibilities. 
It also has a responsibility toward the military. 
You have no business interfering in community health programs. 
Mind your own business and withdraw from this system''.  
Let us get that straight. 
Let we give members a few examples that will help them understand.  
In Quebec, it will take 35 years. 
In 35 years, one quarter of all Quebecers will be over 65. 
Various structural pressures are coming into play. 
What would we do with this $500 million? 
Let me give a few examples. 
This amount of $500 million represents 25% of the budget of Montreal's hospitals.  
I now want to give a personal testimony. 
We looked at the situation in their respective institutions. 
What does it mean? 
This, however, will not be enough. 
He has never been wrong in his predictions. 
He thinks the surplus could be over $95 billion.  
It is this government's responsibility to restore transfer payments. 
There are many backbenchers in the Liberal Party. 
Members know that the CLSCs are a rather unique model that we have in Quebec. 
What do we find in CLSCs? 
What is ambulatory care? 
This approach involves costs.  
Members will see that it is a huge budget item.  
I will have the opportunity to come back to this. 
I know I still have a lot of time. 
The $500 million could be put to good use. 
I will visit the riding of Louis-Hebert, Lake Saint-Jean, Laval. 
I will even visit your riding, Madam Speaker, if you invite me. 
I am aware of your tradition of generosity and hospitality. 
They are often a reflection of what is going on in hospitals. 
This is the challenge we have to meet. 
This is the duty we have to carry out. 
This is the best thing we can do in the days to come.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Did the Conservatives call for a quorum?  
Madam Speaker, the Liberals never listen to what the hon. member has to say. 
My question is a serious one. 
I do not disagree with that. 
I would like to ask the member a legitimate question. 
There has to be a somewhat reasonable expenditure of those funds. 
That is the reasoning behind the handling of that $841 million.  
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, the federal government has been putting money into health care. 
My question is for the hon. member across the way. 
I know Quebec did the same. 
It has $700 million sitting in a savings account in the TD bank. 
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, that is an excellent question. 
I wish to thank the hon. member for such a perceptive question.  
What is the first recommendation of the Krever report? 
What does this report say? 
What did the Minister of Industry do for these people? 
These people hid behind a mask of insensitivity- 
We will never forget this. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Therefore, I want to commend him for his contribution in the House today.  
It gets a little lonely down at this end of the House. 
The other thing that is very surprising today is to listen to the Reform Party. 
Let Canadians know what they are dealing with. 
Whether they say it or not, it really is the case. 
Canadians reject that approach from coast to coast to coast. 
It is something which we must take forward into the new millennium.  
As we have said earlier, that is a paltry sum. 
Hardly an expenditure commensurate to the task at hand. 
We have heard what the Liberals do in the face of this. 
That is a total distortion of reality. 
We know what the government is doing. 
It is throwing in tax points, the cash that is left and equalization payments. 
It is adding it all up and saying ``Look what we are doing''. 
It is only the cash that counts. 
It is the cash that holds this country together. 
You say okay, I will not collect this money, you collect. 
They just say this is our own tax. 
I was referring to the Mulroney government. 
The impact of these steps are well documented. 
That is precisely what is wrong with the approach the government has taken. 
What did we get instead? 
He is not standing up with anything concrete. 
Why will the government not act today? 
The crisis is upon us. 
We are at a watershed in the history of this country. 
Let us go forward.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
ALLOTTED DAY-HEALTH CARE 
The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the amendment.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
Madam Speaker, I was delighted to hear the compliments that the member threw at me. 
I have always known that she has been a big fan of mine. 
Now that it is on the public record, I feel that much better about it.  
On a more serious note, the member in all fairness pretty well covered the waterfront. 
We have had seven years of it. 
All they want to do is talk and argue.  
But is that not the case with the health minister? 
He can lay blame in all the provinces but he never takes responsibility himself.  
I would like the member to comment on that. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
There are three steps that have to be taken before we can get beyond this. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
This after all is their motion today.  
I listened to the speech of the member opposite. 
It does not add up. 
My question to the member is simple. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
Madam Speaker, we have been trying to do precisely that and have been getting nowhere. 
They did not want anything to do with them. 
What do they have to hide and what are they so worried about?  
The member accuses me of poor math. 
I can take that. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am afraid the member's time has expired.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Madam Speaker, this is a very serious issue that we have to deal with.  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point or order. 
You have already warned the member opposite. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member has a legitimate point. 
We do not comment on the presence or absence of members in the House.  
They added to the economy. 
The stress they are under is affecting their health. 
It has to be a number one priority for the government of the day. 
I am really concerned about what is happening. 
I am disappointed that the government would make the cuts it has to health care. 
They could not even go to visit their fathers or their uncles or their aunts. 
What has happened with our health care system is totally inhumane. 
Have they received their cheques? 
Only the government's lawyers have been paid.  
Yes, only the government's lawyers have been paid. 
What has happened to human society? 
What has happened to us? 
We are no longer there. 
I am really disappointed.  
What are they smoking?  
I will not say what they are smoking. 
They will have to tell me what they are smoking. 
Let us look at what has happened to the military health care system. 
They did not put enough money into that either in the budget. 
Has the government ever done anything for them? 
No. It is just like hepatitis C. No, it has not.  
Where are the priorities of the government? 
The leadership race is the priority.  
I do not know.  
Where is Joe Clark?  
We have to establish national goals. 
The Prime Minister needs to sit with them, and he refused to do it. 
We cannot understand why he would refuse to do it.  
The government has to discuss this issue. 
It is a terrible burden on all families. 
It is a terrible burden on society when this happens, but it happens. 
They are under stress, the stress the likes of which I have never seen.  
The coast guard was cut from 365 down to 65. 
That amounts to stress for all families.  
They want to stay home. 
The only way they can do that is with good help. 
I wish to move the following amendment to the supply day motion: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
(The House adjourned at 2.17 p.m.)
