The Senate met at 1:30 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Election of Canada to Human Rights Commission 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
We wish to recognize that election. 
This, I believe, is the third time that Canada has been elected.  
Contributions of Aboriginal Peoples 
I met him several times during my political battles. 
We do not recognize these contributions enough. 
Joe Mathias was remarkable among these people. 
I have always considered Joe Mathias a pillar of patience and hope. 
Imperial Order of the Daughters of the Empire 
Her granddaughter, Margaret Sellers, now lives in Winnipeg. 
Many of my fellow students received such training bursaries. 
Provincial French Language Competitions 
They were so proud not only of being recognized, but of being received here. 
In this area, the average annual income for these households is $16,000.

I hope that your stay with us has been both useful and interesting.  
Organization of American States 
Ratification of Inter-American Convention on Human Rights 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I thank the government leader for that undertaking. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, obviously the condemnation to which the senator refers was unfortunate. 
Honourable senators, that is a useful contribution to my inquiry. 
I will certainly add that to the material. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, I have a brief question for the Leader of the Government. 
A simple yes or no answer would be fine.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
By the way, those arrangements are not complete at the moment. 
I do pray for sunshine.  
I will have the information with me when I go, and when I return, hopefully.  
Effect of Proposed Cuts 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Is there room to negotiate? 
Is there room to save one or two programs? 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
In fact, it serves as a very important, uniting feature of this country.  
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I will undertake to have that information for Senator Roche tomorrow. 
I will attempt to get confirmation.

Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :

That four members constitute a quorum; 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, this motions stands adjourned by Senator Cools. 
She does not wish to speak today. 
Second Reading-Debate Suspended 
Avoiding discussion of these matters will not make them disappear. 
Was it the right decision? 
Only history will teach us what the wisest approach would have been. 
It is my purpose today to submit to you my conclusions.  
Second, the principle of indivisibility was enshrined in our Constitution in 1867. 
Let me remind honourable senators of what the preamble says: 
The reference to the Crown was not made in a casual way. 
Canada, honourable senators, is a constitutional monarchy. 
What does that mean? 
The Supreme Court explained this apparent silence in the following way: 
To have done so might have appeared redundant, even silly, to the framers....It 
is evident that our Constitution contemplates that Canada shall be a constitutional democracy....The 
representative and democratic nature of our political institutions was simply assumed.  
Canada's indivisibility "was simply assumed."  
How does that case translate into the unity debate today? 
Has something changed today?  
The right to territorial integrity is embodied in our internal law. 
That principle suffers no exception. 
What is the fundamental constitutional principle involved in any secession issue? 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable Senator Joyal, I regret that your allotted time has expired. 
Are you asking for leave to continue?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Between the Canadian state and the citizen there is a profound covenant:
Canadian citizenship is the seal on that covenant. 
The Government of Canada has no prerogative to break the seal. 
Honourable senators, citizenship is not a privilege. 
Citizenship is more than a right. 
Citizenship is the very expression of the inseparable bond between the state and the individual.  
I now come to my third point. 
Constitution binds all governments, both federal and provincial, including the executive branch...They 
He could abdicate, but the Crown would survive him, as would the kingdom. 
It would bring down completely the present equilibrium achieved in the Constitution. 
It would wash away the ideals that pervade its provisions. 
The sovereign cannot disregard the Constitution. 
With respect, I submit that this position is constitutionally untenable.  
The House of Commons already has all the means necessary to control the prerogative. 
I do not subscribe to that line of reasoning. 
We must resolve all contradiction before we can responsibly give our consent.  
The Constitution of Canada belongs to each and every one of those citizens.  
I refer to page 34: 
I quote from The Vancouver Sun of October 29, 1992,page A-5: 
Chretien added that all future constitutional proposals will have to be put to the people.  
The then leader of the opposition stated: 
The Throne Speech made the following commitment, and I quote: 
This is the reason why Canada became a federation instead of a unitary state. 
To quote Ridges' Constitutional Law of England : 
...while Parliament alone is the legal sovereign, the electorate is the political sovereign.  
No more, one under one dominion.  
This is where the indivisibility of the Canadian federation lies.  
Honourable senators, I arrive at the fifth argument. 
The Senate embodies the federal principles. 
Honourable senators, the Senate is an essential element of that group of three. 
The Senate is in fact the only perpetual element. 
The Crown's ministers may come and go. 
However, no precedent exists for such a practice. 
In such a case, Bill C-20 prohibits negotiations. 
The other hypothetical result is that both the question and the majority are clear. 
In such a case, Bill C-20 is silent. 
Where is the expression of the sovereign will of Canadians throughout the federation? 
This act recognizes and affirms and the obligations of the Crown. 
Let me quote the preamble of the Emergencies Act. 
- I repeat, "subject to the supervision of Parliament" - 
- to take special temporary measures that may not be appropriate in normal times; 
I have advised Senator Perrault that I will quote him at length in this connection. 
He stated at that time: 
The Senate will have a key role to play in the amending process. 
Constitutional amendments can be initiated in this chamber....the 
consent of the Senate will normally be required for future constitutional amendments.  
What we have to do as legislators is make sure that Canada remains indivisible. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
I believe those were his words. 
My approach in this debate, honourable senators, has not been political. 
I believe that there is a case to be made on political grounds. 
In that regard, I would like to use one word, "indivisible." 
The word does not exist otherwise. 
In my opinion, honourable senators, we cannot avoid it any longer. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I appreciate that the bells will begin ringing in a minute or two. 
I congratulate the Honourable Senator Joyal on a most powerful speech. 
...secession cannot be achieved unilaterally.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I am sorry honourable senators, but I must interrupt the sitting. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I have no alternative in that regard. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Welcome to the Senate.  
Third Reading-Motion in Amendment Negatived 
"(2) Not more than $4,000 of the total".  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The question before us is the motion in amendment. 
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion in amendment?  
Motion in amendment negatived on the following division: 
Hon. Jean-Robert Gauthier :
I heard only part of it. 
The Senate adjourned until Thursday, May 11, 2000,at 1:30 p.m.
