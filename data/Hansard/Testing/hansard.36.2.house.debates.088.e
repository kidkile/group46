Tuesday, May 2, 2000 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
They are asking for a fair tax system.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the second petition I want to present is on another matter. 
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
Mr. John O'Reilly (Haliburton-Victoria-Brock, Lib.):
QUESTIONS PASSED AS ORDERS FOR RETURNS 
Question No. 24- Mr. Garry Breitkreuz: 
I ask, Mr. Speaker, that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
ALLOTTED DAY-GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ) moved: 
Before proceeding, it would be wise to remind hon. members of the definition of GMOs. 
This gene confers upon them new properties they did not initially possess.  
There is need for this matter to be examined more thoroughly. 
The GMOs came on the scene rapidly. 
There is also a lack of knowledge on the effects of GMOs. 
In its speeches, the government is trying to be reassuring. 
It tells us not to worry. 
We should trust biotechnology.  
Currently 42 have already been accepted in Canada. 
Today is kind of an anniversary for me. 
There have been trends and movements about this issue. 
That has been the case from the outset. 
In an article published in today's edition of Le Devoir , I read the following: 
There is no doubt about it. 
So much for good intentions. 
Is there any benefit to producers? 
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Bloc Quebecois for bringing this motion forward. 
There are loads of material on this issue. 
The issue is a bit different. 
Allergies are a growing problem around the world. 
Genetic recombination can create substances and protein allergens.  
So far, fortunately, there has been no major incident that we are aware of.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
As for the rest, it remains a total mystery. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I will make it very brief for my hon. friend from Louis-Hebert.  
I must offer my colleague only partial reassurance. 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
I congratulate my colleague on her persistence and success.  
Hundreds of countries believed in this vision. 
The Liberal way of managing is unbelievably irresponsible. 
Of course, these preliminary studies must not lead to our rejecting GMOs. 
There is, moreover, another risk, a potentially serious risk to the environment. 
This might have disastrous effects. 
There is something called the terminator technology, which gives rise to plants producing sterile seed. 
It is therefore not surprising that some European producers are challenging this monopoly. 
It is clear that the federal government is completely ignoring this responsibility. 
I wish to make an amendment to my colleague's motion. 
The amendment is in order. 
The debate is now on the amendment.  
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to my colleague's remarks. 
I think it is a concern we share.  
There is also a great interest in the international protocol which the member mentioned. 
My question for the member has to do with the nature of labelling. 
Would that be the sort of criterion? 
Would any sort of genetic modification be labelled or would it not? 
These matters are very important. 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his interesting question.  
Labelling must be mandatory.  
We must respect the consumer's freedom of choice.  
We want to respect the consumers' choice and the farmers' choice.  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
I would like to give an example. 
As such, we are responding to the public's interest in this area. 
Its expertise is recognized throughout Canada and internationally.  
I believe the government is doing the right thing by taking this approach. 
Around the world Canada is regarded as a leader on this issue. 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
I am honored that he did so. 
I listened carefully to his speech. 
It is true that we have an enviable reputation regarding food safety. 
That is the type of thing that needs to be done.  
It is not enforceable. 
They can make that choice. 
They will have to make that decision. 
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, this is within the jurisdiction of the House leaders. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
He also indicated that one is already in effect in Japan.  
I wonder if he could clarify it from his viewpoint.  
Food is moved from one part of the world to the other. 
That is the importance of the discussions around Codex Alimentarius. 
At the present time a number of questions need to be answered. 
We cannot and do not want to go there.  
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Canadian Alliance):
This is a truly global issue. 
Regardless of the quality of science, good or bad, the result is bad. 
We have all seen the headlines calling for a complete banning of Frankenfoods. 
I do not really know if it is bad for us or not. 
I think every member in the House wants the same thing. 
The fallout effect of these things have been devastating. 
Can genetically modified organisms solve those problems? 
I frankly doubt it. 
Can they solve some of the problems? 
Are there risks involved? 
I believe the bigger questions are:
What are those risks, and, are they acceptable to the public at large?  
We all take risks every day. 
Most of us take a risk just getting up in the morning. 
This brings us back to the question of the need for scientific proof.  
We are not unique in our debate on this issue. 
There are many countries around the world that have entered into the current debate. 
Many world governments have expressed concerns over GMOs. 
Then we come to the rather delicate issue of labelling. 
We do not know that. 
Or, should consumers bear the cost since they are the end users? 
It would include analysis on non-compliance and/or non-specified testing or audit results. 
A few would say that it would be worth it. 
A few would not care. 
That is fundamentally wrong in our democratic system.  
We are the lawmakers and we should be the ones to make the final decision.  
Where do we go from here? 
Is it all valid research? 
It steadfastly refuses to study the number one priority of Canadians.  
Is mandatory labelling the full and best answer? 
Clear and concise labelling is important to these consumers. 
It seems more akin to the process used by organic farmers.  
I agree consumers demand choice. 
Has it learned nothing from the HRDC boondoggle? 
That is properly done before the health and agriculture committees. 
We need to have that done. 
I thank my hon. colleagues from the Bloc. 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
I listened to his demonstration. 
I think this would lead to a most interesting cost reduction.  
Personally I would not know the answer to the particular question. 
I am perhaps the first person to raise the particular point in the debate today.  
We must look at all sides of the issue. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate this morning. 
I will be sharing my time with my colleague from Kamloops.  
The issue seems in many ways to come down to one of the environment. 
That means it has to be science based and not based on science fiction.  
This has generated a lot interest in my constituency. 
To quote in part from a letter from the Hjertaas family: 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Louis-Hebert for the question.  
This is a developing area for all of us. 
It is to our detriment that we have done that. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
It is possibly one of the most important topics we will be discussing this year. 
We do not know what we are eating. 
We do not know the impact of the foods we are eating.  
There are allergies from coast to coast to coast in increasing numbers. 
It looks like they are all sad and crying. 
It is an increasing reality.  
There are increasing levels of cancer in our society. 
What causes all of this? 
This is a very important topic. 
I look forward to listening to the debate as it progresses.  
A number of elements of the genetically modified food issue are important. 
The article refers to an Albertan farmer who has recently made history. 
Mr. Speaker, you have a quizzical look on your face. 
Allow me to continue.  
This article refers to alien genes. 
The alien genes in this canola refused to stay still. 
By 1999 his weeds were resistant to all three.  
What is the point of this? 
What has happened since the genetically modified crops have been introduced? 
Is this an absolute Frankenstein system? 
Many people say it is not. 
Some people ignore David Suzuki, but a lot of people pay attention to him. 
These are the same people who said ``Don't panic. 
We should be concerned. 
That is why having this debate today is helpful. 
I want to thank my friend and colleague from the Bloc for making this possible. 
We realized we had to take this more seriously. 
We introduced a motion at our last federal convention. 
Let us look into this issue of labelling foods carefully''.  
Why would we not want to do that? 
We do it for all sorts of other things. 
What does the government do? 
The point is, we should let the consumer decide. 
Mr. John O'Reilly (Haliburton-Victoria-Brock, Lib.):
Allergies have many different effects on people.  
I automatically think of Florida and California. 
That would give everybody who wishes to participate the opportunity. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
As the hon. member is aware, we have a huge problem with peanuts. 
There are a number of people in this society who are allergic to peanuts. 
Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to my friend's intervention. 
That is all we are saying.  
I remember the debate around irradiated foods. 
Other than that, nothing else happened. 
For a scientist, this was not an issue of much concern.  
A bit of caution at this point is certainly warranted.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
The previous speaker has already taken fearmongering to a whole new level. 
There is absolutely no question about that. 
Canada is an exporter of a number of food products. 
This means that we must have confidence in our food safety.  
The opportunities with biotechnology and genetically modified organisms are phenomenal. 
With respect to food products, biotechnology has the potential too. 
We in Canada are an export nation. 
Biotechnology increases the yields needed to compensate for the increase of world population. 
We will be seen as the bread basket of the world. 
We will be providing food for the world in the not too distant future.  
That is not the case. 
We recognize that we have to remove and reduce our CO2 emissions. 
Biotechnology will create new markets by introducing value added products. 
There are a number of concerns. 
I have done an 180 turn on the issue. 
Initially I asked why we would want to have a mandatory labelling policy. 
Why would we want to mandatorily label 95% of products?  
That is what we have to do. 
That is where the federal government comes into play.  
Unfortunately I must tell my hon. colleague that I cannot support her motion. 
We may well have to mandatorily label. 
What will that do? 
It seems to be a waste of energy and time.  
What happens with segregation of our food products? 
The hon. member from Kamloops made some very valid points. 
Industry is probably its own worst enemy. 
Perhaps we have to move in that direction to make it more achievable for consumers.  
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I listened to the speech by my hon. colleague from Brandon-Souris. 
In this context, how can we export? 
There is a world trade problem.  
We recognize that commodity has actually grown in Europe. 
We need a global understanding as to genetically modified organisms. 
There has to be a global agreement. 
I am not opposed to that, as the member knows.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
Mr. Speaker, this is a truly interesting debate today. 
It reminds me of the story of two economists locked in a room. 
The more we listen to this debate, the more confusing it gets in a way. 
We all have our views on the issue which are all worthy of note. 
There are varying degrees of genetically modified foods. 
That would be an advancement.  
Many people are allergic to the Brazil nut. 
That just shows how terribly complicated it can become.  
In other words, superweeds have developed in some fields around the crops.  
It is a process that never ends. 
The same survey was taken in other countries of the world. 
The fear is out there. 
The agricultural community has to be cognizant of that fear. 
There can be a downside to it. 
It is an important one and it is worthy of debate.  
We want safeguards built in that can work. 
I am not sure that enforcement is the right way to go on this issue. 
Enforcement would be almost impossible. 
At this point, a ban would be very difficult. 
It would be very tough on the agricultural community. 
I think a great deal of study has to go into this topic. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
I find that I agree with much of what he said.  
Let us take a look at company called Monsanto. 
There is much to be considered in that regard. 
It is something for which we have to be careful. 
Mr. Speaker, my supplementary question involves Monsanto. 
Mr. Speaker, part of it has to do with share price. 
In politics we cannot be too far ahead of our time. 
The repercussions in some Third World countries would be devastating. 
They would be held captive by a huge corporate giant. 
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
This issue has been amply studied. 
Let us begin with the international context. 
Those were my comments regarding the economic side of the issue.  
It is a known fact that transgenic seeds are more expensive than traditional seeds. 
So how can the government have a serious policy on the future of GMOs? 
People have been fighting for 15 or 20 years. 
As a member of the UPA, he introduced these notions of organic farming.  
What would happen to another field farmed organically?  
Organic farmers have made enormous efforts. 
This is a matter of common sense. 
The federal government must act quickly.  
It reads as follows: 
Experts will be in attendance. 
My colleague has done a tremendous job on this issue of genetically modified organisms. 
She is really qualified for this type of work. 
There were about 50 people in attendance. 
They both helped me to prepare this consultation process.  
All the participants showed concern about that.  
The major concerns were coming from the big producers in my riding. 
There is definitely a fear of so-called terminators.  
Production costs vary greatly. 
As a matter, the local journalists had done a great job. 
Who benefits from that modification, the companies, the producers or the consumers? 
What are the benefits and the disadvantages for the producers? 
What are the issues revolving around this new type of farming and traditional farming?  
Speaking of traditional farming, I want to digress to ask a question. 
That is a question I have.  
What are the effects of GMOs on the environment? 
What are the social consequences of the introduction of GMOs?  
This is a worrisome question. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
I represent a farming riding, at least in part, a significant part I might add. 
As a former farmer I have a very keen interest in the particular issue.  
We know that and quite frankly take it for granted. 
We need to remember that and ensure that we keep it in perspective.  
Canadians need to know that and take comfort in that fact.  
This tool is known as substantial equivalence. 
Again this is important. 
Health Canada is taking the lead required in this all important area. 
I will give an example.  
We see that in a non-ending pace. 
Everywhere we look new technologies are coming forward. 
I am interested in it and I know my constituents are. 
Why do we do that? 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
I think, for example, of the principle of equivalence disputed by a number of scientists. 
I have three boxes of documents. 
They are petitions I have been sent, it is crazy.  
In my opinion, there is a lack of impartiality.  
Mr. Speaker, the reason I can say it is because it is true. 
The Bloc members should mention that when they talk about food safety. 
We as a government will continue to provide it.  
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
That may be true. 
We cannot take chances when these are at stake. 
Everyone has the right to know what he is eating.  
Who oversees these issues? 
Should there not be an international authority? 
Several authorities may already be examining those issues. 
Who will be responsible for legislating? 
Are my fellow citizens and myself being used as guinea pigs? 
I have no problem with that. 
I think this is a fundamental issue.  
I have often said I have nothing against globalization, far from it. 
That is what we need at this time.  
Of course this can be discussed in the House. 
Canada can adopt a position and then defend it in the international forum. 
We have a pretty good idea. 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
They talk about health, the environment and biodiversity.  
It is thanks to the civil society that we are talking about these issues today. 
The hon. member will remember that Biotech Action Montreal appealed to us on these issues. 
We saw this also in Seattle.  
It is simply impossible for any member of Parliament to keep track of all problems. 
In this instance, the voice democracy was heard. 
I hope there will be more cases like this one. 
I encourage all citizens to be more vigilant. 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
It was the first cloned animal. 
The same goes for foods containing genetically modified organisms. 
But it still raises several issues. 
Some people do not hesitate to call genetically modified foods frankenfoods. 
This is not very reassuring.  
He managed to do that through genetic manipulation.  
There are beautiful, unblemished tomatoes, perfectly symmetrical potatoes, corn, canola and soybean. 
Have you ever looked at these labels, Mr. Speaker? 
Of course not, but I am sure you eat nothing but butter. 
Many countries have already adopted measures to make labelling mandatory.  
We are talking about millions of people.  
These countries are all in the Far East.  
I do not need to name names. 
Everyone knows who they are. 
Farmers are therefore in a way slaves to a certain company. 
This does not strike us as being in the interests of the general public.  
This is getting pretty close to Aldous Huxley. 
Strong objections have kept this technology from being put into application.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
I think it is important that we emphasize that and that we understand that.  
That too underscores the commitment of our government. 
I have a question for the hon. member. 
Where is the $37 million hiding? 
Where did it go? 
Why was it not spent in the appropriate place? 
Why was it not spent? 
Let us hear the sovereignists answer that.  
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral:
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Who would object to that? 
It is an interesting concept.  
Actually, they were sprung cucumbers. 
They sprung a leak and never got off the ground. 
They tried doing it many years ago. 
This is not new. 
This is rather old stuff. 
It did not work. 
The market was not there. 
People looked at these things and said ``My God, what are they?'' 
They did not feel comfortable with them. 
However, it did not fly in the marketplace.  
I think we should.  
In any event, we understand that it is creating an atmosphere of fear. 
That is not true. 
That is one of the fundamental flaws of a motion like this one.  
It would not surprise me. 
We have seen it before.  
It is trying to turn itself inside out.  
I do not think there is any question about it. 
I have not heard its position. 
I want to share a couple of quotes. 
It is pretty much the same old gang that cannot shoot straight. 
He had his hat and boots on. 
Where will that party go with genetically modified food? 
Will it change its position? 
Will that be the case for GMOs? 
Will they line up and vote here? 
It is truly a mystery. 
It is an absolutely amazing sight.  
It is a mess.  
It is a mess in a political process.  
The member is getting worried.  
I am not worried. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I listened carefully to the comments made by the hon. member for Mississauga West. 
I heard him say the words genetically modified in his speech. 
That is why I did not interrupt him. 
Actually we are not sure how many parties there are any more. 
We know the position of the Bloc. 
I made that point earlier and I was being quite serious about it.  
We can fearmonger with any issue we want.  
The member knows that the government led the way. 
We are doing work in this area. 
I give the example of health products. 
We all know that there was quite a controversy. 
I am not a scientist or a doctor. 
Hopefully they will keep people out of hospital and out of the medical system.  
The research was done by Health Canada. 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I take this opportunity to introduce to the House a great Canadian. 
Boyd grew up to become a true professional cowboy and rancher. 
Boyd enlisted in World War II with the Canadian paratroopers. 
He was wounded in France and taken prisoner by the German army.  
Boyd is known today as a rancher, a writer and a local government councillor. 
He was president of the Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities. 
On February 9 Boyd Anderson was installed as a member of the Order of Canada. 
He is a true Canadian who I am proud to call my friend.  
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
NATIONAL CANADIAN LIBERATION MONUMENT 
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
We thank the people of the Netherlands for this wonderful gesture of remembrance. 
I wish them and all our veterans well.  
VICTIMS OF THE HOLOCAUST 
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):
Yes, Canadian taxpayers are tired of being fleeced by the government. 
Mr. Rick Limoges (Windsor-St. 
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the parish of Saint-Henri de Mascouche was born in 1750. 
At that point, its population was 542. 
Well done and thanks from the people.  
Mr. Irwin Cotler (Mount Royal, Lib.):
NATIONAL CANADIAN LIBERATION MONUMENT 
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):
Over the past year, Daniel Plouffe has been racking up honours. 
Moreover, his horse was named Horse of the Year in Canada. 
The incredible wins of his horse were reported all over America. 
It is always a great pleasure to celebrate success. 
All the residents of Brome-Missisquoi join me in doing so. 
Congratulations to Daniel Plouffe for an extraordinary year in 1999. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Like many things here in this parliament, this is disappointing.  
Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
The teachers are endorsing the recommendations outlined by the Canadian Teachers' Federation. 
The government has made significant progress in supporting the income of families. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I am not a Republican or a Democrat. 
I have a health card, not an insurance card. 
I listen to Cross Country Checkup, not Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh. 
I speak for people, not multinational corporations. 
I believe that Canada can have an independent foreign policy. 
Canadian taxpayers are citizens too who value our social programs. 
And it is pronounced medicare, not Bill 11, okay? 
My name is John and I am Canadian.  
PRIME MINISTER'S VISIT TO THE MIDDLE EAST 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):
It was the great Lennox Lewis who coined the word ``politricks''.  
That is exactly what we are going to do to the hon. member's party.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I think he has been kissing the blarney stone too much.  
It is plain and simple. 
It is just like the transitional jobs fund. 
The Liberals spent the bank in the lead up to the last federal election.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, this was not just some kind of coincidence. 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Canadian Alliance):
It cost the taxpayers an extra $100 million. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am glad to answer the question. 
Yes, we have used the government's economic policies to reduce unemployment. 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Canadian Alliance):
Prior to the last federal election- 
Hon. George S. Baker:
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is wrong. 
Let us recall what the auditor general said about the action plan. 
He said that the action plan prepared by the department represented an exceptional response. 
What is good for the auditor general is good for me.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
She ignored the experts' advice.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Again, Mr. Speaker, the leader of the Bloc is wrong. 
He should take time to do some research.  
Deloitte & Touche was asked to look at our plan. 
They made recommendations and we implemented them.  
What did we do? 
What did we do? 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, let us get serious. 
Is she refusing to act on the recommendations of these chartered accountants?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not know where the hon. member was. 
We gave them advice and the department implemented our recommendations''. 
What could be better?  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
He did not know.  
The minister is obviously overwhelmed by the crisis at the Human Resources Development Canada.  
Mr. Prime Minister, I appeal to you- 
Remarks and questions must always be addressed to the Chair.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
No representative of the government was there.  
There is no disgrace in standing together with Friends of Medicare. 
Why was the health minister not there?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the position of the NDP on health is always the same. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
He has now invoked closure.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
PUBLIC WORKS AND GOVERNMENT SERVICES 
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, most of the contracts go to public tender. 
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the auditor general always reviews what we do in government. 
We do not have to invite him, he is already there. 
When the auditor general makes his report, parliament takes account of what he reports.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Canadian Alliance):
In fact it was shut down in 1997.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
In fact, when a study is complete, that is the end of the study.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Canadian Alliance):
SIRC is looking into the termination.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
SIRC is reviewing this report as it has the authority to review any report.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
We did that and there are no invoices on file.  
The minister justified these grants by referring to the existence of invoices. 
Why is she hiding these invoices?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We are now up to 1,000.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
We contacted her department. 
We used every possible avenue. 
We did not see anything that looked remotely like an invoice.  
My question to the minister is:
We want to see them.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
If the hon. member made the request, he will receive the documentation, as is appropriate.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
When it does, it will report to me.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I again quote the response given by the minister yesterday. 
The government will ensure that this rule is respected.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, last summer 600 illegal migrants arrived on Canada's shores. 
Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
We intend to intercept the boats. 
We will detain them and we will have a speedy determination.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
We are seeking travel documents. 
That is their right because we believe in due process.  
That is good management.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
They are public documents, and we want to see them. 
Will she agree to this?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The response is really twofold, one at the national level. 
The question in fact is very pertinent.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Maria Minna (Minister for International Cooperation, Lib.):
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):
CIDA invested $59.17 million to reform the Vietnamese justice system. 
Where is justice reform in that system?  
Hon. Maria Minna (Minister for International Cooperation, Lib.):
Obviously what has happened in the last number of days has been absolutely unacceptable. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
We have done nothing else but make suggestions for years. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Closure has now been invoked.  
The Minister of Health said he was seeking opinions on this matter. 
What has he found out? 
What is the position of the government? 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
The answer is quite obvious. 
The matter is being debated in the Alberta legislature. 
It is the same old status quo from the same old NDP. 
PUBLIC WORKS AND GOVERNMENT SERVICES 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Some 64% of the contracts were untendered. 
The auditor general has condemned this practice.  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not know where the hon. member got those figures. 
The hon. member has all the figures wrong.  
I do not have to invite him. 
He is already there.  
Once again he has contradicted the auditor general. 
We will see tomorrow who is right.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
It is an independent, non-profit organization which speaks on behalf of women offenders. 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Over 22,000 firearms and components were seized. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Canadian Alliance):
This inaction has led to rate increases instead of reductions.  
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
The bottom line is that those reforms will benefit western farmers. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
There was no invoice in the Placeteco file.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I do not make those decisions. 
They are made in the context of the act of this House.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. 
The minister was in Newfoundland a few days ago. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):
Hon. Denis Coderre (Secretary of State (Amateur Sport), Lib.):
Funding has now increased from $8 million to $11 million.  
Once again we walk the talk.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Canadian Alliance):
That is why there is a 4.5% increase in rates.  
Will you end it with your new legislation?  
Please address questions through the Chair.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
It has penalized everybody in the system for the last 60, 70, 80, 100 years.  
This government has taken its responsibilities. 
Given the hon. member's enthusiasm, I know that we can count on his support.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Those are the kinds of investments that we feel are important. 
Those are our responses to the unemployed.  
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would never allow foreign control of newspapers.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  
That question is very specific. 
If the hon. minister wants to answer, I will permit him to do so. 
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
ALLOTTED DAY-GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS 
The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the amendment.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
I will let people think about that.  
There may be a reason for that suggestion or that feeling. 
In virtually every walk of life science and technology grows in leaps and bounds. 
There are tremendous advances, virtually on a daily basis. 
We should stop the fearmongering that this motion is attempting to bring about.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
Before Oral Question Period, he sort of went off topic. 
This was a kind of departure from the debate on GMOs.  
He seems not to be in favour of labelling GMOs. 
How much will this cost? 
Why is Canada one of the countries most vehemently opposed to such labelling? 
The European countries have adopted it, as have Japan and South Korea. 
These are civilized nations. 
I would like to hear his explanation of this. 
It is as if he had something to hide. 
We know what voluntary codes mean. 
They are almost never applied.  
Mr. Speaker, I am curious about the question. 
No, I have not done an analysis of the cost. 
This is where I have some concern. 
The question was about why we are not in favour of voluntary labelling. 
We already have voluntary labelling. 
I do not need to sit down because you do not happen to agree. 
Voluntary labelling is a totally different issue. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
I was interested in the Bloc member's question. 
I have a question for the hon. member for Mississauga West. 
He represents a great part of Ontario. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Canadian Alliance):
The biotech industry is important to Canada and is growing. 
There are 282 biotechnology companies in Canada. 
The issue is much bigger than just food supply.  
As a result it is paying penalties for that.  
We are talking about the same food with no detectable change to it.  
Farmer choice would also fall. 
No one has any problem with that. 
There is nothing the matter with that.  
Voluntary labelling would also correctly dilute the costs associated with segregation. 
Voluntary labelling would correctly distribute the costs associated with segregation.  
We have increased productivity from the world's farmers. 
We need to restore those forests. 
There is conversion of organic wastes into biofuels. 
That gives the companies the incentive to continue their research. 
The farmer, the lowest level, will pay. 
He cannot dictate his costs to anybody else. 
We have to look at the background on this.  
In any endeavour this is an impossible measure to meet. 
Had this standard been in place, we never would have had the light bulb. 
Child poverty has actually increased. 
We have heard about allergenic considerations. 
That is another red herring which has been brought up by other parties.  
It has been that way for years. 
Any food that could generate an allergic reaction must be labelled. 
As a result we have seen political interference and loss of confidence in that issue. 
It is the federal government that has really contributed to that. 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
How can the companies wash their hands of all this? 
This is not how I see events unfolding.  
However, I want to get back to the producers. 
I think we will have very good hearings on the GMO issue. 
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
The reality is that the debate is somewhat skewed. 
This to me is essentially what is wrong with this debate.  
It is analogous to the production of steel. 
This is part of the labelling process.  
It seems to me that what people want to say- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The hon. member is going on about steel, cancer and all kinds of things. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I will pay much closer attention.  
As I was saying, we live in very exciting times. 
For our farm communities, genetic modification is not new. 
We are consuming genetically modified foods every day.  
This has been very successful for the last 20 or 30 years. 
I come to this debate with some interest in the whole area of genetic modification. 
As I mentioned, farmers have been using this for some time. 
Just look at the great benefits that exist in genetic modification. 
That has done nothing but good and we will continue to do that.  
The great assumption is that genetic manipulation is somehow bad. 
The consumer is far better off with these genetic changes.  
There are of course limitations to genetic manipulation. 
There is certainly a moral argument that goes along with this whole file. 
We have a labelling system already in Canada. 
It is embargoing Canadian beef into the European Union. 
It is embargoing wine into the European Union. 
It is embargoing many of our agricultural products. 
It is important that we not let that kind of fear take over our communities. 
This is a great opportunity for Canadian agriculture. 
Canadian farmers have led that challenge. 
Canadian farmers have been at the forefront. 
I once had the advantage of visiting Taiwan. 
The plant will absorb more phosphates and more nitrogen than it did previously. 
Why is this important? 
This is a tremendous accomplishment for Canadians. 
People are concerned about genetically altered food. 
In other words, the people who are spreading the stories about biotechnology are not scientists. 
The bottom line is we have to provide more responsible debate on the whole issue. 
There has been too much emotion and not enough science. 
I would like to end on that note. 
I believe that is happening. 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
This raises several questions:
Why are plants and foods genetically modified? 
Who is benefiting from that? 
What are the benefits to consumers? 
What are the effects of GMOs on health and the environment? 
What are the challenges for agriculture and the environment? 
What are the economic and trade issues? 
What are the social repercussions of the GMOs? 
What are the regulations on GMOs? 
And what is the position of the federal government on GMOs?  
What are the effects of GMOs on health? 
According to Health Canada, transgenic foods are not dangerous in the short term. 
There is currently no analysis being done.  
GMO lobbyists are very powerful. 
They often do for partisan purposes. 
We all know what money can do. 
But it is often to the detriment of the public.  
They were so concerned that they felt they had to speak out. 
Here is what they say: ``We are not testing these products ourselves. 
Yet, these products end up on our tables. 
There are also concerns about food allergies. 
Why is it that more and more people, and especially children, have food allergies? 
But there are food allergy problems.  
There is no shortage of food around the world; in fact, there is an overproduction. 
So, these lands offer an opportunity. 
Proponents contend that all genetically modified foods are tested in Canada. 
Actually, GMOs are not systematically tested. 
This reduces risks while not eliminating them completely. 
No study has been done. 
Hon. Gilbert Normand (Secretary of State (Science, Research and Development), Lib.):
The role of the government is to protect Canadian citizens. 
I think that the whole GMO issue is being overdramatized. 
I do not want to stand up for GMOs as such. 
It is the same thing with drugs.  
We are also looking at what is being done in other countries.  
I ask my colleagues not to be alarmists. 
Secondly, I do not think that the Bloc Quebecois is fear mongering. 
We just want the people to know what they are eating. 
In addition, scientists at Health Canada denounced a number of things. 
I am concerned and the people I represent are concerned as well. 
So do not tell me that I am alarmist.  
I want to straighten out another fact. 
It took her one year of tireless work. 
I could mention those made on May 14, June 11, and so on. 
I have that list. 
It took the hon. member one year of tireless work, of questions and comments. 
Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):
I will begin my speech with a question. 
The Bloc Quebecois has taken a clear stance on the issue. 
This step taken in Europe should make it easier for us here.  
They were asked to answer two questions. 
The first one was ``Do you believe the general public is properly informed about GMOs?'' 
Here are a few of the comments my office has received so far. 
Governments have no regard for the public''. 
Or ``No, there is not enough outreach, especially regarding health impacts''. 
And again ``No, people are just starting to realize how huge this problem is. 
Labelling should be mandatory. 
It should be mandatory so we can make an informed decision''.  
They said so in a Leger & Leger poll published last month. 
Many questions remain unanswered. 
They are politically modified organisms.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Sherbrooke for his excellent presentation. 
I would like to ask him a few questions concerning genetically modified foods.  
Why do we genetically modify plants and foods? 
Who benefits from that and what are the benefits to consumers?  
They had a number of concerns. 
People were wondering about the impacts this will have on our food chain. 
They were wondering about human intervention in genetics.  
They were concerned primarily with ethics. 
They were wondering how far this will go. 
All reasons are good. 
As a matter of fact, it would seem that it is already the case. 
Some people do not want to eat them. 
We should inform them. 
It is more than a mere marketing decision. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will reread the opposition motion to the House: 
I compliment the Bloc member for putting forward the motion today. 
This issue deserves long hours of debate and long hours of analysis. 
The House has to go right back to the producer of food. 
I do not think we should just look at genetically modified food. 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
I think that what he is proposing is ideal.  
I see the Minister of Industry. 
I have a problem with the present.  
I reviewed a study by Ann Clark, a professor at Guelph University. 
We are eating these foods; they are already on the market. 
That is what worries me.  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
At the basis of that is food production. 
I see food and health as being inextricably intertwined.  
I am confident that all of us in the House will deal with this. 
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):
Fuel costs are up. 
The government announced that transportation rates are up for shipping grain off the prairies. 
These are all issues of concern to the agriculture community. 
I want to be get back to the labelling. 
A lot of products are labelled ``made in Canada'' now. 
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
We are debating today. 
As we know, most of those farmers are very well protected. 
We do it in business. 
They have a difficult time imagining that.  
I for one would be happy to take up that challenge. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
It is an excellent motion which the Progressive Conservative Party definitely supports. 
We support the idea of much greater consumer awareness of genetically modified foods.  
An estimated 60% of processed foods contain genetically modified ingredients. 
They get very nervous about it, which is understandable.  
Pest control products have been a big item as of late. 
People have been treating their lawns with them. 
That type of situation has caused many problems.  
It could also increase yields to compensate for the increase in world population. 
It could create new markets by introducing value added products. 
It could improve nutrition and remove allergens from food crops.  
Value passed on from the producer to the consumer can and is being done. 
Canada is a world leader in biotechnology. 
The Canadian Biotechnology Advisory Committee is also involved in the recommendation process.  
The impacts of the protocol on agricultural exports are not fully known.  
I have a personal example. 
Lawns in my area had been sprayed and then cut. 
The cuttings gathered onto the street. 
They favour foods that provide tangible benefits. 
The simple part is the change of labels. 
This could provide unquestionable value to the customer.  
Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
The federal budget confirms this priority in Canada's regulatory system. 
One of these is the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.  
What is this funding for? 
Our regulatory system is dedicated to maintaining the highest scientific standards. 
They also operate independent of the Royal Society itself. 
Canadians want to take part in the dialogue on food biotechnology. 
That is money and effort well allocated and well spent.  
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Of course, what we want is the security of our food.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We are going to do things a little differently because I made a mistake. 
I had instructed that there was only two minutes.  
Mr. Speaker, I will respond briefly to the hon. member's question. 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
I also listened to colleagues who talked about the various consultations that took place.  
She held a balanced consultation process without bias or witch hunts.  
It is therefore a public concern.  
Eight out of ten were mothers. 
But GMO technology is rather new.  
My father was a farmer. 
Some time later, it was realized that DDT is extremely dangerous. 
Most farmers are responsible people. 
We can see their impact and the concerns they raise. 
There are many kinds of pesticides, of course. 
There is a certain analogy to be made with GMOs. 
In matters of food and human health, caution should prevail. 
That is what the charter says.  
If a principle is guaranteed in the charter, it must mean something. 
It must be adhered to. 
This would be absurd.  
The problem was acknowledged, because caution is always the best way to go. 
She was the first woman to become an agrologist in Quebec. 
This is quite something. 
That dates her, but it is true. 
She was an assistant deputy minister in Quebec's Department of Agriculture. 
She was a member of the Commission de la protection du territoire agricole. 
Her father was a searcher in this area. 
We know that knowledge is important. 
We talked about food, but we could also talk about the risks for the environment. 
That applies to the use of fertilizers and other things. 
That is the risk I saw when I read the documentation on the issue.  
Of course there are clearly economic benefits, but I ask myself some questions. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAM ACT 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried. 
(Bill read the second time and referred to a committee) 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Canadian Alliance) moved: 
I will read the motion again: 
My motion opposes such efforts. 
That would be an offence punishable like other ordinary offences.  
The court took this into account and convicted 16 of these individuals.  
In fact the more numerous convictions indicate otherwise. 
Section 43 of the criminal code is doing its job. 
They cannot exceed what is reasonable under the circumstances. 
That is clearly not the case. 
It is a good law. 
It was well conceived at the time. 
It has served its purpose well and continues to serve us well today. 
Section 43 strikes that proper balance.  
Many good and loving parents from that point on would be made criminals overnight.  
Teachers share this exact same concern.  
The motion accomplishes this goal in two ways. 
Parenting has always been a challenge. 
It is for these reasons that I brought forward this initiative.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
There was somewhat of a contradiction in the member's argument. 
Either the state has this right or it does not. 
We already see this now with the whole notion of physical contact. 
We are trying to eliminate judgment from our society. 
That is a mistake. 
We are human beings. 
We are given a certain amount of freedom and we have to exercise judgment. 
We want to eliminate that capacity for judgment. 
That is a mistake.  
I can think of obvious examples. 
These kinds of little things can create an atmosphere for various kinds of witch hunts. 
I think section 43 at the present time is sufficient. 
There is a bit of political campaigning here. 
There has been all kinds corporal punishment.  
I am not making an argument for corporal punishment. 
Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):
Having said that, I think the subject matter is important. 
The motion calls for the federal government to defend the section. 
I want to take a look at the section specifically. 
It is really very short, so I propose to read it.  
It is important to note exactly to whom this section applies. 
It applies to child and pupil. 
It applies to those individuals named.  
Of course ``force'' is not defined. 
It is important to note that we are talking about the use of force.  
That is critically important. 
The force must be applied for the purpose of correcting the child. 
The force applied cannot exceed what is reasonable in the circumstances...  
It is designed to be examined on a fact by fact situational basis. 
The court system is adequately designed to deal with each individual fact situation. 
Having said that, I really do not want to go on ad infinitum. 
The section is reasonable. 
I think it should be maintained.  
I want to say one thing, however, about the use of section 33. 
With that I agree. 
That is a nuclear option that parliament has to control the courts. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
That section of the criminal code has been in place for a number of years. 
I want to thank the hon. member for Wanuskewin for bringing this motion forward.  
It is a very trying time.  
It becomes a very dicey and grey issue. 
This type of debate is helpful in that regard.  
That is a good thing. 
Thus, the issue becomes, is there a necessity to protect that right? 
That is what is at the very root of this motion. 
There have been some high profile cases before the courts. 
The courts have been quite measured in examining these situations. 
It is understandable that there is some trepidation. 
In his legal commentary, he said: 
It was referred to as the nuclear bomb of our legal system.  
To use the notwithstanding clause essentially annihilates precedent. 
I again congratulate the hon. member on his initiative in bringing this forward. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak. 
I want to say several things in the short time I am allowed. 
I want to show the necessity of the resolution we are debating. 
It talks the talk but it does not walk the walk. 
That is why this resolution is necessary. 
I will give a couple of very good examples of that. 
The Canadian Teachers' Federation states: 
It shows respect for the democratic process. 
We have laws that address abuse. 
I am a former teacher. 
Removing section 43 would encourage some students to engage in insubordinate or disruptive behaviour.  
We should not tie the hands of our teachers in this regard.  
Here are some examples that the Canadian Teachers' Federation puts forth. 
The last example would be restraining a cognitively impaired student.  
That is why we should not change this.  
I said I would give a couple of examples in the few minutes remaining. 
The second example is the court challenges program. 
Here we have the government again funding only one side of the issue. 
I want to indicate at the outset that the federal government is doing exactly that. 
We are defending the constitutionality of section 43 in the courts. 
This is what sections 43 says.  
Section 43 does not, however, condone or authorize the physical abuse of children. 
How does section 43 operate? 
Canadian courts are very accustomed to applying a standard of reasonableness. 
This is the only responsible choice open to us as members of parliament.  
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (WanusKewin, Canadian Alliance):
The record has to be clear. 
A number of studies have been done over the years. 
Some studies have found negative outcomes while others have found positive ones. 
Where we disagree is on the effects of non-abusive physical punishment.  
I can cite from my own family situation. 
It is also helpful that we use all other alternative methods of discipline.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The time provided for the consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
At the time, I said: 
This was the answer of the Secretary of State for International Financial Institutions: 
Taxes went up by only 1 cent.  
This is not the problem for people buying gasoline. 
I never mentioned taxes in my question. 
What I asked was if the government intended to act. 
I asked the government to take action because, as we all know, it has responsibilities.  
For instance, they had to go to the New Brunswick border. 
On weekends, the price of gas was high, on weekdays, it was lower. 
It changed every day. 
In my book, that is almost like stealing.  
But, speaking of taxes, I will give an example. 
In the Atlantic provinces, the government brought in the harmonized tax. 
It did not do that. 
In fact, it did the opposite.  
It is unfortunate that I do not have more time. 
Again, it missed a golden opportunity. 
But, what can one say, it is a Liberal government after all.  
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The increase in oil prices is probably temporary. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
The Minister of National Defence stated: 
We cannot yet take a position. 
Of course we can take a stand. 
We should take a stand and we must take a stand.  
We are at an important pivot point in our relationship with each other. 
Canada needs to take the lead.  
The foreign affairs minister said on March 22: 
The impulse to build walls should be resisted. 
On the other hand we have the minister of defence meekly stating: 
This is a serious matter. 
Canada's role in international affairs hangs in the balance. 
I ask the Liberal government for an answer to my question. 
The defence minister says there are too many unknowns. 
Allow me to clarify the picture for him a little. 
Military affairs analyst John Clearwater said of the proposed system: 
It is money down the toilet...any 
Canada has the duty and the responsibility of playing a leadership role. 
The government has a choice. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The target date for this review is now July. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sorry to interrupt but the member's time has expired. 
The hon. member for Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar.  
Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
Sadly, this vision has become clouded. 
I want to use the example of Prince Albert National Park. 
The Minister of Canadian Heritage embraced the blue ribbon panel on parks. 
She told me that in the House earlier this year. 
This is not an attack on the integrity of the park. 
This use has coexisted with the integrity of the park for many years. 
One wonders what the minister might be waiting for. 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
That is my bit of election 101 advice for the parliamentary secretary.  
Right now the agreements are short term only. 
Negotiations will be ongoing in the future.  
We all know that elections happen. 
Ministers go through the Department of Fisheries and Oceans like it has a revolving door. 
Who is to say that certain strategies may not change as we go along? 
The lobster fishery is the last independent fishery in Atlantic Canada. 
The crab stocks are more or less into area management zones now. 
The larger crab dealers in the Gaspe for example have control of the crabs. 
Lobsters are the last independent resource for an independent living for lobster fishermen.  
Mr. Lawrence D. O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
I will say this much to the hon. member. 
That is a fact. 
However, I have the pleasure right now to speak from notes.  
We expect that most of these will be in place by June.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member has too many notes.  
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):
Instead Canadians have been subjected to a steady stream of arrogant abuse from the government.  
No one wants to see people suffer when they fall ill. 
No one wants an American style health care system in Canada. 
It is time for the government to go. 
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
She promised to look into the matter and provide him with an adequate response. 
However he did not bring it forward.  
Why would they be doing this? 
It is because their rich friends want their taxes reduced. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 7.35 p.m.)
