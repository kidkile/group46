EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 76 
Friday, March 31, 2000 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
I admit that in the game plan not every move could be anticipated. 
In fact, what happened in the fall was very controversial.  
There was a myth that we did not know what we were doing. 
The commissioner of competition very much had his say in this particular exercise. 
In fact, the framework was the second step in the process. 
The committees of both the House and the Senate worked very hard. 
We are now engaged in the fourth and final step in the process. 
That is the legislative step. 
That is a monopoly. 
We will not tolerate price gouging. 
They think that somehow their complaint will not be heard. 
That is not true. 
There is a provision for complaints to be heard. 
That will go a long way in giving comfort to the consumers.  
There has been some discussion recently about a bill of rights for passengers. 
It becomes of great concern when we are going to a dominant carrier. 
We are making it 120 days. 
We are saying that 120 days should do the trick in this sense.  
That will be rigorously enforced.  
Our experience has been that communities always maintain their service.  
Air Canada has agreed to go into Charlo and provide some services. 
The consumer has to be protected. 
We have to make sure there is some oversight. 
The second goal of the bill is to foster competition. 
We are doing this in a number of ways. 
There is no discrimination. 
They get the full benefit.  
It is okay for people like me who live in Toronto. 
These are very important measures. 
Quite frankly I wonder why we have not done this before. 
When I say we, I mean the collective we of governments in the past. 
They say that would be great for Canadian consumers.  
We have to give Air Canada the chance to establish itself. 
It is now the 10th world airline in terms of size. 
We have to give Air Canada the ability to compete.  
We are not going to allow that.  
What are they saying about Canadian entrepreneurs? 
The government has faith that Canadian entrepreneurs will come forward and provide the service.  
The way we have done that is to entrench certain commitments in this law. 
I assume that Air Canada will come forward with packages.  
We have made Air Canada commit to the protection of their unionized employees. 
It appears that the airline is doing its best to meet those commitments.  
I think it was an accomplishment for the government. 
Everybody will know that the Canadian airline industry is in good shape.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Canadian Alliance):
I would not disagree with the minister that it was a difficult file.  
At least it is to be hoped that will be the outcome.  
Reality is that we now have a company which controls 80% of the domestic market. 
We hope that this bill will hold it to that commitment. 
Bill C-26 makes a lot of these commitments enforceable. 
It would be nice if it would expand that to include itself.  
There are problems with this bill. 
That is something which the government must ensure does not happen. 
It will create an equal response from the airline. 
There is an onus on the government to make sure that does not happen.  
The Canadian Transportation Agency must also determine which are monopoly routes. 
We will have to be more careful in that area.  
This measure would concern many of the smaller airlines which service the north. 
The other area I have some concern with is the exit provision. 
The minister feels that the 120 days will not do that. 
Airlines are extremely expensive. 
The 25% limit on foreign ownership is very restrictive. 
The 25% limit is a regulation that can be changed at any time. 
I do not think that should be allowed. 
I think that should be addressed.  
I would suggest that needs to be addressed. 
It needs to be looked at and removed completely from the books.  
We are starting to see them happen every day at the airport. 
However, the complaints from the travelling public are starting to get very loud.  
Flights are being significantly overbooked. 
They had arrived at the airport thinking they had a seat on the aircraft. 
That is not acceptable and has to stop.  
Schedules are being changed with passengers not being informed. 
That is not a direction I would like to see the government go.  
The answer is not to get back into overregulating the airline industry. 
The difficulties we are seeing are not just with the travelling public. 
They are also with the employees. 
Two unions have come to an agreement and that is good news. 
It is not just seniority lists. 
I would like to think that this will stop after the legislation passes.  
What happened to people being able to work in the language of their choice? 
I take him up on that. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Hon. David M. Collenette:
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member for Joliette heard the minister's words. 
Is he prepared to start right away?  
I have 20 to 30 minutes to speak on the subject.  
Hon. David M. Collenette:
That is my only concern.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
It being nearly 11 a.m., we will proceed to Statements by Members.  
Mr. Marcel Proulx (Hull-Aylmer, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, good economic news keeps reaching us.  
This is the fourth quarter in which tourism spending reaches a record level.  
This statistical figure should be looked at in a broader context. 
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Canadian Alliance):
The chickens are coming home to roost. 
It should repeal this disgraceful piece of legislation immediately following question period today.  
Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):
Darrin White was not a deadbeat. 
He was a victim of a system that cries out for fixing. 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
I had been expecting such a statement for several days. 
The Government of Quebec has been in cahoots with oil companies for months. 
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA GOLDEN BEARS 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Canadian Alliance):
The accolades do not end there, not for the Golden Bears. 
Russ hails from Provost, Alberta.  
Clayton joins the Golden Bears from Abbotsford, British Columbia.  
Awards also went out to defencemen Mike Garrow and Dion Zukiwsky.  
Way to go, U of A. 
Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):
Canada can be proud of its creators.  
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
The future of the softwood lumber industry depends on the complete liberalization of this market. 
The U.S. government has indicated its full support. 
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Benoit Serre (Timiskaming-Cochrane, Lib.):
Its budget will be increased to $70 million annually. 
CANADA HEALTH AND SOCIAL TRANSFER 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
Amazingly, they did not include Quebec in their travels.  
STANDING NAVAL FORCE ATLANTIC 
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville, Lib.):
I want to commend Ford on a recent announcement. 
We are witnessing fundamental changes in our society and economy. 
I am pleased to see Ford's recognition of this fact.  
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Canadian Alliance):
I ask the hon. member not to use the name of our members.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
I am not about to criticize the press gallery. 
What wonderful news for Canadians today.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
In fact, I would like to quote from the industry minister. 
These are his very concerns. 
This does not come from the press. 
This is a direct quote. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
Cape Bretoners deserve better than this. 
It would cancel western diversification funds. 
It would cut $3 billion from our senior citizens.  
Canadians need not worry. 
It is not a government in waiting. 
It is just a party debating with itself.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Canadian Alliance):
I ask the hon. member to stay away from the word misrepresents.  
After five years, if the jobs are not there then the money is not there. 
The same party the hon. member wishes to unite with.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Canadian Alliance):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
This facility dismantles and recycles electrical transformers. 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, let us be clear. 
With Globax and Techni-Paint, the rules were followed. 
The scandal is with Placeteco. 
This is where the Prime Minister's friends are. 
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Now there are 170 people in total working- 
The hon. member for Rimouski-Mitis.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
She is saying that Globax had two branches:
Techni-Paint and Placeteco. 
It is no longer part of Globax or of Techni-Paint. 
If she has invoices, let her table them in the House. 
We want to know where the $1 million went. 
We have had it with the answers she has been giving us.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
No jobs were created. 
I would ask the hon. member for Rimouski-Mitis to withdraw this word.  
I would ask the hon. member for Rimouski-Mitis to withdraw the word lying.  
We have had enough. 
I will not withdraw my remarks.  
The hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Why is the government waiting? 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
The Markham meeting is dead. 
It has gone nowhere. 
The hon. Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health.  
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, let us be clear. 
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We decided to keep with this company to assist it. 
As a result we have a net gain in jobs. 
Those companies have achieved tremendous contracts for the future with very large companies like Bombardier.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
The policy has been put forward time after time. 
It is very clear. 
The issue of expropriation has never, never come up.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
I understand that the Reform Party does not understand the new economy. 
On this side of the House we understand what a real global company is. 
We are proud that some of our Canadian companies are really global.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
All rules and regulations will be fully respected.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, people need to be able to trust.  
Mr. Speaker, the answer is yes.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):
When will the government get its priorities straight?  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
It is obviously ours as well. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, the government obviously believes its own propaganda. 
Day after day it continues to give us glib answers bordering on arrogance. 
Today in Markham the provincial ministers are on the receiving end of the same tactics.  
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
What is needed is the renewal of our health system.  
With the tax points, the federal government has restored previous funding. 
Now we must move ahead. 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Hon. Gilbert Normand (Secretary of State (Science, Research and Development), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the question raised by the hon. member is very appropriate.  
So, the government is indeed carrying out its responsibilities regarding GMOs.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this has been a very complex process. 
If we do, I hope that the opposition will co-operate with us fully.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
These are all issues we are looking at currently.  
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
Hon. Gilbert Normand (Secretary of State (Science, Research and Development), Lib.):
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Canadian Alliance):
The majority of producers demand change.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is not in possession of the facts. 
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, that particular component is the largest single expense. 
Half of the producer's cheque on his produce goes to freight and elevation. 
Three hundred million dollars in gained revenues for farmers is real money. 
Producers want to know who is in charge of transport reforms. 
Is it the transport minister or the wheat board minister?  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
This party thinks about the producers.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
My question is for the environment minister. 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not know where the hon. member has been. 
That was the decision of the Ontario government. 
It is there and it is clear for everyone to see.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
I can declare that ships will not come to Canada. 
If I could do that, we would have no problem with illegal immigration. 
We would have no problem with toxic waste coming to our ports.  
When it comes within our waters, we will have some control. 
It will not come here for another six days. 
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
He had the courtesy to come to see me this morning with his letter.  
It is a technical difficulty around a classification problem. 
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):

Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We have now verified some 5.4 million social insurance cards. 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
He told me that I was right. 
In this case, Bill 101 applies.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Unfortunately, few aboriginal people in Manitoba have been able to access the fund. 
I know the aboriginal healing fund is at arm's length from the government. 
Will the minister join me in the name of healing and fairness? 
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
The existence of the fund is well known. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has once again changed the terms of his question.  
Let the hon. member go back to the committee and pose the questions himself.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
HUMAN RIGHTS TRIBUNAL ANNUAL REPORT 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Canadian Alliance):
That is how I would ask all of you to address it.  
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
My constituents are asking me and I do not know what to tell them.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
The electoral commissioner and other officials have no bearing on our decision.  
We can decide what takes place in the House. 
I thank the hon. member for his intervention. 
It is always good to hear from him.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas-Charlottenburgh, Lib.):
Does the hon. member have permission to put the motion?  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I have a response to Question No. 46 today. 
Question No. 46- Mr. Rick Borotsik: 
Mr. Gar Knutson (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Lib.):
Some staff support was also offered by the Liberal caucus research bureau.  
The administration of these budgets is not the responsibility of the Government of Canada.  
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
We will, of course, support the principle of this bill at second reading. 
It was high time and we were very pleased at that.  
Why will we support this? 
We all know that its record in this area is none too good. 
A careful eye must therefore be kept on the situation. 
It took a superior court ruling to put an end to this folly.  
But the fact is that he could once again lose face instead.  
This provision is totally unacceptable and constitutes a denial of our parliamentary institution.  
The bill is therefore necessary, but is flawed as it now stands. 
Several problems remain, especially those having to do with regional service.  
I will add one thing, however. 
First, there is Air Canada's share ownership. 
In that context, is control of an international air carrier not of the utmost importance?  
A healthy air transport industry is essential to an advanced economy. 
Rhetoric seems to be enough for this government. 
But it is not for the Bloc Quebecois.  
Ridicule does not kill. 
That illustrates our basic positions. 
We are sovereignists and we are proposing partnership with Canada.  
They were ashamed of their federal government and they were right. 
The minister has to understand that and not start this business all over again.  
I also want to return to the Official Languages Act. 
The government adopted the Bloc Quebecois's position on official languages. 
On that, this government's record is none too good.  
I would now like to say a few words on the price of airline tickets. 
These prices are often out of line, particularly in smaller communities. 
It is completely unacceptable, because it leaves to much room to arbitrary decisions. 
Canada is huge, and so is Quebec. 
This government's policy goes in the opposite way. 
For this government, it would appear that regions are not financially viable.  
This is an inept way of dealing with the issue of regional transportation. 
The government has abandoned the regions, and this is best exemplified by transportation.  
Let us talk also about the future of regional carriers. 
The Bloc Quebecois is consistent in its positions. 
I also would like to speak about the problems of service to remote areas. 
As we know, safety has been compromised by the minister. 
Yet, it was sold for $1.5 billion.  
These services are now provided by Nav Canada. 
Here is another quote from Nav Canada found on Internet: 
Any surplus has to be given back to customers , in this case as deferments.  
What are these priorities? 
Are they the right priorities?  
In a press release on September 30, 1997, Nav Canada stated the following: 
Would it not have been preferable to reinvest these amounts in passenger safety? 
The regular plane fare from Sept-Iles to Montreal is about $800. 
What are the possible solutions?  
Others yet are considering allowing foreign carriers, including American operators, to do cabotage.  
On the issue of frequency, few solutions have been proposed so far. 
This duopoly had flights at the same times, with planes that were half empty. 
We are of course talking about regional transportation. 
This sort of passenger is not desirable.  
The Bloc Quebecois will suggest some solutions in committee.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
I must say that I was disappointed with the Liberal government on this bill. 
Ticket price increases have been rising faster than inflation. 
That is not what was supposed to happen under deregulation. 
So where is the competition?  
The New Democratic Party is not against markets. 
That is not the case. 
We need to balance a strong market with sensible public policy.  
This is what happens when we are dealing strictly with that ideology. 
This is the reality. 
By anyone's standards deregulation has been a public policy disaster. 
I want to talk about the effect of deregulation on my own riding of Churchill. 
But the Liberal government is not looking at the big picture. 
We have to distinguish between healthy competition and destructive competition. 
Need I say more?  
The competition between Air Canada and Canadian Airlines was the destructive kind. 
New Democrats want to see healthy competition in Canada's airline industry. 
This bill does not provide the balanced approach to Canada's airline industry needs.  
The government's approach once again is selling Canadians short. 
The transport minister has said that this bill would protect the Canadian public. 
Sometimes something is so ridiculous that it seems funny. 
This was one of those times. 
That is not to say that this bill is all bad. 
I commend the government for this part of the legislation.  
The government has a responsibility to make sure the airlines live up to that trust. 
Operating an airline in our country is a privilege. 
All it does is force Air Canada not to abandon any communities for three years. 
After that it will be open season for community abandonment. 
There is no review mechanism to make sure these abandonments are justified. 
This is another example of putting blind faith in a market.  
The other area the Liberal government has bungled is that of airfares. 
These measures are not even that strong. 
This is not going to work. 
The CTA is already mandated to control fares. 
It has been completely ineffective until now. 
The third major flaw with the bill is in the area of labour relations. 
At the end of the day this all comes down to priorities. 
There are no Reform members.  
There is the issue of increased foreign ownership. 
Is that the answer to everything? 
American Airlines increased its investment in Canadian Airlines. 
Did that save it? 
I do not see it here. 
Has increased foreign ownership helped western farmers? 
Some people do not get on the plane if everybody shows up. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I welcome the comments made by the hon. member for Churchill. 
We have a very strong international air service. 
Those things could have happened. 
Then we would have competition.  
Competition for the sake of competition is not the answer. 
People have to say that they are not getting the service. 
We know that wages have not gone up. 
They still were not able to bring down the prices. 
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Madam Speaker, it is certainly a pleasure to take part in this debate. 
I am going to focus on the impact on consumers. 
That recommendation definitely should be followed and I intend to bring it to committee. 
I believe that the appointment of an ombudsman is important.  
There is nothing accessible to the average Canadian without an ombudsman. 
I strongly support the proposal to have an ombudsman.  
I invite any consumer in Canada to write to my office. 
We would be pleased to take them all to the minister's office. 
It was passed by an all party committee and all parties supported it. 
The proposal to establish the ombudsman simply states: 
Air Canada is not the only company that is involved with aviation. 
Really, it is an exciting industry.  
That is only part of the problem. 
That should be addressed and it should be changed.  
There are inconsistent explanations as to why planes are delayed. 
In one case I was given three different explanations. 
I do not know what the truth was, but I was given three different explanations. 
I believe that consumer is entitled to an explanation. 
Another thing happened to me this week. 
After flying into Montreal, I went down to get my luggage. 
I did not know what to do so I called the 1-800 number. 
That was all right. 
Anyway, this went on and on and on. 
The system and the service just was not good enough.  
I do not think he would. 
I do not think so. 
My approach is not adversarial on this issue. 
My goal is not to be adversarial with the airlines. 
My goal is to help them realize and understand what their consumers are going through. 
I am confident that I can to that.  
Air Canada was recently recognized as the best airline in the world. 
That was because they have superior service. 
My goal is to help them maintain their reputation.  
We will monitor the complaints and make sure they are addressed.  
For the long term the ombudsman must be there. 
In the interim, we would be pleased to provide that service.  
I encourage people to communicate with us. 
There is a big problem in communications with the major airlines. 
If those complaints are filed with us then we can do something about them. 
Check our website at www.pcparty.ca.  
I look forward to this bill going to committee. 
It has been an enlightening experience for all of us on the committee. 
It was a tremendous experience to go through the debate about the airline merger. 
We met some incredible people in the industry. 
We were all impressed with the industry officials. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
The airlines should know it. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The question is on the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
CANADA POST CORPORATION ACT 
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I just want to speak very briefly to the bill. 
I personally will support this legislation. 
I have had a lot of contact with the rural mail couriers in my riding. 
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Canadian Alliance):
In other words, they cannot form a union.  
This is the crux of the problem that the rural route couriers have. 
These problems need to be addressed.  
George Radwanski tabled an exceptionally good report dealing with Canada Post issues. 
This is the crux of the matter. 
We agree with the member that rural couriers are being done in. 
They are not being treated fairly. 
Radwanski also found that Canada Post businesses practices were aggressive and unfair. 
It is no surprise to hear the concerns of the rural route couriers coming forward. 
In other words, the bill overreaches what we feel is the stated intention.  
We feel that there are other options available. 
Everyone needs to know what the conditions are. 
If we could fix the contract tendering process I believe we would solve the problem. 
We do not believe that eliminating the section is the solution. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
She is a wonderful individual.  
Most rural route mail couriers barely earn minimum wage. 
Their working conditions are reminiscent of another era.  
There are no standard work rules. 
Some RRMCs have more than one route. 
Work rules are changed arbitrarily and often with virtually no notice.  
They have to train and pay their own replacements. 
They are provided with basic supplies. 
I would like the members present to listen to what some mail couriers are saying: 
And we're not allowed to bargain collectively like other workers. 
This is a denial of basic rights.  
This the subsection the member for Winnipeg Centre is trying to have repealed.  
The argument is that if they do not like it they can always quit. 
They are not allowed to bargain collectively as other workers are.  
The Association of Rural Route Couriers applied for a standing at those hearings. 
These criteria are reviewed from the perspective of administrative control and integration.  
It would allow them to have access to the provisions of the Canada Labour Code. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
There are a number of issues.  
They are all lumped together in one bill. 
For that reason mainly the bill is extremely flawed.  
The member speaks specifically to section 13(5). 
Some people have argued that this section discriminates against rural mail couriers. 
What can we do?  
We have made a difference.  
These include the following. 
Rural routes will be contracted on an individual contractor basis. 
Many other changes have been instituted as well. 
These measures probably will not prevent disputes from arising. 
It certainly does not preclude changes being made to the act in the future.  
We obviously have to make a change.  
We can continue to provide service in rural Canada. 
I depend upon a rural mail courier. 
He is a very good friend of mine. 
I have to cross the road to reach my mail box. 
The weather is only one of the things they face. 
We would then take another look at it.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
It is the new Canadian Alliance.  
Madam Speaker, maybe there is a new alliance. 
We were some 20 miles from the nearest village. 
It is very important that this link be there.  
Their salaries are much lower than those of the letter carriers in the city. 
There is no protection. 
There is no association. 
There is no seniority. 
There is none of that stuff for the rural mail couriers in this country.  
Once again I congratulate the member for Winnipeg Centre. 
I appeal to the House to support the bill. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Give them the same rights as all other workers.  
Let us send the bill to committee and give it the opportunity to be discussed. 
Let us not be afraid to let Canadians make the decision.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
This new crown corporation would fall under the Canada Labour Code.  
In Mexico rural route mail couriers are allowed to bargain collectively. 
Yet this group of 5,000 employees in Canada are not allowed to do so. 
Rural route mail couriers are very well organized. 
They are very committed and very dedicated. 
They may form their own independent association. 
There is again no guarantee that they would choose to join any one union. 
It is just that they would have the right to bargain collectively. 
It is a given.  
We are talking about them.  
I have been serving rural Canada customers for 17 years. 
I have hurt my back at work. 
I don't have any sick benefits. 
For a while, I was able to work half time.  
We can see the difficulty. 
I know rural jobs are hard to come by. 
I can't afford to take one. 
That is not a fair tendering practice. 
In the industry I come from we call that crooked. 
It is offensive to hear that it happens in this regard. 
She went on to say: 
I have had to make extra trips to be able to deliver those large parcels. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
It being 2.10 p.m. the time provided for the debate has expired. 
(The House adjourned at 2.10 p.m.)
