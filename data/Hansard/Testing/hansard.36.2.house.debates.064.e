As is our practice on Wednesday we will now sing O Canada.  
Members sang the national anthem ] 
THE LATE MARCEL PEPIN 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
In short, Quebec has lost a great worker and a great trade unionist.  
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
The complainants want nothing less than a full forensic audit.  
We know of 19 police investigations into the government's mismanagement. 
I hope the solicitor general is listening.  
Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):
She died on March 11 at Foothills Hospital in Calgary. 
QUEBEC FINANCE MINISTER'S BUDGET 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):
In essence the human species will have drawn the first map of its genetic makeup. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Part of the autumn tradition of western Canada is for groups to hold fowl suppers. 
QUEBEC FINANCE MINISTER'S BUDGET 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
That is what Quebec sovereignty is all about.  
Mr. Gary Pillitteri (Niagara Falls, Lib.):
Our cadets have recently completed studies on the Canadian government and democratic society. 
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
The hon. member for Mississauga West.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
These people work long and emotionally draining hours. 
Kate O'Brien interviews refugees in a camp in the Sahara desert. 
Security requirements are very serious. 
Kate is at risk every day. 
RENDEZ-VOUS WITH OUR FRENCH-CANADIAN HERITAGE 
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
ROYAL OAK GIANT MINES 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Bill C-20 will join the 1982 Constitution. 
It will have no legitimacy in the eyes of Quebecers, who, whatever happens- 
The hon. member for Beausejour-Petitcodiac.  
FETE NATIONALE DES ACADIENS 
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, PC):
August 15 is the date of the Fete nationale des Acadiens of this country.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
I would urge members today to please choose their words very carefully.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Those members are not interested in dealing with facts, so let us review them again. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
They were told to play with the rules. 
They were told not to pay attention to details like the law. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we do not break the law.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, that is one girl's opinion. 
I would like to quote from her own employees.  
I would prefer, my colleagues, if we called each other by our regular titles.  
This was something the department came up with and I would like to quote verbatim. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this girl will answer as she has over the- 
Mr. Speaker, let us look at the facts. 
We have identified that we have administrative improvements to make in my department. 
We are implementing a six point plan.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
The law says that is illegal. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We will apply the Treasury Board requirements. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, we are talking about more than mere consultations. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
There is legislation on lobbyists. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
How can he say such a thing?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, he did act on one or two occasions- 
He was never paid by the Canadian government, by my office, to do so. 
This is what he does as a profession.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Some questions are already before the courts. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
The hon. Minister for International Trade.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to see the hon. member. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Speaker, at least I admit my mistakes. 
This minister tries to cover his up.  
The fact is that the decision has been made. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
The minister's opinion does not count for much in a situation like this. 
I want to know from the minister, has she referred this matter to the RCMP.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
That is a fact.  
Those are the facts and that is what this story is all about.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
She has said that is not the case. 
Has the minister referred it to the RCMP?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Now they seem to be defending them. 
Which way would they have it?  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
The minister's department did not follow the law. 
They had to be instructed to start doing so. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, again let me be clear. 
We have made that a priority for the department. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is not what the officials said at all.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the minister and her officials are totally contradicting each other.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
The department's questions and answers- 
Choose your words very carefully. 
The hon. member for Calgary West.  
What made the minister think that she could break the law- 
From what I heard, the question is in order. 
The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, again let me categorically reject the allegations made by the hon. member.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Now we find out that much of it was done illegally. 
Why do the Liberals think they are- 
The question is out of order.  
The hon. member for Temiscamingue.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Mr. Charles Hubbard (Miramichi, Lib.):
Would the minister please update the House on how we are doing on exporting fish?  
The side over there needs a lot of fish products. 
It would be good for them and would develop some of their brains too. 
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
Why doesn't management make up its mind?''  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, again the hon. member is incorrect in his assertions. 
I know him to be a proponent of strong public administration. 
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, again the assertion is absolutely incorrect. 
The facts are these. 
The plan is already at work. 
We are improving our system in order to better serve Canadians.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
The Minister of Health at that time said ``We are looking at it''. 
On December 13 the Alberta health minister confirmed its intentions. 
The Minister of Health stood in the House and said ``We are studying that matter''. 
On March 2 Bill 11 was tabled. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Canadians want an answer. 
Will he give Canadians a timetable for when he will have completed his analysis? 
Will he say no to Ralph Klein?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Mr. Speaker, Rene Fugere had a close working relationship with the Prime Minister. 
He represented the Prime Minister at events. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of people in Canada who know Jean Chretien. 
I have been elected 11 times in Saint-Maurice. 
I have been the member of parliament for Saint-Maurice since 1963. 
I am grateful that they keep electing me.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Fugere was not registered at the time as a lobbyist.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Where there is failure to comply, the appropriate action will be taken.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
One of the pressures is cost recovery fees. 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's question. 
It gives me a chance to remind everyone of the government's commitment to agriculture.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The department was advised to close the trust fund. 
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP):
The only people out of step are NDP members. 
When are they going to get in step with their own constituents?  
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
That is the equivalent of creating two virtual MITs in Canada. 
This will make Canada competitive in the 21st century.  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Gar Knutson (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
That the House do now proceed to orders of the day.  
The hon. member for Roberval on a point of order.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
I am pleased to see him here today.  
His point of order is certainly very serious. 
The motion has been presented and we need to consider it.  
Mr. Speaker, could I ask a question?  
I have a great deal of respect for the hon. member for Roberval. 
We are now at Routine Proceedings.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
I will put the question to the House. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
Quebecers want no part of that disturbing prospect. 
The clarity act is pro-Quebec and pro-democracy.  
I quote Professor Hogg: 
Former Ontario Premier Bob Rae stated: 
So there is not that much distance separating us.  
Voters would press them for an answer, and rightly so. 
They would have the right to know.  
The separatist leaders would do better to aim for maximum clarity. 
With clarity, everyone wins.  
Now, let us talk about the clarity of the majority. 
He has devoted his life to it. 
This is what he had to say to the legislative committee.  
Will the separatists say that Mr. Broadbent is anti-democratic?  
Will he have to be called undemocratic as well?  
As everyone knows, the clarity bill does not set a threshold. 
As Dean Hogg told the committee: 
That is all on the subject of the clarity of the majority. 
I will now consider the aboriginal issue.  
Clearly a double standard.  
I stress ``at least''.  
The time for ambiguity has passed. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Does the hon. member have unanimous consent of the House to move the motion?  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
The official opposition supported the issue of clarity of the question. 
We undertook to try and pin down the majority. 
We felt that broad consultation on an issue like this was best. 
Today I would like to report on how we did with those broad principles.  
It was a two pronged question. 
He felt as I did that the question was not clear. 
It was not unambiguous.  
This bill will result in a clear question. 
On the issue of majority, how did we do? 
I would say that we have failed on that issue. 
I must say I found some of those arguments persuasive.  
This was a fairly low threshold. 
In 1786 independence became an issue for Massachusetts trying to secede from Maine. 
This was a state. 
Maine was a district. 
Massachusetts wanted to become a state. 
The third issue was broad consultation. 
There was no travelling. 
We had but one week of committee hearings. 
Many witnesses were unable to attend. 
No amendments were put forth at committee. 
The proceedings were televised. 
All those issues could have been discussed at least.  
There would have been broader consultation. 
There would have been more issues on the table. 
I have mentioned those issues.  
Our bill would not be proclaimed. 
Our bill would have had a 50% plus one threshold in it. 
That is a legitimate complaint. 
I conclude by saying that the official opposition will continue to support this bill. 
I have mentioned areas that could have been improved. 
I have a simple statement for Quebecers.  
Who are afraid of a clear question?  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Bill C-20 is undemocratic. 
We will keep on repeating it. 
That is not what it is all about. 
They do not respect each other''.  
But theses views are not shared by all.  
They vote for independentist leaders and they put their confidence in them. 
The 50% plus one rule is acceptable and accepted. 
That rule is universally applied.  
That rule is universally accepted. 
It was not clear. 
The no vote of Quebecers in 1980 and again in 1995 was not clear. 
Odd, is it not?  
The only confusion around is supposed to be in the sovereignist camp. 
In 1997, only 26 Liberals were elected to the House.  
The Liberal Party of Canada does not represent Quebecers. 
But the committee was not to travel. 
It had to hear 45 witnesses here in Ottawa. 
What was the minister afraid of? 
He did not have the courage of his convictions.  
No, debates had to be limited.  
Actually, the proceedings of that committee had to be made very partisan. 
They said there should be a consensus to hold a referendum on sovereignty.  
The minister knows it. 
The civil society of Quebec is clearly opposed to this bill. 
This bill will have no legitimacy. 
It will not stop Quebec from deciding its own future. 
The debate will not end here. 
In closing, I would like to add this on behalf of Bloc Quebecois members. 
We members of the Bloc Quebecois affirm that the Quebec nation is sovereign.  
We members of the Bloc Quebecois affirm that Quebec is free.  
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Does the member have unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas-Charlottenburgh, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Does the hon. chief government whip have unanimous consent?  
Does this apply to both?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I was saying that we had a number of concerns about the bill. 
However, the government rejected those amendments for reasons of its own.  
We also had concerns about the role of the Senate. 
We moved amendments in that regard and those amendments were defeated.  
We worked on these amendments all through the process. 
I might say that it was justified anger. 
Two of our amendments were accepted. 
They were important amendments. 
This has not been easy. 
I believe that Bill C-20 meets that test. 
We cannot come at this innocently. 
I think there is a legitimate means to self-determination and to secession. 
I hope that day never comes.  
However, I would urge the government to get busy on having its own plan A. 
That, in my view, is what Bill C-20 does.  
We have been very unhappy with the process. 
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Bill C-20 was extremely difficult, frustrating, disturbing and alarming. 
That is what the government just did. 
After Bill C-20, what happens? 
It will be the government's the latent period. 
All will be settled, there will not be any changes. 
I often say that a country evolves at the same pace as his citizens. 
Legislation absolutely must evolve also.  
But the government is budging very little if at all. 
It is not doing anything. 
It says ``We do not want to talk about it''.  
This is a false comfort zone, false security. 
Where is the logic in that? 
It is a political logic. 
According to the polls, everyone wants a clear question and a clear majority. 
That is not the way we operate.  
The bill is not clear. 
Is the question clear? 
They do not understand. 
Will we have a battle between legal experts? 
The majority was 91%. 
One can see how faulty the logic is. 
It is clearly illogical. 
Bill C-20 is illogical, it does not make sense. 
How logical is that? 
For now, but there will be other referendums.  
A country is not some kind of marriage contract. 
What is a marriage contract? 
It is a contract for divorce. 
That is not what a country is about. 
We must make sure that a signal is sent. 
This government has been in office for seven years. 
We have gone from indifference to the whip.  
He has not done a great job at it. 
But what message is being sent? 
``Something had to be done. 
The order has come down''. 
That is not much of an argument.  
Why not have a collective project? 
But that is not what needs to be done. 
After seven years, nothing has been done. 
They have gone from indifference to the whip. 
That is not what the supreme court said.  
The NDP proposed an amendment relating to the first nations. 
His answer ``No, it is a perfect bill''.  
The member for Winnipeg-Transcona must have thrown a few fits. 
Is this the message we want to send first nations? 
If I were in their shoes, I would be scared.  
But I am worried about the first one. 
Unfortunately, the provinces are letting their big federal brother decide what to do.  
You are so good. 
For the past seven years you have accomplished a lot. 
It has no plan. 
It has absolutely nothing to offer.  
Our party's position has not changed. 
It is clear that some members will vote with the government. 
We have tried to explain our position. 
The other place that has been forgotten.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The amendment is in order.  
The question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House divided on the amendment, which was negatived on the following division:) 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Could other hon. members who voted twice please let me know who they are.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
For the sake of clarity, I personally voted in favour of the amendment.  
I declare the amendment lost.  
The next question is on the main motion.  
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
(Bill read the third time and passed) 
WITNESS AND SPOUSAL PROTECTION PROGRAM ACT 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Calgary Centre has eight minutes remaining.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
It has been thrown together by some well meaning bureaucrats. 
It has no real mandate. 
It actually has no funding. 
It is hard to find out about it and to access it. 
It has had very limited application.  
She is the mother of four children. 
It was a tragic story.  
He was out on probation for a while. 
She lived in fear when she went shopping. 
She went to the authorities. 
During that time she had some relative peace of mind. 
It is essential that we put forward this kind of legislation. 
Between 1977 and 1996 there were 2,048 spousal killings in Canada. 
In 56% of the spousal killings, the police knew there was a problem.  
It is just like the case of Sally to which I referred. 
She thankfully is alive and well at this point in time. 
They could have applied to that. 
They could have taken on a new identity and perhaps could have relocated. 
Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert, BQ):
We all know that the majority of those victims are in fact women.  
Violence often occurs within a domestic relationship. 
They are often stalked and sometimes killed.  
However, despite these measures, tragedies continue to occur all too often still. 
Unfortunately, women and the police do not seem very familiar with this program. 
In addition, the assistance provided is very limited. 
The program has no specific mandate and no statutory or regulatory basis. 
For all these reasons, it appears quite inadequate to protect threatened individuals.  
This is what is currently in place. 
The act says, and I quote: 
In short, it provides full protection. 
Therefore, they should benefit from the legislative and regulatory measures under this program.  
The commissioner will also take into consideration a more subjective criterion. 
The commissioner will also consider other possible forms of protection outside the program.  
The Bloc Quebecois supports Bill C-223. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
I have a long history when it comes to issues such as this. 
I commend the member for taking the initiative in this area.  
As members of the House we are all concerned with this very important issue. 
Because we have ignored it, it is more prevalent than it should otherwise be.  
Sometimes the only remaining last resort and course of action is a change of identity. 
That may be far from a perfect solution. 
The program to provide protection to them is administered by the police, for police reasons. 
Experience from this process has taught us some very valuable lessons. 
A change of identity is definitely a last resort. 
In the beginning there were not many cases. 
Consultations have begun in this very important area. 
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Sadly, these victims cannot remain anonymous and are eventually found by their abusive spouses. 
The result is often violent. 
The Progressive Conservative Party of Canada supports the bill. 
Broadening the mandate is a welcome change.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to enter into this debate. 
He explained that in his speech in the previous hour of debate. 
It caught his attention. 
It was a need crying out. 
He gave some encouragement for the notion and the idea of this bill. 
These are unacceptable solutions that he offers to a very serious need.  
It is well thought out. 
It has some flexibility designed into it. 
This is simply unacceptable. 
Individuals are being abused and murdered by their spouses in our country. 
It is a sad situation.  
These situations are often very difficult for them to deal with. 
It will also save people's lives. 
It is not working now. 
Sometimes there may even be abstract notions. 
It would be a very simple thing to do. 
Why in the world would we wait any longer? 
For each year that goes by another 100 individuals will be murdered. 
We would be remiss if we were implicated by our inactivity.  
Let us make a positive solution to a very serious problem.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
I am very pleased to support the bill. 
I think it is not only important, but imperative that we support the bill.  
Two Canadians, mostly women, every week lose their lives to their spouses in domestic situations. 
Why is this not something that we are being compelled to deal with? 
I hear the Liberal member who spoke some time ago making comments. 
He suggested that we are taking the wrong approach. 
I think that Canadians should do like Bill Clinton-do not inhale.  
Some people might argue that this would be an expensive measure. 
Let us not forget that we are talking about two people per week. 
She ended the relationship. 
The man went to jail for 18 months. 
She did what she was supposed to do. 
What am I supposed to do?''  
Tammy considered at great length going underground. 
This legislation would provide them with an option, a way out. 
It would provide protection. 
It is nothing less than saving the lives of Canadians, in particular Canadian women. 
It can be done. 
This legislation provides the tools to do it. 
Let us protect Canadian lives.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this should be a non-partisan debate. 
Clearly this is an exceptionally serious issue that crosses all gender lines. 
It crosses all geographic and demographic lines within the country. 
We treated him with respect. 
His comments were particularly revealing. 
Not only women but children are involved in this.  
There is always room for improvement but we do not need to reinvent the wheel. 
We need to build on what is already established. 
There are a number of unsettled questions''. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The time provided for the consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
(The House adjourned at 7:32 p.m.)
