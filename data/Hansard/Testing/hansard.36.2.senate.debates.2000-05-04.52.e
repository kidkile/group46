Thursday, May 4, 2000 
The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker pro tempore in the Chair.  
The Right to Vote for Women of Quebec 
We were the last Canadians to obtain that right. 
Not that Quebec women were not clamouring for the right to vote! 
The opposition to this suggestion was strong. 
The honour for this goes to the Liberal government of Adelard Godbout.  
A number of arguments were raised against giving women the vote. 
The arguments have changed a bit, but a certain resistance remains.  
In fact, the amendments to the bill were withdrawn. 
Iroquois Helo Detachment Commander's Situation Report 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
Honourable senators, we are now getting the picture. 
I will ask a question of the minister on this topic during Question Period.  
In Recognition of Naval Forces 
The eager, the scared 
Knew not what they dared.  
They withstood every hardship 
Long gut-wrenching days, 
Lonely vigils on watch, 
They proved that they cared.  
Midst sweat, tears and toil, 
And oft when torpedoed 
Were covered in oil.  
Subs nearby did hover; 
Storms, ice and fog, 
With sea, spew and gear; 
Their equipment not modern 
Their ships lacking, too, 
Their "on-the-job training" 
By the wrath of the sea, 
By the bombs and torpedoes 
Of a harsh enemy.  
"Wary Navy" most were, 
R.C.N. lads in blue - 
100,000 and Wrens 
Like good ship's crews do 
In "sweepers" and "four-stackers", 
Cruisers, carriers - not new.  
The Canadian Navy yet grew 
Midst turmoil and terror 
To a multitude from a few.  
To 400 ships in our Navy, 
400 Merchant Ships, too. 
The East and the West, 
They gave of their best; 
These sea-faring sailors - 
Merchant Navy and the Wrens.  
Hon. Lois M. Wilson :
Canada, of course, does pay its dues in full and on time. 
Canada's interest lies in a strengthened, reformed and well-funded United Nations. 
What can Canada do? 
We can make this situation known. 
Africa Direct Mission to Canada 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Ghana, Mauritius, Mozambique, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda. 
Africa is on the move and its future looks bright. 
Canadians can benefit by pursuing business opportunities in Africa. 
There is a lot of good business to be done.  
Fortunately, this is an area where Canada can be of great assistance. 
Bill to Amend-Report of Committee 
Thursday, May 4, 2000 
The Standing Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs has the honour to present its 
The Hon. The Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Payments in Lieu of Taxes Bill 
Thursday, May 4, 2000 
The Standing Senate Committee on National Finance has the honour to present its 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
L'assemblee parlementaire de la francophonie 
Report of the Canadian Delegation to Meeting in Libreville, Gabon Tabled 
Hon. Pierre De Bane :
Hon. Peter A. Stollery :
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Tuesday, May 9, 2000, I will move: 
That the committee report no later than March 31 of the year 2001.  
Notice of Motion to Authorize Committee to Examine 
Emerging Developments in Russia and Ukraine 
Hon. Peter A. Stollery :
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Tuesday, May 9, 2000, I will move: 
Notice of Motion to Authorize Committee to Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Tuesday, May 9, 2000, I will move: 
Prime Minister's Visit to Middle Eastand Persian Gulf 
Hon. Pierre De Bane :
Airworthiness of Sea King Helicopters 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
I think the minister is still missing the point.  
We know that the Sea Kings have a good maintenance regime. 
It then embarks on a mission. 
Any aircraft that has ever crashed was airworthy enough to get off the ground.  
We are talking about a complete failure to even get off the deck.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Is that why you cancelled the contract?  
Statistics have been given on that issue. 
We have an older piece of equipment that does require a high level of maintenance.  
The equipment is old and needs a significant amount of maintenance. 
Those are not my words; they are his.  
You will recall he was referred to and quoted here yesterday by another honourable senator. 
His comments were disturbing. 
What do you expect him to say? 
What are you waiting for?  
That is the reason these honourable people held back somewhat. 
I think the honourable senator characterizes the situation in a fairly correct fashion. 
The issue is safety.  
The answer, according to Brigadier-General Curleigh, is no.  
He said we are not there yet.  
Replacement of Sea King Helicopters 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
I wonder if he could provide us with those names today.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I will do so, honourable senators. 
That is not the issue. 
That is a very important yet incorrect statement. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, the minister knows the issue. 
Will he put it on the agenda? 
I do not have any other news yet. 
Another one was forced into the position of having to land outside its mission.  
Will the government leader do something about it?  
Hopefully, that will be completed.  
How old are they?  
I have no idea. 
How old are their Sea Kings?  
I have no difficulty tabling that document, honourable senators.  
I do not recall discussing the tabling of any documents.  
If the honourable senator wants the document, we will give him the document. 
I can do it, perhaps, by the end of today. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Can the minister answer that question today?  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I put that request forward and am awaiting a response. 
I have not as yet received an answer. 
I will forward the answer as soon as I receive it.  
Possibility of Suspension of AnthraxVaccination Program 
Hon. Michael A. Meighen :
My question to the minister is twofold.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
The pharmaceutical industry is a major industry in the province of Quebec, among others. 
It invests one billion dollars a year. 
It is an industry of the future.  
Why does it take so long in Canada? 
Delays ultimately have an impact. 
People lose patience and go elsewhere to develop their products. 
The evaluation must be done in an effective manner. 
Is it because health standards are higher in Canada? 
Can something be done to improve the situation? 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
As the honourable senator will know, it is a question of balance. 
That balance must be struck. 
I am sure there are countries that approve some drugs in two weeks. 
We do not want to follow those examples. 
Delayed Answer to Oral Question

Heritage-Visit of Minister to Newfoundland 
Third Reading-Debate Adjourned 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Therefore, in 1983, the law was again amended. 
In 1984 the National Citizens' Coalition won its case. 
Honourable senators, I should like to quote a short passage from the Lortie commission report.  
The federal government decided not to appeal the judgement - 
They are referring to the Somerville judgement.  
- or to amend the law in a manner consistent with the Charter. 
The Charter couples these two dimensions. 
It is essential that both Parliament and the courts acknowledge this fundamental fact.  
For myself, I agree wholeheartedly that the election playing field should be level. 
A maximum limit of $150,000 for 301 ridings is a little ridiculous. 
That is approximately $500 per riding. 
Let me again quote the Lortie report. 
What I am saying here has been discussed and debated for a long time. 
Honourable senators, the government still has not got it right. 
In paragraph 40, he concluded by saying the following: 
At paragraph 103, for instance, he said: 
Here is the significant turning point:
Professor Johnston no longer stands behind those preliminary findings. 
Justice Brenner made the following finding: 
Professor Peter Aucoin is a professor of political science at Dalhousie University. 
He was also qualified as an expert in the field of political science. 
Honourable senators, every democracy has its own peculiar way of dealing with third-party advertising. 
Somewhere in here is the happy median which Canada should adopt. 
By "happy median" I mean a policy which has fairness as its central tenet.  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, I therefore move, seconded by Senator Murray: 
"(2) Not more than $4,000 of the total".  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
It was moved by Senator Oliver seconded by Senator Murray: 
"(2) Not more than $4,000 of the total..".  
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion in amendment?  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is the house ready for the question?  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
I do not want anyone to be confused. 
Honourable senators, I listened to Senator Oliver's amendment with care. 
I will try to be as brief as I can be. 
This judgment seems to be based on a very important finding. 
Of course, Senator Oliver agrees. 
It is just that we are not in agreement on the limit. 
That is a very unsatisfying perception for one out on the hustings.  
He did not do that. 
His measure is much less encompassing. 
There is not a great deal of difference between the two amounts.  
Honourable senators, I may have an opportunity to comment further later. 
I recommend to honourable senators that we not support the amendment proposed by Senator Oliver.  
Honourable senators, I wonder if Senator Hays would entertain a question?  
Honourable senators, that is a good question. 
I have a good answer. 
The honourable senator explained why he distinguished it.  
That is an oversimplification, I know, but that is the main basis. 
On motion of Senator Atkins, debate adjourned.  
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Jean-Robert Gauthier :
There is talk of consultation, but we know what that means.  
One can imagine the impasse that this would create. 
Obviously, I have no objection to aboriginals being invited. 
The majority in the House of Commons? 
This is an important issue for me. 
Bill C-20 excludes us.  
In my opinion, Quebec is essential to the survival of the Canadian francophonie. 
If Quebec broke away from Canada, what would happen to the French fact outside Quebec? 
I ask this question honestly. 
What would happen to the Acadians? 
I ask this as a Franco-Ontarian senator. 
Honourable senators, I will use an expression that was used in 1982. 
I was told I should be reasonable, I am. 
The blind, the disabled, the deaf are not counted. 
For heaven's sake, stop counting us. 
It makes no sense.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, the time allowed is up. 
Is leave granted to continue the debate?  
If my understanding is correct, Senator Murray is accurate in his interpretation. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I am not asking that our role be increased. 
I just want it to be maintained as it has been since 1867. 
This is more than enough for one generation.  
How did we get to this point?  
What we are in fact dealing with here is: 
The government put three questions to the Supreme Court: 
However, is that what the court wanted?  
A distinction must be made between a decision and an opinion. 
Neither Quebec nor Canada is obliged to act on our opinion.  
We are a long way from a "requirement". 
This "requirement" is political, it is neither legal nor constitutional. 
One will have guessed. 
- were to hold a referendum on improvements to the Canadian federation.  
These Quebecers are now reassured: their yes vote will force Canada to negotiate.  
The headline reads, "Clarity Act helps sovereigntist cause, Quebec minister says." 
Such is the sad result of the government's action. 
Was Bill C-20 the last "winning condition"?  
It so happens that Mr. Bouchard made that statement in Paris. 
That is certainly not a coincidence. 
Quebec's separation is no longer illegal. 
There will be an act of Parliament, which will facilitate negotiations. 
Bill C-20 gives more clarity to the separatists' project.  
Let us not forget that there will still be separatists in Quebec. 
I do not have a mandate to negotiate separation.  
As Senator Lynch-Staunton quite rightly pointed out: 
Will they vote even if they do not approve of the question? 
Will they suggest that their federalist fellow citizens abstain? 
Lucien Bouchard would never go that far?  
I am not sure all of them understood the consequences of their vote.  
The Leader of the Government is not a Quebecer. 
He did not have the opportunity of voting in 1980. 
Honourable senators, I voted no in 1980 and 1995. 
Both times, I understood very well the consequences of my vote.  
Certain senators will say that is old history. 
On motion of Senator Nolin, for Senator Pitfield, debate adjourned.  
Special Senate Committee on Bill C-20 
Motion to Appoint-Point of Order-Debate Adjourned to Await Speaker's Ruling 
Senator Celine Hervieux-Payette, P.C. 
That four members constitute a quorum; 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I rise on a point of order. 
It has been pointed out that this is no ordinary bill. 
Later, paragraph 514(2) states: 
Erskine May, page 335, states: 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, perhaps I should add a few words. 
However, I listened as carefully as could I to Senator Lynch-Staunton. 
I have only a passing familiarity with the question of anticipation. 
It would automatically fall off the Order Paper at that point.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
A "standing committee," according to our rules, means: 
That is the important point: as specifically assigned to the standing committee by these rules.  
Rule 86(1)( k ) provides that: 
This is a bill. 
It is very specific. 
Honourable senators, that is the procedural argument. 
Again, all the authorities are clear on this. 
Beauchesne states, at paragraph 684 on page 204, that: 
Honourable senators, I should like to comment further, now that additional comment has been made.  
Thus, I should not let this opportunity to comment pass.  
We have done this before, honourable senators. 
We have in the past referred bills to special committees. 
That was done at a time when our present rules were in place.  
The last two paragraphs, senator.  
However, permissive instructions, generally, are not in order. 
Thus, it really comes down to what definition we give to "anticipation." 
If it did not say that, perhaps there would be an argument. 
I thank Senator Lynch-Staunton for the prompt. 
As to orderliness, whether it was done with unanimous consent or not, it was done.  
After second reading, surely.  
I do not know the answer to Senator Murray's inquiry either. 
He may be right.  
We are glad you are comfortable.  
I am glad that the honourable senator is glad that I am glad.  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, I have been listening fairly attentively to the discussion. 
In addition, I have a profound interest. 
I will begin to relieve myself of that burden by talking about it. 
We are not on the substance of the motion.  
On the business of the point of order, I have a couple of questions. 
It seems to me that Senator Lynch-Staunton has a point. 
Obviously, someone has been a bit tardy in the drawing up of the motion. 
Let us see what is missing in this motion. 
It does not say "after a vote at second reading stage." 
It very clearly says "after second reading." 
This statement, as written, clearly anticipates an affirmative vote. 
It definitely anticipates a conclusion that the Senate has yet to make. 
There is another flaw in the motion, honourable senators. 
We must understand that every motion of this chamber becomes an order of this chamber. 
Any order of this chamber can demand obedience. 
This is very interesting. 
It does not say that Bill C-20 is "an act to give effect." 
That is a second flaw in the motion. 
It does not say "an act."  
The Honourable Dan Hays states: 
Honourable senators, I give notice that, on Tuesday next, I will move: 
The words "an act" are not in this particular document. 
Senator Hays may want to look at that later on.  
I am reading from Debates of the Senate , which are carved in stone. 
What I am reading from is absolutely accurate. 
Honourable senators, I should like to move on. 
However, that is a different point.  
If we are not careful, we will go from bad to worse. 
A motion for a special committee has been brought. 
Honourable senators, I should like to raise a couple of issues. 
Honourable senators, this chamber has no knowledge of a committee. 
It is an article by David Gamble, and it states: 
This chamber has no knowledge of this matter.  
Does The Gazette have a copy of the committee report?  
Then the article goes on at some length with a few quotations.  
That is more than a motion, a result. 
A committee vote and committee considerations have been anticipated.  
I know I am very proud to have been associated with it.  
I leave it in Her Honour's hands. 
I do not believe I have done any such thing.  
I just did not talk to him. 
I do not know his sources for that article.  
Honourable senators, I appreciate Senator Fraser's comments. 
I have no problem with them whatsoever, but we were speaking to two different points. 
Perhaps she should write some letters to clarify that.  
That is a very important matter to many of us.  
As I said before, I have never seen this before. 
I now have an answer to the question asked by Senator Kinsella. 
It was not done by unanimous agreement. 
As I recall, Senator Kinsella chaired that committee.  
Was it after second reading?  
I draw attention, as well, to our rule 93: 
That rule does not have a condition precedent as to when it can be used. 
Honourable senators, the motion seems to be missing one or two words.  
This situation is remarkably straightforward. 
Two or three words could be scripted into the motion. 
That can be done quite easily.  
From what edition is the honourable senator reading?  
Let me accept personal responsibility for that.  
From the comments I made earlier, that is obviously not the case here.  
No, I do not intend to withdraw the motion.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Do any other senators wish to speak?  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
I thank Senator Kinsella for speaking to it several days ago. 
I have done much work in this regard. 
I view this issue as a national crisis of epic proportions.  
I would like to put a few quotations on the record. 
At paragraphs 19 and 20, he continues: 
At paragraph 23 the judge continues: 
I confess to have been taken in by the mother's evidence. 
However, it appears in making such an order that I simply erred. 
It is to be hoped that this order corrects that error.  
That was an extremely fine statement to make.  
It is very hard for any judge to ignore such allegations. 
I am satisfied in this case that these allegations are completely without foundation.  
...Why were such groundless accusations made? 
Her affidavits were absolutely scandalous and outrageous in light of their content. 
I have spoken to hundreds of people who have been so falsely accused. 
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
National Archives of Canada Act 
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Continued 
I shall bear in mind that the hour is late.  
Now we know better.  
There is room for some argument about whether Statistics Canada's belief is correct. 
This is of course essential for any census in a free and democratic society.  
They are simply too important as historical records. 
Australia and the United States, for example, have both reached that conclusion. 
I believe that Canada should do likewise.  
The expert panel is expected to report by the end of this month. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, I made my arguments yesterday on the question of privilege. 
I would, however, add a few remarks. 
It is time that we did something about this state of affairs.  
It is dated Wednesday, May 2, 2000. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, is permission granted to table the report?  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
My role is limited to determining whether there appears to be a prima facie case. 
The matter should be put before the Senate for its determination.  
Therefore, Senator Tkachuk may now proceed with his motion.  
Referred to the Standing Committee on Privileges, Standing Rules and Orders 
Honourable senators, I move: 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Energy, the Environment and Natural Resources 
Committee Authorized to Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
This will be a one-time only request. 
We will not be asking for permission to sit again when the Senate is sitting. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Leave having been given to revert to Government Notices of Motions: 
Hon Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government):
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, May 9, 2000, at 2 p.m.
