The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker pro tempore in the Chair.  
Fifty-sixth Anniversary of D-Day 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
There was much to be done and these women rose to that challenge.  
Activities During Environment Week 
Eleventh Anniversary of Tiananmen Square Massacre 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Honourable senators, this week marks the eleventh anniversary of the massacre in Tiananmen Square. 
The terrible images of June 4, 1989 remain with us.  
Many more are still unaccounted for. 
Some were tortured to extract confessions. 
Honourable senators, June 4 is also a day of remembrance. 
The fabric of society had come apart. 
China had become a country owned by the political elite.  
Traditionally, intellectuals in China bear the responsibility of society. 
That child is democracy.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Developments Respecting Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide 
Report of Social Affairs, Science and Technology Committee Tabled 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, when on the Order Paper will this report be considered?  
Honourable senators, it should be the last item under Reports of Committees.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?

Sir Wilfrid Laurier Day Bill 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
L'Assemblee parlementaire de la Francophonie 
Hon. Pierre De Bane :
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Can the minister either confirm or deny that?  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
No, I am afraid I can neither confirm nor deny that rumour.  
If he cannot, is it because he does not know?  
I want to relay that information to people in Halifax West and in Dartmouth.  
Flow of Specialized Workers to the United States-Incentives to Remain in Canada 
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
In fact, honourable senators, I am not aware of the specifics. 
That program will have an impact, as will other specific programs.  
One that comes to mind is the Chairs of Excellence program. 
That is entirely possible. 
There are programs across any number of departments that will assist. 
Honourable senators, as I said, I have seen some statistics. 
I will attempt to retrieve them and share them with the honourable senator.  
Air Canada-Promotion of Bilingualism 
Hon. Jean-Claude Rivest :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
As we know, Canadian Airlines and Air Canada will be combining their operations. 
Services previously provided by Canadian Airlines will now be provided by Air Canada. 
What is the position of the government in this regard?  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, I will await the committee's report to the Senate. 
Again, it could relate to the question of brain drain.  
Dr. Schindler has proposed a solution. 
These are, after all, two of our most eminent Canadian scientists.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the honourable senator is quite correct, in part. 
In the last two budgets, the government has committed $1.8 billion. 
With accumulated interest, it is significantly in excess of$2 billion. 
I know it has worked in areas with which I am most familiar. 
It is a huge commitment. 
I will inform Dr. Schindler of that.  
I will pass along his comments and those of the honourable senator.  
The comments that he makes are completely at odds with my experience. 
Every one of them was research based at a university.  
Honourable senators, I have a final comment. 
The point is that many universities are now dependent on industry as well. 
We are talking about pure basic research that is in the public interest.  
Pages Exchange Program with House of commons 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
She is studying international management at the Faculty of Administration.  
Simone is from Sherwood Park, Alberta.  
Elise Wouterloot is studying at the Faculty of Arts at the University of Ottawa. 
She is from Mission, British Columbia.  
To all three pages, I wish you a very good week here in the Senate. 
Citizenship of Canada Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
Rather, it is a reflection of the values that we share. 
The first Citizenship Act of 1947 was also such an expression. 
The 1947 act reflected the social mores and attitudes of the time. 
However, it failed to define what is specifically meant by "residency." 
Physical presence will be assessed through a variety of ways. 
One thousand and ninety-five days is a reasonable number. 
I believe that is a logical undertaking.  
As we know, adoption comes under provincial and territorial jurisdiction. 
Adoption must be in the best interests of the child. 
Any adoption must create a genuine relationship of parent and child. 
The change in Bill C-16 reflects the current reality. 
This change in the process of adoption will be retroactive to any adoption after 1977.  
That is a tiresome task. 
They will promote active citizenship. 
Commissioners will continue to be appointed by Governor in Council. 
Commissioners will also provide valuable advice and consultation to the minister on citizenship matters. 
Bill C-16 modernizes Canadian citizenship. 
Criminality, criminal or false identity are the primary provisions for annulment. 
Revocation of citizenship is a serious matter. 
This is simply not the case. 
There are 15 cases that have proved this process all along the way.  
By the way, this same process is found in almost all Commonwealth countries. 
Honourable senators, the revocation process is built upon our parliamentary traditions. 
The power to remove citizenship must, therefore, also remain with the executive.  
I do not believe that this is the Canadian way.  
Canadian citizenship is not a right but a privilege. 
The last matter I wish to address today is the question of penalties. 
Honourable senators, most of us are immigrants. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, perhaps the Honourable Senator Finestone would answer a few questions?  
Is this indeed the third time?  
We are into the third revision.  
It addresses these unpleasant, unethical acts.  
Is it a matter of nomenclature, naturalization versus citizenship? 
I suppose it is an argument one could easily hold.  
That phrase caught my attention. 
I have had difficulty in finding that clause. 
There is just one paragraph under that heading, which is clause 12. 
Canadian citizens have the right tovote. 
Canadian citizens have the right to leave and re-enter Canada. 
Canadian citizens have certain linguistic minority education rights. 
As a matter of fact, honourable senators, I did think about this issue. 
The principle that is articulated in clause 12 is that of equality among citizens. 
Citizenship is a growing, learning experience. 
Further to that, the oath is comfortable. 
It is easy to repeat. 
On motion of Senator DeWare, for Senator Andreychuk, debate adjourned.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Thus, I should like an opportunity to deal with this on an advance basis. 
I am requesting leaveto do so. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Thus, it is very helpful and a good procedure to utilize.  
The bill was read a first time. 
My understanding is that that is the bill that isbefore us.  
Now we have their bill, the bill that they should have sent to us. 
Instead, they sent us a bill with only some amendments in it.  
That requires a vote.  
Is it two-thirds or is it a simple majority? 
Let us clear up that matter as well.  
Other honourable senators may have something else to contribute to this debate. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, I will not repeat what Senator Kinsella has already said. 
We can come back tomorrow afternoon at the same level. 
It could be a mistake. 
I can only speak for myself. 
Honourable senators, it is not appropriate for me to move the motion. 
"Leave" means no dissenting voice.  
I will sum up from our point of view. 
Of course, we would prefer to proceed today. 
Senator Kinsella has observed that this omission is a serious mistake. 
I think they are all serious mistakes. 
Honourable senators, I agree. 
I would agree that this matter should stand for the day.  
I have noted his suggestions. 
Hon. Jean-Robert Gauthier :
Perhaps we could have a letter of apology. 
For once, the House of Commons does not stand out to be a perfect place. 
I am a little worried that there is some sloppinessover there.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
On motion of Senator Kinsella, for Senator Andreychuk, debate adjourned.  
Legal and Constitutional Affairs 
Motion to Authorize Committee to Study Sentencing-Debate Adjourned 
Hon. Lorna Milne , pursuant to notice of May 11, 2000, moved: 
That the Committee report to the Senate no later than June 21, 2001.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
On motion of Senator Kinsella, debate adjourned.  
Developments Respecting Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide 
Report of Social Affairs, Science and Technology Committee-Debate Adjourned 
Leave having been given to revert to Reports of Committees: 
The need for this national strategy is the first of our14 recommendations in the report. 
Canadians want the federal government to take a significant leadership role.  
What of those who have various other lung diseases? 
Why is palliative care not available to them? 
Honourable senators, Canadians are still dying in needless pain. 
Some progress has been made in very limited areas. 
However, there are things that the federal government can do on its own initiative. 
We have, over the years, moved to provide parental leave. 
We have moved to provide maternal leave. 
There will be 12 to 15 of these research centres established in Canada. 
Well, they are still not training their physicians in pain management. 
In this country, there are still no residencies in palliative care. 
They had tried to establish a program. 
Again, it is a question of dollars. 
The money has simply not been there.  
Honourable senators, it was an honour for me to chair this subcommittee. 
Senator Corbin was with us through each and every one of the presentations we received. 
I should like to particularly commend Senator Roche. 
You may not need a MRI or a CT scan, but you will die. 
I still say that a glossary is one of the most important things. 
If we define the terms at the start, discussions will be shorter. 
This is very advantageous.  
I repeat in closing that this report is unanimous. 
It is very important. 
The situation is, as our report says, "inexcusable."  
Let us be clear on this subject, honourable senators. 
Euthanasia and assisted suicide are illegal in Canada and should stay that way. 
Sickness, suffering and dying are an inevitable part of human experience. 
Perhaps it is the denial of death that permeates our culture. 
Doctors are trained to cure and make people better. 
Technology continually provides new means to prolong life. 
Social justice demands governments' priority attention to palliative care. 
On motion of Senator Corbin, debate adjourned.  
Leave having been given to revert to Notices of Government Motions: 
The Senate adjourned until Wednesday, June 7, 2000,at 1:30 p.m.
