The House met at 10 a.m. 
INCOME TAX AMENDMENTS ACT, 1999 
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Canadian Alliance):
He went on to explain that Revenue Canada was after him for back taxes. 
Thanks to my intervention, the RCMP prevented that from happening.  
That is a very important step. 
Having said that, I have some other concerns as well. 
These are the issues I will be dealing with in my remarks today. 
This was supposed to be a tax relief budget. 
``It is your money'', he said, ``after all''. 
Speaking to Canadians, he said that the tax dollars were their money. 
That is a significant step forward for the Liberal government. 
The answer is clearly no, Canadians cannot. 
Again, I would ask, is cancelling scheduled tax hikes really a tax break? 
That leaves a grand total of $7.9 billion for tax relief. 
Canadians are not so fortunate. 
This is what Canadians expect of their federal government. 
Canada's current debt load is approximately $580 billion. 
That is what Canadians are saying must not happen.  
The scandal does not stop at the department of human resources. 
That was in January. 
The number one concern of Canadians is health care. 
The provinces are upset about this and rightly so. 
I will continue to do this.  
It has to look for funding from other sources. 
It has to be creative, and it is. 
The government should also do something. 
In the next election campaign, we look forward to bringing this to the Canadian public. 
We want to see changes. 
The country wants to see changes. 
Is the Liberal government up to the challenge? 
I think the answer is no.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I want to direct a question to my friend from British Columbia.  
I have a newspaper clipping that puzzles me. 
The headline reads: ``Provinces should collect taxes, not Ottawa, Day says''. 
It was turned down as an idea that was far out in right field.  
Does my friend from British Columbia agree with this fellow named Stockwell Day? 
I mentioned in my speech that Premier Ujjal Dosanjh was here. 
That is an extreme view when it comes to politicians in this country.  
As for Stockwell Day, until recently he was the treasurer of Alberta. 
The provinces want to have more control over their funding. 
No, it does not.  
The hon. member for Regina-Qu'Appelle would probably agree that he likes that model. 
He likes to have the big central government in Ottawa. 
That is what his party stands for. 
Also, the member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca will be entering the debate. 
My question is very simple. 
That is what Stockwell Day is saying. 
Does he agree with that?  
The auditor general has said that he has severe concerns about that. 
There are mismanagement issues that have to be dealt with. 
The level of funding to health care should be restored. 
That should be addressed. 
I am one Canadian who will vote during the leadership race. 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of my hon. colleague. 
I think that Canadians are quite willing to pay taxes. 
They want to do their part to contribute to the state of the nation. 
One grant in particular stands out. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question. 
It is not used for job stimulation or job creation. 
The government does not create jobs. 
People who think that the government actually creates jobs are wrong. 
I know there are some bright people across the way. 
Canadian dollars should be left to Canadians.  
Priorities such as health care and education should be addressed. 
We must ensure that we have an adequate monetary system. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
A few minutes ago I had an exchange with my friend in the Reform Party- 
I get mixed up. 
I have not seen such a radical idea for a long time.  
Stockwell Day is a leadership candidate for the Alliance. 
He is aspiring to lead that party. 
I have not heard an idea like that for a long time. 
It is far out in lulu land. 
That idea was rejected back in 1776.  
Is that the kind of vision we want? 
Is that the kind of country we want? 
I have never heard anybody put forth that kind of idea before.  
It does not want the federal government to collect any more taxes. 
The provinces would do that and send a cheque every year to the federal government. 
That has not happened. 
The GST is still here today.  
She put her seat on the line in a byelection. 
They have not kept their word. 
Health care went along relatively smoothly for a number of years.  
I suggest that is not good enough. 
Another matter should be addressed in terms of the government's fiscal policies. 
Now we are seeing the biggest crisis since that particular time.  
Does the House know what it is in our country? 
He enjoyed the whiskey. 
That is what should be done.  
That is what we are asking on this side of the House. 
That is what Manitoba and Saskatchewan are asking of the government. 
That is becoming a very important issue today. 
The Canadian Conservative Reform Alliance Party of Canada is a long name. 
It will require a longer ballot in the next election campaign. 
It is saying that it has a new idea for taxes. 
Yet it is an idea being pushed by the Canadian Alliance Party.  
Why is it an idea that is not acceptable to good progressive thought? 
The big tax break would be for the the millionaires and the wealthy.  
That is not the way the country should go. 
That is the Canadian way. 
I conclude by saying what I said at the beginning. 
I have not heard an idea like this for an awful long time. 
I would like to know the response of Canadian Alliance members to that.  
If members have any questions or comments, I will take them now. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):
The current Prime Minister while in opposition said: 
The current Deputy Prime Minister said in 1985: 
What help have they been to those families?  
Justice delayed is justice denied.  
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, April is Cancer Awareness Month in Canada. 
I urge all members to lend their support and efforts in helping to fight cancer.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
A modernized plan without a renewed vision is simply rearranging the existing order of things.  
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):
Canada is a world leader in implementing these safety initiatives.  
BATTLE OF VIMY RIDGE 
Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):
We will be reminded of our coming of age as a nation. 
Out of Vimy a renewed confidence and sense of patriotism filled our nation. 
May we honour their memory as well as they honoured our country.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Canadian Alliance):
That sounds pretty political to me.  
Mr. John O'Reilly (Haliburton-Victoria-Brock, Lib.):
Congratulations to the Minister of Finance for his excellent budget.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
It is the best builder of oil rigs in Canada.  
Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):
We wish the participants good luck in their discussions.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):
The minister has not delivered what she says.  
Unfortunately the new immigration act will not help the very people that it should help. 
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Plan B will never suffice on either moral or political grounds.  
This is the political legacy the Prime Minister should leave us.  
VICTORIA HARBOUR STUDENT PARLIAMENT 
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
This year alone these children raised $5,000.  
THE LATE VICTOR TREMBLAY 
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
He was the youngest president of the Societe nationale de l'est du Quebec. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Two of the ships taking part in this event are particularly noteworthy.  
Molly Kleiker is a grade 10 student at Park View Education Centre in Bridgewater. 
This ship will also be participating in Tall Ships 2000.  
I wish them all best luck.  
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Canadian Alliance):
That is file tampering. 
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Let us use the budget to create jobs in areas of high unemployment.  
PUBLIC WORKS AND GOVERNMENT SERVICES 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
The offer was rejected by the owner on March 31.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Canadian Alliance):
No one dares stand in the way of this Prime Minister. 
The Prime Minister swiftly had Harder transferred out of the department.  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there was no special treatment. 
We offered whatever was left on the lease signed by a Conservative government in 1991. 
We offered $68.5 million, which was the value of the lease. 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
The hon. member's question is not relevant whatsoever. 
In fact, there was no special treatment. 
The owner of the building decided not to accept the government's offer.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Canadian Alliance):
I am sure we all remember Rene Fugere. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am very glad to be able to set the record straight. 
It is clear that we are reviewing our files. 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
We need a clear answer. 
We want clarity and nothing less.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let me be very clear. 
If she has proof, let her bring it forward.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the minister keeps touting her six point plan. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there are private clinics for profit around the country. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I share the concern that the hon. member expresses. 
PUBLIC WORKS AND GOVERNMENT SERVICES 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
It turfed the helicopter contract then bought the same helicopters. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Harder has been promoted to another senior deputy minister's position. 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, this government loves a botched investigation. 
If it cannot do it itself, it messes up someone else's.  
These documents are obviously central to the investigation.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, do they have to keep that information confidential even from the police?  
It wants documents that only the government can provide. 
Why will this government not co-operate?  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):
The problem with that is that CINAR is accused of tax fraud. 
One would think the government would want to get to the bottom of this.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
As far as I know, no charges have been laid.  
The only time taxpayer information may be provided is in respect of, and I quote: 
In other words, charges must- 
The hon. member for Okanagan-Coquihalla.  
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Canadian Alliance):
Why will the government not release those documents to the RCMP?  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Another member has said that the company has been charged. 
I challenge him to make that accusation outside the House. 
Perhaps the member would like to join him.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
He knows very well that a colleague of his has fallen victim to this.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Subsection 241(2) states the following: 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance):
What is the department hiding? 
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I can only repeat what I said earlier. 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
So this section indeed provides ``any other''. 
These are the only two exceptions.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Education is provincial jurisdiction- 
MILLENNIUM BUREAU OF CANADA 
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Canadian Alliance):
The HRDC scandal was bad enough. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the premise of the hon. member's question is wrong. 
This is the case as well for Reform ridings.  
That does not seem unfair, does it, Mr. Speaker? 
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I think the premise of that answer is all wrong. 
He administered the Millennium Bureau of Canada. 
Three-quarters of a million dollars went into his own riding. 
Why does it cost so much to buy votes in Liberal ridings?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the premise of my hon. friend's question is wrong. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the minister likes to quote transcripts. 
The president of the employees' union on questioning said: 
Have you ever received this information?  
Mr. Chair, we have got similar directions and the answer is yes.  
This is a very serious accusation. 
Could the minister shed some light on these accusations?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Let me continue to quote from the formal directive of February 16 that states: 
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
We are bringing these facts to the attention of the department today. 
These are very serious accusations.  
Will the minister call for yet another police investigation?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Marcel Proulx (Hull-Aylmer, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We have also made a commitment to increase funding to the provinces in order to- 
The hon. member for Wild Rose.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):
The Indian affairs minister says they do not have anything to worry about.  
Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is news to me. 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
My question is for the Minister for International Trade. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
The project is in jeopardy. 
Mr. Brent St. Denis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question. 
The report of the agent is still being evaluated.  
At any time they wish they could settle the matter. 
In due course a response will be made on the report of the agent.  
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Ian Murray (Lanark-Carleton, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry. 
What is the government doing to help eradicate this devastating and debilitating medical condition?  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
It is subject to renewal based on peer review. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):
They do not give a hoot.  
They are calling my office and I am passing on the numbers. 
This is very serious. 
These people are being threatened for speaking out. 
Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
The government has responded. 
Until we have that, nothing can be done. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
TABLING OF A DOCUMENT 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Canadian Alliance):
I believe she read from it. 
I wonder if she would be able to table it for the House.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would love to table it. 
I have it here, in both official languages.

INCOME TAX AMENDMENTS ACT, 1999 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I want to summarize. 
Once we collect taxes, on what do we spend the money?  
It is preserving the medical care system.  
I was honoured to be at that press conference with them. 
That is very significant. 
The crisis is still there. 
We are in the midst of the worst farm crisis since the 1930s.  
Suicides are up, reaching a record high. 
Farm stress, with all its attendant problems, is now very serious. 
The last point I mention is the system of education. 
I think that is one system where we should spend more money. 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance):
How much of this money is flowing back to the people that need it? 
That is not the case today. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
That might be acceptable in the case of the Senate. 
If the funds were insufficient, we could get rid of the place. 
Let us shed some light on this topic that Mr. Day has raised. 
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
A process in under way to bring together all the municipalities in that region. 
I am pleased but, at the same time, I am also very disappointed. 
The measures contained in these budgets are always spread out over several years. 
They are almost like Soviet plans, spread out over three, four or five years.  
That is the way it is done usually. 
We want change this year. 
In one sweep, this brings us all the way back to the beginning of Confederation. 
I can say this however. 
Our mission as the new government is to continue with real reform''.  
What did the Liberals do? 
They increased taxes 50 times. 
Not many people know that.  
Consider how much they benefit from free trade. 
Here again, they failed in their mission, which was to complement what we did. 
The government did absolutely nothing.  
Do members know what that led to? 
I often have to say ``Focus, quick''. 
I say why not follow the lead of the European Economic Community? 
Why not follow the example of Portugal? 
They have taken the trouble to write a book about it.  
Yes, we left a deficit of $40 billion. 
That is the same level as in 1984. 
You passed legislation on referendum clarity''.  
This still just skims the surface. 
We have the impression that this government does not want to govern. 
People no longer have anything to show for their efforts. 
And we think this is a democracy. 
This means that people are happy''.  
People are not happy. 
I am proud to be here to defend the former government's track record. 
This government abdicated its responsibility to continue the work that had been started.  
He said it this week.  
This means that the government is absolutely not carrying out its mandate. 
We know the Prime Minister has been in politics for 30 or 35 years. 
Canadian federalism has been in trouble for 30 years now. 
Mr. Speaker, you are a well informed man. 
You have followed politics over the last 30 years. 
I have a few small things to ask this government. 
Health is what is urgent. 
Let us give the funding back to provinces. 
Let us stop creating new programs.  
Let us talk about the millennium scholarship fund. 
People have accepted the GST and free trade. 
That is where the problem lies in Canada.  
It is perfection of the sum of all the parts.  
They want the fruits of their labour to be given back to them.  
They want the fruits of their labour back home in their families. 
What is happening in hospitals in the country makes no sense. 
Certainly, through a redefinition of our respective roles, we would.  
I hope things will change in the next election. 
Support of 38% is a bit shaky. 
The 101 members from Ontario are concerned about their fate, and I can understand that.  
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
This country is a federation. 
The hon. member talked about confederation. 
How does the hon. member see that unfolding?  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for her question. 
The federal health act exists to protect universality. 
The government has to stop treating the provinces like big municipalities. 
This government treats the provinces and their premiers like children. 
It wants to see the provinces beg.  
The provinces do not have the budgets to carry out their responsibilities. 
This has been going on for 30 years.  
He was always speaking from both sides of his mouth. 
I have an example of co-operative decentralized federalism. 
At the time, it was a real partnership in both democratic and constitutional terms.  
We will recall the Meech Lake accord. 
It took five or six Liberals, no more. 
It was a historic setback to the development of the country.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance):
We want to do a reality check on that. 
It is not tax relief at all. 
They are payroll taxes. 
Take that off the claim of $58.4 billion.  
That is nothing but a tax cut for suckers. 
Canadians are not going to fall for it.  
Canadians are not being fooled by that. 
This is not just my opinion. 
We are moving in the wrong direction. 
Its chief executive officer is Mr. John Roth. 
We agree with him.  
I have a chart in my hand that was prepared by this company. 
It has to stop. 
We have to turn it around. 
Alberta and Ontario have realized this. 
It is the only federal department that continues to add people to its staff. 
It is getting way to big.  
It costs a lot of money to collect the taxes in this country. 
The finance minister even consulted with this group and prior to his budget. 
That is the wrong way to go. 
The working poor should not be required to pay taxes. 
It is picking the pockets of the poor.  
Why do we tax people with low incomes? 
That seems abundantly reasonable.  
That is a $10,000 deduction for the spouse. 
They do not have to keep receipts. 
When they do pay tax they would pay at the lowest possible rate.  
There is much that is grievous about the budget. 
They understand that they have to contribute to government for the benefit of our country. 
It is a tragedy.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):
I want to drive home a point that I did not quite finish.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
However, marginal is the rate paid on each additional dollar. 
The hon. member's numbers for Canada reflect both the federal and provincial components. 
In the United States that is not the case. 
Finally, to wrap up, the hon. member talked about the Canada child tax benefit. 
He is absolutely right because the Canada child tax benefit is not a taxable item. 
When it used to be the family allowance, it was included in the taxes. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of privilege. 
The member has accused me of giving incorrect information.  
The Speaker is cognizant of the fact that sometimes members disagree profoundly. 
A year later here comes the cheque from the big state.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
It was an idea rejected by the Americans in 1776. 
It is rather bizarre. 
I know a lot of Reformers are hanging their heads in shame. 
I wonder if he is part of that group.  
Let us not give up hope.  
Why did that person make those statements? 
Let us think about it. 
He is the treasurer of one of the brightest lights in the country, Alberta. 
MODERNIZATION OF BENEFITS AND OBLIGATIONS ACT 
BILL C-23-TIME ALLOCATION MOTION 
ACCESS TO INFORMATION ACT 
Unfortunately, all government legislation emanates from the Department of Justice. 
Therefore, I undertook to write it myself.  
Indeed the current access to information commissioner has suggested just that. 
Schedule II in the old act is a list of exemptions. 
This is all dramatic stuff. 
Actually, the word is fear. 
The government should try to opt for openness wherever possible.  
This theme I hope runs right through it.  
Openness is a kind of contract. 
The government has to have necessary secrets.  
I am sure some are, I am sure some are not.  
Then I had representations coming from the bureaucracy. 
I had Statistics Canada wanting to visit to explain why it needed a special exemption. 
I had the justice department come forward to make some very, very helpful suggestions. 
I had representations from the privy council office. 
They wanted to get in on it as well.  
I will give an example of one of the changes that was proposed. 
There was another change with respect to cabinet confidences. 
I can explain that in further detail either now or at another time.  
There are problems in the legislation. 
It is not perfect. 
There are areas that have to be developed and examined in committee. 
That was a proposal from the access commissioner.  
There would be no user fee whatsoever. 
These are things that have to be clarified and debated.  
I put it back in the new version. 
I am not sure that was a good idea. 
This is what my colleagues have to examine.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):
I listened very carefully to the hon. member and I found his comments surprising. 
That day the hon. member for Wentworth-Burlington spoke against our motion. 
I have mixed feelings. 
The bill has a chequered past. 
It needs to be modernized, redefined, refined and amended. 
This bill is in fact regressive. 
Who determines when too many ATI requests come from a certain specific source? 
Another thing is the fees. 
There are two standards here. 
This is so undemocratic that it is anti-democratic.  
The government would be pleased if this bill passed. 
Is this a new tax? 
No wonder there were no amendments put forward by Bloc members. 
That is the kind of information in the bill.  
We will not be supporting it.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
As background, the Access to Information Act was adopted in 1982. 
This has not been for lack of effort. 
I commend the member for Wentworth-Burlington for his initiative in this file. 
He proposed releasing them after 15 years. 
I have a supplemental in closing. 
The Liberal government is now afraid to strengthen the law or to modernize it.  
We need to prevent ministers from manipulating the process. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
I am very honoured to have seconded the bill as well. 
The reason is that I know the member very well.  
I have great admiration for his work. 
I feel so very strongly about this bill because of where it came from. 
It touches one of the most important pieces of legislation we have in Canada. 
We know there has been great difficulty getting this bill shaped and fashioned. 
What a noble objective, to have the best Access to Information Act in the world. 
It is something to which Canada should aspire. 
It is something to which the member aspires. 
I know there will be some debate on it. 
I am surprised that some members have already declared that they will not support it. 
Some of the changes are very complex. 
Let me give some examples. 
He wants to broaden the notion of openness. 
He states that very clearly in the second amendment. 
That reason alone is enough for the act to be amended. 
We cannot be followers. 
With this bill, we have an opportunity to be leaders.  
In looking at these provisions, we should consider that they actually require prompt attention. 
The Private Members' Business question troubles me from time to time. 
It is as valid as any other bill in this place.  
He has given us a tool, an instrument to work with. 
I believe it is an excellent starting point. 
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Canadian Alliance):
I believe strongly that transparency in government is a laudable goal. 
That is the kind of freedom of information that we have in this country.  
My concerns with the key proposals in this bill are as follows.  
This is an extraordinary amendment to legislation dealing with openness. 
This is absolutely outrageous.  
Many would argue that the current legislation governing ATI is too restrictive. 
(The House adjourned at 2.30 p.m.)
