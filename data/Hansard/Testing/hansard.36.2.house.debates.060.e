Wednesday, March 1, 2000 
The House met at 2 p.m. 
As is our practice on Wednesday we will now sing O Canada.  
Members sang the national anthem ] 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
This is an amazing achievement and a welcome acknowledgement of her talent.  
We are all very proud of her.  
Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):
2008 SUMMER OLYMPIC AND PARALYMPIC GAMES 
Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
The Canadian government is involved in the development and training of our youth. 
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
The economy of the South Okanagan depends on it.  
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
This measure will protect Canadian taxpayers against inflation as far as taxation is concerned.  
Families with children will benefit even more.  
These are measures that will benefit Canadian families.  
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
No, not before 2001, and with a budget of only $100 million. 
The rest will come later.  
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
In its 1999 annual report it describes Correctional Service Canada as- 
This analysis comes from an organization that works extensively with CSC. 
These attitudes come straight from the very top. 
The commissioner thinks he is untouchable. 
It is up to the solicitor general to show this man who is the boss.  
Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):
Ken Battle of the Caledon Institute said: 
Families with kids are the big winners in this budget.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
As well, the member for Beausejour-Petitcodiac was very much involved with this lengthy debate.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
They are not there investigating parking violations. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
We do not treat the matter lightly. 
We want to see things looked into thoroughly. 
We want to see action taken on any problems.  
Thanks for the endorsement of our wonderful budget.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
These two or three little investigations are taking place in the Prime Minister's riding.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has been here too long. 
The list goes on and on.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
They talk about briefs. 
We on this side of the House believe in those investments.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, she talks about a few projects. 
The hon. member for Edmonton North.  
Let me quote from Hansard : 
That was not someone from the official opposition. 
The hon. Deputy Prime Minister.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Yes, the Reform Party needs lots of help. 
Thanks again for the endorsement.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
This is some logic.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The hon. member for Rosemont.  
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
This is what she seems to be telling us. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Yet the number of coincidences keeps going up.  
It is there in black and white.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I gather that it too- 
The hon. minister still has time if she wishes to use it.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Why will this government not put health care first?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
That is federal leadership.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, if the health minister wants to talk money then let us talk money. 
My question is very straightforward. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We are offering both. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Where has truth and accountability in government gone?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is mixing apples and oranges.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
I ask members to please stay away from statements like that. 
It would help us all.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Canadians understand what this issue is about. 
They have separated the politics from the substance. 
They know that it is not about waste. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, obviously the minister is very desperate. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
The case the hon. member is referring to is not one of those 37 cases. 
No wonder he does not have any questions on the budget. 
He does not know what he is talking about on that either.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
How can the minister not be aware of this?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Can the minister tell us where this money went?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
When we compared the two a number of troubling discrepancies came to light. 
In several cases projects showed up in different ridings and some had even been deleted. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
One is a college. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I reject the allegations made by the hon. member. 
Let us look at some of the projects in the city of Calgary.  
The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Mr. Speaker, that party talks about these projects being wasteful. 
The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development, if she wishes to proceed.  
I have a very long list of questions that I would ask. 
There is a very long list here. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Hon. Maria Minna (Minister for International Cooperation, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, first, we do not give grants. 
I do not have the name of this particular company. 
I will look into it and give her the answer.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, let us be clear. 
Claude Gauthier received $6 million from CIDA. 
The affair is controversial. 
In both cases, the person responsible was the present Minister for International Trade.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
The members opposite must respect the rules of this House.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
This list is obviously totally flawed. 
How could anyone believe any of the information that the minister is giving?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
As we have said all along, programs can change.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Here are some more specifics for her. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
MINISTER FOR INTERNATIONAL TRADE 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, there is a devastating report on CIDA. 
There is a scandal at Human Resources Development Canada.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
I want to reassure this House that the situation at international trade is perfect.  
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the President of the Treasury Board.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the minister has it wrong. 
We are very interested.  
This is two million tax dollars from the minister's own special reserve fund. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
There were only two cents for health for every dollar of tax cuts.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I am back to the budget.  
I want to ask the minister one more time, where is the balance? 
What is his definition of fairness? 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The hon. member wants to talk about taxes. 
The hon. member for Madawaska-Restigouche.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
He is still not a registered lobbyist.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member makes reference to the Opitciwan sawmill. 
Ninety-two per cent of those employed are aboriginals.  
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
I ask the minister which is it?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean.  
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
My question is for the Minister of Finance. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I want to thank the hon. member as well. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
AMENDMENTS TO BILL C-20 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
I want to tell you about an extremely serious situation. 
I have these two amendments with me.  
This action imperils these rights, which everyone recognizes as fundamental. 
But there is more. 
While our privileges are defined, contempt of the House has no limits. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
The first is the fact that her party's amendments were rejected. 
I say this at all levels for the people working for us. 
That is our privilege.  
We are not in a dictatorship, here.  
When I say this, I am not imputing any motives.  
He is indeed imputing motives, Mr. Speaker. 
No, I am merely repeating- 
I wish to hear what the member has to say.  
This is the result of the situation we find ourselves in today.  
Mr. Speaker, I would like to add a small clarification.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
We have to leave it to you and your staff to do that.  
It has limited debate in the House of Commons. 
It refused to let the committee travel. 
It disallowed any travel whatsoever.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, there are two matters.  
That is not the point.  
Two questions were raised. 
We have a relationship of confidentiality with the legislative counsels. 
We worked with one of them in drafting a number of amendments. 
A number of the amendments we had prepared were tabled. 
We noted something that gives us cause for concern. 
That is where the problem lies.  
It seems there is a bit of a problem.  
There are two issues here.

GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOOD LABELLING 
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):

Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Question No. 66- Mr. John Williams: 
(d) The overhang was repaired.  
I ask, Mr. Speaker, that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
Motion No. P-7 
Motion No. P-9 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
It appears that there will have to be further consultations. 
Everyone's position is clear now. 
FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF MINISTER OF FINANCE 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Eight hundred million dollars. 
What else did he say? 
He said, ``We have a crisis in health care. 
He cannot go to a mental health institution.  
He said it was tax cuts. 
Today he is saying he needs money. 
Well, the money is there. 
I am very pleased. 
We thought we should presume that parents are the primary caregivers. 
Breast feeding is also an important implication. 
He studied 25 years of population data in nine European countries. 
Specifically the budget proposes that the time be doubled to one year. 
I was looking at some numbers. 
There is a gradation as a result of combined family income.  
I also thought of this very interesting and important point. 
I looked at the other side. 
All of a sudden there is a higher Canada child tax benefit. 
The issue for me is not the money. 
I just wrote a monograph on that subject. 
It is time we invested in our children. 
We have to understand that all parents do not live in urban centres. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a couple of questions for the member.  
It was probably a higher amount in Ontario.  
I would like his comment on what has happened to the 50:50 help.  
I say stupid because that is what they are.  
There are no strings. 
I am sorry, but the member seems to have his facts wrong.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Everything the government is doing is in the opposite direction. 
Why is the government ignoring the National Forum on Health? 
Why is the government ignoring the advice of Canadians?  
That represents a 25% increase over two years. 
That reflects the commitment of the federal government. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
This budget was no exception. 
In fact it continued the trend.  
The budget took what I would call a shotgun approach to government spending. 
That was in 1997-98.  
What did he do in 1998-99? 
I have to wonder whether he lives in the real world.  
Lo and behold, we find that what he actually will spend is $115 billion. 
That is overspending by $4 billion.  
That is one of the points we want to make today.  
In addition, he has gone on a spending spree. 
The finance minister not only is continuing to spend, he has been spending huge amounts. 
However, we find that is not the case. 
What is the government spending money on and why? 
What are its priorities? 
Then we heard that health care was its priority. 
Then we heard that children were the priority.  
Let us look at the Liberal record. 
What was the result? 
They put only $5 billion back in the last two years. 
I want to examine the whole area of tax cuts. 
Let us look at what they have actually done.  
The tax cuts were announced at $58 billion. 
That sounds like a good, big figure, does it not? 
This is a debt. 
In fact, $13.5 billion falls into that category. 
I want to spend some time on the control of government spending. 
It was just ``It is not my money. 
There is lots where that came from. 
Canadians pay lots of taxes. 
Let us just send it out the door''.  
Let us cut him a cheque''. 
I do not know. 
There was no application.  
In 72% of the cases there was no cash flow forecast. 
There was no financial plan at all.  
In 80% of the cases there was no financial monitoring. 
In 87% of the cases there was no evidence of supervision. 
Money was just given out with no supervision. 
It did not merit a single line in the budget.  
There was not a word. 
We have a very serious situation in the country. 
They pay their taxes. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I will not get into that.  
I could go on and on with examples.  
I will give two quick examples, with the indulgence of the House. 
Perhaps the Liberals may want to do that as well.  
Everyone can look at it.  
Productive people assist others. 
They are consumers and entrepreneurs. 
They are the backbone of the economy. 
Somehow Liberal members think that the government creates jobs. 
I have news for them. 
This is exactly what the budget perpetuates.  
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her HRDC speech. 
That adds up to $58 billion. 
The numbers the hon. member is putting forward are not realistic. 
It is in fact $17 billion worth of tax relief. 
It is in fact a five year tax reduction plan. 
I do not understand the thrust of the hon. member's speech. 
We know the government will put the best face on its budget. 
At the end of the day I invite Canadians to make their own decision.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Today's retirees get $8 out for every $1 they put in. 
The hon. member for Calgary-Nose Hill.  
Younger Canadians are now being socked with that 30 years of mistake. 
They will to have to put a lot of money into the plan. 
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for Niagara Falls.  
I will begin by apologizing to the finance minister. 
The good news does not stop there. 
I expect this will do the same thing.  
Any one of these steps would be a significant reform to the income tax system. 
Cumulatively it is enormous.  
However, it does not end there. 
If a business is not competitive it will not survive. 
If that business does not survive it will have no employees.  
Regardless of what others say, this was absolutely necessary. 
It is the worst of all possible worlds.  
The so-called brain drain is of concern to us all. 
These are significant in and of themselves but cumulatively these are extremely significant.  
This is the best budget in 25 years. 
This is a taxpayers' budget. 
This is a budget that addresses the fiscal reality in an even-handed way. 
This budget is good for business. 
This is great for personal tax filers. 
I would urge hon. members to support the passage of this budget.  
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
That would have been really something to hear.  
How many years has the government had to eliminate this? 
Second is the matter of health care spending. 
I would be very happy to hear his responses to these questions.  
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is right. 
That is the first answer to the hon. member's questions. 
This is the first meaningful surplus we have had.  
It meant a significant sum of money in Ontario. 
Forty per cent of $3.5 billion is a significant sum of money. 
Does the member know how much money has hit the ground in my riding? 
There is this huge whine from the other premiers saying ``Give us more money''. 
What did they do with the last bit of money? 
Mr. Gary Pillitteri (Niagara Falls, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak in the debate on the budget. 
The unemployment rate is now at its lowest level in 24 years. 
We must be doing something right.  
The reviews from the riding on budget 2000 are more than positive. 
It is a plan that will put more money into the pockets of Canadians.  
Our plan is secured by two fundamental changes. 
With this plan the government is providing real and lasting tax relief.  
Tax indexation is not a new idea. 
Indexation also means protection against inflation for seniors. 
Canadian business will also benefit from tax cuts. 
We are cutting personal income taxes by an average of 15%. 
Many will enjoy bigger cuts. 
In turn the government will receive more revenue. 
This initiative will be well received in my riding of Niagara Falls. 
My riding is a so-called border riding. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am afraid that the time is over.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
But I will not mince my words.  
What sort of credibility does the Minister of Finance have? 
Madam Speaker, I thank the member for his question. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
It does not look too promising.  
I wonder if they are there. 
What about wasteful spending? 
That member laughs because he thinks it is funny and great. 
Only a Liberal would laugh at anything that stupid. 
I wonder if he would like to respond.  
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his remarks. 
We have different beliefs and opposing views. 
They say that the flat tax is the salvation of all, a better tax. 
It reminds me of a serial I used to watch on television called The Flintstones . 
With a flat tax, nothing moves, nothing is progressive.  
I want Canadians to understand that Canada is a great country to live in. 
We as the Liberal government made it a better place to live in. 
When we get up in the morning we think it is a bright day. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
This is contemptuous and ridiculous. 
It was estimated that some $4.2 billion were required. 
What would we do with $500 million? 
It is the equivalent of the budget allocated to home support. 
Imagine the sharp mind of the Minister for International Trade at 80. 
Allow me to digress again. 
But we are short $500 million.  
Home support is important. 
I believe the government must realize this is a provincial responsibility first and foremost. 
I will get back to this later. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I listened with great interest to the member opposite. 
That is an all time high. 
I would like to hear the hon. member's opinion. 
You are such a liar. 
You are just plain and simple lying.  
The question I have for the hon. member is quite simple. 
I would be very interested in that.  
Listen to the hon. member opposite, the Reformer, calling me a liar. 
He should watch himself. 
He should go back to- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.  
However, I warn my colleague against any attempt to divert the debate. 
I ask my colleague to engage in this campaign with me; together we will succeed.  
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
Madam Speaker, the famous and long-awaited federal budget was tabled Monday.  
This budget is characterized by two things: timing and electoral opportunism. 
The municipalities will have to wait for the election goodies. 
Let us talk about EI now. 
With the current surpluses, the federal government could have helped the unemployed. 
In my riding of Lotbiniere, there are still two regional rates. 
This opportunistic decision essentially motivated by electoral considerations will penalize our regions.  
My colleague just spoke at length about the health care issue. 
Only $2.5 billion in additional funding will be given over four years. 
They are laughing at the sick, the young and the poor. 
They are showing lack of respect for the people of Quebec. 
Let us talk about tax relief. 
Tuesday morning, the daily Le Soleil ran the headline ``Taxpayers, be Patient''.  
Here are more numbers. 
This is the trademark of federal Liberals. 
As far as we are concerned, the Minister of Finance missed the boat. 
We know that an election campaign is looming on the horizon.  
These people are very partisan and they often take advantage of elections. 
There are many reasons to condemn this government. 
We are lagging behind. 
We were expecting $1.7 billion from the federal government this year. 
We need social housing. 
There is a lot of catching up to do.  
As I said at the beginning of my speech, the federal government is waiting. 
While it is waiting, it is engaged in political and electoral opportunism. 
In the meantime, who is suffering? 
The unemployed, the students, and the sick are.  
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That is $59 billion over the five years of the budget plan.  
They will account for about 25% of the province of Quebec's estimated revenues. 
They are expected to be about $1,566 per person. 
That is about 18% above the national average.  
Perhaps the member opposite would read the budget. 
In fact the province of Quebec receives almost $5 billion in equalization payments. 
Quebec receives that because it is a poor province. 
Did he read it?  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
My question for the Bloc member is on agriculture spending. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, the hon. member for Lakeland, for his question.  
Fortunately, in Quebec we have the Bloc Quebecois to defend Quebec farmers.  
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for Guelph-Wellington.  
It is essentially a Canadian document. 
It is not radical; it is measured, it is well paced. 
It is irrefutably a strong pro-growth document.  
This budget represents a long term strategy. 
We have met that commitment and prudent planning has become our hallmark. 
Today the economic situation of the country has changed dramatically. 
He indicated that indexation was a prudent approach for stimulating our economy. 
This will benefit every Canadian family.  
The government has set out a plan that reduces personal income tax. 
We have now met this commitment. 
This leave will be made more flexible and accessible. 
We have also invested in programs and tax relief for disabled Canadians. 
In Kitchener the Independent Living Centre has received funding from the opportunities fund. 
Kitchener is a hotbed for small business and high tech industry. 
Our tax system is now more conducive to investment and to innovation.  
Having met with student presidents from these schools, I have heard the need. 
The mayor of Kitchener, Mr. Curl Zehr, said: 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Here are some facts on which I would like the member's response.  
That is a fact number one.  
I have five children. 
That is fact number two.  
Canadians are worried about health care. 
That is fact number three.  
There is a better option, which is Reform's solution 17. 
That is what we have to offer.  
Canadians get a lot in return for their tax dollars. 
There are many challenges. 
The problem is much more than money. 
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague across the way for her wonderful speech. 
One of the students wanted me to ask a question of the government. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for the question. 
Clearly, it is a topic that we have discussed. 
There are the millennium scholarships. 
This is an issue that we need to work on together with the provinces. 
While we transfer money to the provinces, we see very different approaches. 
I believe that the federal government is trying to be part of the solution.  
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):
This is a budget that all Canadians can and should be proud of. 
It is a balanced budget in two ways. 
Last fall I conducted a prebudget survey in my riding of Guelph-Wellington. 
I asked my constituents to identify their priorities for the 2000 federal budget. 
The government listened to our concerns and acted on them. 
This is the fourth consecutive time that we have increased funding for the CHST. 
Here is another important figure. 
Obviously the federal government is committed to health care. 
This is the highest amount ever that has been transferred to the provinces.  
The federal government is also committed to post-secondary education. 
In short, we have turned the economy around. 
Ontario gave a tax cut and borrowed money.  
Tax brackets have also been adjusted. 
One way we can do this is by protecting the environment. 
The Guelph council and mayor want this infrastructure program. 
Together we will continue to improve the quality of life of each and every Canadian.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
I am referring to the child benefits. 
That has to be taken off the $58 billion.  
What does that amount do for an individual? 
All these nice things are deceit in the worst way. 
The finance minister knows it and the member should know it.  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am afraid the hon. member is getting into debate. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
I got carried away in the heat of the moment.  
I want to address some of the points he talked about. 
He talked about the child tax benefit that we are giving. 
He talked about the environment. 
He talked about knowledge, innovation and families. 
For all of it he said ``take it off, take it away''.  
I am not surprised we hear that from the Reform Party. 
There has never been support for any of those things from the Reform Party. 
It is important that they have social programs to support them. 
It is important that we support the environment. 
If we do not, what will be left for our children?  
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
I will be splitting my time with the member for Elk Island.  
I am pleased that the government has finally listened to the Reform Party of Canada. 
I am pleased to see that end. 
For the last 40 years we have seen spend. 
Liberals believe in bigger, bigger, bigger; more spending, more spending, more spending. 
We have seen an $86 billion increase in spending in the budget. 
How did the Minister of Finance respond? 
He raised its budget by $226 million this year alone. 
That is how he responds to unaccountable, unacceptable spending. 
That is completely unacceptable. 
That is what a budget is. 
That is what we have been responding to. 
That is what the billion dollar boondoggle is. 
That is what this unaccountable spending is. 
That is what the slush fund is.  
It is absolutely unacceptable.  
What happens when spending is increased to this magnitude? 
We go into another deficit situation. 
Let us look at the finance minister's numbers. 
There is a graph with two lines, fiscal requirements surplus and budget requirements.  
Does the House know what will happen at the end of this year? 
Some would ask what that means. 
Do you know, Madam Speaker, what he told us there? 
He has found a new gold credit card. 
It is in black and white. 
The minister's definition of financial requirements on page 47 states: 
This government is crazy about spending. 
It is evident in its own numbers. 
That is exactly what the government has gone back into.  
It has its spending programs. 
At the same time it is ignoring the debt. 
There is not a mention about the debt. 
Yes, there is a $3 billion contingency fund. 
It does not mention that at all. 
It is not nearly enough.  
I will conclude right now in one sentence. 
It is an absolute bloody disgrace.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The question is on the amendment to the amendment. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the amendment to the amendment will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I declare the amendment to the amendment lost.  
(The House adjourned at 6.48 p.m.)
