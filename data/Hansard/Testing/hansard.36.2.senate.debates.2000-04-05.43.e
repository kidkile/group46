The Senate met at 1:30 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Changing Mandate of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Report of Foreign Affairs Committee on Study Tabled 
Hon. Peter A. Stollery :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Tobacco Youth Protection Bill 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Kosovo-Resolution on Return of Serbian Force-Government Policy 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I appreciate that reply. 
There are humanitarian reasons such as family reunification. 
I will certainly attempt to get the honourable senator as specific a response as possible. 
Agriculture and Agri-Food 
Farm Crisis in Prairie Provinces-Support Funding to Farmers-Demands of Banks 
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
Most farmers have not received any money yet. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
The honourable senator makes a telling point. 
I will undertake to raise his inquiries specifically with the Minister of Agriculture. 
On the part of the financial institutions, however, that practice would be very short-sighted.  
In fact, honourable senators, this practice is very general. 
He has already signed up. 
That goes for every farmer who takes a cash advance. 
The same thing is true with payments from the government.  
I understand the nature of the honourable senator's concern. 
I will raise it with the Minister of Agriculture, as I have indicated.  
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
They were trying to say that they were being even-handed in the situation. 
It was taking 18 months to fill out the forms.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
That will surely have a dramatic effect on their credit situation.  
I take these questions seriously. 
Perhaps my question was not clear enough or put appropriately enough when I asked it. 
Is it the final position of the government with respect to those farmers?  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
These folks are forecasting that one-third of them will lose their family farms.  
They do not have the money to do that now. 
It is a situation that the Minister of Agriculture continues to monitor. 
They are just asking to survive, not to live well.  
Honourable senators, I recognize that fact. 
I will undertake to do that before the end of the week.  
China-Resolution on Human Rights-Government Policy 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
It is probably worse than it has been in 10 years. 
I do not presume to go over my speech again.  
It pleads with China to look again at this issue.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
It is in the process of consulting with other like-minded countries. 
Clearly, our viewpoint is beyond doubt. 
We will be announcing a decision on that situation in the near future.  
Honourable senators, the minister used the term "like-minded countries" in his response. 
This serious resolution will come forward. 
It is one that we will undoubtedly need to address as a country.  
Sanctions Against Iraq-Government Policy 
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
The honourable senator asks what our position will be in the debate. 
Report of Secretary-General-Request for Distribution to Parliamentarians 
Honourable senators, I thank the minister for that answer. 
This will be the largest meeting of world leaders ever. 
It is such a remarkable and forward-minded report.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I will convey their views to the minister.  
In any event, I will respond specifically to the honourable senator on his request.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I should like to introduce some special guests in the gallery. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I should like to introduce to you some distinguished visitors in the gallery. 
They are accompanied by His Excellency Janis Lusis, the ambassador of the Republic of Latvia.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Celine Hervieux-Payette :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Leave is not granted, honourable senators.  
Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Bill 
Nisga'a Final Agreement Bill 
Third Reading-Debate Suspended 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
No party has the authority to change the agreement unilaterally. 
The courts have said that treaty rights are not absolute. 
Here, I refer to paragraph 56 of the general provisions. 
Of course, there will be a claim for compensation if it legislates without agreement.  
Paragraph 125 of the Nisga'a government chapter states: 
Nothing in this Agreement affects the authority of: 
a. Canada to declare a national emergency; or 
b. British Columbia to declare a provincial emergency 
in accordance with federal and provincial laws of general application.  
That is made clear in paragraph 15 of the access chapter. 
I should like to refer briefly to the law. 
These same arguments will apply mutatis mutandis to Canada's international obligations.  
This was referred to yesterday by honourable senators opposite. 
The subject matter of the case related to certain discriminatory provisions of the Indian Act. 
Finally, an important point that was raised by Senator Beaudoin:
This section only applies to the Parliament of Canada and provincial legislatures.  
Honourable senators, that ends the answer portion of my responsibilities.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
My final question is perhaps more a political question than a legal one. 
I decline to walk with him down that path this second time.  
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
Obviously, the honourable senator has conferred with someone in the last 24 hours. 
Does the honourable senator have an answer to that question?  
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Honourable senators, I wish to thank the Honourable Senator Austin for his clarifications today. 
The powers of protection under section 35 are not absolute.  
I do not wish to use the phrase. 
Some witnesses used it. 
In my view, that is a catch-all phrase and not useful. 
Certain powers are given to the Nisga'a under this agreement. 
Honourable senators, that is a neat question.  
Honourable senators, we had this discussion with the professors from Osgoode Hall. 
There is an aboriginal government. 
It is another government. 
That is as far as I wish to go with my own position. 
The rest of the discussion, as far as I am concerned, is rhetorical.  
I am not sure if it is rhetorical. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
If they are not, then the word "government" does not apply.  
When I studied constitutional law, I had a provincial rights professor. 
I rather fancy that way of looking at governments in this country.  
Parallel or equal, they are similar; they each have respective jurisdictions. 
They are each considered partners of the other. 
Whenever there is a federal-provincial conference, the partners meet.  
The aboriginal government does not have the powers of the federal government. 
It does not have the powers of a provincial government in this country. 
It is a government. 
We should be looking at what we are doing here. 
The rest of it becomes an exercise in either a philosophy or political science class.  
However, we are using terms that are usually applicable to a separate entity. 
This body could name its own judges, for instance. 
If I am wrong, the honourable senator may correct me.  
Those last few words are absolutely correct. 
That section was rejected.  
It was rejected for unknown reasons.  
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
The Honourable Senator Grafstein is correct. 
The federal government has all the residual power not given to the provinces. 
My constitutional law professor was a provincial rights professor. 
You have a fellow in the other place, as well.  
It is true that Parliament may restrict a collective right or an individual right. 
However, the question raised by the Honourable Senator Andreychuk is about the emergency power.  
The provinces and the Parliament are sovereign in their spheres. 
There is no doubt about that. 
They should not intervene. 
The law must be founded on logic. 
Perhaps that is the only answer that we may give to this problem.  
I still have doubts about this. 
I have been told that the government will not do that. 
For that reason, we are dealing with those serious doubts.  
All lawyers are not on the same side. 
What does the honourable senator have to say about that?  
I tried to make the following point in my earlier remarks today. 
The test of justification would be very simple in that situation.  
What about the 14 cases to which I refer? 
That is my only problem with that project. 
We have concurrent power with the provinces, currently.  
However, in this case we go one step further. 
We say that parmountcy exists in 14 areas. 
Ordinary jurisprudence does not say that. 
However, it must demonstrate a just reason.  
The people of B.C. have been asking for a referendum. 
That is what makes us suspicious. 
Let them decide and make it a constitutional amendment. 
That is very much a political statement. 
I will answer it by saying that I am a believer in responsible government. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The government will not follow a doctrine of fairness...  
You are wrong there. 
I did not say that yesterday. 
You have your facts wrong, Senator Austin.  
Why don't you speak when it is your turn?  
I am doing what you did yesterday.  
I believe my facts are right.  
Everything that was argued was argued plainly and simply by all of the parties.  
There was not enough money on the table. 
Was that negotiating in bad faith? 
The Crown will establish on what terms and on what basis it wishes to negotiate.  
He could have played a role as a mediator. 
However, unfortunately, he saw his role as a partisan and as an adversary. 
Why would they continue?  
I absolutely reject that suggestion. 
I suggested to Senator St. Germain that he should withdraw the amendment. 
I do not think it is fairly based. 
Honourable senators, I am really at a loss for words. 
I never said anything in this place about conflict. 
I did, however, in committee. 
Yesterday, however, I never uttered a word in this chamber in regard to that issue. 
He is citing me for this, that and the other thing. 
I did in committee, but I did not in this chamber. 
Does the honourable senator agree?  
Yes, that is correct.  
I merely wish to set the record straight, honourable senators. 
Senator Austin says I am questioning the methodology. 
I am only trying to represent the case of the Gitanyow and the Gitxsan. 
I am not prefabricating anything. 
What is wrong with Senator Austin? 
Is he asleep at the switch?  
Are you going to vote in favour of the bill here?  
I will do what I think is right for aboriginal people and for British Columbians. 
This is not a Liberal or a Conservative issue. 
Have you accused the government of negotiating in bad faith, or haven't you?  
It is not a question of the Nisga'a. 
I have the floor, honourable senators.  
The Hon. The Speaker pro tempore :
Does the Honourable Senator St. Germain have a question?  
That is what I am disputing. 
I have given the honourable senator my evidence. 
Now he is asking me a question. 
We will reverse roles, then. 
Why did the government appeal the case? 
Why not just accept what Judge Williamson said? 
The government appealed the case. 
That is why I believe that the government possibly could have bargained in bad faith.  
That is why we are where we are.  
Senator Austin referred to the Charlottetown Agreement. 
I have travelled it, and I have visited these villages. 
My concerns are not only for myself, my wilp - 
It is my opinion that this treaty is a dictatorship-structured treaty. 
Those who have concerns are left on the outside looking in. 
A structure is not in place to ensure that future - 
The phone call was of such a nature that she reported it to the RCMP.  
She read everything she could. 
With regard to Bill C-9, she said: 
Possibly Senator Austin could follow that up.  
We would appreciate an answer to that question.  
I question their logic. 
Why would these parliamentarians, whose rights are enshrined - 
- because they are non-native - 
- promote laws that will require and force native women to fight for their rights?  
I also received a letter from Mrs. Isabelle Dulmage. 
That is her simple way of talking about paramountcy. 
Why are we afraid to demand a level playing field? 
The Nisga'a third order of government - 
Betty Eckgren of Victoria writes: 
It would be divisive and weakening to our national unity.  
A writer from Surrey says: 
It is more than the Liberal M.P.s were prepared to do.  
It is interesting that in this debate money is not discussed. 
Another letter from Vancouver says: 
Thank you for listening to us.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable Senator Carney, your allotted 15 minutes of speaking time has elapsed. 
Do you request leave to continue?  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Robin Dodson, a bureaucrat who is now with the treaty negotiations, is quoted as saying: 
The West Vancouver correspondent comments: 
Here is a letter from Katie Eliot of Richmond. 
Many Nisga'a people themselves do not like this current Agreement.  
Ms Eliot asks for a provincial referendum, which I am not suggesting.  
I promised that I would end with a letter supporting the Nisga'a agreement. 
This is from Roy Dagneau of Salmon Arm.  
- Mr. Dagneau is referring to a pamphlet sent by Preston Manning of the Reform Party - 
He rejects the referendum by saying: 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the next speaker on this side is Senator Sibbeston. 
Hon. Nick G. Sibbeston :
It has been a long road and a big struggle for the Nisga'a. 
It outlined the law as it then was, being: 
This is what Indian title meant then. 
Obviously, the discussion and the demarcation of aboriginal rights since those dates have advanced.  
In a speech that he gave in Vancouver, Mr. Trudeau said: 
However, "aboriginal rights" really means, "We were here before you. 
Mr. Trudeau then said, "Our answer is no."  
That was former prime minister Trudeau back in 1969. 
A question then arose as to whether this section included a right to self-government. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable Senator Sibbeston, I regret that I must interrupt. 
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
