The Late HonourableRichard A. Donahoe, Q.C. 
Richard Donahoe was a wonderful orator and also a keen judge of oratory. 
It was a somewhat intimidating experience. 
Let there be no doubt - he expects us to rise to this occasion.  
His funeral last Saturday was at St. Mary's Basilica in Halifax. 
On an occasion such as Saturday's, one is conscious of being surrounded by history.  
Two former archbishops of Halifax conducted the service.  
They were all there to pay a respectful and affectionate farewell.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham :
As well, his life was properly celebrated.  
Yes, former senator Richard Donahoe was always larger than life. 
He was quick-witted and gifted with a commanding presence. 
He was eloquent and a champion of all his beliefs. 
Honourable senators, Dick Donahoe was a great debater in this chamber. 
In one of his finest pieces, the senator wrote: 
I will arise now and go to Innisfree...I 
hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore...I 
hear it in the deep heart's core.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
He was a great Nova Scotian. 
He spent the rest of his life as a tireless supporter of that former institution. 
He ran in the general election of 1956, 1960, 1963 and 1967. 
He continued to serve in the cabinet of Premier George Isaac Smith.  
They learned well from their father. 
Dick Donahoe's life was worth sharing. 
Because of the examples set by our respective fathers, politics was a logical choice. 
Dick's appointment to the Senate was greeted with celebration in the Connolly household. 
Therefore, what better Tory to have it go to than Richard A. Donahoe?  
I wish to express my sincere sympathies to the whole Donahoe family. 
They are our friends - friends of the Connollys. 
They mourned with us the loss of our parents. 
We mourn today the loss of their father.  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
He was the embodiment of the public service. 
He and his family have been close friends of mine for more than 44 years. 
I was honoured to have known him. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Rumour has it that she never cast another Liberal vote from that day on.  
He was quoted often in our home during that campaign of 1956. 
Hon. Erminie J. Cohen :
Honourable senators, today we observe Yom Hashoah, Holocaust Memorial Day. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I ask for 24 hours to reply. 
Report on Sea King Talon41 Incident 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
I certainly hope this is true of the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
I am referring to the report on the Talon41 incident. 
All times are approximate.  
Talon41 then declared an in-flight emergency, known as a PAN. 
TX pressure stabilized at 20 PSI - which is outside of the operational limits. 
The crew decided to land as soon as possible in the Lawrencetown area. 
At 10:58, the crew noticed the TX pressure drop to 15 PSI. 
The crew decided to land immediately. 
Shut-In Island was nearby and chosen as the landing spot.  
Some grinding sounds were heard by the crew.  
At 11:03, Talon41 landed on Shut-In Island.  
The left side of Talon41 sinks slightly into the soggy ground.  
I will be asking some questions about that later.  
National Native Role Model Awards 
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
It was hosted by the Governor General of Canada, Her Excellency Adrienne Clarkson.  
The ceremony honoured the newest recipients of the National Native Role Model Award. 
Special Senate Committee on Bill C-20 
Notice of Motion to Appoint 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I give notice that, on Thursday next, I will move: 
Replacement of Sea King Helicopters-Report on Talon41 Incident 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
I am no longer particularly interested in hearing about the maintenance regime. 
These aircraft are always safe as long as they are on the ground. 
That is excellent but not enough to ensure the reliability of these aircraft. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
The existing helicopters are old. 
They are complicated pieces of equipment.  
I ask the minister to think back to the Talon41 report. 
They had one minute to get to dry land. 
Show some faith in the men and women who must fly these aircraft."  
However, as we have said before, this is an old, complicated piece of equipment. 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
One must wonder where the minister was during that information session.  
I have spoken to other military personnel and to the minister. 
These incidents do occur. 
As a matter of fact, they occur with brand new equipment. 
Honourable senators, many of us on this side of the house are quite disturbed. 
They refused to withdraw their allegations of criminal behaviour. 
In this case we have aircraft that are falling out of the sky.  
In fact, one might even describe it as a diatribe.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
That is the responsible answer to the question.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, perhaps I can phrase our concern in another way. 
The reassurances of the military are not enough.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I cannot answer that question. 
I will take it as notice and return with an answer.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, the answer to that question might spur some action.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, that is what we refer to as a hypothetical question.  
The question is operational in nature.  
I will pass that concern along to him.  
Replacement of Sea King Helicopters 
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson :
Honourable senators, I should like a simple answer from the minister, please. 
Why is the government so reluctant to replace these worn out helicopters? 
What is going on? 
Does the government not care?  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Report of Special Joint Committee on Code of Conduct-Government Response 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
The article by Lorne Surtees, which my honourable colleague will have read, states: 
When, if ever, will the minister act on that report? 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I would welcome his presence there.  
It is a report that might help shed some light on this problem. 
The purposes of the Code of Official Conduct are: 
Has the Government of Canada taken a firm position on this matter?  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I should like to put the question in greater detail. 
On the one hand, the Government of Canada says it has not taken a position. 
This is an irresponsible attitude on the part of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
They have, in fact, asked for nothing. 
There is something wrong here, it seems to me. 
This is a limited defence system. 
Just how does the Government of Canada operate?  
No chemical company wants to go there. 
Therefore, federal research grants are unavailable.  
My question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate is this:
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I will give you two examples of massive programs. 
Universities have matched funds and, indeed, provincial governments have set up matching funds. 
Honourable senators, I recognize the very important initiatives that have come forward. 
I certainly think these are notable achievements. 
Is that the Leader of the Government's final answer?  
Honourable senators, I have a supplementary question. 
Many universities all across this country will be searching for those 2,000 people. 
Pages Exchange Program with House of Commons 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Sonja Harrington is from of Ottawa. 
She is majoring in journalism.  
Third Reading-Debate Adjourned 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, I wish to speak but not today. 
Therefore, I will take the adjournment of the debate.  
On motion of Senator Oliver, debate adjourned.  
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Celine Hervieux-Payette :
Honourable senators, Canada is a magnificent country and a strong federation. 
These were complex questions involving options that were not clear. 
Their ramifications were difficult, if not impossible, to assess. 
Separation must not occur in a state of confusion and outside legal parameters. 
Honourable senators, the federation called Canada works. 
Some areas come under federal jurisdiction, while others fall under the provinces' authority. 
Therefore, when we coordinate our energies, we work hand in hand with our partners. 
The infrastructure program is a fine example of this. 
Thus, the federation is all the more effective and national unity stronger.  
Does Quebec benefit from this flexible partnership? 
Yes, and it enjoys an enviable degree of autonomy. 
Bill C-20 applies the Supreme Court's opinion. 
The two cannot be separated. 
It will assess the nature of the question.  
From a democratic point of view, Quebecers are protected by this bill.  
Therefore, the basic rules must be very clear. 
The bill sets out clear indicators. 
The question will be up to the National Assembly alone. 
I return the question to the honourable senator. 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Honourable senators, I will ask my question as a legal expert. 
Can the honourable senator read clause 1.(1) of the bill? 
Clause 1.(1) reads as follows: 
...the House of Commons shall...consider the question and...set out its determination...  
This legislation covers questions such as these, in Quebec. 
The answer is yes. 
Under what principle of Canada federalism can this be done?  
I was not there in 1867. 
They did not think about including provisions on secession. 
Honourable senators, I have another question.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, is leave granted to continue?  
Therefore the House of Commons considers that the question does not exist. 
What must the federalists in Quebec do then?  
I know that it is always distressing. 
I canvassed, as did a number of my colleagues. 
If I recall rightly, the official opposition had criticized the question. 
No one knew what agreement they were talking about. 
I agree with the honourable senator. 
Let us transpose Bill C-20 to 1995. 
The question is hypothetical. 
The honourable senator acknowledged the obscurity of the question. 
It will be up to the House of Commons to decide on a question. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, Senator Hervieux-Payette is a good legal expert. 
My remarks concern the opinion of the Supreme Court. 
I imagine you have all read it carefully. 
My question concerns the problem at page 2 of the bill.  
It is only in paragraph 101 that the Supreme Court uses the expression "elected representatives." 
In this paragraph, the court addresses the problem of the negotiations. 
The negotiations are the responsibility of elected representatives. 
Can the honourable senator explain this?  
Our institution will certainly give its opinion on the question. 
It is our duty to protect the future of this institution. 
There are two Houses in this Parliament. 
It is a bicameral system. 
The issue remains the nature and the clarity of the question. 
However, I am open to any suggestion from honourable senators.  
I should like to ask a question on our bicameral system. 
Why vote in favour of our exclusion from the provisions of a bill? 
However, this is not a constitutional matter, it is a legislative matter. 
In our legislative system, both chambers are equal.  
Both Houses are therefore equal. 
We are told it was because of the time factor. 
We can reach a decision just as quickly. 
I think that no government has ever been defeated in the Senate. 
The suspensive veto of the Senate applies only to a constitutional amendment.  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, I commend Senator Hervieux-Payette for her patience. 
Would the honourable senator take a question from me?  
Some of them are stars.  
Yes, some are falling stars.  
I do not like to be described as one. 
If I had chosen to be one, I would not be here.  
I do not have the answer the honourable senator is trying to get from me. 
I thank the honourable senator. 
These are political questions, not legal questions. 
I now move to my second question. 
I wonder if the honourable senator could tell me where this right has come from. 
Perhaps I did not make myself clear enough. 
The honourable senator said the court confirmed it. 
She did not say they created it, but that they confirmed that right.  
I think we go far beyond that. 
We do not have such a clause.  
We will play by the rule of democracy. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I come from Quebec, as does Senator Lynch-Staunton. 
For me, it is a very easy task. 
Honourable senators, as I stand here today, I am a democratic person. 
It is tough to be a federalist in Quebec. 
That is their choice. 
That is why I am here. 
That is our job.  
That is our job, says Senator Austin. 
Our job is to ignore the wishes of the elected representatives?  
No, it is to hear the wishes of Canadians.  
And which would have no impact on Canada?  
We must recognize the facts.  
That is all we have to know.  
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Honourable Senator Hervieux-Payette. 
We all took part in this very painful exercise. 
I cannot rewrite history. 
This bill is an insurance policy. 
It is a bill that defines the frame of reference. 
It is an exercise in which all Canadians would lose.  
On motion of Senator Atkins, debate adjourned.  
Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
Strictly speaking, that is the entire scope of this omnibus bill.  
There are some who see Bill C-23 as an attack on marriage. 
This has been the case, however, in the past. 
Bill C-23 is also in response to a number of court rulings. 
In 1998, two decisions overturned this preliminary interpretation of the Charter. 
The Court of Appeal of Ontario handed down a similar ruling. 
This principle must now be put into practice. 
To attack them could only lead to social unrest.  
At the time, she stated as follows: 
It does not affect marriage.  
Nothing could be clearer than that.  
This is, if I may say so, an extremely narrow-minded view of marriage. 
By passing Bill C-23, Parliament will resolutely prove its modernity.  
Let us move now from marriage and the family to the field of law. 
Nevertheless, Bill C-23 can help alleviate some of these difficulties.  
The law must reflect today's reality.  
Above all, Bill C-23 is a matter of simple justice. 
They live just like a family does.  
You say it is completely different. 
It is not fair to those in dependency relationships.  
Honourable senators, one does not live with someone just to be dependent either. 
These are two completely different issues. 
I am prepared to pass on your requests to the government. 
At this stage, this addition would add confusion to the bill.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
What exactly is the social policy objective of this bill? 
I think there is a slight difference. 
There is no dependency or financial relationship. 
If some honourable senators have better arguments, they could answer your question.  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
I think it should form part of the record here today. 
The court has said that it will take a similar approach. 
This is a very important question. 
That is very unusual. 
It is a question with which the committee must deal.  
I have two questions to ask of the Honourable Senator Pepin. 
First, what is a conjugal relationship as defined in this particular bill? 
Second, how will the existence of a conjugal relationship be determined?  
It is not based on sex. 
Sex is one element. 
However, it is not an exclusive element of a conjugal relationship. 
It is the right of people in a couple to choose. 
There is a fundamental element in what Senator Pepin has said. 
That is essentially what the court has said. 
A mother and nephew, for example, are not in a common-law situation. 
That is a totally different issue. 
Honourable senators, I rise on a point of order.  
Honourable senators, if Senator Joyal is asking a question, I should like to respond. 
I welcome what the honourable senator has said. 
I want to ensure that we will have an opportunity to debate his remarks.  
Senator Pepin has just said that she is not answering questions. 
Thus, I welcome the comments of Senator Joyal. 
However, we need an opportunity to debate his points.  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
It is in order to make a comment or to ask a question. 
I submit that we are getting close to the time limit of a comment. 
I also submit that we should do everything we can to encourage debate. 
On motion of Senator Robertson, debate adjourned.  
Heritage Lighthouses Protection Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
Honourable senators, this matter is, perhaps, a little less controversial. 
I want particularly to express appreciation to Deborah Palumbo.  
This is neither a partisan nor a money issue. 
Try to envision Peggy's Cove without a lighthouse. 
They have served as the centres for many coastal communities.  
Lighthouse portraits are among the most popular of wall hangings. 
Today, there are over 500 lighthouses left in Canada. 
Another 101 have partial protection and recognition as heritage sites. 
The rest exist in no man's land at this time.  
What does heritage protection status mean in real terms? 
Clause 3 of the bill states: 
The bill defines "heritage lighthouse" as: 
It defines "alter" as: 
"Board" means the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada.  
The minister responsible for this act shall be the Minister of Heritage.  
Most important, honourable senators, clause 6 (1) states: 
For the purpose of safety, clause 6(2) reads: 
Finally, clause 9(1) states: 
In conclusion, honourable senators, these are not partisan issues. 
There is a legislative void to guide the work of our tireless public servants. 
This is simply not right.  
I am talking about real lighthouses. 
It is for this purpose that I seek your support.  
On motion of Senator Hays, for Senator Callbeck, debate adjourned.  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
In the committee report of December 1988, there was this recommendation: 
Therefore, we would support that course of action.  
On motion of Senator Hays, debate adjourned.  
Changing Mandate of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Report of Foreign Affairs Committee on Study- Debate Adjourned 
He made a great contribution to this report on the new NATO.  
We were not anti- or pro-NATO. 
The Foreign Affairs Committee of the Senate was very independent.  
For the record, the project was an exhausting one; it really was. 
I must say, however, that shape of the study changed as it went along. 
It was a very strange experience. 
Article 5 is the guts of the treaty. 
That is what the committee studied. 
What does NATO do? 
NATO, itself, in fact, has been wondering what it does. 
That is the term that is used.  
What was the legal basis for the Kosovo intervention? 
Then we talk about the new NATO - the moving target, as I describe it. 
Naturally, when we were in Brussels, we went to NATO. 
The Soviet Union does not exist any longer, so just what does the organization do? 
This, of course, is a question that a lot of people are asking.  
Honourable senators, in our report, we made 16 recommendations, all of them extremely good.  
We questioned the legal basis for these interventions. 
We would like to know more about the definition of "human security." 
Let me remind all honourable senators that this is a unanimous report. 
Both parties in the Senate supported this report unanimously. 
We think that would be an important reform of the system. 
These are good recommendations. 
They are very important recommendations.  
We discussed the European Strategic Defence Identity in our report. 
Furthermore, where does it leave Canada? 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, the speaking time for the Honourable Senator Stollery has expired. 
Is he asking for leave to continue?  
May I have leave to continue, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Where does this leave us, honourable senators? 
We are all proud of our work and of the result of our work. 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, would Senator Stollery permit a brief question?  
I remember the event because I was there. 
It caused a controversy. 
It was not in our mandate. 
The information in our report is based on the evidence we collected. 
I cannot comment about the missile defence system. 
It may well be part of the evolving NATO. 
We understand perfectly well that the executive in our parliamentary system makes decisions. 
We have been very careful not to impede the power of executive decision. 
We discuss this issue in the report and did a thorough job on that subject. 
We heard from an excellent legal advisor.  
Chapter VIII of the report is entitled "Parliament and Canada's External Security Commitments." 
For example, from where did the money come to pay for Kosovo? 
It has been said that this is not being done very effectively. 
We have allotted an entire chapter to this subject.  
It has been the opposite in other countries. 
Even in 1939, Prime Minister King spoke to the House of Commons. 
In Canada, there has been a lessening of parliamentary consultation. 
We are not saying that. 
I think that answers Senator Hays' question.  
It was for this purpose that NATO came into existence. 
This situation is thus likely to alter the nature of our armed forces. 
We must be clear and selective. 
The resulting European defence initiative is a healthy and legitimate movement. 
It is not the first time, honourable senators, that I raise this issue here. 
In a nutshell, this is where Canada's constitutional law is at in this regard.  
Parliamentary practice in this respect varies a lot. 
We have addressed security issues here. 
On motion of Senator Andreychuk, debate adjourned.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
I do not think it is quite six o'clock, Your Honour. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
It is agreed, honourable senators?  
Motion to Instruct Committee to Amend- Point of Order-Speaker's Ruling 
Motion of the Honourable Senator Lynch-Staunton, seconded by the Honourable Senator Kinsella: 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
I want to thank all senators who spoke on the point of order. 
Motions of instruction are relatively infrequent in Canadian parliamentary practice. 
Motions of instruction respecting bills are permissive rather than mandatory.  
The motion of instruction of Senator Lynch-Staunton seeks to do none of these things. 
As I read it, the current motion does not meet this standard. 
The language is not clear or specific enough. 
Again, all the authorities are clear on this. 
Beauchesne states, at paragraph 684 on page 204, that: 
Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission 
On Motion No. 56: 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
I should be happy to give further clarification if requested.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Leave having been given to revert to Government Notices of Motions: 
The Senate adjourned until Wednesday, May 3, 2000, at 1:30 p.m.
