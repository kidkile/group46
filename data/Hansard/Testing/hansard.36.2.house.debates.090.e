The House met at 10 a.m. 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Louis Plamondon (Bas-Richelieu-Nicolet-Becancour, BQ):
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
Mr. Speaker, if the House gives its consent, I move: 
Norman Doyle for Andre Harvey.  
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions to present this morning. 
The first petition deals with the issue of child pornography.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Canadian Alliance):
The truck traffic is horrendous.  
The proposal to build a road on the south shore of the river is unsatisfactory. 
Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
RIGHTS OF THE UNBORN 
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions to present this morning on behalf of my constituents. 
Hundreds of people have signed these petitions concerning the sanctity of marriage.  
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, the second petition concerns child pornography. 
The government seems to be protecting the pedophiles as opposed to the children.  
Mr. John O'Reilly (Haliburton-Victoria-Brock, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise to present four petitions in the House. 
Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Canadian Alliance):
Shall all questions stand?  
REQUEST FOR EMERGENCY DEBATE 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Time is of the essence. 
It is something that we can only debate now. 
The Parliament of Canada should be seized with this subject as soon as possible. 
I beseech the Chair to see the wisdom of this request.  
CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY ACT 
Is the House ready for the question?  
The question is on the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
And the bells having rung: 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Then we will deal with the matter after the debate has been concluded.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
The bill has to do with offences committed in Canada. 
There is also the part concerning the Crimes Against Humanity Fund. 
The bill contains a number of consequential amendments to many federal acts. 
The Extradition Act is also greatly modified. 
These are amendments to the Citizenship Act. 
The Bloc Quebecois hopes for speedy ratification. 
It will help ensure justice, peace and international security.  
This is an important bill for the entire international community.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Canadian Alliance):
Let me turn to the history and evolution of this initiative. 
There is a lot of momentum worldwide for such an undertaking. 
The ICC will be located in The Hague, Netherlands. 
An assembly of states parties will ratify these rules of procedure and evidence.  
The remaining costs will be shared equally by all states parties. 
I would like to raise some concerns and questions regarding this new court. 
Bill C-19 is Canada's version of that legislation. 
We trust this is correct.  
Again we have assurances this cannot happen.  
There are two ways we can approach these concerns. 
Some conclude that individual tribunals would be superior to a permanent existing ICC. 
A tribunal would examine a specific case, render a verdict and then disband. 
On that front the ICC is attractive.  
Bill C-19 requires a lot of study and review. 
Is the House ready for the question?  
The question is on the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
And the bells having rung: 
BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 2000 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):
These leaders confirmed through statistical evidence what Canadians instinctively already knew. 
What does that really mean? 
However, the data is clear and unequivocal. 
Other countries are now much closer to the U.S. and have overtaken Canada. 
I say that it is a failing in the report. 
Canada, however, did not enjoy that same level of growth.  
The accumulated deficits created a federal debt of over $575 billion. 
The Liberal response to this crisis is very weak.  
We know that interest rates are starting to rise.  
Investors take small comfort from the tepid measures found in the federal budget. 
In fact, by 1997 Canada had become a net exporter of foreign direct investment.  
It is a poor way to try to get ourselves out of this problem.  
As Jim Frank from the Conference Board of Canada said: 
Depreciating our currency will not serve us well....At 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
We have much criticism to level at it.  
The government has no control over at least part of this money.  
Employers and employees are, therefore, paying too much in the way of contributions.  
This is a disgrace. 
We were expecting a thorough reform of employment insurance. 
This is robbery, because the federal government does not put a cent into it anymore. 
The employers and the employees pay.  
He has wrecked the employment insurance plan. 
He let the ship drift. 
This man's ambition is to become the leader of a country. 
For social housing, $54 million has been earmarked. 
The minister was boasting, saying ``I care about the poor''. 
It is hypocritical to present things like that. 
It is to maintain housing that has already been built. 
That is the difference. 
There is also quite a difference between $1.7 billion and $54 million.  
Because taxpayers are being robbed. 
And what has been the result? 
If this is not thumbing their nose at people, what is it?  
This is really laughable. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Most pharmaceutical costs are covered privately. 
The federal government is not addressing the biotech industry. 
However the cost of these health care miracles is immense. 
These types of things have to be considered.  
Clearly the budget missed the point on that.  
Productivity is the currency of the economic environment. 
The brain drain is a damning barometer of the performance of the government. 
That is happening under the stewardship, or lack thereof, of the government.  
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Canadian Alliance):
With a balanced budget the surtax should have been eliminated. 
After all, its only reason for being was to address the deficit. 
HRD should have been dramatically reduced in funding instead of being rewarded. 
It is a disgrace.  
Let us break our budgetary process into very simple terms. 
We all know how conservative the minister becomes when he projects his revenues. 
The minister should be absolutely ashamed of his actions. 
The rest is used to perpetuate the Liberal legacy of spend, spend, spend. 
And we wonder why we are $576 billion in debt. 
And we wonder why we are facing a brain drain.  
Last year they said there was no such thing. 
They appear to have finally clued in.  
Speaking of being clued in, where was the government prior to the budget? 
In the budget there was very little for health care. 
A national plan seems to be seriously lacking.  
Canadians owe very little to the Liberal government for our present economic outlook. 
The deficit was conquered solely on the backs of Canadian taxpayers.  
In both cases the government has put more money to the problems.  
Unfortunately, the government has no other solutions to the problems of the country. 
Canadians expect much more. 
The government has gotten very old and very tired.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
This is the mark that I would give to the Liberals.  
We noticed a second thing about this budget. 
It is unacceptable that the government has not budged on EI. 
It is no longer insurance when six people out of ten do not qualify. 
And there are all sorts of reasons why they do not.  
The government knows perfectly well what is needed to correct the situation. 
The project is being re-evaluated. 
Now they say there would probably be something for the regions as well.  
The person will pay a huge $14 less in taxes in 2004.  
Here again there is very little for people with low incomes. 
That is what we see.  
The government should have given us a social budget, and not- 
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Canadian Alliance):
I want to read this for their benefit.  
Why are the citizens of Ontario blessed with such an incredible economy? 
Let me give an example. 
Translated, that means tax cuts.  
Contrast that with the Liberal government. 
The Liberals simply do not get it. 
Consumer spending would increase. 
In order to balance our budget we do not really have to grow the economy. 
We will let Ontario do that for us, or in spite of us. 
That is what they have done.  
That formula is simply this. 
Higher taxes equal a sluggish economy. 
We could almost get excited about it. 
The solicitor general is going to love this one. 
Does that sound like a caring, generous government? 
I do not think so. 
All the time the government has blown its spending budget. 
Every year since 1993 it has spent more than what it said it would. 
Canadians are waiting for it and they have not received it. 
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Canadian Alliance):
As a whole, they reveal two things about this Liberal government. 
He who has the money makes the rules.  
When did a qualification like that ever slow down a tax collector? 
That would require imagination and political will and we do not see that. 
We should not expect any action on this very soon. 
We will have to continue to pay it.  
That is not a very big amount when we break it down over four years. 
That is a big point. 
There are bursary and scholarship programs out there already. 
The government gives with one hand and rips it back with another. 
It is cost prohibitive because of the tax law. 
They are good citizens.  
Our dollar is worth less than 67 cents today.  
Welcome to the 1990s. 
These ideas have been kicked around for the last 10 or 12 years. 
The Canadian people will leave them behind.  
Unfortunately they are not. 
People should look at their pay stubs and judge for themselves. 
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance):
We just had a budget introduced in Ontario that gives significant tax relief. 
We thought maybe Joe Clark did not consider himself to be a Conservative. 
We have been saying that for quite some time.  
This is second only to social assistance in the amount of $1.097 million. 
The report makes statements like: 
Actual education costs are not known to the Department.  
I note the use of the plural of audit. 
In section 4.65 he says: 
It is getting to be a major issue. 
The Department has no updated analyses.  
What can I say? 
That 15 year old information is still being used to base spending. 
What can we say about that? 
Why should Canadian taxpayers be happy about statistics like those? 
The latest auditor general's report uncovers a human tragedy. 
They are not moving from high school into jobs.  
This includes people from the first nations and immigrants. 
It is a disaster for the human beings involved in this kind of program. 
Does debt repayment amount to anything? 
That is the way of the future.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The question is on the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
PROCEEDS OF CRIME (MONEY LAUNDERING) ACT 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I declare Motion No. 2, as amended, carried.  
(Motion No.2, as amended, agreed to) 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The next question is on the amendment to Motion No. 3. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I declare the amendment carried.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The next question is on Motion No. 3 as amended. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I declare Motion No. 3, as amended, carried.  
(Motion No. 3, as amended, agreed to) 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I will now put the motions in Group No. 3 to the House.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ) moved: 
That Bill C-22, in Clause 71, be amended 
( a ) by replacing line 32 on page 37 with the following: 
(1) The Director shall, on or before Septem-'' 
( b ) by adding after line 40 on page 37 the following: 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.) moved: 
That Bill C-22, in Clause 71, be amended 
( a ) by replacing line 32 on page 37 with the following: 
(1) The Director shall, on or before Septem-'' 
( b ) by adding after line 40 on page 37 the following: 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ) moved: 
Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.) moved: 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.) moved: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The amendment is receivable.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Yes, I think that is an entirely understandable error. 
We are now debating Group No. 3. 
It includes Motions Nos. 8 to 11 inclusive. 
That Motion No. 9, in paragraph 
( b ), be amended by replacing the word ``Parliament'' with the following: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The amendments moved by the hon. member are in order.  
Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):
I want to say first that I support the bill. 
It is a global phenomenon. 
I would ask them to consider the following points.  
However that certainly is not a criticism of the minister.  
That is not a very radical idea. 
This process already exists in the Bank Act. 
In short, I would call it a guard against statutory rust-out. 
It is a Ziebart provision, if I can call it that.  
These impediments do not only have implications for our jobs as lawmakers or legislators. 
Important questions about the true nature of democracy arise. 
In recent times these obligations have become misplaced. 
By having the sunset clause we will bring that back to this place. 
I am simply saying that these amendments are not revolutionary. 
The way it stands, that is not the case. 
For the department to resist such an amendment is not the correct thing to do. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The parliamentary secretary has already spoken to this group, I believe. 
The proposed amendment would not therefore provide any additional safeguards. 
For this reason, I do not support the proposed amendments.  
This is appropriate given the importance of this legislation.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Canadian Alliance):
I continue to feel a sense of distress over this bill. 
I am very concerned about that.  
I will speak to Group No. 3 specifically. 
I take him to be a very serious and competent gentleman. 
Unfortunately that did not happen. 
This would have to be included in the motion which we will have to defeat. 
This is terribly confusing.  
Under normal circumstances our party would be in favour of a sunset clause.  
Those are the comments of the official opposition. 
The confectionery is getting concerned.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The question is on Motion No. 8, as amended.  
Madam Speaker, could I verify something with the Chair? 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion as amended?  
(Motion No. 8, as amended, agreed to) 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I declare Motion No. 8, as amended, carried.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I declare the amendment lost.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I declare Motion No. 9 lost.  
(Motion No. 9 negatived) 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I declare Motion No. 10 lost.  
(Motion No. 10 negatived) 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I declare the amendment lost.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I declare Motion No. 11 lost.  
(Motion No. 11 negatived) 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The question is on Motion No. 1. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I declare the motion lost.  
(Motion No. 1 negatived) 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order, which is one of clarification. 
It seems to me that the request for a recorded division was made yesterday. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Does the House give unanimous consent to proceed in such a fashion?  
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I would like to thank members for their co-operation and their indulgence. 
The amendments will certainly add value to the bill.  
We know that money laundering will not go away. 
Flexibility will be the key word in developing the guidelines and regulations. 
The money launderers of this world are constantly changing their modus operandi. 
They are constantly moving into new areas of activity. 
Therefore, we need to have some flexibility within the regulations and guidelines.  
As an example, there will need to be some clear rules around the professions. 
That would create an unnecessary burden. 
In the normal conduct of professional activities that would not be required. 
This will be spelled out in the regulations.  
With this law we will do the same.  
The bill specifically calls for respecting solicitor-client privilege. 
Let us waste no time in passing this legislation. 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Unfortunately, this was just before our two week recess. 
We could give others.  
It is a third victory for the Bloc Quebecois.  
These three victories are quite impressive. 
It deserves the support of all members of the House.  
Canada meets its obligations in this regard.  
On the whole, this is a good bill. 
The regulative jurisdiction is one of the main problems of this bill. 
This is why the regulatory power is very broad.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Canadian Alliance):
The bill is a highly sophisticated response to a highly sophisticated problem.  
Those activities were detailed in the study by this law enforcement organization. 
It is not only organized crime. 
I can give an example. 
That is the parliamentary process.  
We listened to different professional agencies. 
That is their right and their privilege to come before us in committee.  
I drew that to the attention of the parliamentary secretary.  
In good faith I went to that committee session. 
My colleague from Charlesbourg went to that meeting. 
We both basically said that we needed more time. 
Therefore we did not take part in the clause by clause study. 
We were left out of any discussions of that type. 
It was only logical. 
It gave the government an opportunity to get a breather.  
It has been the height of folly. 
That motion actually had some merit. 
The member included a phrase that unfortunately was unworkable. 
This just happened within the last hour.  
I just despair for this process.  
I will want to complete my speech following question period. 
This is where the Senate does come in. 
God bless their souls over there. 
They do have the ability to take a look at this legislation. 
Hopefully they will not go through as badly flawed a process.  
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Also in attendance were publisher Kim McArthur and Sheryl McKean of the Canadian Booksellers Association. 
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Canadian Alliance):
Over the past few months the health of the Lake Dauphin fishery has been questioned. 
Fishing practices and conservation are the issues.  
What does the word sustenance mean when quoting these rights? 
What are the acceptable methods of carrying out sustenance activities?  
Mr. Marcel Proulx (Hull-Aylmer, Lib.):
The hon. member for St. Paul's.  
Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
Mr. Applebaum's accomplishments are legendary. 
The hon. member for Yorkton-Melville.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
In addition, he provided advice on administrative aspects of the company.  
I congratulate Mr. Beelen and thank him for his devotion. 
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
There are solutions to stopping this wildlife carnage in the national parks. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):
The Liberal member for Wentworth-Burlington has his own take on it. 
PREVENTION OF MENTAL ILLNESS 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP):
The money is there. 
BRADLEY GASKIN MARSHALL CRITICAL CARE FUND 
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
This represents $1 for every day BGM has been in business in Cambridge.  
Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the opposition parties are total cowards.  
This week, now that he is back, there is barely a squeak out of them.  
The Bloc Quebecois feigned concern for Canada's reputation. 
What a fine example of courage.  
What does this show? 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
FRENCH LANGUAGE EDUCATION IN MANITOBA 
Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):
I want to know what the hon. member is saying.  
That is what I thought. 
We will hear from the hon. member tomorrow.  
The hon. member for Halifax West.  
RESERVE FORCE UNIFORM DAY 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
On May 21 the Royal Canadian Naval Association meets in Cornwallis. 
Many of these individuals made donations for these memorial windows. 
When will the minister return these windows to their rightful place?  
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
They said no such thing. 
He said ``We did not perform any review or analysis of that action plan''.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let us go through this again. 
We drafted a strategy. 
We contracted with Deloitte & Touche and asked them for their advice. 
We implemented their recommendation. 
We provided it to the auditor general. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
The minister says that she in fact implemented those plans. 
That is not true. 
There were no substantive changes between February 2- 
I am sure that members could use other terms. 
I would prefer that we would stay away from that kind of statement for today.  
Her claims were not backed up by fact. 
Deloitte & Touche never even saw the final report. 
She knows that there was no substantive difference.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
No, Mr. Speaker, we would like to move on to the future.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
What did we do? 
Deloitte & Touche recommended that we strengthen our information systems. 
We implemented the recommendations.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, the first recommendation was that the minister resign.  
That was in their February 2 report. 
Why is she telling people that she has taken action?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I am sure we could use others.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
There are certain regulations that must be followed and they are being followed. 
There is excellent co-operation.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
I imagine it is the minister who has the hot potato in his hands.  
Perhaps these people are also friends of the Liberal Party.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
What this government and every government does is let the RCMP do its job. 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, as I just said, there is full co-operation. 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
Ms. Charest would probably still be hosting benefit dinners for the Liberal Party of Canada.  
Who does the government want to protect? 
More friends of the Liberal Party?  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, these gratuitous accusations are completely unjustified. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. 
Bill 11 is now in its final form in Alberta. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we will uphold and enforce the Canada Health Act. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Could he be clear about that? 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
All should take note of our commitment in this regard.  
PUBLIC WORKS AND GOVERNMENT SERVICES 
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Work on the justice building is going as planned. 
Work is going according to schedule.  
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Instead, it will sit empty until the summer of 2001.  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, again, the work is on time. 
Maybe he would understand.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is incorrect. 
The recommendations of Deloitte & Touche were incorporated.  
Does she think differently now? 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Canadian Alliance):
Deloitte & Touche were obviously disapproving of the first draft. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I received no recommendations from that party.  
Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert, BQ):
This situation is unacceptable.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert, BQ):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Canadian Alliance):
Why are you minister? 
Why are you minister if you are not doing anything? 
You don't have any responsibility.  
The hon. member for Wanuskewin.  
Today mysteriously it does. 
There are five words strangely added. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I thought maybe if they read it on the website they would.  
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I have read it very carefully side by side. 
It does not clearly assign to specific individuals the actions they are responsible for. 
It does not establish timelines, deliverables and milestones. 
They are not in the final six point plan. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is wrong. 
We incorporated the recommendations.  
They want to cut a billion dollars from people with disabilities. 
They do not want to help them get jobs. 
The hon. leader of the Bloc Quebecois.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
What interest does the Minister of National Revenue have in frustrating the investigation?  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Minister of National Revenue is certainly not frustrating the investigation. 
That is totally false.  
This is what we decided as a parliament, as an institution. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary leader tells us that the act will certainly be changed.  
When we ask questions to the Minister of National Revenue, he cannot talk.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
I do not want to make accusations.  
The law is the law, and we intend to comply with it.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
That was the basis of the report that he gave us last fall. 
We believe that there will be real competition as a result of this bill. 
He will be able to hold Air Canada to account. 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Canadian Alliance):
It is interesting, Mr. Speaker. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
What about those other airlines? 
I do not think they want that.  
Mr. Gerard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):
In 1997, only 17% of its pilots were francophone.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
I invite my colleague to read the bill. 
Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, Lib.):
Quite frankly, rural Canadians themselves are telling us what their priorities are. 
The report indicates how we are responding. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):
Instead of paying his fair share, what is the health minister is doing? 
He is musing about adding more things which were never covered. 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
We have invested more. 
We have made commitments for the medium term. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):
I ask my question again. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Why does the candidate Stockwell Day advocate user fees?  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  
What is the Prime Minister's position? 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
We have both indicated concerns. 
It has not even asked us to be a part of this yet. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
That is all that is going on. 
In fact the technology has not yet been perfected.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
In fact the file is moving.  
As I have said on numerous occasions, it is a priority for acquisition. 
We have a timeframe for replacement of the Sea King helicopters in 2005. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
I am certain the minister can see that incident summary in his sleep. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
They are not saying that it is at that point now. 
Mr. Rick Limoges (Windsor-St. 
Mr. Speaker, today, May 4, is World Asthma Day. 
Today also marks the 100th anniversary of the Canadian Lung Association.  
Thousands more are being treated for bronchitis, asthma and other breathing problems. 
This coming summer will be no exception.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is correct. 
We are approaching the subject on two fronts. 
These negotiations will continue until October. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
It was able to create only 33 of the 36. 
No invoices, no jobs created, and $1 million gone.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
From our point of view that is a good investment. 
I would remind the hon. member again that the Government of Quebec supported this undertaking.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
My question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. 
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
I will certainly look into this matter and get back to the hon. member.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the minister keeps missing the point. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
That is why we need to replace them quite obviously. 
The safety of our personnel is of utmost importance. 
Meanwhile we are not standing still on the replacement of the Sea King. 
The file is moving and we are moving toward its replacement.  
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Co-operation.  
Hon. Maria Minna (Minister for International Cooperation, Lib.):
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):
I do have a question for the hon. House leader. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
On Monday we shall consider Bill C-11, the Devco legislation.  
Starting on Tuesday we shall return to the listed bills.  
PROCEEDS OF CRIME (MONEY LAUNDERING) ACT 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member for Kootenay-Columbia has 22 minutes left in debate.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Canadian Alliance):
Madam Speaker, as you said I am resuming debate. 
Let us now turn to the bill itself. 
This is a quote from that report: 
First, this activity is a criminal activity. 
This is from an RCMP security intelligence report.  
The act establishes a financial transactions and reports analysis centre to receive the reports. 
Concerns have been raised, as I have mentioned. 
With that in mind I listened to all the testimony very closely. 
Again, we have taken a look at that. 
I am sorry, but I do not see that as being a problem. 
It was really very unfortunate. 
It was just a tad thick.  
I suggested that it would be a hole big enough to drive a truck through. 
That is not a false threat at all. 
That is not hyperbole. 
I maintain a concern because I do not know. 
There are things that we can join hands on. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Tax evasion is not addressed in the proposed legislation.  
The recommendation of the New Democratic Party is to support the legislation in principle. 
We think that a number of concerns should be examined and addressed further. 
There is a potential for charter violations. 
A second point is the possible pressure on consumers. 
There remains a series of concerns about the planned reporting effectiveness. 
Obviously, strict guidelines must be established in this area. 
In addition, the issue of tax-related offences could be addressed. 
Many other key dispositions would be determined after that fact by regulation. 
Those are the points I wish to make. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Like most business activities, organized crime has become very much a global enterprise. 
It is a huge issue. 
The estimates of money laundering are even difficult to get a handle on. 
There is a huge variance and disparity on this one issue. 
That indicates the degree to which we are really only beginning to understand it.  
That being the case, it is very important to separate the powers of these agencies. 
The nebulous nature of the description of suspicious transactions is also disturbing. 
The issue of resources is very important. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I declare the motion carried.  
(Motion agreed to, bill read the third time and passed) 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I believe it would take less than five minutes, which seems to be the indication. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
(The sitting of the House was suspended at 3.48 p.m.) 
(The House resumed at 3.52 p.m.) 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I think you will find consent in the House for the following motion:
``Rimouski-Neigette-et-La Mitis''; and 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
INCOME TAX AMENDMENTS ACT, 1999 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):
Any objective review of the facts will bear that assertion out. 
I think it is absolutely the case. 
This is an obvious truth; it is self-evident in a sense. 
It is getting larger. 
Sadly, apparently the government is deaf to that message. 
It does not seem to understand. 
The government cannot seem to figure that out.  
We must beat down burdensome regulations that have outlived their usefulness. 
However, it refuses to act for reasons that I cannot understand.  
One of the biggest impediments falls under the umbrella of tax policy. 
We have high marginal tax rates. 
Their reward is to pay higher taxes. 
The result is that many of these people get frustrated. 
That phenomenon is called the brain drain. 
We will find out that brain drain is a real problem. 
As legislators, we are crazy if we do not do something about that.  
It is public policy that is standing in the way. 
This is not because we have some natural disadvantage in Canada. 
On the contrary, we have all the natural resources in the world at our fingertips. 
We have an educated public. 
We have great human resources. 
Unfortunately, we have a situation where public policy is standing in our way. 
The only people who can change it are the people in this place.  
That is a shame. 
Governments should not punish the people they purport to serve. 
I would argue that this government, through neglect, is doing exactly that.  
Is it because Ireland has so many more resources than Canada? 
That is exactly what has happened to Canada.  
What does that mean? 
The Alberta government brought down a very unique tax proposal. 
The Alberta government understands that.  
How do they do that? 
We eschew that system. 
We do not agree with it. 
However, how does it do that? 
How come it is not going bankrupt?  
How does it fund all those things? 
It is able to do that because its economy is much more productive. 
The output of the average American is much higher than that of the average Canadian. 
Is it because they are smarter? 
Do they work harder? 
That is something our government cannot get through its head.  
If it goes somewhere else it will benefit someone else. 
It is time we learned that lesson. 
How do we turn this ship around?  
It is a single rate tax proposal. 
It has three elements. 
All of a sudden the incentive to continue to work harder is gone.  
It has allowed that to happen. 
The Prime Minister is the one who sticks his head in the sand.  
``A low dollar is good'', he says. 
However, a low dollar is a reflection of the strength of the economy. 
Canadians, individually, are poorer for it.  
I will conclude by moving an amendment. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I heard the comments of the member for Medicine Hat. 
The party opposite uses the expression ``marginal tax rates''. 
What are marginal tax rates? 
The way the member opposite was speaking we would think it was doom and gloom. 
There have been 18 straight quarters of growth in the country. 
We are leading the G-7 and the OECD countries. 
I could go on and on about the good news. 
Let me give a comparison. 
I do not know how we are going to divide this. 
You are asking a question, I believe. 
Mr. Speaker, I was building up to a question. 
It is the wrong system.  
I think my friend across the way should pay attention to that fact. 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):
I have heard it.  
Eliminating bracket creep is not a tax cut. 
That is not a tax cut.  
It is a social program by any reasonable definition.  
That is simply not the case.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):
We simply have to ask Canadians if they see more money in their pockets. 
It is a simple question. 
Where are these tax cuts? 
I do not know where these tax cuts are. 
Canadians do not see them.  
I would like to address two areas. 
I can tell the House that is not happening. 
What is happening is that Canadians are calling their members of parliament. 
I received a call this morning which concerns me. 
A constituent of mine is having problems with Revenue Canada. 
My constituent phoned the agent who seized an aircraft from U.S. Customs. 
What did this bureaucrat tell my constituent? 
He said ``You went to your member of parliament. 
You complained to the minister. 
Is that how we deal with Canadians?  
No, it is not happening. 
This is becoming a trend which is quite disturbing.  
Where is this tax relief?  
A constituent came into my office. 
This disability claim is disallowed''.  
I do not know.  
The government says that it is compassionate and is giving a tax credit. 
Do members know what is killing them? 
That is the problem.  
It just goes ahead and assesses without giving due notice. 
People are already facing problems and having difficulty paying in the first place. 
These are not people who are trying to cheat. 
He says this proudly. 
As a matter of fact he said it today.  
I refer to book entitled ``Africa Trade Strategy 2000''. 
That is fine and I accept it. 
We are proud of what is going on. 
However, I have a question to ask of him. 
Why has there been no trade mission to Africa? 
The problem is that it is for Canadian companies. 
We have a serious problem henceforth with calling for EDC's privatization. 
I can name a couple of them, Bombardier and SNC-Lavalin. 
These are the companies that are taking advantage of it. 
The Canadian economy is growing. 
There are companies all over the country that would like to do international trade. 
We need to expand to get them to take advantage of international trade.  
Lowering taxes is the peak criterion. 
Companies from Ireland came to Newfoundland and asked people to work for them. 
What does that tell us? 
If Newfoundlanders can find work in Ireland, great.  
Today its companies are coming to Canada looking for workers.  
Our government refuses to do that. 
That is good for Canada. 
International trade provides jobs. 
They cannot expand because people are leaving the country. 
They do not have the workforce and taxes are very high.  
As I was saying, it is critically important that we have a sound fiscal policy. 
We are touted as the best country in the world. 
We have started to lose ground to them rapidly. 
We do not have to be rocket scientists to know what all this means. 
If we fail to do that it will not happen.  
If we are not going to go, they are going to come here. 
It is a question of priorities. 
It is the largest province and it is doing well. 
In my home province there is also a great sense of optimism. 
Those two provinces are optimistic. 
The question we might ask is why. 
The answer is simple. 
The federal government is refusing to recognize the results. 
It is refusing to recognize the evidence that is out there. 
There is evidence of those provinces reducing taxes. 
The European Union started reducing taxes. 
Nothing will stop them. 
They will be going down to Mexico.  
At this time I would like to move an amendment to the amendment.  
That the amendment be amended by adding the words ``by the Official Opposition''.  
The amendment is in order. 
It would add those words after the words ``solution 17''.  
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I applaud the Ontario government for following the lead of the federal government. 
Mr. Speaker, I am glad the hon. member raised this question. 
It is critically important that we say what is right. 
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Canadian Alliance):
Madam Speaker, I enjoyed my colleague's comments immensely.  
There are a couple of things he alluded to in his speech. 
One of them was constituents' complaints. 
I wonder if he would like to outline a little bit more on that.  
To whom do we go? 
I try to work out things for my constituents. 
Would the hon. member care to comment?  
Why can the government and Revenue Canada not just settle these problems? 
One goes in one direction and one goes in another direction. 
One will accept it and one will not accept it. 
Where can people go? 
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Canadian Alliance):
Madam Speaker, my colleague was talking earlier about international trade.  
We will be competing with China over the next several decades. 
My impression is that Canada is just about at the opposite end. 
The government is trying to penalize industry. 
It is not making progressive taxation or legislation that works for industry. 
The question is will this century become the century of missed opportunities for Canada? 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):
I was talking to a lady at a trade fair a couple of weeks ago. 
We have these trade fairs out west. 
I stood all day and listened to people about their concerns. 
This one lady said she always watched CPAC. 
I asked her if she had any other problems. 
She was a very delightful lady.  
However, this bill is one which is now over a year old. 
I think people should know that. 
It is really quite ridiculous.  
Furthermore, this bill also covers two ministries. 
We have been calling for that for six years. 
We are now going to keep it there''. 
It is a skill I wish I could use here. 
We would be able to communicate so much better.  
The point I am making is a very important one. 
Now it says it will increase the rates no further. 
Now it claims the level is flat. 
Let us hope the government keeps it that way.  
There is the elimination of an individual surtax. 
We promoted and proposed that both the 3% and the 5% surtaxes be eliminated.  
I guess we should give them credit when credit is due. 
An income splitting tax is included in this legislation. 
It is rather interesting. 
Those earnings are added to the income of the parent claiming an exemption. 
They introduced a tax on passive income. 
It is a tax increase no matter which way we slice it.  
One could argue that it is only fair. 
The bill addresses a number of other issues. 
One I found particularly interesting was the one on communal organizations. 
There are a number of such organizations. 
They are very successful farmers but do not own the land as individuals. 
Instead they all live on it. 
All the young people are taught to work. 
If they all owned little pieces of land they could all claim their basic exemptions. 
The costs are paid by the commune. 
That is also a form of commune. 
They always have a reduced exemption.  
We have been quite consistent in this regard. 
Both parents should enjoy the same basic exemption. 
There should not be a differential. 
Our solution 17 does the same thing. 
There are a number of other issues in the bill. 
They are talking about taxable income as a result of interest from these trusts.  
I would like to say a few things in general about taxes. 
It is a non-repeatable experiment.  
That is the case with some economic assumptions. 
We often hear from the government in its budgetary policy that it is creating jobs. 
Canadian families are taxed to death. 
I thought of something last week during the Easter recess. 
I noticed that my garage roof was leaking. 
He would have a job for a day. 
We know how much mismanagement and mishandling there has been of government funds. 
The boondoggle has become quite a large issue in the country.  
The fact of the matter is that I have had this idea for many years. 
That is what we are doing. 
I do not know what the number is. 
Even if they were, I would still like to have a tax regime that works. 
Strictly speaking, we have not yet passed the orders into law. 
I think that is regrettable.  
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The hon. member talked about the flat tax. 
I do not have the information on solution 17. 
Under solution 17 will there be various deductions and tax credits? 
He could not have asked a better question.  
It is an equalization of the tax burden.  
The basic exemptions are increased dramatically. 
We are going to give a percentage tax cut indeed to the average Canadian taxpayer. 
However the people who benefit the most are the families. 
Every tax dollar that they have paid they now will no longer have to pay. 
That is $26,000 they earn before they pay a single penny of tax. 
It is not a flat tax per se. 
It is a single rate tax. 
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Canadian Alliance):
Madam Speaker, again it depends very much on the individual situation. 
I am speaking as a mathematician. 
We propose to take a constant percentage. 
Those people who make $20,000 would pay zero. 
They got into a higher bracket. 
That will never happen with our system because it is a linear system.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):
Could my colleague comment on that?  
Madam Speaker, I am no different from other members of parliament. 
Yes, I think that is deplorable. 
It is really wrong for an individual to avoid the tax system. 
Until that happens, people should really comply.  
At any rate the problem is huge. 
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Canadian Alliance):
It is interesting to look across the way. 
It is almost a state of denial. 
It is the United States that we always look to''. 
We have interprovincial trade barriers, for example. 
We have talked about it. 
What about our debt? 
Back in those days we had a very tiny debt. 
The reason our dollar is down on its knees is the huge burden. 
Canadians would like the government to address that. 
It is as if it is a crime in this country to make a buck. 
That is about where this government has been going.  
Canadians are on their knees. 
This country needs to get its tax burden across the board under control. 
All levels of government have to do that.  
We have seen other countries that we have to compete with. 
These are the economies we as Canadians have to deal with.  
I am running out of time, so I will wind up. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I have to interrupt the hon. member at this time. 
OFFICE OF THE CORRECTIONAL INVESTIGATOR 
Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert, BQ) moved: 
In my opinion, this is a very important part of the act.  
The commissioner reports to the minister, in this case, the Solicitor General of Canada.  
I should be noted that the reasons for complaints are many. 
Clearly, the decision-making power of the correctional investigator is quite limited. 
Furthermore, the appointment process does not guarantee total independence or neutrality. 
In other words, the minister is his boss.  
This report may include recommendations regarding the changes in legislation that are deemed desirable.  
For these reasons, this change in the appointment process of the correctional investigator is desirable.  
I want to stress that this motion is absolutely non-partisan. 
No, that is not why we were elected. 
I know that I am not alone in this regard. 
If it is not the case- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member but her time is up.  
There are only two sentences left.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House?  
Together, we should succeed in changing this practice that leads us nowhere.  
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
It is in that new act that the Office of the Correctional Investigator was established.  
And besides, there is another important element, of course. 
Therefore today's motion is totally redundant.  
We are living in times of tremendous change. 
Is our justice system working? 
Is it indeed protecting our most vulnerable citizens? 
Our government was well prepared to deal with those difficulties. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):
The way the justice system works in Canada is very seriously flawed. 
The Minister of Justice simply wrings her hands and says ``I cannot do anything''. 
The member is really bypassing the minister with her motion.  
Consequently, the minister can sit on it and forget about it. 
There is never a requirement to actually act on any of the recommendations. 
I can understand the member's frustration.  
We have lost our autonomy. 
If they were, there would be no choice but to adopt those recommendations. 
I think that would be unwise.  
As I see it, that is the most serious flaw in the motion.  
They work at that institution and they express their concerns to me. 
I commend the hon. member for bringing this motion forward. 
I certainly sympathize with her frustration with the system. 
We do need to look at the way this reporting should be done. 
Perhaps that would have been a better way to accomplish the goals she is seeking.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
She has the floor.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The time provided for the consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
(The House adjourned at 6.05 p.m.)
