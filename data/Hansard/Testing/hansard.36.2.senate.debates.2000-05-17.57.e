The Senate met at 1:30 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Prince Edward Island-Effect of Proposed Cuts 
Hon. Catherine S. Callbeck :
If this proposal goes through, many small regions across the country will be hit hard. 
I am strongly opposed to this proposal. 
Council of Atlantic Premiers 
Moncton, New Brunswick-Signing of Organizational Memorandum of Understanding 
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson :
The purpose of the council is to promote Atlantic Canadian interests on national issues. 
We look forward to the continued work of this important alliance.  
Prime Minister's Visit to Middle East and Persian Gulf 
Hon. Pierre De Bane :
It has also expressed its immense satisfaction.  
Honourable Senator Pierre De Bane, 
Please accept Senator, the continued assurance of my highest consideration.  
He is the dean of the Arab diplomats, heads of missions, posted in Ottawa.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators, that this letter be tabled?  
New Brunswick-Effect of Proposed Cuts 
Hon. Erminie J. Cohen :
The CBC produces the only made-in-New Brunswick news show. 
We must prevent the CBC from eliminating our regional news shows.  
International Joint Commission Report on Red River Flood 
Their flesh contained increased levels of toxaphene. 
That was the task force recommendation. 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
They are stretched to the limit. 
Hon. Leonce Mercier , Chairman of the Committee of Selection, presented the following report: 
Wednesday, May 17, 2000 
The Committee of Selection has the honour to present its 
Special Senate Committee on Bill C-20 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
Energy, the Environment and Natural Resources 
Notice of Motion to Authorize Committeeto Meet During Sitting of Senate 
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Thursday, May 18, 2000, I will move: 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I cannot give an exact time frame for any potential action. 
What is going on is a serious matter. 
It was a secret between me and the department.  
This is truly Kafkaesque! 
And this is happening in Canada!  
Furthermore, they circulate all that information to other departments. 
There are 25,000 employees in that department. 
That number has been reduced to something in the order of six.  
However, we must be ever vigilant. 
I am not doubting the intentions of the officials. 
I would like to read you the quote that goes with this business: 
This leads me to ask you a second question. 
Where will that lead us? 
Soon, everything will be on the Internet. 
I shall relay his concern to my colleagues in cabinet.  
It is a challenge to find the appropriate balance. 
There is an increasing necessity to manage the system. 
How to accommodate one with the other is a challenge for government. 
It is something which did not exist 20 years ago. 
However, there is also the issue of privacy to be considered. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I can make those inquiries for the honourable senator.  
New Brunswick-Effect of Proposed Cuts 
Hon. Erminie J. Cohen :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Other parts of the country face that possibility as well. 
Effect of Proposed Cuts-Possibility of Increased Government Funding 
I have a question by way of supplementary, honourable senators. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I think it may be a matter of philosophy. 
It certainly enjoyed, and continues to enjoy, national support. 
I do not think it is simply a question of money.  
Presence of President at Liberal Caucus Meeting 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I do not know.  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I can only assume that no request was made. 
I may be wrong, but that seems to be the case. 
Shipbuilding-Development of National Policy 
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson :
It is an urgent priority for the country. 
It is a very sophisticated business. 
There are many spin-off, high-tech industries related to shipbuilding. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, there are no easy answers to this question. 
Shipbuilding-Involvement of Minister in Development of National Policy 
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson :
We really need more distinct answers.  
When will that be?  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
What about Canada Steamship Lines?  
Delayed Answers to Oral Questions 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
(Response to question raised by Hon. Noel A. Kinsella on May 2, 2000) 
Similar arrangements apply for American military aircraft flying over Canadian airspace.  
Agriculture and Agri-Food 
However, this in no way compares with the level of arrears in the 1980s. 
For some, even higher prices may not help. 
This does not mean that they are bad farmers. 
Is it impossible for farmers to make a profit? 
Shouldn't the FCC take this into account?  
What is the government doing on the subsidy issue internationally?  
(Response to question raised by Hon. Roch Bolduc on May 4, 2000) 
Between 1994 and 1996 review times were cut by 50 per cent. 
This action delays the access of the Canadian public to new and promising drugs.  
This bill was dealt with, including amendments, in a very timely and efficient manner.  
Hon. W. David Angus :
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
He has exhausted his right to speak.  
Are you ready for the question, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.  
Second Reading-Debate Suspended 
Perhaps she will speak a bit later.  
This debate has been, as several have remarked, a most edifying one. 
There are various reasons for this, but they are not particularly relevant to this discussion. 
That is not so any more.  
The situation today is that Quebec has no allies among the provinces of Canada. 
Quebec has historically been seen as the foyer of French Canada. 
Think about the House of Commons for a minute. 
I think I am quoting him just about word for word.  
We have 133 years of history to prove it. 
The whole country will unravel.  
In a brief to the House of Commons legislative committee, he said: 
It is yesterday's solution!  
Instead, he comes to offer his support for what is essentially a policy of confrontation.  
We should think about it. 
Mr. Manning supports this bill. 
Shall we go with the flow?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is the honourable senator requesting leave to continue?  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
I thank honourable senators.  
This climate of triumphalism is in the country, in Parliament and in the media.  
Will we go with the flow? 
The authors of this bill think they have Quebec cornered. 
They may find they have cornered themselves and cornered the country. 
That is what we are telling them with this bill. 
This thing is sometimes described as Mr. Chretien's legacy. 
That has been our history. 
I think we all know that. 
That is one history.  
Pearson, Trudeau and Mulroney. 
Prime Minister Pearson had practised cooperative federalism. 
We could add other initiatives that were taken. 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Honourable senators, would Senator Murray entertain a question?  
Before I ask my question, I shall make a comment.  
That remains to be seen.  
Today, however, we find an extraordinary circumstance. 
Some say that perhaps the devolution has gone too far. 
That was done in this chamber and the other chamber jointly. 
Let us put that on the record.  
Second, I appreciate what my friend has to say about the Tremblay commission. 
I understand how and why that argument is made. 
I believe their bargaining position has weakened considerably. 
I am not necessarily complaining about that. 
The federal government and federal Parliament has a role in that respect.  
Those are the two subjects that need to be addressed. 
If they are not addressed, we will have a serious problem.  
Post-secondary education is an interesting example. 
The present government brought in the millennium scholarship fund. 
Hon. John G. Bryden :
Honourable senators, I have a question for Senator Murray.  
Senator Murray used the word "triumphalism." 
I am unfamiliar with that terminology. 
Honourable senators, my short answer is that I do not know. 
I could speculate, I suppose. 
Another journalist describes the situation as, "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn."  
I think these people are misled. 
"If there is a referendum, it will be on our terms."  
I think there is a kind of fools' paradise, frankly. 
Victory at last, clarity at last - no, no.  
They do not take leadership roles. 
They are not in the business of formulating opinion. 
That would be one issue. 
For people to suggest otherwise is really very foolish, in my view.  
I will make one last comment. 
This bill is a further attempt. 
Who is to say that it may be somewhat more successful than the others?  
We disagree on that point. 
We have seen that. 
We have now thrown Plan A overboard. 
Hon. Jean-Robert Gauthier :
I should like to ask a question of Senator Murray.  
I think we are talking about two solitudes, mainly. 
Do we have that much confidence in the present composition of the House of Commons? 
I wish to ask a very simple question. 
I object to the division or possible breakup of my country. 
We might, to use Mr. Trudeau's classic phrase, provide the effective counterweight. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I wonder if I could ask for leave to make a proposal.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) Bill 
Hon. James F. Kelleher :
Moreover, the government has not made clear exactly what its new centre will cost. 
Quite frankly, this is unacceptable. 
This leads me to our next concern.  
We do know that the new centre will be monitoring our transactions. 
What we do not know is who will be monitoring the monitor. 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Orders of the Senate simply should not be overcome that easily. 
Why only on this particular question? 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I thank the Honourable Senator Cools for her comments. 
I recognize that she is raising an important point.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I suppose every rule could be changed.  
Leave was granted for the suspension of the order. 
I heard honourable senators say yes, that leave was granted; therefore, I had no alternative.  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Are there other honourable senators who wish to speak to Bill C-22?  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
We criticize committees for wanting to sit during our sitting hours. 
Honourable senators, we should be consistent. 
There must be a limit. 
Honourable senators, I think I had better speak to this matter. 
The way to prevent that from happening is not to grant leave. 
In other words, we can say no when leave is requested.  
Or you could decide not to ask for it.  
I do not think I should say more than that.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
If no other honourable senator wishes to speak, I will proceed with the question.  
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, the item for which leave was granted has now been completed.  
The Senate adjourned until Thursday, May 18, 2000, at 1:30 p.m.
