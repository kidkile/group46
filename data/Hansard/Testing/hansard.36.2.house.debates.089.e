EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 89 
Wednesday, May 3, 2000 
The House met at 2 p.m. 
Members sang the national anthem ] 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Northumberland, Lib.):
He will be sadly missed but always fondly remembered.  
Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay-Boundary-Okanagan, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Mr. Cook was also a veteran serving Canada in World War II.  
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
These men and women are essential to the vitality of these illustrious Canadian units. 
They have served and continue to serve their country with distinction.  
And the Canadian Rangers ensure an essential military presence in our remote northern regions.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Fredericton, Lib.):
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Canadian Alliance):
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
May 3 marks the 209th anniversary of Poland's constitution. 
SALON DU LIVRE DE TROIS-RIVIERES 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
The hon. member for London-Fanshawe.  
RESERVE FORCE UNIFORM DAY 
Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Fanshawe, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, today is Reserve Force Uniform Day. 
Our reservists come from virtually every segment of Canadian society. 
Reservists have played a vital role in the defence of Canada. 
Please join with me in saluting Canada's outstanding citizen soldiers.  
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Canadian Alliance):
Bob Homme created the Friendly Giant in 1953 for American radio. 
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
WORLD PRESS FREEDOM DAY 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
The freedom of the press is an essential rampart against abuse of all kinds. 
WORLD PRESS FREEDOM DAY 
Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):
One of the hallmarks of a civilized society is the encouragement of public debate. 
We owe them a great debt.  
JEAN-NOEL GROLEAU FARM 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
This farm is at the top when it comes to protecting the environment. 
I also want to mention the success of La Framboisiere de l'Estrie. 
Again, congratulations to the farm operated by Mrs. Beaulieu and Mr. Groleau.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it turns out that the hon. member is at least a day late. 
We should not mention whether a member was here or is here.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Yesterday in committee, and I quote, Deloitte & Touche stated: 
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, this minister knows she created those extraordinary circumstances. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, quite the opposite. 
We implemented those plans. 
We have added aspects of training and we have added aspects focusing on accountability. 
We have a plan that will work. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, here is what happened. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let me try again.  
Very slowly, as my colleague suggests. 
We put together a plan. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Canadian Alliance):
She has never ever said that. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
The minister says that the mistakes made were honest ones. 
It would be easy and we might then understand. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member makes reference to mistakes. 
I would like to clarify something from yesterday.  
Was that a mistake?  
Jane is in trouble.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I, for one, can admit that I made a mistake.  
She should be aware of that too. 
Is it because there are none?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is talking about a particular access to information request. 
Let us be clear about access to information. 
I make no decisions on the information that is conveyed to requesters. 
The hon. member knows that. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Could she tell us whether she has the infamous invoices? 
I think we are getting close to words that are unparliamentary.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
What can be conveyed will be conveyed.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
That seems clear to me.  
This is being discussed everywhere. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
That is confirmed and are appropriate under the terms and conditions of the program.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. 
I want to give the Prime Minister a chance to exceed expectations. 
Could the Prime Minister stand in his place and name the five principles of medicare?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
The hon. leader of the New Democratic Party.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
PUBLIC WORKS AND GOVERNMENT SERVICES 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Since the election the company has evaporated. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
That is a pretty good return.  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Before he stands up he should look at himself in the mirror.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):
That was simply not the case, and the minister knew it. 
She repeated the same thing yesterday.  
I ask you to be very judicious in your choice of words.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
What did we do? 
We actually put together a grants and contributions team, a team focused on this. 
What did they say we should do? 
The hon. member for Medicine Hat.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):
Why did the minister try to hide that fact from Canadians?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
I believe that Bill C-26 does give those guarantees.  
However, the hon. member is a member of the Standing Committee on Transport. 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
Is he prepared to support such amendments?  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
This government will make sure it does not.  
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Canadian Alliance):
It said ``The leadership, responsibility and accountability needs to be identified''. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
First and foremost, it was an internal audit that identified the problems.  
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Canadian Alliance):
I think this should frighten taxpayers. 
If she cannot convince Deloitte & Touche, how can she- 
The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The department, at the most senior levels, has engaged in this process. 
Senior executives know exactly what their role and responsibility is. 
The hon. member for Portneuf.  
COUNCIL ON CANADIAN UNITY 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, programs are audited every year. 
These audits go back to 1988, when Lucien Bouchard was the minister. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Will these issues be covered by the minister's investigation?  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):
The health minister just does not get it. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member and his party are obviously afraid of discussing new ideas. 
That is a pity. 
I guess there are some ideas over there. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):
The hon. Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
Hon. Claudette Bradshaw (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Trade is vital for Canada.  
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Canadian Alliance):
The hon. member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley.  
Mr. Richard M. Harris:
Here is the formula: lower taxes equal a buoyant economy. 
Mike Harris got it and Ralph Klein got it. 
The question is, why can this Liberal finance minister not get it?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will tell the party opposite the formula. 
Follow the federal government and introduce indexation of the tax system. 
Follow the federal government and eliminate the deficit.  
Do not follow the Reform Party. 
Do not introduce a flat tax. 
The hon. member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley.  
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, let us be really clear. 
Why is the finance minister so afraid of lowering taxes for Canadians?  
I think we had better quit while we are ahead.  
The Right Hon. Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
It took them four years to do that. 
We have balanced the books for four years. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
The foreign affairs minister says the missile system is dangerous. 
Will he say no?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Indeed, the Government of the United States has not taken a position on the matter.  
The missile system has not been perfected yet in terms of the technology. 
Further tests are coming.  
After that is done the United States will make a decision. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, it seems that the military generals are taking a position.  
Why then does the government still try to suggest that DU is safe? 
What does the minister have to say about this?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
PUBLIC WORKS AND GOVERNMENT SERVICES 
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will say this very slowly so the hon. member can understand. 
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
I do not recall.  
And if not, why not?  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his question.  
Canada condemns in the strongest possible terms the violence that is occurring in Sierra Leone. 
We call on the rebel leaders there to comply with the Lome accord.  
We earnestly hope they will do so. 
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Canadian Alliance):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Secretary of State for Amateur Sport.  
Hon. Denis Coderre (Secretary of State (Amateur Sport), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for her question.  
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
I know we will honour that. 
We believe it is very important.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Hon. Maria Minna (Minister for International Cooperation, Lib.):
At this point, I have no plans to resume consultations with the Government of Vietnam.

VOYAGE OF LEIF ERICSSON 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have the honour today to present two petitions. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36 I would like to present three petitions. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions. 
CANADIAN CHARTER OF RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS

Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Canadian Alliance):

Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
They would like to know the ingredients used in the food products through mandatory labelling. 
I am pleased to table a petition on their behalf.  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mr. Speaker, we will be answering Question No. 94 today. 
Question No. 94- Mr. Ted White: 
(b) Status of challenge before the European Court of Human Rights: 
A decision is expected soon.  
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all other questions stand.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I therefore ask the hon. member to withdraw his motion.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The motion is transferred for debate pursuant to Standing Order 97(1).  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
PROCEEDS OF CRIME (MONEY LAUNDERING) ACT 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The motions will be grouped for debate as follows.  
Motions Nos. 2 to 7. 
The Chair will inform the House of the details with each vote.  
I will now put Motion No. 1 to the House.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ) moved: 
Most people agree with the objective of this bill. 
I want to explain what Motion No. 1 is all about. 
We know that the banks make profits in the billions. 
In my view, this would be a big improvement to the bill.  
People say ``Another obligation for the banks. 
They will pass on the bill to us. 
Our fees will go up again. 
This is crazy, we are already paying plenty''. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I would like to speak very briefly about the process. 
Members know the way standing committees work. 
It met and there was a work plan established. 
I would like to turn to Motion No. 1 by the Bloc. 
In principle we can understand why the hon. member might propose motion. 
Basically the proposition is that financial institutions will be required to report suspicious transactions. 
I do not think the compliance costs will be that significant. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Canadian Alliance):
I find the process to be completely unacceptable. 
It is a bill that is vital. 
I believe it is in Never-Never Land. 
Of course they will.  
To try to regulate something that is totally unregulatable is pie in the sky. 
Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert, BQ):
He does not paint a glowing picture of Canada. 
The fight against this international scourge must begin at home first. 
For this reason, the Bloc Quebecois supports this bill.  
There are in Canada measures against money laundering. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
These investigations are extremely lengthy and few lead to prosecution.  
These measures are clearly inadequate and do not seem to be effective enough. 
Mr. Speaker, I believe we do not have a quorum.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Saskatoon-Humboldt has called for a quorum count. 
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We now have a quorum.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
I also want to congratulate my colleague, the member for Charlesbourg. 
He worked very hard during consideration of this bill. 
I am very proud to have worked with him.  
The main purpose of the amendment is obvious. 
It is something that is happening at an alarming rate in Canada.  
That is the number one problem facing this government and this country. 
This bill moves in that direction.  
The U.S. has expressed concern repeatedly about the situation.  
Firearms were then smuggled back into other countries. 
The soft approach on crime is highlighted by these inadequacies. 
Much of that has been earmarked to fight organized crime.  
Once again, a pittance. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The recorded division on the proposed motion stands deferred.  
I will ask to speak in order to introduce them.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ) moved: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(Motion No. 5 withdrawn) 
The purpose of Motions Nos. 2, 3 and 4 is very simple. 
This is the reason why I proposed these motions. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(Motions Nos. 6 and 7 withdrawn) 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Therefore the amended motion would read as follows: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The debate is on the amendment.  
Mr. Speaker, could I now proceed to Motion No. 3?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The amended motion would read: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The debate is on the amendment. 
The hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Normally in a speech an amendment is moved just once. 
There were several amendments created during the speech. 
I would like to know what the protocol is.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
This is what is being considered by the clerks.  
What is before the House now are the amendments. 
For an amendment to be in order it must amend a motion. 
Therefore, the amendments as presented by the parliamentary secretary are not in order. 
It must be done by the parties.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
I can only deplore it. 
These are amendments to my motions with which I can live. 
I wonder if we could go the unanimous consent route.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That is a good way to do it.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, the process that we are currently involved in is egregiously flawed. 
That the debate be now adjourned.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members have risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House divided on the motion, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the motion lost.  
Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I move: 
That Motion No. 3 be amended by deleting the following words: 
``, on grounds that the officer believes to be reasonable,'' 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The amendments are in order.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to take part in this debate. 
We saw a member on the government side try to amend an amendment. 
This shows there is no plan. 
The Conservative Party supports the broad principles.  
International money capital markets annually are very much affected. 
We need to do this right away.  
The bill is one of which our party is supportive. 
The amendments as well are supported by our party. 
We know that guns and other contraband material are coming across our undefended borders.  
We do not have impenetrable borders, and that will never happen. 
All the indicators are there. 
All the signs are speaking out to Canada to do something about it. 
The government is letting down the side. 
It has not lived up to the billing. 
It has not responded to requests from the RCMP. 
It is not listening, and we know it is not listening.  
We knew that long before he went to the Middle East. 
What we want to hear is that the government is listening. 
Canadians want to hear that the government is actually listening to them. 
The indicators are there. 
The ears are closed. 
The message is going out but they are not listening.  
When that happens, maybe that message will start to penetrate those ears. 
We hear about things like this happening in the country. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
OATH OF ALLEGIANCE TO THE FLAG OF CANADA ACT 
I have been working on this bill for a very long time. 
The 19th century gave us nationhood. 
The 20th century gave us our flag. 
In the 21st century, Canada should have an oath of allegiance.  
Some people have asked me why an oath of allegiance is important. 
We have a national anthem. 
Why would we need anything more? 
The answer is simple. 
As you well know, Madam Speaker, our flag is very highly respected around the world. 
An oath would reaffirm our commitment to these values.  
Others have asked why we should pledge allegiance to a piece of cloth. 
It represents not only our values but also our common history and our traditions. 
It represents two official languages working together. 
It represents democracy and freedom. 
Many Canadians think that an oath of allegiance is a wonderful idea. 
The letters, e-mails and phone calls of support continue to arrive.  
I agree with Mr. Peate. 
I am not proposing a mandatory oath. 
Forcing patriotism tends to lead to dangerous consequences. 
Young Canadians have also shown a strong interest in this legislation. 
Leanne Rutledge of Iron Bridge, Ontario suggested: 
Jocelyn Smid, a student from Cochrane, Alberta wrote the following: 
I pledge allegiance to the flag of Canada and its people. 
I will try to keep our country free, peaceful and beautiful. 
I will obey the laws of the land and will protect our environment. 
What better way to ensure the oath's relevance.  
The swearing of an oath is done solemnly and respectfully. 
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Canadian Alliance):
I will begin by saying that I do support the bill. 
National symbols are very important. 
Our national flag is respected around the world. 
Our exercise of patriotism in my opinion has certainly declined over the years. 
Yes, we in the House are the model for this country. 
Today we are talking about an oath of allegiance to our flag. 
That is why I support the bill.  
At this time the criminal code does not protect our flag. 
Many have other oaths of allegiance, such as the oath of citizenship. 
Oaths are not pious statements of goodwill. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Recognizing and respecting a national flag is one thing. 
Making it the object of patriotic devotion is another. 
Patriotism is love for one's country and devotion to it. 
Patriotism is not about taking an oath. 
I work for it in a totally legitimate, legal and respectful way.  
When it comes right down to it, what purpose would this oath of allegiance serve? 
When would it be used? 
Who would be authorized or encouraged to take it? 
France is a good example. 
The Americans, for their part, have chosen to have such an oath. 
That is their choice and it goes along with their mentality.  
Although we share some values, there are others that set us apart.  
A flag is the symbol of a nation's values. 
What are these values? 
This bill is not appearing in isolation at this point. 
The totalitarian regimes of the 20th century could not do better.  
The bill of the member for Guelph-Wellington is cut from the same cloth. 
This freedom can never be denied us by law. 
The Bloc Quebecois opposes this bill.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
We must ask ourselves why this is the case.  
At first glance we immediately point the finger at our educational system. 
Our education system must certainly bear some of the responsibility. 
However I think the problem goes much further than that.  
For whatever reason, we Canadians do not believe in beating our own drum. 
And yet, we do have a number of heroes in Canada. 
I believe the federal government is to be blamed for such ignorance. 
Our Canadian flag is a symbol of a strong and compassionate society. 
We are missing that and it should be brought back.  
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to stand in reply to my bill. 
He said that symbols are important. 
There are two large Canadian flags right beside the Speaker's chair. 
I think it is important to point that out. 
Unfortunately, members of the Bloc are against this bill. 
I am not surprised, but I am sorry that is the way they feel. 
I want to remind the hon. member that Quebec is a province of Canada. 
Quebecers certainly are proud Canadians.  
He asked what we would do with such an oath. 
He talked about the significance of the flag for patriotism. 
Our flag is recognized all over the world. 
We are looked at as a kind and gentle society, peaceful and caring. 
These are all things that the Conservative member recognizes. 
He also said that we should work together to bring patriotism back.  
He thought that would be a good thing. 
This federal Liberal government decided that it would not be a good thing. 
We ordered all those Canadians flags to be put back up on those federal buildings.  
I implore the House to adopt the bill. 
It will show our love for Canada.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hour provided for the consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP):
We may never be repaid.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Our share was by far a minority share.  
Could that be it? 
I do know what the local paper said about it. 
The families of those former fishermen are just as important as the families of miners. 
They do not deserve to have their representative trying to jeopardize their employment''. 
Their representative was successful in that attempt because that company is closed.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
The minister said that his own advisory board on this issue has made worthwhile recommendations. 
Which recommendations does he see as worthwhile? 
Which ones will he implement and in what timeframe?  
Why only 7%, and what specifically is being done to meet this target?  
How can they possibly integrate when they stick out like a sore thumb?'' 
How does the government seriously expect to foster diversity with an attitude like that?  
What is the minister's position on fast tracking qualified individuals?  
I recognize the changes that occur only at the top tend to be short-lived. 
Superficial treatment of this crisis will breed superficial results. 
So far the pupil does not seem to be doing much better.  
Anything less would be an insult.
