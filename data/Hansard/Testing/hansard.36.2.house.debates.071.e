GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Justice and Human Rights 
EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 71 
Friday, March 24, 2000 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Essentially, we should recognize that it is a good bill. 
The same issue applies to crown corporations. 
There are some very serious issues that ought to be talked about. 
The constitution says that the government is exempt.  
The key word is ``may''. 
It should be ``shall''. 
I will get into that in a bit more detail later.  
I want to talk as well about late payment of taxes. 
The bill also provides for an advisory panel. 
This is a very useful mechanism. 
The advisory panel would give the minister advice on the assessment. 
If the government has leased the building to a third party, who is liable? 
The panel would be comprised of people who understand what this is all about. 
There is an appeal process. 
Or, it may tell the taxing authority that their assessment probably is too high. 
He may amend it, he may change it or he may use it. 
It is entirely up to him.  
Why is it that we are so concerned about these issues? 
Why is it that the minister would want to ignore the advice of the panel? 
He is not obligated. 
It is quite possible for him to do that. 
It could be something else. 
It could be manipulation. 
There is a possibility of playing favourites here. 
There should be no particular advantages to one group vis-a-vis another group. 
The very same set of arguments also applies to the panel. 
We also need to look at a couple of other things. 
The first of these are the rights of the taxpayer. 
What are the rights of the individual taxpayer? 
It goes beyond that. 
There are three crown corporations that are for-profit corporations. 
Simply because they are crown corporations they can be exempt. 
We do not know why.  
There is also a responsibility on the part of the minister for sound management. 
At the moment it is not.  
I now want to move into the area of accountability. 
The minister is accountable to this parliament and he should be held to account. 
We need to have that information.  
We also need transparency. 
What needs to be hidden? 
Nothing needs to be hidden. 
Why should this be some kind of deep secret. 
It should not be. 
The minister is accountable to parliament.  
Finally, there is the business of commitment. 
I will again refer to that specific instance with the contracting procedure at Canada Post. 
The process is not open. 
It is one sided and, in many ways, discriminates against other people.  
I suggest that we must decide to play fairly, equitably and honestly. 
We would then have a fair and equitable treatment of all crown corporations. 
They would then be obligated to pay taxes to the taxing authority.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
It is only fair and right that we should be paying for them. 
These federal payments contribute to the local economies. 
Canadians realize their value and their necessity. 
That is not at issue today.  
Bill C-10 will change the name of the legislation and the program. 
The type of language used is very important. 
This is a very positive and necessary aspect of this newly redefined relationship.  
We believe the local politicians in the municipalities are comfortable with it. 
They have had a satisfactory opportunity to have input. 
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
Memory will tell us that they were all mayors in their hometowns.  
It has been a very one-sided process.  
Along with Bill C-10 some other important policy changes are being made. 
Who could actually believe that? 
The key word is predictable. 
That will benefit all municipal taxpayers. 
That is why our party supports Bill C-10.  
The bill is not without its flaws. 
We complained to the minister's office about this. 
Again the minister listened to those complaints.  
I understand what the intention of the phrase would be. 
It was meant to ensure that only qualified professionals serve on the panel. 
That leaves the panel open for political abuse. 
I am glad the Speaker is not paying attention. 
Members on the other side of the House are not used to compliments. 
In fact it could come to a crashing end within the next number of months. 
This was not a bad attempt. 
However there are two problems with this definition. 
Second, there is no consistent national definition of an appraiser. 
What more could we ask for than a review of the process?  
Its advice would be rejected by the minister without an opportunity for appeal. 
It sounds familiar in this place. 
It did not look like a very fair system.  
We received the same complaints from the municipalities and their organizations. 
That sounds like cabinet across the street. 
The amendment by the member for Tobique-Mactaquac was passed by the committee. 
It proposed that the governor in council or cabinet would appoint panel members.  
It adopted both amendments unanimously.  
It used to be that these crown corporations served purely for public policy purposes. 
Profit was never in their vocabulary. 
Now these corporations serve two purposes. 
The question is how much. 
The discussion is not yet finished on this issue.  
I look forward to seeing this problem resolved in the very near future. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The first speaker when the bill comes back will be the minister.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, PC):
What is the member's view on this point?  
What is good for a private business should be good for government. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The question is on the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
(Motion agreed to, bill read the third time and passed) 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Epilepsy is the most common serious brain disorder in Canada. 
Approximately 300,000 Canadians have epilepsy. 
This disorder does not discriminate. 
People of all ages are affected by epilepsy, especially the elderly.  
Also discouraging are the myths surrounding epilepsy. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the government never learns from its mistakes. 
Liberal actions speak louder than words. 
In this time of declining farm incomes, this industry continues to thrive. 
This monopoly is called the Canadian Wheat Board. 
We do not need another one.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
We have a collective duty to help in the global action. 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
Mr. John Maloney (Erie-Lincoln, Lib.):
Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):
A big part of that is a healthy environment.  
A clean environment and good health is great for Canadians.  
MEMBER FOR VAUDREUIL-SOULANGES 
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
Unfortunately for the hon. member for Vaudreuil-Soulanges, we can only confirm his fears. 
The Bloc Quebecois will indeed take his seat from him in the next election.  
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
Since that time the relations between these two countries have not been the greatest. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
I need your help, I need your prayers-'' 
Elections are usually run on memberships and money. 
I guess Joe Who has now become Joe Boo Hoo.  
Mr. Ivan Grose (Oshawa, Lib.):
I look at my city and say ``Why not?'' 
For a first class city, why not a first class harbour?  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
TAX ON INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS 
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
It seems to me legitimate therefore to control this market.  
Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):
I therefore invite my colleagues to visit the riding of Brome-Missisquoi. 
I am convinced they will have an unforgettable time there.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
Mr. Ganong was an Order of Canada recipient whose accomplishments were numerous. 
NATIONAL CAPITAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
How a nation projects this image is through its national symbol.  
Our flag is the embodiment of our nation's heart and soul.  
To desecrate Canada's flag must be forbidden by law. 
To defile the symbol of our nation must have due consequence.  
The House will soon decide the importance of our flag. 
I ask for all to support his stand.  
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
This is the hidden side of Bill C-20. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member's question has an inaccurate premise. 
The minister did not wait. 
The government is identifying the problems and addressing them. 
The hon. member should give us credit for that.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's premise is totally wrong. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we have always fully supported the auditor general. 
It is the Liberal government that only uses his words when it suits its needs.  
It does not matter how many points there are in the minister's plan. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, again the premise is wrong. 
This is something he in effect is saying.  
Again, the Reform Party should apologize for criticizing- 
The hon. member for Dewdney-Alouette.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
It is the same players and the same programs. 
How can it be expected that there will be anything different this time around?  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Once again, they are only telling part of the story. 
They did not mention what the auditor general also said. 
He said ``Exceptional circumstances demand exceptional actions. 
The action plan proposed is exceptional. 
I believe it is a very thorough plan for corrective action''. 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
The parliamentary secretary talked about facts.  
The minister took no action until she was caught. 
That is a fact. 
That is a fact. 
That is a fact. 
She has not so much as apologized for this billion dollar bungle.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
There is no billion dollar boondoggle. 
A billion dollars is not lost.  
The minister has never stonewalled. 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the auditor general supports the six point plan. 
He insists that we must continue with that plan.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Let me remind the government of one recommendation that the auditor general finds extremely important.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
It should know that it is difficult to acquire private sector- 
I cannot hear the answer.  
Yes, there are limits to the noise in the House. 
Everyone is talking at once. 
It is impossible for the Chair to hear anything at all.  
They should question themselves about the long term effect of their political posturing.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We have not yet seen the regulations. 
We will wait for the final product. 
We will assess it in relation to the Canada Health Act. 
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
That is exactly what we have offered. 
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
In reality he does not recognize the difference between his aspirin and his elbow. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. minister is defending health care in a vigorous and effective way. 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Let us talk about commercial financing then. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
The hon. member for Peace River.  
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Why can the minister not answer this question? 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
The EDC did not write off $1.3 billion last year. 
Its actual loan write-off last year was zero.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. 
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary secretary is trying to cloud the issue. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
The hon. member for Kelowna.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. minister has not addressed the question at all. 
The hon. Minister for International Trade.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau-Mirabel, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Health. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau-Mirabel, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
Her department warned about it last August. 
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, our constituents would like to have some accountability at HRDC.  
The Access to Information Act is clear. 
Departments have 30 days to return requested information. 
Dozens of requests have not been dealt with yet.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is absolutely no clampdown.  
Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):
The one-point rise in the inflation rate since January is evidence of that impact. 
My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We know that the price of petroleum is coming down. 
We are hoping that the price of crude will continue to go down. 
Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, Lib.):
My question is for the Secretary of State for Rural Development. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
As a result the agriculture minister is guilty of financial mismanagement.  
Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
It got 60 crisp, brand new 60 million dollar bills just a short time ago. 
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
It is awful short on details. 
There is no provincial agreement. 
Saskatchewan and Manitoba come up short again as the hardest hit areas.  
Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, they call $3.3 billion nothing. 
Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
What that meant was an ever arching increase in development.  
Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Voluntary action is important. 
It is not the only thing. 
We have to do other things, but it is a critical component.  
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, PC):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, for the NDP even good news is turned into bad news. 
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, PC):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
They are having higher benefits and they are having them for a longer period.  
Ms. Judy Sgro (York West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Trade. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
This is what Canada stands for.  
Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):
When is the member for Brant getting the finance job?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
It has not been written off. 
We are taking every action we can to collect it.  
We have substantially cut down this kind of problem. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. 
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
There is no doubt about it; it is a stinky situation.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
This was done without contacting former program recipients. 
This was done without advertising in local papers. 
This was done without contacting opposition MPs. 
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Middlesex, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
The HMCS Iroquois , Charlottetown , Halifax and Toronto and the ship Preserver participated in the rescue. 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Why does he not answer the questions that are put to him?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Nine months later, I received some documents, but no answer to my question.  
My question is for the Minister of Health. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we provided a full response.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
That should have been today.  
All other members are now required to wait while the member dithers.  
In the Chair's ruling of March 21, 2000, the Speaker said: 
It is obvious that the member did not obtain the required support in time.  
The member had his chance. 
He should now proceed as suggested in the Speaker's ruling. 
It is equally or even more inappropriate to second guess the ruling of the Speaker. 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
I wish to table it. 
Ah, this is an entirely different matter from the one we discussed.

Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
Mrs. Judi Longfield (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Part II of the code defines the duties of both the employees and the employers. 
Workplaces have changed and will continue to change. 
The last amendments to Part II were made in 1985. 
The process was not easy. 
I congratulate the parties for the perseverance they showed throughout the process. 
Their recommendations constitute the vast majority of the contents of this bill.  
I have no doubt that this is the right approach. 
These committees will complement the work of the existing workplace health and safety committees. 
Five features of the bill seem to be particularly important and necessary. 
Fourth, the Liberal government is committed to help establish family friendly workplaces. 
This bill provides additional protection for pregnant and nursing employees. 
These are all important changes. 
They all deserve to be commended and thanked.  
It is time that we gave them a chance.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Unlike parts I and III, this one also covers the federal public service.  
This involves every one of us. 
One worker is injured on the job every nine seconds of work time. 
That gives us an idea of the magnitude of the problem. 
Approximately 18 million days of work were lost this way in 1997. 
It is a serious issue.  
The question really arises of why the number 300 was chosen. 
Is that some kind of arbitrary number? 
What happens if a company has 299 employees? 
Is that a materially different company from one which has 300 employees? 
That is the real question. 
This is what you shall do. 
Another area of concern is the lack of a second stage appeal process. 
I think an appeals process is essential. 
It is my understanding that employer and worker groups have concerns about this particular provision. 
That is part of the problem. 
In some situations stress can lead to violence. 
It is a very real question. 
These are some of the things that ought to be looked at in some detail.  
We have to look at this as well with the firefighters. 
He has to know what kind of fire it is. 
These amendments have been in the works for almost 10 years. 
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
That is completely ridiculous. 
But what can one expect of the federal government, after all?  
Why do I say it was high time for the minister to present her reform? 
Because work-related accident statistics are of great concern. 
I shall come back to this point later.  
Her efforts are praiseworthy and it is our duty to call attention to them.  
The bill is only at second reading. 
Unfortunately, the federal government has let things drift along. 
Let me give you an overview.  
An equal number of deaths was reported in 1995. 
In terms of economic impact, these accidents are very costly. 
One would think that bad luck hounds this age group. 
Yes, as you have no doubt guessed, it is the young.  
These clauses are a major factor in the increase in social inequality.  
In 1993, the number of hours required had risen to 73 hours a week.  
More than ever, in this period of restraint, we have to show great solidarity.  
Let us revert to the matter at hand, Bill C-12. 
Let us start with the local occupational safety and health committees. 
Their mandate was to inspect the workplaces. 
In addition, they will be able to investigate, conduct studies and inspect the workplace. 
Finally, they will evaluate workers' protective equipment.  
Measures will also be taken to prevent violence in the workplace. 
Finally, work space ergonomics programs will be set up.  
What about this government's responsibility as an employer? 
First, they gave grants and now they are giving jobs.  
Such situations are found in eight clauses of the bill.  
This is another conflict of interest that the Bloc Quebecois feels is completely unacceptable.  
Surely she is not serious. 
I must say I find this exemption quite amusing. 
The bill was sponsored by the finance minister himself. 
Why give a very special status to the chairperson and the alternate chairperson? 
These are other political appoinments for the government's friends.  
From now on, these practices must be a thing of the past. 
Otherwise, our party will have to reconsider its position.  
It is not very clear.  
Subsection 154(1) provides that, and I quote: 
Where is the punishment then? 
This certainly is a funny way to enforce the law.  
I would like to come back to the matter of financial penalties. 
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  
Would it not be a constructive approach?  
It is a start, but it is much too timid.  
The same cannot be said of the federal government. 
Section 132 of the federal act is greatly flawed. 
Such discrepancy and two tier system are totally unacceptable.  
What is the federal government waiting for to follow suit?  
Let us talk about those conclusions.  
The federal government is light-years behind Quebec. 
Why should women be the victims of the discriminatory policies of the Liberal government? 
I will leave the minister with that.  
The Minister of Labour can depend on the Bloc Quebecois for these amendments. 
So far, the Bloc has done its homework and it will continue to do so. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
There was no majority vote on these issues. 
That is what makes Bill C-12 so critical.  
Obviously the employees of the federal government fall under the Canada Labour Code. 
Many are crown corporations, et cetera. 
Some fall under the Public Service Staff Relations Act. 
It was through my own background. 
I would not recommend it to anyone, frankly. 
One part per billion in the air was too much. 
That taught me a lesson when I was very young.  
Companies would actually factor that into their cost and into their productivity.  
I do not really have to say anything more in this speech. 
It is so critical.  
Where is the payback? 
It will slow us down and it will cost us money. 
It is a terrible way of doing things.  
I will give the House some figures that will illustrate how wrong-headed that is. 
Let me tell the House some of the economics of workplace safety and health.  
It is a productivity issue. 
I have seen that happen many times.  
It is very complicated now. 
We are dealing with very complicated materials now. 
There are secondary things that go off with the materials we work with. 
We need to know that. 
It is recognized officially by a motion passed in the House of Commons. 
As I said, we think Bill C-12 has a great deal of merits. 
We wish it to go speedily through the House, but not unamended. 
I will go through them briefly.  
We would like to see a two tier appeal system. 
We feel that is like the fox looking after the hen house. 
The second detail we find fault with is the definition of health. 
It may sound like we are nitpicking but frankly it is very important. 
Definitions are contained in the preamble. 
That was arbitrarily changed by the government side and we would like to know why.  
We wholly disagree with that. 
We believe that workplace stress in general can also lead to that condition.  
We want that changed.  
Ontario has recently changed its law in this regard. 
Four conditions must be met for medical examinations in the workplace to be all right. 
First, they must be completely voluntary. 
Second, individual test results must be strictly confidential. 
Third, workers should have the right to choose the examining doctor. 
Fourth, there should be no cost whatsoever to the worker. 
That is what we should be shooting for.  
Twelve would be the minimum.  
There are provinces which already mandate that. 
That is what Justice Richard was talking about. 
That is essentially what we believe we ratified in the motion the other day. 
We would like to see some reference to it in the Canada Labour Code.  
Other than that, we look forward to dealing with the bill at committee stage. 
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, PC):
No bill is ever complete or perfect. 
It looks good, but it is a bit vague and short on details. 
For the layperson, ergonomics is a strange and sophisticated sounding word. 
Perhaps the minister could explain why.  
This commission too is appointed by the minister and serves during pleasure. 
I am not sure this is the way to go either.  
Will one be forthcoming?  
All in all it is not a bad bill. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The question is on the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I declare the motion carried. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House adjourned at 1.52 p.m.)
