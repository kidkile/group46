The House met at 2 p.m. 
Members sang the national anthem ] 
Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard-La Prairie, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Canada's economic upturn is indeed a reality.  
The economic and budgetary choices made by the Liberal government are now bearing fruit. 
Despite the opposition raised, of course, by the opposition, we have done the job. 
There are now some truly concrete results.  
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam, Lib.):
The students in the choir range from 5 to 19 years of age. 
Ms. Donna Otto is the musical director. 
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance):
Grassroots aboriginals will not forget this setback. 
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
MISSISSAUGA SOUTH ESSAY CONTEST 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Thank you, Sandra, for sharing your artistic work with us. 
Canada is indeed full of treasures from sea to sea to sea.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Eric Bishop, an institution in Calgary for decades, passed away last week. 
We all have our own idea of what heaven will be like. 
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Vimy Ridge, April 9, 1917:
UNITED CHURCH OF CANADA 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Among other things, it refused outright to show gratuitous violence. 
That is why action must now be taken.  
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
One in twelve Canadians are directly or indirectly employed in the housing field. 
No other Canadian industry has such a large impact on our economy.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
Strangely, a finance official went along. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Finance referred the problem to the ethics counsellor. 
They have done that and there will be a report by the ethics counsellor.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I do not agree.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
We can see that. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is always the same thing.  
This company was not a company with shares. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Canadian Alliance):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
He should be the last to talk about lessons of ethics today.  
I said that it was a crown corporation. 
The Minister of Finance was a private citizen. 
He was sitting on the board. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Canadian Alliance):
The Right Hon. Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I understand that members opposite love dirt. 
They like to throw dirt. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, this minister has no expertise in health administration. 
They have quite a nerve telling us what to do. 
The question is a very simple one. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
In addition, Quebec qualifies for equalization payments. 
These were $8.6 billion- 
I would ask hon. members to listen to the answer.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
What claim is he making?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the delivery of health care services is a provincial matter. 
But the health care system itself is a national concern.  
The Government of Canada has a role to play in this area. 
We intend to honour our responsibilities.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
That is exactly what we are doing. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
It has been virtually silent. 
If there is a plan, where is it? 
What is the government waiting for?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
Those in the community tend to know each other. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
By George, I smell a rat here, Mr. Speaker. 
Will the minister tell us who the broker is? 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
The hon. member says that he can smell a rat. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):
Let me quote from that memo. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the CDC was a government owned corporation. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):
Right now what we are talking about is the finance minister's own department. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, we have asked a considerable number of questions about Placeteco. 
It can even go so far as to withdraw delegation of authority.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Canadian Alliance):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is absolutely ludicrous what they are doing. 
They want to stir up something based on nothing. 
The report will be made public. 
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has all his facts totally wrong. 
He should do his research and then he would get to the facts.  
They want someone else to be part of the solution.  
Do they really care about aboriginal people? 
Are they really interested in helping them? 
From the questions I hear, I do not think so. 
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is the parochial view of this member and his party. 
They want to make sure that no one else can benefit.  
Is he against that? 
If he is, he should stand and tell us.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Connaught was a subsidiary of a subsidiary of the CDC. 
Also there were joint ventures involved.  
We are all looking forward to his report.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):
I do not care what kind of business it is.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
He obviously did not have a personal conflict of interest.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let us look at what we have done. 
Parents can be home for a year.  
We have taken away the second waiting period required. 
Then perhaps the dad can be home with the child.  
We are doing something about it for all Canadians.  
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Trade.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Beauce for his interest in this issue.  
Canadians can be very proud. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
He will report to the House. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):
The right hon. Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, again they use a word like ``implicate''. 
They try to tarnish reputations, destroy people. 
They get up today and talk about ethics.  
The hon. member for Regina-Qu'Appelle.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, yes, I can assure the hon. member that our financial situation is sound. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the minister did not make any reference to interest rates. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
The protection of a species at risk is a value that all Canadians- 
The hon. member for Fundy Royal may begin his question.  
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
The last budget from the finance minister will encourage that process.  
The bill will be tabled in a short time. 
I think he should wait and actually see what is being proposed.  
BATTLE OF VIMY RIDGE 
Mr. Carmen Provenzano (Sault Ste. Marie, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Canadian Alliance):
Why did the minister not keep his own promise?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
All pertinent documentation will be submitted.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
We took those representations seriously.  
The answers to those questions- 
The hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Minister of Health.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has it wrong. 
What we have here is state of the art equipment. 
The memo that the hon. member notes was sent last fall. 
In fact, a course of action was taken very quickly.  
We do have the best possible equipment. 
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Minister of International Co-operation.  
Hon. Maria Minna (Minister for International Cooperation, Lib.):
Over the last three years we have spent $45 million in the region. 
We will continue to monitor the situation and support it.  
I have to deal with an issue in the House. 
I am directly addressing my colleague, the hon. member for Rimouski-Mitis.  
The hon. member has had a few days to, I hope, reconsider her position. 
This is the 21st century and we are entitled to the truth in this place- 
And Mrs. Tremblay having withdrawn ]

Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre-Rosedale, Lib.):
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House to present the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
One in nine Canadian women will develop breast cancer in their lifetime. 
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to present this petition on behalf of Canadians.  
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering-Ajax-Uxbridge, Lib.):
Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering-Ajax-Uxbridge, Lib.):

Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, Question No. 79 will be answered today. 
Question No. 79- Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien: 
Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Total cost to the department was, therefore, nil.  
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Motion No. P-2 
I therefore would ask the hon. member for Skeena to withdraw his motion.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The motion is transferred for debate.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Surely the government would want to make this correspondence public.  
The hon. member opposite has referred to Motion No. M-34. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It was not permission, it was just a matter of fact.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Therefore, we will just be splitting the time.  
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the co-operation of hon. members. 
It consists of the OECD countries, plus Singapore. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I do not think you heard that.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
No, the Speaker did not hear that and we are not going to revisit it.  
What do we currently have in place in terms of law? 
There are expanded means, including the Internet. 
Where there is a suspicious transaction, it must be reported.  
We will have three types of reporting. 
Second, there will be mandatory reporting of prescribed transactions. 
Those are the guts of the new law. 
The centre must satisfy itself first.  
What does the centre pass on? 
The centre will not be exempt from examination by the privacy commissioner.  
Let us look at why it is important that we pass the bill quickly. 
This was reconfirmed again last year at the Cologne summit.  
We in finance issued a consultation paper in December. 
We have considered wide consultations with all interested parties. 
This is through using this unique concept of the centre. 
The centre will be able to analyze trends in money laundering. 
It will be able to work with international law enforcement agencies. 
I think it will be a great addition to our war against crime.  
We will appreciate the support of all parties. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
It is a substantial problem.  
There are a number of other estimates that reveal the scope of the problem. 
We take these concerns very seriously.  
This is exactly what Bill C-22 does.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):
I would also like to provide some suggestions and amendments.  
They have to do that to continue their illegal operations. 
In Canada alone the ballpark estimate is around $20 billion.  
Even some professionals such as lawyers and accountants help in money laundering. 
Criminals launder money through gambling and cross-border transfers. 
It is a wide open area.  
These activities make our streets unsafe. 
Someone else can sit in the driver's seat. 
A Canadian Alliance government would do that.  
Canadians are fed up and have had enough. 
We do not want Canada to be a haven for money laundering. 
Why has the reporting been voluntary in the first place? 
This does not make sense. 
The Liberal government not only lacks vision but it is also very weak. 
It thinks that the status quo is the only option.  
It has a mentality and culture of only doing a patchwork job. 
The patchwork does not work, particularly when dealing with organized crime. 
The loopholes in the system and the law are not plugged. 
There are so many loopholes and the criminals are exploiting them. 
Due to the illegal activities of some individuals, the legitimate taxpayers suffer. 
The whole nation suffers.  
That is what Canadians are telling us. 
That is the only way to discourage them. 
How about stopping the federal government when it launders the money?  
We all know those figures. 
When we ask a question, the government does not reply.  
No, I do not think so. 
Let us look at some other aspect of the bill. 
We need to see the government's definition for these efforts. 
These definitions are not given in this bill. 
We do not know what they mean. 
They are too vague. 
The bill is too vague in many areas.  
The Liberals have to show us clarity in this bill.  
There is a lack of precision in this bill. 
There are no definitions of many terms, for example, the definition of ``suspicious transaction''. 
What is a suspicious transaction? 
There is no definition.  
There should be sufficient protection and freedom of law abiding citizens should be preserved.  
The government has overall authority to make those regulations.  
Routine legitimate business transactions could be disrupted as a result of the bill. 
Let us talk about securing a conviction of money laundering. 
It should be needs based.  
The Department of Finance issued a consultation paper on January 17. 
This addresses some of the concerns about the broad discretion. 
Everything is hidden in these regulations. 
Nothing has been clearly defined in the bill.  
Let us talk about regulations. 
Every small business will sue the government.  
Those 800 regulations are on questionable files that have been backlogged for years and years.  
Successive ministers have kept the stonewalling going. 
The regulations that the committee objects to are kept in place and are fully operable. 
I have criticized this bill enough. 
Let me now discuss some of the suggestions for the government if it is listening. 
There are only three members here in the House who are listening.  
I will call them proposed amendments. 
There should be precision in the legislation. 
Witnesses before the committees must be representative of a cross-section. 
The government does not put its money where its mouth is. 
We must arrive at the best possible solution to this complex problem. 
Therefore, all parties must co-operate in the committee work. 
Sometimes the actual issue is lost.  
As it is written, it is very vague. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
This is a major problem. 
The word ``violent'' is not used lightly. 
There are human tragedies behind these figures.  
Therefore, we can no longer talk about a soft drug. 
All drugs are becoming hard drugs.  
Associated with money laundering are also murders. 
Justice in this country has always been one of the Bloc Quebecois' main concerns. 
Our party has always wanted to see justice done. 
Why was that so important?  
It also facilitates money laundering.  
The small denominations weigh 120 kilos. 
It would be a lot easier.  
Following these efforts, 70 pawnshops closed in Montreal. 
These 70 pawnshops were probably used to launder money.  
It is something that we have often talked about here. 
These farmers receive death threats. 
They are told their children could be harmed. 
We had the opportunity to discuss that. 
It take time to build up this trust.  
The law was distinctly lacking in this regard. 
They do so on a voluntary basis.  
Essentially, Bill C-22 does what the Bloc Quebecois had proposed. 
This was essentially what had to be done, for the present at least. 
There are some questions, but we are only at second reading. 
The bill also broadens the scope of existing legal provisions. 
We feel this is an improvement. 
There are also provisions for co-operation with foreign countries. 
We must never forget this.  
Recently, there was a conference in Russia on the evolution of organized crime. 
We must remember that organized crime is becoming increasingly international. 
This is the amount laundered internationally. 
Co-operation between governments is essential. 
Finally, Bill C-22 provides another innovation. 
The first of these relates to increasing the powers of customs officers. 
This may be beneficial. 
We are concerned, at the same time, about people's rights and freedoms. 
Customs officers must have a framework of operation.  
We have misgivings about this. 
This has also come up in other bills.  
Next week, the justice subcommittee will be meeting. 
I would like to send a message to the government. 
The hopes of several thousand people rest on that subcommittee.  
I do not say that as a figure of speech. 
They also place a lot of hope on short term measures. 
But they are waiting for short term action.  
I bring this message to the government. 
We must see improvements. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That is not a point of order, but never mind.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
However, I am concerned about a number of issues with respect to the bill.  
The NDP supports this bill in principle. 
The Liberals in the past have introduced legislation which I classify as feel good legislation. 
I hope this bill will not fall under same definition. 
I would use two examples. 
The smugglers went from smuggling tobacco to smuggling guns.  
What did the government do? 
In fact, it was not doing a darned thing. 
It was encouraging smugglers to continue to smuggle.  
We have these two pieces of feel good legislation which the Liberals passed. 
As we know, criminals do not register their guns. 
It is a feel good piece of legislation. 
The third issue in terms of our concerns is a possible pressure on consumers. 
That means that the consumer stands to pay the fare one more time.  
The fourth issue of concern for us is the question about the system's effectiveness. 
There remains a series of concerns about the planned reporting scheme's effectiveness. 
More and more people are using the Internet. 
There is a huge growth in the debit card business. 
More and more consumers are using cards for instant transactions. 
I happen to know someone from New Jersey who owns a fast food franchise. 
It is actually quite nice.  
A clearer and more precise definition of what constitutes a suspicious transaction is needed. 
Strict guidelines must be established.  
In addition, the issue of tax related offences should be addressed. 
Money laundering extends far beyond hiding profits from narcotics. 
This comes from a book by Diane Francis entitled Contrepreneurs . 
Some members may be wondering what I mean by that.  
It has not really undertaken, in my view, a comprehensive attempt to do that.  
Hon. Ralph E. Goodale:
It is up and running in Bethune.  
It is up and running in Bethune?  
Hon. Ralph E. Goodale:
It has been there for two years now. 
It was in my riding and he never invited me. 
He should have invited me to the opening. 
He has to be more co-operative.  
I am glad to see that is happening. 
One of his promises has been completed.  
Hopefully the government opposite will provide sufficient funding for these individuals.  
There are no taxes on those particular transactions. 
Most members of parliament in Canada believe there should be a tax. 
Most elected officials in the world believe there should be a tax. 
In summary, we support the bill in principle. 
It has many more positive things to address. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Tax evasion is not addressed in this bill.  
Nine billion dollars a year is a lot of cash. 
It could also address some of the farm crisis. 
It could address all kinds of major problems that we have in the country.  
Is it too complicated or just not a high enough priority? 
I also appreciated his comments on the Tobin tax. 
I maintain that if there is a will, there is a way as well.  
It was extended by the Conservative government for a number of extra years. 
Guess who pays the piper?  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
We all know that this is but part of a larger problem. 
That larger problem obviously being organized crime, again here in Canada.  
We have to be more aggressive and more vigilant in addressing this problem. 
This legislation does move in the right direction in that regard.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Motion No. 1 will be debated and voted on. 
I shall now put Motion No. 1 to the House.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ) moved: 
It is not as widespread a practice as some might think. 
There was some public outcry around that.  
For example, banks sometimes have a promotion. 
One can get free life insurance or any type of insurance for three months. 
It is free for three months. 
That is not negative option billing.  
At present, we have the Consumer Protection Bureau. 
Moreover, this individual could be prohibited from publishing any new material.  
I believe that the Kelloggs are in a similar situation regarding these regulations. 
We are applying the terms of the act.  
We believe the same thing applies in this case. 
Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):
This practice is a perversion of the traditional buyer-seller relationship. 
I often have trouble following the twisted logic of the Bloc. 
A change was made to deal with the evolution of electronic commerce. 
I am sure this is simply a coincidence.  
I will quote his question: 
You are a watchdog organization involved in consumer protection in Quebec. 
What they do not say is that their act specifically exempts federal jurisdiction. 
It in fact says it does not apply to cable.  
Look, I have no objection if a Quebecer wants to subscribe to TFO. 
That is not what I would call a free market practice.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I ask all members to show a little respect.  
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Canadian Alliance):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is the hon. member asking to split his time?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
That is a reasonable proposal to use and therefore we are supportive of that concept.  
In principle I think it should be the other way around. 
I know that is the intent of this bill. 
I do not think that it would be a serious matter. 
The bill is in proper balance. 
I think that is a good check and balance which will be used very rarely. 
That is a very good provision in the bill.  
I will be voting against the amendment put forward by the Bloc at report stage.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
The bill is remarkable for several reasons. 
We have not seen any kind of progressive consumer legislation come from the government. 
It has always been from private members like the member for Sarnia-Lambton.  
They have anti-combine legislation which actually protects consumers. 
They have competition legislation which actually encourages competition.  
We have an act which the Liberals have misnamed. 
They call it the Competition Act. 
I would hope they will support it as they did at second reading.  
Will they vote for the bankers or will they vote for the consumers? 
Every consumer I have spoken with agrees with this statement.  
There are arguments in favour and against. 
The Bloc wants to exempt the province of Quebec from the bill. 
If so, why does it not just exempt the whole country? 
The Liberal government will sacrifice consumers at the altar of industry. 
The Bloc Quebecois will sacrifice common sense at the altar of ideology. 
The banks could not defeat the bill in committee. 
The Bloc will not defeat it in the House. 
We wish him luck in the Senate.  
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
The story gets very interesting as we uncover its many layers. 
The bill proposes to eliminate what is known as default billing. 
This relationship is simple. 
This is only logical.  
This practice does not allow the buyer to even consider purchasing a product. 
How can we do this? 
What role can this House have in furthering the preservation of consent? 
We can start by passing this bill, Bill C-276. 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I am quite pleased to take part in this debate. 
Our objections are based on the constitution.  
Some may wonder how that can be. 
And it is the Bloc Quebecois members, sovereignist members, who have to do this.  
In both cases, the arguments put forward by the attorney general of Quebec were accepted. 
Therefore, the new package is offered on a positive option marketing basis.  
If those rules are not respected, what is the use of having them?  
For Canadians outside Quebec, the main government is the federal government. 
In Quebec, whether one is a federalist or a sovereignist, the exact opposite is true. 
Turnout in provincial elections in Quebec is always higher. 
Yet this is clearly a provincial jurisdiction.  
The same is true for health. 
It upsets me even more coming from the New Democratic Party. 
I was an observer at their last convention. 
At the same time, it pointed out that Quebec had the right to self determination. 
I would like to recall the remarks of the representatives of this group. 
They said that the bill was a matter of provincial jurisdiction.  
That for all transactions, consumers be given a hard copy contract.  
None of these recommendations was heeded.  
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Cable companies have a monopoly in the industry. 
I know that in my riding there is a certain company, and that is it. 
That is why I supported the member's bill in the last parliament.  
Since that time a number of things have been added to the bill. 
Should that apply to the banks? 
The principle is the same. 
Members should ask themselves if it is workable in the context of banks. 
I would submit that it is not. 
First, banks are not monopoly providers. 
Let me give members an example to try to express my point. 
Guess what, maybe 90% to 95% of customers of banks will not respond. 
That is a reality. 
We can pretend it is not the case, but it is. 
We know from experience that surveys will not get the kind of response we want.  
What is the bank supposed to do? 
It has seven million customers. 
What does the bank do now? 
More importantly, how do consumers benefit from this?  
That is what is happening.  
The irony is the banks are doing this right now. 
The reality is members do not hear a lot from their constituents. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):
Those are the important questions. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):
To date, it has none.  
The committee is an important component in the parliamentary process surrounding environmental legislation. 
Towards Pollution Prevention'', containing 141 recommendations. 
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Canadian Alliance):
Madam Speaker, the HRDC boondoggle will just not go away. 
The HRDC problem is the tip of the iceberg.  
TJF grants are supposed to be used to create sustainable jobs. 
But at what cost? 
Here are some examples. 
Was the transitional jobs fund a slush fund? 
He later pleaded guilty.  
There seems to be no end to the shovelgate affair. 
There are at least 13 RCMP investigations occurring at this time.  
Overall we have continued to find the same problems. 
There are many reasons why these problems have persisted. 
It is unfortunate that the auditor general does not have teeth. 
Perhaps it is long overdue that the House give the auditor general some teeth. 
After all, the buck stops with the politicians. 
The money belongs to the people. 
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We had a report on poor management and poor administration. 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
I remind hon. members of the significance of the 20 year figure. 
There were other incidents along the coast of Brittany and in several countries of Asia. 
On what secret study did the minister rely to say what he said? 
Maybe he made a mistake? 
If that is the case, I forgive him in advance.  
Mr. John Cannis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
In order for dialogue to be meaningful, we must all start from the same basis. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.44 p.m.)
