The Senate met at 1:30 p.m., the Speaker pro tempore in the Chair.  
In Recognition of Naval Forces 
The forests, the towns, 
Great cities and mountains, 
Some were of renown.  
The eager, the scared 
Knew not what they dared.  
They withstood every hardship 
Long gut-wrenching days, 
Lonely vigils on watch, 
They proved that they cared.  
Midst sweat, tears and toil, 
And oft when torpedoed 
Storms, ice and fog, 
With sea, spew and gear; 
These young men, Canadian, 
Their equipment not modern 
Their ships lacking, too, 
Their "on-the-job training" 
Pushed most convoys through.  
By the bombs and torpedoes 
Of a harsh enemy.  
"Wary Navy" most were, 
R.C.N. lads in blue - 
And Merchant Navy, not few; 
In "sweepers" and "four-stackers", 
The Canadian Navy yet grew 
Midst turmoil and terror 
To a multitude from a few.  
The East and the West, 
These sea-faring sailors - 
the R.C.N.V.R., R.C.N., 
Merchant Navy and the Wrens.  
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
They seem to have determined that it has not been done since 1914.  
Misappropriation of Funds for French-Language Training 
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
For a provincial minister to make such an admission is quite something. 
It is scandalous in more than one regard. 
It is not only unfair, it is dishonest. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
What we have to declare was not arrived at lightly. 
Not to mention the lives of the men and women who fly them.  
We hope you are listening, Mr. Prime Minister.  
School System-Update on Making Waves Program 
Hon. Erminie J. Cohen :
What can we do?  
It has been very successful. 
This is the type of project that deserves federal funding. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
On behalf of all honourable senators, I welcome you to the Senate of Canada.  
State of Domestic and International Financial System 
Interim Report of Banking, Trade and CommerceCommittee on Study Tabled 
Hon. E. Leo Kolber :
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Agriculture and Agri-food 
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
However, the farm crisis is not only happening on the Prairies. 
Honourable senators, we have heard this for two years. 
Farm crisis groups have been established. 
The following was reported in today's Leader Post : 
The Governor General recognizes that we have a national problem here.  
One might say, "Well, the government has provided money." 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I thank the honourable senator for raising this issue once again. 
There was an increase, but it did not appear to be a catastrophic increase. 
Farm Crisis in Prairie Provinces-Level of Government Subsidies 
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
Honourable senators, the minister mentions the fact that farmers have received money. 
They are receiving the funds right now, so I know exactly what they are getting. 
The Americans are recognizing that they have a major national issue. 
Canada does not seem to recognize the same condition here. 
Agriculture is facing a serious problem.  
German companies are buying up land all across Manitoba.  
The big question is whether the government will come to grips with a serious approach. 
I am suggesting that it will take a couple of billion dollars per year. 
The government boasts of a surplus. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
It is a fact of government that we must live within limited resources. 
Is the assistance enough? 
Obviously, our farmers are much more efficient than the world competition.  
Honourable senators, what if the farmers are no longer there? 
Bankruptcies are the order of the day. 
One of my neighbours went bankrupt a few days ago. 
These things are happening. 
I would be the last one to cry. 
I should like an ask another question. 
Why can farmers not get a reasonable price for their commodities? 
We supposedly get 6 cents on a loaf of bread. 
Canada must deal with this problem or we are gone.  
I give that undertaking to the honourable senator without hesitation.  
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Honourable senators, I rise on a supplementary question. 
The answers of the minister bothered me in two ways. 
It seems to be a response about the majority. 
If the majority are complying, then everything is okay. 
They probably did not have a relative with extra money. 
They probably did not have extra equipment or extra land.  
We are losing a resource in rural Saskatchewan. Does that not count? 
Many of those who did pay had difficulty doing so. 
Many are in a totally destitute position. 
That does not mean they are bad farmers. 
It means that they do not have the extra means.  
Honourable senators have heard the figures from Senator Gustafson. 
People cannot make money farming these days. 
They are trying to wait for a turnaround. 
Surely, the government has a responsibility here. 
Surely, the Farm Credit Corporation should take that into account. 
I have a second question. 
What is the government's plan to tackle the subsidy issue?  
They have a three-year cushion with which to prop up their farmers. 
There is no new initiative. 
What is the government doing on the subsidy issue internationally?  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, there were two questions, and I shall attempt to answer both. 
I will convey the honourable senator's concerns and views. 
It is not an easy task. 
Obviously, it is not something on which, we will be successful in one stroke overnight. 
Admittedly, this involves a long, ongoing process. 
Senator Gustafson can give you all the statistics. 
They have exhausted their own resources and any other resources available to them. 
That is cold comfort to the person who has neither a relative nor the means. 
That is why I am saying that this is hurting the poorest of the poor. 
Talk to those families and to their children. 
At this point it is not a statistical thing, it is a humanitarian issue.  
Honourable senators, I do not want to repeat my comments with respect to that issue. 
Obviously, it is a situation that has developed. 
Low Rate of Return to Producers-Government Response 
Honourable senators, I rise on a supplementary question. 
There is another piece of information apart from the government strategy on the subsidies question. 
The government can look upon this situation with equanimity. 
In the past, we have had wage and price controls and all sorts of things. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I am not familiar with the particular plan that the honourable senator mentions. 
No, I have not read those documents.  
The leader might try that to begin with.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
...we now believe the elastic band has been stretched as far as it can go. 
We hope you are listening, Mr. Prime Minister.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
That is a pretty serious, fundamental charge.  
Whom do we believe? 
You can name them.  
I will supply a list of the names to the honourable senator.  
This program costs $18 million and is already well underway. 
That entire program has covered 21 of the 30 military helicopters to date. 
Under this program, the balance of nine helicopters will be fully completed by 2002. 
There is a main gearbox upgrade program. 
The main gearbox upgrade is another $18 million ongoing program. 
I do not want to go on and on, honourable senators, but I could. 
Honourable senators, let us give the senior military personnel a little credit. 
That is not a charge I would make of them. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I rise on a supplementary.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, the time for Question Period has expired.  
It is a short day, honourable senators.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
I am sorry, honourable senators, but I do not have unanimous consent.  
Delayed Answers to Oral Questions 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Sanctions Against Iraq-Government Policy 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Douglas Roche on April 5, 2000) 
Agriculture and Agri-Food 
Nova Scotia-Effect of Proposed Cutbacks on Employees in Halifax 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Donald H. Oliver on April 6, 2000) 
Accordingly, the CBC is responsible for all aspects of its operations 
It would be inappropriate, therefore, to speculate on the eventual results of this internal exercise.  
Ucluelet-Tofino, British Columbia-Request for Replacement of Leasehold Fish Licensing System 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Pat Carney onApril 6, 2000) 
It was rejected on March 31, 2000.  
Yugoslavia-Rotation of Peacekeeping Soldiers Home-Problems of Return Flight 
At no time were our troops abandoned by the Canadian Contingent.  
There is no other offer outstanding.  
(Response to question raised by Hon. John Lynch-Staunton on April 11, 2000) 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin on April 11, 2000) 
Firearms Registration Form-Nature of Personal Information Requested 
Possibility of Suspension of Anthrax Vaccination Program 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Michael A. Meighen on April 13, 2000) 
This will give crew members more time to take protective measures.  
Agriculture and Agri-Food 
Flooding Problem in Manitoba and Saskatchewan-Possibility of Assistance 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Terry Stratton on April 13, 2000) 
The losses are therefore not eligible under the DFAA guidelines.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Obviously, the report was given to that paper by someone.  
I find that insulting to us all.  
I want to know who leaked the report. 
I want some action taken. 
I ask for His Honour's guidance in this matter.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
The last sentence in the story states: 
The report is expected to be released in the next few weeks.  
Under the rules, that is clearly a breach of privilege. 
However, the Senate has not yet considered that report.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, might I respond to the question posed by the Honourable Senator Murray?  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I rise on a point of order. 
This debate is completely out of order. 
I hope that the honourable senator's question of privilege will be upheld. 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The first is Bill C-2, standing in the name of Senator Oliver. 
Other senators may want to propose amendments. 
The last item is Bill C-23. 
I think Senator Robertson intends to speak to it today. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
We have identified those three pieces of government legislation. 
We are making good progress on all three.  
If other senators wish to go ahead of him, they may do so. 
However, we will speak to the other two bills today.  
Third Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton , Leader of the Opposition:
Honourable senators, I rise on a point of order. 
How could an honourable senator interrupt the debate to talk about something else?  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
I understand Senator Fraser also wishes to speak today.  
I am speaking to the bill, honourable senators. 
I should like to read it into the record.  
The Honourable Lorna Milne, Senator Chair 
The Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs ... 
The Honourable Don Boudria 
So far as I can tell, it is all reasonable and well designed.  
The first is the part relating to opinion polls, which has two main thrusts. 
It is this last rule which concerns me. 
I firmly intend to address this in the near future.  
I am not one of those Canadians.  
The democratic process will be aided, not limited.  
On motion of Senator Nolin, debate adjourned.  
Modernization of Benefits and Obligations Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson :
The message emanating from the courts and the tribunals is loud and clear. 
Honourable senators, Canada prides itself on being a leading nation. 
As such, discrimination based on sexual orientation is unacceptable. 
The interpretation section reads: 
It is most certainly not about legislating morality.  
However, in the meantime, I wish to raise three issues that cause me some concern.  
The broader dependency issue is a tricky one. 
The implications for both individuals and Canadian society as a whole are unclear. 
Much thought must be given to a whole range of questions. 
Other questions need to be addressed. 
What are the definitions of dependency and relationship? 
What relationships would be allowed? 
If so, how would privacy issues be addressed? 
How would negotiations with the provinces be completed?  
My third concern relates to social policy-making in general. 
Honourable senators, I could not agree more with the Honourable Minister of Justice. 
A recent editorial in The Ottawa Citizen makes the case. 
The wife did not earn an income outside the home. 
The editorial goes on to argue: 
...it's hard to exaggerate how much this picture is changing. 
According to the 1996 census, 15 per cent of couples are common law. 
There are well over one million lone-parent families. 
The point is, honourable senators, the times are rapidly changing. 
We are always mopping up after the fact. 
We cannot seem to see the social changes in advance. 
We are always mopping up in this regard.  
Quoting further from the The Ottawa Citizen editorial: 
How have governments responded? 
Certainly not by truly rethinking those systems. 
It could be that Bill C-23 is just such an illustration. 
Hon. Lois M. Wilson :
I support this bill. 
I do not think this bill threatens the status of marriage as an institution. 
Marriage between heterosexual couples exists for many, many reasons other than procreation. 
Nor does the bill necessarily undermine the family. 
They are doing an excellent, responsible job with that family.  
What does the future hold? 
It behooves us to prepare ourselves carefully and responsibly for that eventuality. 
On motion of Senator Cools, debate adjourned.  
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Norman K. Atkins :
I have listened to and read every word said here. 
No one will ever accuse me of being a constitutional lawyer. 
I will leave that to Senator Beaudoin and others. 
On the other hand, I have been a senator since 1986. 
I am not sure what that gives me. 
Let us go back in time and attempt to determine from where this bill came.  
These were the immediate responses to the 1995 referendum result. 
This was an avenue that we opposed as a political party. 
This is not a responsibility to be passed on to the Supreme Court of Canada.  
Supported by the Liberal Party, it did not survive a nationwide referendum.  
In the preamble of the bill, there are eight paragraphs. 
The Supreme Court of Canada is mentioned in five of them. 
It is great politics but, I ask you, is it right?  
Why did the government act? 
Senator Boudreau helps us with that. 
It is brought in under the guise that it will bring clarity to the situation.  
Who could be against clarity? 
Obviously, only those who oppose the bill. 
The dismantling of the country is not the job of the federal government. 
Honourable senators, there is no clear question in the bill. 
The clear majority is not spelled out, either. 
Where is the clarity? 
Why does a sovereigntist movement exist in Quebec? 
Why has this movement been so significant over the past quarter century? 
What is the best strategy to counter the idea of Quebec sovereignty?  
Let us look more closely at the bill, honourable senators. 
Again good politics, but I ask, is it right? 
Of course it is not.  
It was risky in 1995 and still is very risky today.  
I know that a large number of Canadians are anxious to turn the page. 
I can appreciate the government's preoccupation with referenda. 
I will again quote Mr. Garneau commenting on Bill C-20: 
Quebec should proceed instead in a more constructive manner.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Are you requesting leave to continue, Senator Atkins?  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is leave granted, honourable senators, for the Honourable Senator Atkins to continue?  
It did not contain a method by which the country could be broken up. 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I move the adjournment of the debate. 
That is not the way to adjourn debate.  
On motion of Senator Hays, debate adjourned.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Energy, the Environment and Natural Resources 
Notice of Motion to Authorize Committeeto Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
Leave having been given to revert to Notices of Motions: 
Honourable senators, I give notice that tomorrow, Thursday, May 4, 2000, I will move: 
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m..
