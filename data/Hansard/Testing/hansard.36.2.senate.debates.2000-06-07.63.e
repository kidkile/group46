The Senate met at 1:30 p.m., the Speaker pro tempore in the Chair.  
Catholic Health Association of Canada 
The statement issued by the chairperson, Sister Annette Noel, reads: 
Bill to Amend-Notice of Motion to Declare Null and Void 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
We are in the hands of honourable senators in terms of proceeding with leave. 
I suggest that we refer the matter to the Rules Committee.  
I shall now take my seat and request a comment.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, a number of questions must be answered. 
Thus, the bill that is before us is the bill that came with the message. 
How were we told? 
Perhaps the deputy leader could explain.  
I shall give the question the best answer I can.  
I do not see this as a typographical error. 
That is how the two bills come to us, Senator Kinsella.  
This is the problem of the House of Commons. 
I guess the message would be something to which all senators would have to agree. 
Nothing that we have done is at issue here. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Why should we correct and even cover up for the sloppiness of the other place? 
It is their bill. 
Let them send it to us in the proper manner. 
What I think I heard is which one do we pick? 
Honourable senators, there is another option. 
Let me make a final attempt and give the notice of motion. 
I think all parties would agree to that. 
Perhaps we are not at that stage yet. 
I will discuss that with my counterpart.  
Honourable senators, I give notice that, tomorrow, June 8, I will move: 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
I sat for years in the other chamber. 
I asked some members yesterday about our concern. 
One of them said to me, "What bill again? 
Well, I did not pay attention. 
I just voted, as is customary. 
That shows one thing. 
I am not in disagreement. 
I was with him in 1960. 
I will not be here for the end of this debate. 
Then we will act accordingly when the bill is returned.  
Hon. Jean-Robert Gauthier :
Honourable senators, I must come to the defence of the person responsible for this error. 
Let us correct this error without blaming the honourable members or the House of Commons. 
There is no reason to cast stones at them, for we, too, can make mistakes.  
Budget Implementation Bill, 2000 
Bill read first time.  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, the tabling of this document is debatable. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Hon. Thelma J. Chalifoux :
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Thursday next, June 8, 2000, I will move: 
That the Committee submit its report no later than December 15, 2000.  
Public Knowledge of Committees 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Indeed, they are put there and maintained there for a definite reason.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, there are certain standing committees of cabinet which function on an ongoing basis. 
I gather that is the Honourable Herb Gray's committee. 
I assume that the Leader of the Government is familiar with its workings.  
Replacement of Sea King Helicopters-Openness of Procurement Process 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
The details of those procurement announcements are, of course, left with him. 
I am confident that any process he initiates will be fair.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I have no knowledge of whether that is the case but I can certainly check. 
I will table a written response, but I will inquire forthwith.  
Future of CFB Shilo 
Honourable senators, my question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
They have done upgrades of $3 million to fitness facilities. 
Manitoba does have a desert, and Shilo is located on that desert. 
This is reported in the Winnipeg Free Press . 
I would appreciate a response.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
However, it does appear that a significant infrastructure exists. 
Possibility of Closing Kapyong Base 
Honourable senators, there is another base in Manitoba called Kapyong. 
It is the base for the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry. 
That base is quite old. 
It was built during and after the Second World War. 
As compared to the base in Shilo, it is really quite decrepit. 
The land that the base sits on is extremely valuable. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Delayed Answer to Oral Question 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Effect of Proposed Cuts 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Noel A. Kinsella onMay 31, 2000) 
Developments Respecting Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide 
Report of Social Affairs, Science and Technology Committee-Debate Continued 
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
That was not the purpose of this five-year review. 
Thus, I will leave that aside.  
That was imposed upon us as an imperative. 
It had travelled in 1995. 
Institutions that deliver palliative care were not visited this time around. 
Depression exacerbates the suffering that dying people and their families endure. 
When I use the word "younger," I use it in a relative sense. 
I am talking about beyond-middle-age terminally ill people. 
That depression hits many people. 
Unfortunately, there is not sufficient research in this field. 
As such, I do want to underline that need.  
The entire committee endorsed this view. 
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
Therefore, honourable senators, I move, seconded by the Honourable Senator Ferretti Barth: 
That the motion be amended by adding the following words: 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt this motion in amendment?  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Before carrying on this debate, we should await Senator Carstairs comments on it.  
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
Honourable senators, I had intended to speak to the report. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
I wish that I had had the time to sit on that subcommittee.  
Pain management seemed to be the other serious problem at that time. 
We recommended strongly that there be research done on pain management. 
That was one of the recommendations in the 1995 report.  
It does not have to cost a great deal. 
The Liberal government endorses pharmacare as a long-term national objective....We 
On motion of Senator Hays, for Senator Pepin, debate adjourned.  
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration 
Tenth Report of Committee Adopted 
Honourable Senator Rompkey, P.C. ). 
Therefore, twice the amount of funds was allocated to committees as compared to last year. 
I also wish to pay tribute to the Subcommittee on Budgets.  
Senator Carstairs' report is a case in point. 
I hope that the Senate will support the adoption of this report.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
