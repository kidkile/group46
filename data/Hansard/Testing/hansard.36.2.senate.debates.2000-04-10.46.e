The Senate met at 4:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
He is very familiar with public life.  
Senator Wiebe is a long-time farmer. 
As Premier Romanow said earlier this year: 
We all look forward to the addition that you will make to our work."  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
In 1983, our new colleague took out membership in the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. 
Apology to the Honourable Ron Ghitter 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
On October 21, 1998, Senator Ghitter commenced a defamation action against us.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Acting Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Margaret Newell is the Chair of the Prairie action Foundation. 
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
Honourable senators, I was privileged to attend a special ceremony this morning. 
On her invitation to Canada, she wrote: 
Thank you from the whole of my heart for making this dream come true!!! 
Hon. Catherine S. Callbeck :
I should like to recognize these individuals for their efforts and dedication to their community. 
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration 
Eighth Report of Committee Presented 
Monday, April 10, 2000 
viii) A Senate Disability Guide for staff will be developed; 
x) A proactive access to the Senate Internet will be also developed; and 
xi) Accessibility issues will be incorporated with the Senate Intranet.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
When shall this report be taken into consideration?  
A Bill to Change the Name of Certain Electoral Districts 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Tuesday, April 11, 2000, I will move, 
Notice of Motion to Instruct Committee to Amend 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I give notice that tomorrow, Tuesday, April 11, 2000, I will move: 
Public Works and Government Services 
I have known him for a long time. 
We are not intimate friends at all.... 
How much money was involved and what could possibly be the reason behind this? 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
In fact, that decision has not been made. 
I said that there was pressure put on the government.  
Did the Leader of the Government in the Senate agree to support this? 
I can, however, tell the honourable senator two things. 
Second, a decision was not taken by Treasury Board.  
Honourable senators, are we missing something here? 
Why would someone in Mr. Rae's position be involved? 
What is going on here?  
There were no representations made to me by Mr. Rae on behalf of that individual. 
The decision speaks for itself.  
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
What does he know about that story?  
I have no knowledge of it otherwise, so I cannot make any further comment.  
Has the honourable senator met with Mr. Bourque or any of his representatives?  
I have never met with Mr. Bourque. 
I would not know him if he walked into the room.  
Honourable senators, I have another supplementary question.  
I was not lobbied by anyone. 
I do not know the first individual you mentioned - Mr. Riopelle?  
Nisga'a Final Agreement Bill 
Third Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
These are my neighbours and my friends.  
They can profoundly impact the lives, well-being and futures of countless families.  
For this reason, I review all bills that refer to fisheries. 
I had no axe to grind. 
The Nass River Valley is far away from my home province. 
It is only fair that they should be assured of continued access.  
Minister Nault, therefore, did not inspire confidence to trust his judgment.  
The fish are owned by the public. 
It is a common property resource. 
The federal government is the steward of those fish. 
Therefore, it has no right to give that resource away as it sees fit.  
The Gladstone decision went on to state: 
Others interpret this Canadian position in the same way. 
Pardon the nautical pun, but this is a red herring.  
This is not rocket science.  
I wish to point out another significant precedent. 
Issue Paper 16, page 16, number 4 states: 
Do with it as you see fit. 
I refer to section 37, which states: 
That, of course, is the cabinet.  
Why should it trust our judgment on treaties?  
The cabinet will then assume the legislative power to sign amendments to the treaty. 
Parliament is here to keep a check over government decisions. 
We should not squander our parliamentary oversight responsibility. 
We should not place blind trust in cabinet. 
On motion of Senator Carstairs, for Senator Christensen, debate adjourned.  
Canadian Institutes of Health Research Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Honourable senators, our Constitution of 1867 is silent on the secession of a province. 
Any provision or clause of the Constitution may be amended. 
Our Constitution is also silent on the referendum. 
Parliament and the provinces may adopt legislation on referenda. 
A referendum is facultative in our system.  
The court said no in both cases. 
It is probably more impressive but it is certainly much less flexible.  
This decision is made via resolution. 
The legislative power is provided for, described and defined in the Constitution. 
Some powers are exclusive; a few are concurrent.  
What is supreme in our country is the Constitution. 
We have had five formulas of amendment since 1982. 
There are three aspects of the bill that I think are open to criticism. 
Is this respectful of the spirit of federalism? 
The Senate is a legislative chamber like the House of Commons. 
Parliament is composed of two houses at the federal level. 
For legislation, the two houses are equal. 
We are concerned with a statute.  
This is based on the fundamental principles of our parliamentary democracy.  
I do not agree with that view. 
Bill C-20 leaves intact the notion of vote of confidence. 
It does not even touch on it, and this is fine. 
Of course, the vote of confidence only exists in the House of Commons. 
It has been part of our constitutional conventions since 1847, if not 1846. 
In that case, it was section 133 of the Constitution. 
On the contrary, the adoption of a resolution is part of the legislative process. 
In my opinion, Bill C-20 should be amended accordingly.  
It is true that the Senate only has a suspensive veto. 
This is an important point, but it was done through a constitutional amendment. 
It was not done through a simple act. 
Honourable senators, why should we accept such an erosion? 
I am in favour of clarity. 
This has always been my goal. 
In its opinion, the Supreme Court saw this clearly at paragraph 155 of the reference. 
Laws may impress, but they are not flexible.  
Plan A offers hope. 
I hope that we will come back to it. 
Plan A is based on a common thread. 
In a few words, I refuse to accept an erosion of our powers. 
This may be our finest hour.  
However, is this the right way to go about it? 
I will not debate the role of the Senate - that is a constitutional issue. 
I do not wish to pass judgment on our court. 
There is a question that arises, and again I quote Patrick Monahan: 
There must be something missing in our society for things to be like this. 
I trust that the bill we have here will not be any obstacle to that.  
On motion of Senator Carstairs, for Senator Pitfield, debate adjourned.  
Payments in Lieu of Taxes Bill 
The changes cover two general areas. 
Please note that I say "intention". 
The government has no obligation to pay property taxes. 
There would be few convictions!  
Honourable senators, these are all matters that we may want to study in committee. 
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Honourable Senator Finestone, P.C. ). 
Hon. Celine Hervieux-Payette moved the adoption of the report.  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Distinguished Canadians and Their Involvement with the United Kingdom 
We all know the details. 
There is nothing to excuse this shameful and embarrassing spectacle. 
However, this is not about the protocol or lack thereof. 
There is one glaring exception, and that is its editorial page. 
He pops up here, there and everywhere, shilling for his political masters. 
If he were a columnist, fair game. 
At the very least, they should insist that he sign his editorials. 
A newspaper baron who strove to be a knight 
found it not easy just to be black and white 
though accepted in Britain as Sir Conrad Black 
with Jean Chretien's denial, he was taken aback.  
With that peerage denied, we know how you feel 
and advise you to consort with Lady Barbara Amiel 
and if to call you Sir Conrad is what you want most 
then beware what you print in the National Post .  
This was written by Michael Cronin in The Ottawa Citizen on June 23, 1999. 
So the Prime Minister is angry with the National Post . 
Is that not what newspapers do? 
Whether it is you or me or Conrad Black is irrelevant. 
This is about one thing and one thing only:
Jean Chretien's desire to get even with Conrad Black. 
This, honourable senators, should come as no surprise. 
There is plenty of proof of the Prime Minister's character traits. 
This tells a lot about the man.  
To which the editorial responded: 
It happened to be our party.  
...and then to run a non-campaign against him. 
That style - mow them down - has always been his shortcut to success.  
Mr. Martin's article continues: 
Mr. Chretien may have mellowed somewhat since then. 
Why is Jean Chretien so angry? 
...The bluster is a symptom, not a cause. 
Jean Chretien is an angry man in the Prime Minister's chair. 
There is nothing we can do about his anger.  
Lawrence Martin of The Ottawa Citizen stated on June 22, 1999: 
An article in the Ottawa Sun on June 26, 1999, by Paul Stanway, states: 
None of which seem to hold much water.  
It goes with the territory.  
So what we see is yet another mean-spirited attempt at humiliating a political adversary. 
It is just plain pettiness, unworthy of a prime minister.  
The federal Liberals understand the politics of this....  
... I would have described him - 
- and here Mr. Gibson is referring to Mr. Chretien - 
Mr. Black having made himself an enemy, the rest follows.  
...My final adjective for the blocking of the peerage is "outrageous". 
Jean Chretien's behaviour is part of a pattern long established. 
What a temper it revealed!  
The Hon. the Speaker :
May I have leave, please?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Acting Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is it agreed not to see the clock at six o'clock?  
The Hon the Speaker :
Please continue, Senator LeBreton.  
They are only prevented by courtesy.  
"Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed, `That he is grown so great?'" 
- Cassius, in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar.  
The little guy from Shawinigan has grown too big for his britches.  
Forget all the other things, including his dubious financial dealings. 
Why the intrusion into the affairs of another country? 
The guy who "couldn't speak either official language" was us.  
Now, he's a thug.  
The Queen is one. 
This was reported in the National Post on June 22, 1999. 
The Prime Minister replied: 
And so he could not accept it and remain a Canadian citizen. 
There was no regulation passed by the Mulroney government, and you know it!  
Honourable senators, it is as clear as glass. 
This is a contemptuous act based on nothing but false vanity. 
In layman's language, it means the Prime Minister is above the law. 
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
Honourable senators, would the Honourable Senator LeBreton permit me a small question?  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, I should like to move the adjournment of the debate.  
Honourable senators, Senator Cools has spoken already to this inquiry. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
On motion of Senator Cools, debate adjourned.  
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
