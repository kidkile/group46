Report of Committee of the Whole 
Tuesday, May 30, 2000 
The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham :
No one saw him fall. 
No one knew if he had drowned. 
No one knew where his body lay. 
I thought of the Unknown Soldier, as we all did:
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
It is the greatest gift that one person can give to another. 
It is a point made in the Gospel of John 15:13, which reads: 
It is a soldier's requiem. 
As long as there is a Canada, we will remember them. 
Hon. Raymond J. Perrault :
Was he able to use his weapon in attack or defence? 
How old was he? 
Where in Canada did he live? 
Did he understand the causes for which he died? 
Did he suffer, or was his death mercifully swift?  
Genocide is taking place. 
The Late Honourable E. Davie Fulton, P.C., O.C., Q.C. 
Hon. Raymond J. Perrault :
The Late Honourable Maurice (Rocket) Richard, P.C., O.C. 
Hon. Francis William Mahovlich :
How many people in this world can start a riot? 
Starting a riot or winning a hockey game was a natural happening for Maurice Richard. 
This line was formed by coach Dick Irvin. 
We will all miss him.  
It was in 1957 and the Canadiens were at their best. 
The Toronto coach was Howie Meeker. 
He gave me strict orders not to let the Rocket get away. 
Honourable senators, I found out why they called him the Rocket. 
He was beginning to break away from me so I grabbed hold of him. 
I get chills when I think about it.  
It was Bobby Hull, Wayne Gretzky and Gordie Howe for the first team. 
The second team was Frank Mahovlich, Mario Lemieux and Maurice Richard. 
It will surely be Maurice Richard, in overtime, who will score the winning goal. 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
The Montreal Canadien's Number 9 is no more. 
The notice of his death plunged millions of Canadians into mourning. 
This prodigious player was born on August 14, 1921. 
Today, the idol of young hockey fans is Number 99. 
There were four teams, two series.  
Thanks to him, public interest in hockey skyrocketed in Canada. 
I wish to offer my sincere condolences to his family. 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Hockey made the difference. 
Shorter, wider, even faster up close in person, the Rocket was simply poetry in motion. 
Nobody could push him around. 
I could not take my eyes off him. 
He was the magic of hockey. 
Later, when I met him, he was still all about hockey. 
He was a simple man interested only in hockey.  
This week, Maurice "the Rocket" Richard died after yet another valiant battle. 
He was his own star. 
He was our hockey star. 
In my time, he was the greatest. 
"The Rocket" had a passion for hockey and a desire to win. 
He hated losing so much that it was a sickness for him. 
He inspired a generation of Quebecers to surpass and believe in themselves. 
He was a sort of pope in a way for us.  
I had the honour of meeting Maurice several times. 
He spoke little and was very humble. 
For us Quebecers, he became a legend: the god of the arena.  
Thank you, Maurice, for showing us the way.  
Hon. Edward M. Lawson :
People speak of the commitment and passion that Rocket Richard had for his game. 
The Rocket agreed that he could do that.  
Maurice Richard was a wonderful human being. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
That was the Maurice Richard we loved.  
I told him about our having this in common. 
This is just what Senator Roberge was trying to tell us. 
Maurice Richard was a man of few words. 
That is why all the flags in Canada today are at half-mast.  
Sometimes, people have a strange notion of history and background. 
This is not taking anything away from the tributes. 
It provided such wonderful continuity. 
Thank you, CBC; they do watch.  
They are still Canadiens fans. 
Le Canadien, c'est pour eux. 
Having a desire to win is not wrong. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I should like to introduce two distinguished groups in our gallery. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
They are the guests of Honourable Senator Wilson, who is the Chancellor of Lakehead University.  
The Honourable Bill Rompkey 
Congratulations on Receipt of Honorary Doctorate Degree from Memorial University 
Their children, Hilary and Peter, were born there. 
The Honourable Dan Hays 
Hon. Catherine S. Callbeck :
However, his relations with Japan date further back than even this date.  
Walkerton-Tragic Deaths Resultingfrom Polluted Water 
Balanced budgets can leave too high a price to pay.  
Dismantling of Longitudinal Labour Force File 
United Nations Representative Christopher Westdal 
The golden age is presumed to belong in the past. 
It could not be moved. 
He showed the golden side of Canadian diplomacy and he deserves our congratulations.  
Twentieth Anniversary of Pro-democracy Movement 
Hon. Lois M. Wilson :
It is a date etched in South Korea's history. 
Canada had a special role. 
The motion passed unanimously. 
The Canadian government did intervene, to be followed by other countries.  
Pages Exchange Program withHouse of Commons 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Paul is from Montreal, Quebec. 
Anna is majoring in psychology. 
On behalf of all honourable senators, I wish you welcome here. 
I hope that you will find your week with us pleasant, interesting and instructive.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Second Report of the Joint Committee Presented 
Tuesday, May 30, 2000 
The Standing Joint Committee on the Library of Parliament has the honour to present its 
A copy of the relevant Minutes of Proceedings (Meeting No. 2 ) is tabled.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration 
Ninth Report of Committee Presented 
Tuesday, May 30, 2000 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
I would be pleased, honourable senators, to deal with any questions concerning this proposal. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Perhaps negotiations are unnecessary. 
My honourrable friends can negotiate in front of us. 
It seems that we could get approval from every quarter. 
However, I am in your hands.  
I am in the hands of the Senate. 
It does not matter. 
We have scheduled the witnesses to fit around either scenario.  
Do what you want.  
Some senators tend to object. 
If there were a good reason, we might approach this differently. 
Accordingly, I should like to deal with this matter now. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
I think I hear a dissenting voice.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I did not hear a dissenting voice.  
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I did not hear any "nays."  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Stand up and be counted.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I did not hear any "nays."  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Would those honourable senators in favour of the motion please say "yea?"  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Would those honourable senators opposed to the motion please say "nay?"  
The Hon. the Speaker :
In my opinion, the "yeas" have it.  
Motion agreed to, on division.  
Canadian NATO Parliamentary Association 
Report of Canadian Delegation to Meeting in Bamako, Mali, Tabled 
Hon. Rose-Marie Losier-Cool :
Energy, the Environment and Natural Resources 
Notice of Motion to Authorize Committee to Meet During Sittings of the Senate 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Report on Restructuring Reserves-Viability of Militia-Response of Government 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Will the minister inform us as to the big secret or what is the difficulty? 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I am having some difficulty understanding. 
I never questioned it at the time. 
I thought that it was accurate and true. 
Perhaps they deserve something a bit better. 
How are we to handle these?  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Those troops, as one can understand, felt somewhat abandoned.  
Can the minister tell us why these discrepancies keep arising? 
Do problems arise at the drafting of his advice to the chamber? 
Many people follow closely the events pertaining to national defence in this country.  
That is yet another example, all within a month, of receiving inaccurate correspondence. 
What is the response to my comments?  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I am not sure that I understand the point honourable senator is making. 
Honourable senators, I will review the original question and answer. 
Perhaps then I could make it simple for them. 
That is another question I can ask.  
That is the point. 
Would an answer in written form be provided? 
The honourable leader gave a different answer when responding to my questions.

( b ) by replacing line 25 with the following: 
"( a ) by the chief agent or a registered agent of a registered".  
The Senate plays an essential role with respect to legislation. 
Its consent is required for bills to be passed.  
This clause leaves out the Senate. 
We now have an opportunity to correct that omission. 
This constitutes an erosion of the Senate's powers.  
Accordingly, this pertains to the exercise of a basic democratic right. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, leave of the Senate is required when more than three amendments are moved. 
We now have seven amendments. 
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Would Senator Beaudoin accept a few questions?  
Yes, I do believe it was proposed later.  
What are the government's comments on this addition? 
Senator Joyal will surely have the answer to that question. 
The minister is right in his desire to amend this bill to include the Senate. 
I am taking this opportunity to submit this amendment immediately. 
Honourable senators, I should like to continue the debate on the amendment moved bySenator Beaudoin. 
Changing those boundaries can, in many cases, mean the difference between re-election and defeat. 
We were facing a similar time frame for putting the law into effect. 
I would just reiterate it here in this house. 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those in favour of the amendment please say "yea"?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those opposed to the amendment please say "nay"?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
In my opinion, the "nays" have it.  
And two honourable senators having risen .  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, we will do that tomorrow, then.  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
I will tell him.  
I believe significant improvements were made. 
We should also again carefully study the divestiture of regional air carriers. 
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
Today, we are facing the same challenge as John A. Macdonald faced. 
This cannot be done with a balanced budget. 
The people in the North depend on air transportation.  
The same thing has to happen in the North. 
Just look at any other continent on the globe. 
I arrived back home from Kazakhstan recently. 
It might as well have been Alberta in 1905. 
Will the honourable senator accept a question?  
That is another continent on which there is no development in the central core. 
Sorry, I overlooked that. 
I thank Senator Bolduc. 
Hon. Raymond J. Perrault:
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
I am in total agreement with the honourable senator on that point.  
Honourable senators, I will not get into a long discussion of the bill. 
It is better that we get it to committee as quickly as possible. 
I thank Senator Taylor for his interesting and always useful observations. 
He might wish to develop them in committee.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Received in Committee of the Whole 
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to dispense with rule 83?  
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Mr. Phillips, do you have an opening statement?  
Mr. Bruce Phillips , Privacy Commissioner:
Honourable senators, thank you very much for having me back. 
I am not trying to flatter you; I mean it. 
That is no reflection on any other place.  
Well, some other people will have to decide that.  
I do not propose to repeat it in any great detail. 
I want to remind you of one or two basic points.  
The issue of privacy is frequently misunderstood. 
People think it is essentially denoting "a means of hiding things." 
Privacy is not the business of hiding things. 
If you really respect someone, you will grant that person a right to privacy. 
If that person respects you, that person will give you a right to your privacy. 
I think that is right. 
"Privacy" is just another word for freedom.  
It essentially became an informational jungle, where there were no rules. 
It will become law at the end of the year. 
That is almost akin to a revolution. 
There are continuing issues, such as the problems in respect of the social insurance number. 
We are aware of the opinion of the Auditor General on that issue. 
We have much anecdotal evidence and information from a variety of sources. 
My first concern is with the confidentiality issue. 
There is a 1918 law on the books that states essentially the same thing. 
However, that form also provides an unqualified guarantee of secrecy and confidentiality.  
There is an enormous amount of data on that census.  
It is no longer simply a census of the population. 
It is a socio-economic study of the most comprehensive kind. 
That distinction has yet to be drawn. 
I did not hear it made at the expert panel on this subject. 
It is possibly the beginnings of a compromise answer to this problem.  
I would now defer to honourable senators.  
He is out of town giving a speech. 
I know you wanted to single him out because he is a very bright fellow.  
I thank honourable senators.  
I am sorry to hear you say that this may be your farewell appearance. 
If it is, I wish you well. 
Your efforts are exemplary. 
The definition may change, but the intent of the information sought is the same. 
After that introduction, sir, my question is twofold. 
By "census taker" do you mean the canvasser or Statistics Canada?  
They are obliged to do that.  
If you fill out the long form, you must give it to someone. 
That person has to check that the questions have been answered. 
That person may be your next-door neighbour.  
I do not disagree with you, senator. 
I am saying it is an obligation under the law.  
Perhaps we might hear from Mr. Phillips.  
That is a process question, honourable senators. 
It has been discontinued, and they are now trying out something else.  
Thus far, they have not been able to do so. 
There is no doubt that the questions are intrusive. 
This tends to be of an extremely intimate nature. 
You have just read off some of the questions, senator.  
Do they have to convince the cabinet?  
Yes, that is right. 
What do you have to say about it? 
Is there anyone who says "no" to a particular question?  
No one from my office.  
Mr. Phillips, I want to talk about the historic census, not today's census.  
Of course, you have anticipated that I would ask you this question. 
You have also written quite a section in your report about the historic census records. 
I have read your presentation to the expert panel.  
Statistics Canada requested this opinion. 
It is too bad that the lawyers were in such a hurry. 
Do you want to answer that question before I ask my second question?  
I might as well get the whole blast.  
Otherwise, why would the government have archives at all for its own records?  
Please, Mr. Phillips, perhaps you could respond to Senator Milne.  
Senator Milne, you will have a chance to ask another question.  
Perhaps when we have lunch, senator. 
I am sure you read that.  
This is your right. 
Every Canadian gets that guarantee with the census form.  
I think we have to debate this issue on more philosophic and ethical grounds.  
You agreed with that last year.  
Some of that information might be contained in a census.  
It is not unreasonable to make adequate provision to take care of that problem.  
I have the greatest respect, senator, for Canadian historians and Canadian academics. 
I read many of them. 
Journalists could make the same claim. 
I concede that the question of time is the basis of a good debate. 
Ninety-two years is the present allocation. 
We must also start considering that issue.  
Thus, I have some problems with lengthening the period of time. 
Until somebody invented a better machine.  
That is the best case I can make.  
I think not; otherwise, we would not bother writing wills.  
If I were drafting the bill, I would have changed that provision.  
Mr. Phillips, I should like to address a slightly different area. 
You mentioned the social insurance number. 
Canadians feel that they must give information if it is requested. 
How do you deal with that as an issue?  
That is a very good point. 
Companies will have to disclose their informational practices. 
That is the way to develop a civilized relationship. 
You must have transparency so that both sides know what is going on.  
My office has never had a public education mandate. 
However, under Bill C-6, we will be given one. 
Are you satisfied that need will be responded to in the new regime?  
The answer to that question is both practical and theoretical. 
In the second paragraph, on page 65, you write: 
First, you must understand that we have limited audit resources. 
I had four people available at that time, in 1997. 
I had 100 per cent cooperation in that review. 
I want to make that clear. 
We asked what it was and they told us. 
My staff examined it and had some questions about it.  
That is why it is there.  
Maybe other senators will be pursuing this matter.  
I am not just satisfied with the minister's decision; I am delighted by it. 
I say this on behalf of Minister Stewart. 
I expect that will be addressed. 
That is one of the things we have been pressing for.  
There are a couple of other issues there. 
It stood the whole process on its head. 
That was bad to begin with.  
I do not have any problem there. 
This database did not comply.  
No, I cannot give you that guarantee. 
That is because my staff was there to see that done. 
It is now back with Revenue Canada. 
That is quite wrong. 
Let us not all panic about that. 
Some of this is necessary sharing.  
The federal service is doing its job. 
I have been in the civil service for 35 years.  
There is one point I want to make about all of this. 
The more the public knows, the less alarmed the public will be.  
There has been an extraordinary reaction to this labour force file. 
That is the bottom line.  
Have you looked at that area at all? 
I regret to say that the answer to that, senator, is no. 
We will certainly take note of what has been said here.  
Just two days ago I returned from a meeting of my provincial counterparts in Winnipeg. 
The subject of information sharing was on the agenda. 
I would include in that, senator, foreign governments. 
I would like to return to the point I made a few moments ago. 
It is a field ripe for careful study.  
Could I have your comment on how you see that playing out? 
Do you think a consensus will develop? 
What will happen if a consensus does not develop?  
We must wait to see where it goes from there.  
We will just have to wait for the findings of the committee. 
Does that answer your request?  
Would you comment on how you see that playing out?  
We certainly have to face that issue.  
You can count on it.  
A real problem of both law and ethics is now in front of our society. 
You have put your finger right on the issue.  
Mr. Phillips, I am delighted that you are here. 
I am sorry to learn that you might be leaving. 
On the issue of privacy rights, where do you stop? 
They are on the Internet every day, with convergence and with technology. 
I believe we are all very concerned. 
Are you comfortable with that still?  
That is the best answer I can give.  
It has been almost a year of work.  
I think a great deal about privacy rights these days. 
Therefore, one cannot dishonour the dead. 
I agree with that.  
Do you not find that a little strange? 
We should keep you on in your position so that you could investigate that?  
I will do what Parliament tells me, senator.  
Yes, I think that is a good point. 
There is an enormous amount of information that must move back and forth. 
The government needs that information in order to do its business. 
The whole thing turns on the way this is done. 
Is it done in a way that respects the principle of the Privacy Act? 
One can make no other argument for abrogating people's rights. 
It could be a template, and I am anxious to see how it works out.  
I hope that template is something you will want to put in the charter.  
In an effort to telescope my opening remarks, I overlooked mentioning that. 
People simply do not know what is going on. 
Mr. Phillips, we shall miss you. 
I enjoy your presentations here each year. 
I am assuming you are gone, I am not certain of that fact.  
I should like to talk about the Canadian Firearms Registry, if I may. 
Have all these recommendations been addressed?  
If there are any problems there, we will try to fix them.  
Are you in the process of doing that?  
Finally, can gun owners access their personal file? 
I cannot give that guarantee. 
You need only look at the statute yourself.  
However, that is only an expectation.  
However, one cannot access the federal tax information. 
What should be done or what are you recommending?  
That is what we are trying to sort out here. 
That is my view and not necessarily the view of everyone in the office.  
That is the problem with this. 
Is the file itself a meld of both provincial and federal information? 
That form is huge now. 
Why do you have to take the whole thing under secrecy? 
Instead, one would donate one's medical history.  
Section 8 sets out a number of exemptions.  
Our paths have crossed in interesting ways over the years.  
I have been sitting here this afternoon with an increasingly sinking feeling. 
Senator, I will level with you. 
Having said that, it is more because we do not have all that many resources. 
We should look at that issue. 
It may not require a whole lot of hard research. 
I do not know. 
I can see someone here who can already tell us a lot about it. 
We will get in touch with you on that. 
It is something we will have to look at.  
Maybe this would be a future project for you.  
That is what I am saying. 
I can see one good resource right here.  
Yes, we have, and we will be there, senator. 
Our intervention will be short. 
Commissioner Phillips, I thank you very much for your availability to come to the Senate. 
Thank you, Madam Chair and honourable senators.  
I get the last word, Mr. Commissioner. 
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Report of Committee of the Whole 
Hon. Rose-Marie Losier-Cool:
The Senate adjourned until Wednesday, May 31, 2000,at 1:30 p.m.
