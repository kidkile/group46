Thursday, May 18, 2000 
The Senate met at 1:30 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Hon. William M. Kelly :
It is part of the tradition here. 
I want to explain why I was not present. 
I was one of the three senators. 
I must say a few things. 
I am not totally prepared at this point to say "goodbye." 
I am quite serious. 
I intend to do two things. 
Fifty-fifth Anniversary of VE Day 
Hon. Raymond J. Perrault :
They were Canadians of many racial descents, of many religions and philosophies. 
They came from every one of our nation's provinces and territories. 
They served with uncommon valour on land, on the seas, and in the air.  
Thousands from all of the services never returned.  
The bodies of some have never been found.  
This week marked the fifty-fifth anniversary of the liberation of the Netherlands. 
The streets were crowded with grateful Dutch citizens. 
We shall never forget." 
These fallen Canadians had the potential to do great things in this world. 
War denied them long, productive lives." 
Honourable senators, it was a marvellous and emotional week - a week never to be forgotten. 
Official Code of Conduct for Parliamentarians 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
A code of conduct would help to avoid even a potential conflict of interest.  
Since that time, nothing has happened. 
The report was not adopted in either the House of Commons or the Senate.  
Many of these provisions are rather antiquated and deal only with specific situations. 
After all, service to Parliament is a public trust. 
Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) Bill 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Bill to Amend-First Reading 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
There were 800,000 self-employed workers, and 1.5 million unemployed.  
That is a bureaucratic "derapage" of the highest order.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
For this reason, it does warrant a review. 
Some changes have already been instituted by HRDC and more are contemplated. 
I am confident that the minister responsible for HRDC is responding in an appropriate way. 
I have always assumed that our tax returns were confidential. 
This is not acceptable. 
There are 25,000 employees at Revenue Canada. 
The minister said yesterday that only six employees have access to this information.  
We must make sure that tax returns are confidential. 
This is the least we can ask.  
I shall certainly pass the views of the honourable senator along to my colleagues.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Replacement of Sea King Helicopters-Possible Purchase from Company in France 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, I have a question for my returning hero. 
Does the Leader of the Government care to try for one himself?  
I am somewhat concerned about that.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
The senator would probably share my views on that point. 
Everything they were able to do was done with great professionalism. 
Where is the flight log?  
I shall certainly forward the question along and provide a response in due course. 
I cannot comment on it one way or another.  
Replacement of Sea King Helicopters-Openness of Procurement Process 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
That is what I am talking about.  
There are various options available. 
We are not talking about buying a piece of 20-year-old technology. 
Members of the Canadian Armed Forces deserve a little bit better. 
Honourable senators, I shall make the inquiries, as I have indicated. 
The answer I bring back will depend, obviously, on the individuals who are questioned. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
That does not answer the question. 
They are still there waiting, as you well know.  
Proposal to Institute Government Responses to Petitions 
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
Honourable senators, my question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
We do not have that practice here in the Senate. 
As to what happens to them, we have no idea. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I thank the honourable senator for raising that particular issue. 
I appreciate his experience in the practices of the other place particularly. 
It sounds to me like a sensible idea and one that I shall pursue.  
Delayed Answer to Oral Question 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Possibility of Suspension of Anthrax Vaccination Program 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Michael A. Meighen on May 4, 2000) 
The license has been in effect since 1970 and has never been revoked. 
Answer to Order Paper Question Tabled 
Foreign Affairs-Human Rights in China-Government Position 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Accordingly, pursuant to rule 38, I move: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
However, leave can be given for comments.  
I should ask for that leave, honourable senators.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable Senator Cools, is this on a point of order?  
Honourable senators, you could say it is a point order. 
I am reiterating the point that I made yesterday. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable Senator Cools, I thank you for your comments. 
This, however, is not within my power to do. 
I am sure you have been heard.  
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I had concluded my remarks and had replied to several questions. 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Would Honourable Senator Murray take a question from me?  
It was my understanding that there was no legal possibility for secession. 
As for the question of clarity, that is a laudable objective. 
Of course, if it does not, then that question and all other questions are moot.  
Hon. P. Michael Pitfield :
In doing so, it has won quite a following.  
It makes very few commands. 
It is legislation that is concerned with the realization of objectives. 
It is legislation that is used to publicize party positions. 
It is legislation that calls upon people in ways that are new to them.  
It is very destructive, for example, to systems of accountability. 
I mention this not to criticize but, rather, to set the background. 
Honourable senators, all of this explains why I am drawn to support the bill. 
There is nothing wrong with that. 
People's views on the Senate vary greatly. 
There is lots of room for discussion. 
Hon. Joyce Fairbairn (The Hon. the Acting Speaker) :
I must inform the honourable senator that his speaking time has expired. 
Is leave being sought to continue?  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I wonder if we could extend the usual time frame. 
This is the last day of debate. 
Accordingly, I think we should keep track of our time. 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators, that Senator Pitfield continue for another 15 minutes?  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
The Honourable Senator Hays has suggested 15 minutes. 
Would he be prepared to follow Senator Prud'homme's suggestion?  
Let us just give Senator Pitfield as much time as he wants.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Senator Pitfield, please continue.  
At what point does the onus of leadership switch from one to the other?  
Surely, it is to defend the appointment. 
It is difficult to imagine the pressure that one can come under.  
Let's get it into someone else's hands. 
Use it to get more supporters, if you will. 
Political participation is vital to the system. 
It is very important that we recruit new members to our political parties. 
The foundation of democracy, we are taught, is participation. 
The mainstay of participation is the party. 
The party change needs to be refreshed.  
What relationship has this to your position on the Constitution?" 
It was early in the national political agenda then. 
There were all those wonderful law books, but few answers. 
Above all, it is an important element in the process of negotiating constitutional change.  
Under those circumstances, why would anyone raise the issues that I have? 
That is, to me, one of the wonders of this country. 
It has a record of contribution to our society that few other institutions can meet. 
Is someone preparing to call for a unicameral chamber in our federal system?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I propose that we extend the time for a further 15 minutes. 
Five minutes for each of them would probably be appropriate. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
We shall proceed on that basis, then. 
The government in office is not immune from making strange decisions. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I have spoken already at this stage of the debate. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable Senator Pitfield, at this stage you are offered another three minutes.  
There is a coherent and national story to our country. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
I shall read the pertinent parts without taking them out of context.  
There is no room for Bill C-20 in this declaration. 
This, the Senate must avoid. 
Support for Senator Stratton's amendment will accomplish exactly that.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion in amendment?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those honourable senators opposed to the motion in amendment please say "nay"?  
And two honourable senators having risen.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, we shall have a standing vote. 
The bells will ring for 15 minutes. 
The vote will be held at 3:30 p.m. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Motion in amendment negatived on the following division: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those honourable senators in favour of the motion please say "yea"?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those honourable senators opposed to the motion please say "nay"?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
In my opinion, the "nays" have it.  
And two honourable senators having risen .  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, pursuant to the order, we shall proceed with the vote now. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Leave having been given to proceed to Reports of Committees, Order No. 7: 
Honourable senators, I move the adoption of this report.  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Business of the Senate 
I understand this has been discussed between the house leaders.  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Air Canada Public Participation Act 
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Thank you, Your Honour.  
The proposed legislation would provide for such a process to take place.  
Consumers want the assurance that there will be fair pricing. 
Where there is significant demand, of course, some provision is to be provided.  
This legislation will be implemented progressively.  
Smaller carriers have a longer list of expectations. 
It also creates greater requirements for monitoring of the industry.  
It makes a few changes to address our new reality. 
Its focus is to promote and protect both competition and the consumer.  
The fact is, honourable senators, we have in our nation two excellent airlines. 
Just two years ago, Canadian Airlines won the same honour. 
We have two good operating entities.  
I remember some of my recent experiences with American carriers. 
Other senators have gone through similar nightmare experiences. 
We have never had that problem with our Canadian airlines.  
That is a problem that faces many airlines from time to time.  
The sooner this matter is dealt with in the committee, the better. 
It will be of benefit to be there for those talks. 
It will be very challenging to bring together two carriers of this size. 
I have one final appeal. 
On motion of Senator Forrestall, debate adjourned.

Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Canadians are cynical, and rightly so, in many cases. 
They are cynical about political finance in this country. 
Honourable senators, secrecy subverts democracy. 
I believe they have a right to know.  
Unfortunately, unlike his two rivals, Mr. Long refuses to be upfront with Canadians. 
They refuse to divulge how much money individual contributors give. 
Really, theirs is an empty promise as far as real transparency is concerned.  
Honourable senators, what Canadians want is simple. 
It is what the Honourable Senator Nolin is trying to give them. 
How much is being given? 
Are there any strings attached?  
This is the only honest thing to do.  
I believe it is just the opposite. 
It is as simple as that.  
Honourable senators, these amendments are a significant step toward political finance reform. 
In other words, they are a law unto themselves. 
We are addressing the issue publicly and honestly. 
We are trying to do something concrete to limit future abuses. 
It will be a win-win situation.  
On motion of Senator DeWare, debate adjourned.  
Motion to Receive in Committee of the Whole Adopted 
Heritage Lighthouses Protection Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
All of us in this house are captive to airline schedules.  
I want to speak to this bill to protect heritage lighthouses. 
People care deeply about the lighthouses on both coasts. 
Manned lighthouses give a profound sense of the safety net on our coasts. 
This bill accommodates the potential to develop financial partnerships.  
Time is running out as many of these lighthouses are in critical need of repair. 
Current legislation for the protection of lighthouses is inadequate. 
Other light stations have been demolished without notice.  
As others are so designated, they will also be covered. 
Fisgard, another station, was built in 1860. 
Its location was to mark the proximity to Victoria Harbour. 
This building is an architectural marvel. 
Today, the lighthouse is part of the Fort Rodd Hill National Historic Park.  
The ship hit the rocks amid terrible waves.  
Most of them died.  
In July 1906 came the inevitable collision in the Narrows. 
It was after that when Brockton Point lighthouse was improved. 
Our family maintains that Brockton Point belongs to us. 
It is located on the west shore and started operation in 1874. 
For all of his efforts, his pension was a mere $33 per month.  
On my own island of Saturna, our lighthouse does not have a heritage designation. 
The lighthouse was established in January 1888.  
It is beloved by Saturna Islanders. 
Honourable senators, I urge you to support this bill.  
On motion of Senator Carney, for Senator Callbeck, debate adjourned.  
National Archives of Canada Act 
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
Honourable senators, I am somewhat bothered by Senator Milne's motion. 
It is no longer data that one thinks will be buried forever. 
I am also concerned about the sanctity of the contract. 
We are now considering breaking that contract. 
That would be to break an ancient trust.  
Honourable senators, those are my reasons for opposing this motion.  
Would the Honourable Senator Taylor accept a question?  
The questions in the census up until 1951 were very innocuous.  
Honourable senators, I thank the honourable senator for her questions.  
After uttering an expletive, the person said, "I got the long form to fill out." 
Therefore, more complete information is being asked for today.  
In other words, the whole sanctity of the contract will be destroyed.  
The dead do not complain.  
The honourable senator is advocating a from of negative billing to census taking. 
The honourable senator is saying, "I want that information. 
My generation wants it, so we should have it." 
There is an implied contract to keep the information private.  
Honourable senators, I wish to ask a follow-up question of the Honourable Senator Taylor.  
This is a provision written into the Privacy Act. 
That is a good question, honourable senators. 
In effect, the honourable senator has turned my own argument around. 
Honourable senators, would the Honourable Senator Milne clarify the comments that she just made? 
The Hon. the Speaker :
She was addressing questions to the Honourable Senator Taylor.  
In any case, I must inform the Senate that the 15-minute period has elapsed. 
Is the Honourable Senator Taylor requesting leave to continue?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, this matter originally stood in the name of the Honourable Senator Johnson. 
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, that it remain in her name?  
Order stands in the name of Senator Johnson.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I have a request from the Honourable Senator Beaudoin to revert to Bills. 
He is now prepared to speak to Bill S-22. 
Is it your wish to proceed to that order?  
Federal Law-Civil Law Harmonization Bill 
This initiative, which has started to bear fruit today, was not born yesterday. 
Canada is a bilingual and bijural country. 
We also have the Official Languages Act. 
This is one more example of the bijural nature of Canada.  
Quebec was not covered by this general rule for obvious reasons. 
The Province of Quebec retained its civil law. 
Under the Union of 1840, uniting Quebec and Ontario, the situation remained unchanged.  
The result was turned over to the legislature on January 31, 1865. 
The original four provinces were joined by six others. 
Only the Province of Quebec is governed by a private law regime of French origin. 
The other provinces are governed by the common law system. 
Eugene Forsey was quite right when he wrote: 
This program is becoming increasingly popular.  
This is an undeniable fact. 
For the rest, the bill is essentially a housekeeping bill.  
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Honourable senators, would the honourable senator agree to answer a few questions?  
The honourable senator referred to the Civil Code of Lower Canada. 
Does the Province of Quebec intend introducing legislative amendments to its civil laws?  
The federal harmonization act meets this objective, in my opinion. 
I congratulate the federal Department of Justice for undertaking such a formidable task. 
It took some time, but it was done very well.  
I am quite optimistic. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Corrections and Conditional Release Act 
Bill to Amend-Second Reading 
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
That is an uncharitable view of any opposition to the status quo.  
If you sit on an egg long enough, it hatches.  
My point is that the mood of the public is recognized by the courts. 
After all, a few hundred years ago we used to hang people for stealing sheep. 
This bill deals with consecutive sentencing. 
That principle certainly denounces harmful conduct and deters the offender. 
It separates offenders from society. 
The only question it raises might be in connection with the rehabilitation of offenders. 
Rehabilitation after consecutive sentencing would probably be just as effective under this proposed provision. 
I cannot see how these changes would make a big difference. 
That is the whole idea behind consecutive sentencing.  
That process spanned the last election. 
They know the sentence will be served concurrently. 
This bill will not remove any discretion from the judges. 
Some people have argued that it handcuffs judges. 
I do not think that is true.  
Honourable senators, that is playing with words. 
What is imposed is a term of imprisonment of, say, 20 or 25 years. 
There is no such thing as a life sentence. 
Senator Nolin is shaking his head. 
I am glad I got his attention. 
That is a way of getting around the language.  
The other argument is relates to the principle of deterrence. 
Consecutive sentencing is used in cases of multiple rape and multiple murder. 
Nothing will deter that offender from committing offence number three, four, five, six, or seven. 
Our society has done away with capital punishment. 
Honourable senators, this is a sensible bill with a tremendous amount of logic behind it. 
In this particular case, I think she is absolutely right. 
Logic is witness to that.  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, does any other honourable senator wish to speak? 
I shall be very brief in my remarks.  
I thought it was important that that fact should be known in this chamber. 
At that time, I reserved the right to raise a point of order. 
Could the senator tell me how I have been exaggerating anything to this chamber?  
Senator Bryden responded by saying: 
He continued later in the paragraph to say: 
I invite the honourable senator to check the Hansard.  
At that point, I said to the chamber: 
I asked him twice. 
He said he did not say I was exaggerating. 
I looked at the record. 
The record clearly indicates that was the case.  
Honourable senators, the debate here has been quite rounded and sufficiently full. 
There is evidence before us all that something in respect of these questions needs correction. 
I think that debate is very important and that the debate must go on.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Poulin rose pursuant to notice of Thursday, May 11, 2000: 
That she will call the attention of the Senate to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.  
The Senate has already published two reports on this communications explosion. 
These reports are entitled "Wired to Win I" and "Wired to Win II." 
Is this not the very essence of our country? 
Canada is made up of small groups spread about over a huge area. 
Canada is not a homogeneous country. 
All Canadians want a renewed and revised CBC. 
When one leads, one needs a team, sometimes even an army. 
How many of you, honourable senators, watch and laugh with This Hour Has 22 Minutes ? 
This is what local television capacity will ensure.  
A public service, yes! 
A public service that informs, enlightens and entertains.  
Honourable senators, would the Honourable Senator Poulin accept one short question?  
If the roots are not strong, the tree will not be strong.  
I know that Senator Poulin has vast personal experience in this field. 
The Honourable Senator Fraser also has a journalistic background. 
She knows that those operations are essential. 
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
The honourable senator actually asked three questions. 
My answer is yes, absolutely. 
It is the level of ethics in journalism. 
There is the matter of certain centres where there are no other services. 
In many northern regions, there is no other service. 
On motion of Senator Bolduc, debate adjourned.

Social Affairs, Science and Technology 
On Motion No. 72: 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
Energy, the Environment and Natural Resources 
On Motion No. 72: 
Hon. Noel Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I would argue against the Senate adopting this motion. 
The subject of this study is not a government bill. 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I understand the comments made by Senator Kinsella. 
At this point, however, I am in agreement with Senator Kinsella.  
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
I must confess, honourable senators, that I went through the motions like a sleepwalker. 
I did not really think this motion through. 
Both senators have made a valid point. 
Senator Spivak and I have discussed this matter. 
We have scheduled witnesses to appear before the committee at some point in the future. 
Does the Honourable Senator Taylor wish to withdraw the motion? 
I would ask leave to withdraw the motion.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted to withdraw the motion, honourable senators?  
Is Senator Graham in agreement with that procedure?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham :
The motion was in Senator Spivak's name. 
Leave having been given to revert to Government Notices of Motions: 
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, May 30, 2000, at 2 p.m.
