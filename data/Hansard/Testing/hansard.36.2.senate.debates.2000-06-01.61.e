International Associationof Fire Fighters 
Proposal for Early Retirement 
Hon. Erminie J. Cohen :
Honourable senators, the federal government has taken a first step in the right direction. 
It is time for government to deal with this inequality.  
The Right Honourable Brian Mulroney 
Economic Record While in Office 
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
Senator Robichaud ( Saint-Louis-de-Kent ):
That's a good one! 
You believe what you read, do you?  
Have they not abolished that?  
I want this to be a short statement, honourable senators.  
Bill to Amend-First Reading 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Issues Surrounding Rural Canada 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Hon. Rose-Marie Losier-Cool :
Ambassador to the United States-Comments on Presidential Candidates Running for Election 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the minister is saying that the ambassador was discussing the candidates. 
Let me read to you a few of his comments: 
We know Vice-President Gore. 
He's a friend of Canada....  
This is what the articles quotes the ambassador as saying about Mr. Bush: 
Gov. Bush, on the other hand, doesn't know us as much.  
He went on to joke about some episodes on This Hour Has22 Minutes . 
That might be a bit more difficult for us.  
Another quote from the article reads: 
"We know Vice-President Gore. 
He's a friend of Canada," 
I rest my case.  
All of that is factual.  
What does that say? 
If that is not a preference, what is?  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I have a supplementary question for the minister.  
You employ him, do you?  
Mr. Trickey does attribute certain quotations to the ambassador. 
We can only assume he is quoting accurately. 
He says that Mr. Chretien: 
...described Mr. Bush as a "nice man"...  
He again quotes Mr. Chretien directly: 
"We will deal with whoever gets elected."  
These are the direct quotes. 
The rest, I suppose, is conclusion by Mr. Trickey in his article.  
That is an endorsement to me!  
The ambassador was clearly stating fact.  
He stated his preference.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
There is a precedence to taking sides.  
Why did the ambassador not just keep his mouth shut?  
Were there instructions, by any chance?  
Then why did he not shut up?  
The conclusion that Mr. Trickey ascribes to the quotes is a little less than innocuous. 
It sounds like an endorsation to me.  
Is that not the policy of the Government of Canada?  
That is real statesmanship.  
From whom would you rather buy a helicopter?  
Replacement of Labrador Helicopters-Success of Procurement Process 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
It is about helicopters. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I believe the honourable senator is referring to the Cormorant. 
The program is being well received by people with whom I have spoken. 
They look forward to operating that piece of equipment. 
Replacement of Sea King Helicopters 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Requests for proposals went out in the fall of 1996. 
The evaluation of bids took place in May of 1997. 
The maritime helicopter program has not even been announced yet. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Replacement of Sea King Helicopters-Operational Requirements of New Aircraft 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Perhaps that is a matter that I can discuss with the honourable senator. 
I want to ensure that I have his request properly framed.  
I think perhaps the honourable senator misunderstood me. 
It is not the answer that I want to discuss privately. 
I am prepared to give the answer here. 
Future of CFB Shilo 
I would very much like to know. 
I am sure other senators in this chamber would also like to know.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Delayed Answers to Oral Questions 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
World Trade Organization-Negotiations on Agricultural Subsidies-Government Policy 
The mandated negotiations on agriculture and services, however, are proceeding this year.  
I am actively trying to address these challenges. 
Canada will also defend our ability to continue orderly marketing systems. 
The position is posted on Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada's Web site.  
The Chairman for the negotiations will be Ambassador Jorge Voto-Bernales of Peru. 
In the Cairns Group, Canada is also actively pursuing our interests.

The Hon. the Speaker :
It is Mr. Kevin O'Brien, the Speaker of the Nunavut legislature. 
He is here as a guest of Senator Willie Adams.  
Heritage Lighthouses Protection Bill 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Does any other honourable senator wish to speak?  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
That seems simple to me. 
There are a number of ways in which one could express informed consent.  
As well, there are exceptions in this bill. 
Bill C-276 protects the basic consumer's right to choice. 
Bill C-6 has ensured this.  
This reversal of the traditional buyer-seller relationship relies on implied consent. 
It is a deceptive yet highly profitable marketing practice. 
That percentage of the population is particularly high in the over 65-year-olds. 
They are at an even greater disadvantage and risk.  
Do honourable senators think this is fair? 
In effect, they had purchased insurance by saying nothing. 
Consider GICs, and many of us carry them. 
Customers had until October 1997 to indicate their preference. 
No news meant the information would be shared.  
From banks, we expect and should get the highest of moral behaviour.  
Another industry example brought to my attention involves university students. 
They are never re-called to verify if they were satisfied. 
They are never re-called and asked if they want the service. 
They were sold these additional services through negative option marketing.  
Witness the negative option billing fiasco of January 1995. 
Some would argue that the cable companies have learned their lesson. 
You are a watchdog organization involved in consumer protection in Quebec. 
They do not comply with the Consumer Protection Act. 
She referred to the1997 launch of new speciality channels by Videotron: 
That is what she had to say. 
Obviously, the Bloc Member for Temiscamingue agrees. 
Consumers want it and have wanted it. 
It is also about ensuring that there continues to be choice in the marketplace. 
In the meantime, the businessmen line their pockets.  
It is simple, profitable and efficient, but that does not make it right. 
In fact, one can argue that negative option marketing is anti-competitive. 
It can lead to further concentration in the marketplace. 
I don't see how negative options can ever be pro-competitive. 
You never did get that choice...  
I grant that some may be fair. 
A change was made to deal with the evolution of electronic commerce. 
Changes were made, but the key elements of consumer protection have remained intact. 
Honourable senators, this bill would amend the Competition Act. 
It would not prevent an increase in bank service fees. 
I refer to both Rogers and Cogeco.  
Express consent can be given in many forms. 
The bill is flexible on this point.  
In total, the big banks have more than20 million customers, we are told. 
It does not sound like plenty of competition to me. 
With only six banks for 20 million customers, how much competition actually exists? 
On motion of Senator DeWare, for Senator Eyton, debate adjourned.  
Leave having been given to revert to Government Notices of Motions: 
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, June 6, 2000, at 2 p.m.
