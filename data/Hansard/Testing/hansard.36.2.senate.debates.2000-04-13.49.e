Thursday, April 13, 2000 
The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Hon. Norman K. Atkins :
In the early 1960s, the oral health problems of Canadians were tremendous. 
As well, there was less public awareness of and interest in oral health. 
The Importance of Education to Youth 
Hon. Rose-Marie Losier-Cool :
I see these young people are in the gallery.  
I would like to comment briefly on this event. 
Today, some 125 million children are not in school. 
Most of them are girls. 
There is a solution. 
Parkinson's Disease Awareness Month 
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson :
It is important to note that Parkinson's disease is not a fatal illness. 
Hon. Michael A. Meighen :
It is astonishing to realize the number of people who suffer this disease. 
Extraordinary Canadians have been struck down by this persistent disease. 
In 1980, Terry started his Marathon of Hope. 
Can you believe, honourable senators, that 20 years have already passed? 
Terry Fox is legendary in our country. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
I know that several members in this house were there that day.  
Hon. Erminie J. Cohen :
Many regions in our province have mainly francophone residents. 
This contest, called "Actifs et fiers...En 
Forty-five French organizations participated in this inaugural event. 
...this award is one the entire community may be proud of.  
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Our legal system is predominantly an adversarial system. 
As that great American legal scholar, Jerome Frank, stated: 
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
They should have been called the "old boys' club". 
There were four women, one each from Canada, the United States, Scotland and Sweden. 
I was pleased to be the Canadian delegate who attended those meetings.  
We started in 1975 with a meeting in Vancouver. 
Therefore, we went to Karlstad, Sweden, and bent their arm again. 
The first women's championship took place in Scotland in 1978. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I should like to introduce to you a distinguished visitor in our gallery. 
It is the Honourable Peter Irniq, Commissioner of Nunavut.  
Honourable senators, I would like to congratulate the new Commissioner of Nunavut. 
Peter Irniq is a good friend of mine.  
You have influence already.  
The translation is "Nunavut Our Strength".  
Privileges, Standing Rules and Orders 
Fourth Report of Committee Presented and Printed 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Fifth Report of Committee Presented and Printed 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Thursday, April 13, 2000 
The Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has the honour to present its 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Possibility of Recall from Trip to Middle East 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, my question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
Paul Martin won't get him!  
Send a Sea King for him!  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Replacement of Sea King Helicopters 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
The Canadian Sea Kings sat inoperable. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Some may debate whether they have gone beyond that. 
The same one the government cancelled?  
Honourable senators, my question is very serious. 
Must we wait until the ultimate tragedy takes place before we do the simple thing? 
That is what the government has done. 
They should have been airborne by now. 
We will have new submarines.  
We will also have new helicopters for search and rescue. 
There is no question that this piece of equipment has to be replaced. 
We have been assured by senior military personnel of its operational capability. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I have a supplementary question. 
In 1994. You were not there.  
At the time, the view certainly was that there would be a saving. 
Honourable senators, this question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Possibility of Suspension of Anthrax Vaccination Program 
Hon. Michael A. Meighen :
Honourable senators, my question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
This summer, the HMCS Calgary will go to the Persian Gulf. 
Will personnel on the Calgary be vaccinated against anthrax? 
If so, where will the vaccine come from? 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I thank the honourable senator for raising this issue. 
I do not have the specific details of the program for those particular service people. 
The government will ensure that whatever health precautions are necessary will be put into effect. 
Agriculture and Agri-Food 
Flooding Problem in Manitoba and Saskatchewan-Possibility of Assistance 
Honourable senators, my question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
The estimated costs are $43 million.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I will pass that information on and see if I can have it verified. 
I certainly have no problem asking. 
If he does have those figures, I will confirm them for the honourable senator.  
Yet we have rejection letters coming a month later. 
Why should I have to do that? 
Why should any senator have to do that?  
We have concerns for those farmers. 
They are legitimate concerns. 
It proves once again the minister just does not seem to care.  
I will refer to an article from today's Leader-Post of Regina.  
Can you confirm that again?  
They don't seem to want to declare the area a disaster. 
...That was kind of another slap in the face. 
That is how the people feel down in that part of the world.  
In fact, the assistance in the tabled information was made available. 
I can only repeat the information that I gave to the honourable senator previously.  
They fall between the cracks again.  
Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
Auditor General's Report-Substandard Quality of Native Education 
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
Honourable senators, my question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Is the government leader aware of that?  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
How many dollars have been allocated?  
Did the government leader read the Auditor General's report?  
Delayed Answers to Oral Questions 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
(Response to question raised by Hon. Donald H. Oliver on December 14, 1999) 
The 1997 paper, Securing the Canada Pension Plan:
The pilot project will be evaluated for relevance to other jurisdictions.  
Millennium Scholarship Foundation-Disbursement of Scholarships 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Ethel Cochrane on February 10, 2000) 
Students will clearly be receiving the bulk of the Foundation's funds.  
A key reason for non-acceptance was the taxation of scholarships.  
(Response to question raised by Hon. Ethel Cochrane on February 23, 2000) 
In its first year of operations, the Foundation accomplished a great deal. 
Report on Restructuring Reserves-Viability of Militia 
(Response to question raised by Hon. J. Michael Forrestall on March 28, 2000) 
(Response to question raised by Hon. J. Michael Forrestall on March 29, 2000) 
Thirteen lives were saved because the Canadian Forces was able to respond quickly and effectively. 
One of the Sea Kings did join the search operation the next morning. 
Business of the Senate 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Nisga'a Final Agreement Bill 
The amended Section 3 will therefore read: 
The amended Section 27 will therefore read: 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
I listened to a number of the hearings and have read many of the transcripts. 
Those last few words are absolutely correct. 
Later, he went on to say: 
I underline the word "might".  
- already recognize that right.  
A little later, in speaking of the Charlottetown accord, he said: 
That committee was chaired by our former colleague the Honourable Senator Joan Neiman.  
This special committee reported in October 1983. 
I detect the same pattern here. 
It will discourage entering into similar agreements with other aboriginal nations. 
Perhaps the time is right to consider the idea.  
Bill C-9 is a landmark bill. 
The principle of Bill C-9 is not being challenged - far from it. 
We only wish it were done in proper form. 
I hope that the Senate, in its sober second thought, will act accordingly.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those honourable senators opposed please say "nay"?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
In my opinion, the "nays" have it.  
And two honourable senators having risen.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
We will have a standing vote. 
There will be a 15-minute bell.  
However, there will be no further 15-minute bells. 
The vote will take place at 3:30.  
Motion in amendment of the Honourable Senator St. Germain negatived on the following division: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, there are two further amendments. 
If not, we will proceed with the further amendments.  
The amended Section 3 will therefore read: 
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion in amendment?  
Will those in favour of the amendment, please say "yea"?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those opposed to the amendment, please by "nay"?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
In my opinion, the "nays" have it.  
And two honourable senators having risen.  
Motion in amendment of the Honourable Senator Sparrow negatived on the following division: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The numbers will be the same, then.  
The amended Section 27 will therefore read: 
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion in amendment?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
In my opinion, the "nays" have it.  
And two honourable senators having risen.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
We will proceed with a recorded vote immediately, as per agreement.  
Motion in amendment of the Honourable Senator Sparrow negatived on the following division: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, we are back to the main motion. 
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
In my opinion the "yeas" have it.  
And two honourable senators having risen.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
We will have a standing vote immediately, as per agreement.  
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed on the following division: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Are you rising on a point of order, Senator Carney?  
Honourable senators, we have the right, on abstention, to stand. 
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
They asked me to do what I did here today. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Honourable senators, I also rise on the fact that I abstained. 
I reiterate what I said yesterday:
Secretary to the Governor General 
The Speaker of the Senate 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I rise on a point of order:
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
You didn't have a Sea King to send for him!  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The matter is closed.  
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the request for leave was for how long?  
A short period of time.  
Your Honour, must I state a condition? 
I am just asking for leave.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable Senator Nolin, you need not make any statement. 
Remember, however, that it is then open for someone to refuse leave. 
That is a risk that you take.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will he be more than an hour? 
I think that is a fair question.  
I know that His Honour is considering a ruling. 
How long does the honourable senator want?  
In the meantime, I shall exceed the 15 minutes provided in the rules. 
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
Honourable senators, on a point order:
I agree with my deputy house leader. 
However, I believe that, at this stage, we need not anticipate. 
It could well be that the senator might terminate his speech in 15 minutes. 
In 15 minutes, put the question.  
That is exactly right.  
Honourable senators, I have asked for leave and I am waiting for the answer.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Does Senator Gauthier wish to speak?  
Hon. Jean-Robert Gauthier :
It depends on the questions that will be put to me.  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Please proceed, Honourable Senator Nolin.  
Unfortunately, this is not the case. 
This is what is commonly known as Plan B. 
Unfortunately, the government leader never gave a clear answer to the question.  
...limited to the identification of the relevant aspects of the Constitution in their broadest sense.  
There is a distinction to be made between a judgment and a reference. 
Neither Quebec nor the rest of Canada is forced to comply with our opinion. 
If it were a judgment, it would be binding.  
It reads, and I quote: 
The second theory is that of national emergency. 
This is limited power and is restricted to a period of time.  
Finally, there is the theory of residual power. 
Quebecers have the right to decide their own future. 
After much reading and many days of thinking, I find it difficult to say. 
I would have liked to be able to give an answer. 
Guy Lachapelle said, and I quote: 
Federally, political action does not always take the form of legislative measures. 
That brings me to two questions. 
That included the determination of the terms of consultation. 
At the moment, the Quebec Referendum Act provides for consultative referendums. 
This rule was observed in the 1980 and 1995 referendums.  
In this regard, the provisions of clauses 1 and 2 of this bill are eloquent. 
A little further along he added: 
Under our system, each level of government is deemed sovereign within its own jurisdiction...The 
Personally, I do not share his optimism. 
It cannot help but contribute to a false sense of security. 
Let us begin with the wording of the question. 
It would be more than enough for Ottawa to express its reservations about the question. 
However, it has always used the expression "clear majority". 
The British government decided this required a referendum by the Scots. 
It had recognized a simple majority as acceptable in determining the outcome of the vote. 
Moreover, as Gordon Gibson said to the committee: 
At any rate, it did not prevent them from seceding!  
Officially, Ottawa seems to recognize the prerogatives of the National Assembly. 
The public must be aware of this.  
Seventy-one per cent of Quebecers have had enough of the constitutional wrangling. 
I do not think it will.  
We tried to keep Canada together. 
That is not how things work in the real world. 
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
Senators of differing persuasions approved the principle of the bill at that time. 
The Legal and Constitutional Basis." 
It does not lie in the provinces, except as a power to enforce.  
To many Canadians, this is a tragic situation because the need is great. 
Many nurses have agonized over this dilemma. 
They claim that they have been taken for granted.  
Second, unlike doctors, nurses are employees of hospitals. 
This greatly inhibits their chances of promotion.  
The fifth point on the nurses' lists is this:
This is a matter of human rights. 
I am not arguing the other case.  
They took their complaint to the Ontario Human Rights Commission. 
It violates their human rights. 
Fifth, some medical facilities have themselves acknowledged that nurses possess conscience rights. 
Why have these laws and policy statements not been sufficient?  
Let's start with the Charter. 
The Charter is, therefore, unable to help nurses in their present plight.  
Unfortunately they are also insufficient. 
They are ineffective at preventing people from losing their jobs. 
As a result, many injustices go completely unnoticed by the commission. 
The problem here is that so few hospitals have such statements. 
Without pressure perhaps it would never have acted. 
These are words from an international document.  
The first three paragraphs of Article 18 are worthy of citation: 
Such a limit of his religious freedom in the circumstances is deemed a reasonable limit. 
Honourable senators, I invite your support for Bill S-11. 
On motion of Senator Cools, debate adjourned.  
Corrections and Conditional Release Act 
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Order Stands 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, last Tuesday, during his remarks - 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, I wish to inform the Senate that if Senator Cools speaks - 
It is a point of order. 
I am asking the Senate for leave to defer.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
What are you asking from the Senate, Honourable Senator Cools?  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Therefore, this order will remain standing in the name of Honourable Senator Taylor.  
A Bill to Change the Names of Certain Electoral Districts 
Second Reading-Order Stands 
The sponsor of the bill is actually Senator Rompkey. 
Therefore, I should like the item to stand in his name.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration 
Eighth Report of Committee Adopted 
Honourable senators, the credit for this initiative goes to Senator Brenda Robertson. 
Despite our attempts to give him enhanced and advanced audio, we failed. 
This, honourable senators, is the nub of the entire issue surrounding accessibility. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Report of Foreign Affairs Committee on Study 
How can we expand our manoeuvring room? 
All this means that the European political landscape is changing noticeably every year.  
We have seen this in Canada. 
Canadian companies have been in the same situation.  
What does all this mean for Canada? 
The situation is changing, and we must be aware of it.  
That is a huge amount, and hurts us. 
Honourable senators, these are my thoughts as we table our report.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall rose pursuant to notice of April 5, 2000: 
When Senator Roche addressed us, he said: 
Reducing the Political Value of Nuclear Weapons for the Twenty-First Century."  
What is National Missile Defence? 
Why is it important? 
Does it violate the ABM Treaty? 
If so, does this destabilize deterrence? 
What are Canada's interests in National Missile Defence? 
What should Canada do to try to address them?  
They are not armed. 
Thirty states now have ballistic missiles, and 70 have cruise missiles. 
Each threat calls for different counter-measures. 
The critics should stop mixing apples and oranges.  
Russia's had its ABM system around Moscow for years. 
The ABM Treaty allows theatre level systems but not strategic systems.  
However, that did not happen. 
Does NMD stabilize deterrence? 
Deterrence is based upon a premise of rationality. 
It never was intended for that purpose. 
Thus, National Missile Defence is not even in this deterrence equation. 
This situation changes every day. 
The weapons are in either the deployment phase or in the building phase now. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I should like a few more minutes.  
How long does the Honourable Senator Forrestall think he will be?  
Not more than seven or eight minutes, and certainly not an hour.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators, to allow Senator Forrestall to continue?  
Japan could do so very rapidly. 
The Non-Proliferation Treaty is, in reality, dead. 
Let us not be deluded, honourable senators. 
King made sure that it was just large enough to keep the Americans happy. 
We already do not carry our fair share of the defence burden. 
It is not a lot of fun.  
Otherwise, we are telling a sovereign state how to make its defences. 
The concept was suicidal, and we all knew it. 
How do we break the deadlock? 
Let us make no mistake. 
The threat was and continues to be offensive nuclear weapons. 
That is exactly what the non-nuclear National Missile Defence system is all about. 
Thank you for your indulgence, honourable senators.  
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
Honourable senators, I have a couple of short questions of clarification. 
Senator Forrestall uses the two words. 
One is a high-altitude system; the other is a marine-based system. 
That is the context. 
It sure does not need nuclear detonation to render the system ineffective. 
That basically is the difference.  
On motion of Senator Taylor, debate adjourned.  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.  
The House of Commons withdrew.  
Her Excellency the Governor General was pleased to retire.  
The sitting of the Senate was resumed.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, May 2, 2000, at 2 p.m.
