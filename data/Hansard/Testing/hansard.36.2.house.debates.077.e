EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 77 
Monday, April 3, 2000 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I will be speaking in lieu of my colleague from Churchill River.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Peter Stoffer (for Mr. Rick Laliberte) moved: 
At that time the motion was called Motion No. 292. 
Canada is blessed with tremendous natural gas resources. 
How quickly our resource priorities change. 
The federal government is out of the megaproject business, as Liberal members have stated.  
Where natural gas is distributed, added economic opportunities follow. 
We could have done much better and followed other examples around the world. 
Gas could have been distributed in Nova Scotia as well. 
Those lines are all headed south. 
Fuel costs are some of the highest costs which those businesses must incur.  
Why are health care costs continuing to skyrocket? 
Environmental factors in human health are no longer denied. 
National perspective and true leadership are not bad things. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support Motion No. 298.  
We should do the same thing for energy efficient initiatives. 
Mr. Brent St. Denis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
It is this type of approach that is behind the natural gas success story. 
This policy has not resulted in a stalled natural gas industry. 
Consider the Sable offshore energy project to which the member referred. 
Provincial regulators set financial tests for new projects. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Canadian Alliance):
I appreciate what his colleague had to say as well.  
There is one advantage of being a little older. 
My colleague in his motion is referring to unserviced regions. 
They were coming north into the oil fields in my constituency. 
It was taking carbon dioxide gas and under pressure making it a liquid. 
There was co-operation between two companies and two countries.  
There were piles of steel pipe, grey in colour. 
There was no further development. 
The reason was that on each pipe 51 feet by 12 inches was indicated. 
Otherwise the cost to go through rocky terrain would be almost prohibitive.  
I am not sure if that is possible. 
Can we imagine what it would be like and the cost to do so? 
I am not saying it would be impossible.  
We have to look at going into the north in another way. 
It sounds like it is easy to accomplish. 
If we asked the federal government to sponsor it, what would we do? 
Would we go back to the provinces where the utilities remain with them?  
We would have to make sure there was some way. 
It would be extremely expensive.  
It had all these things going on without environment approval. 
For this reason and many others I cannot support the motion. 
We are not ready for it. 
I do not think the groundwork has been done. 
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
Canada's natural gas reserves are immense. 
They are beyond anyone's imagination. 
We are talking 500 to 600 trillion cubic metres. 
This is an important factor in the issue. 
There is nothing wrong with that.  
That is not what the government does. 
It reacts to a given situation, but advances nothing. 
They do not enter into discussion''. 
Ships will continue to travel it. 
The prevailing winds will continue to blow in the same direction.  
Quebec is well intentioned. 
There will be international agreements. 
We in the Bloc Quebecois are in agreement. 
The NDP's suggestion is an excellent one. 
I have seen this. 
They thought it was terrible, but it was something that happened.  
The government has done nothing about this. 
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
People on fixed incomes have had to make choices between food and heat. 
Governments seem to have their hands tied. 
Many people on fixed on incomes have no extra money. 
We certainly support the motion.  
The major and small centres in New England have natural gas. 
It impacts on employment. 
It means zero growth. 
It is more than just the economic issue here. 
It is the standard of living. 
It is the way of life. 
It is the culture. 
Therefore we support this motion.  
We have seen it go one way and then the other. 
We have to be able to compete on a level playing field with them. 
It only makes sense.  
There is another benefit of this proposal. 
It could use natural gas to offset those energy costs. 
That again would save taxpayers. 
There were several deep coal mines in Springhill. 
Those coal mines are now filled with hot water. 
It would help economic development. 
It would definitely bring jobs to that area.  
We have just gone through this urgent situation this morning. 
On the way to the airport I checked the price of gas. 
Gas is down five cents a litre this morning from what it was on Friday. 
That instability is extremely difficult for people to handle.  
Those residents are going to have to pay higher energy costs. 
Completely aside from the economic issues are our Kyoto commitments. 
Projections are that instead of improving we are getting worse. 
Natural gas delivered to all communities in our country would help address those concerns. 
We will now have to reverse our direction even more than before to catch up.  
It is spending hundreds of millions of dollars because of environmental concerns. 
We will all be winners if this bill goes through.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Premier Mike Harris is finally back to work in Ontario. 
Why should we be optimistic about our future in this area? 
We really should be and we must be. 
The reason is quite simple. 
We should think about that because it really is important. 
I think we have seen over time that the system works well in this area.  
We have growing markets and a favourable public policy framework.  
Needless to say, natural gas fits that bill.  
As a former chairman of Kitchener-Wilmot Hydro, I welcome that. 
I sat on the board for 10 years. 
We are selling more natural gas to U.S. markets than ever before.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
MODERNIZATION OF BENEFITS AND OBLIGATIONS ACT 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The other motions will be grouped for debate as follows: 
Motions Nos. 14, 91, and 117 to 133.  
The voting patterns for the motions within each group are available at the table. 
The Chair will remind the House of each pattern at the time of voting.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP) moved: 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance) moved: 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order with respect to Motion No. 3. 
Marleau and Montpetit at page 668 reads: 
Beauchesne's describes this exception to the rule on page 212 as ``special circumstances''.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I rise on this point of order. 
As the mover of Motion No. 3, I want to make two points.  
The standing orders are very clear. 
The practice in Beauchesne's as well as our other guides are clear. 
That motion would amend certain words in clause 1.1. 
Perhaps the member might want to explain why the double standard.  
Madam Speaker, I rise on the same point of order. 
I do not want to engage in debate with the member for Burnaby-Douglas. 
With regard to Motion No. 4 it is not in the same form. 
It is a different motion than the one submitted by the member for Elk Island. 
I invite the member for Burnaby-Douglas to have a look at it. 
Obviously there is a redundancy when we do that. 
Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I rise on the same point of order. 
I have some further citations to perhaps help the Chair. 
In this case the hon. member for Burnaby-Douglas was a member of the committee. 
His motion was dealt with by the committee. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I think the Chair has heard enough arguments on this point of order. 
Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.) moved: 
That Bill C-23, in Clause 2, be amended 
( a ) by replacing line 14 on page 1 with the following: 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance) moved: 
````spouse'' means either of a man or a woman who has entered into a marriage.''  
````spouse'' means either of a man or a woman who has entered into a marriage.''  
``spouse'' means either of a man or a woman who has entered into a marriage.''  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Are we talking about all the motions in Group No. 1?  
I would suggest that you ask the House for consent to do that. 
In that way we would perhaps save considerable time in the House.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there agreement of the House to proceed in such a fashion?  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance) moved: 
``spouse'' means either of a man or a woman who has entered into a marriage.''  
``spouse'' means either of a man or a woman who has entered into a marriage.''  
``spouse'' means either of a man or a woman who has entered into a marriage.''  
````spouse'' means either of a man or a woman who has entered into a marriage.''  
````spouse'' means either of a man or a woman who has entered into a marriage.''  
``spouse'' means either of a man or a woman who has entered into a marriage.''  
That Bill C-23, in Clause 72, be amended 
( a ) by replacing line 18 on page 39 with the following: 
(1) In subsections 10(1) and 11(1), ``com-'' 
( b ) by adding after line 22 on page 39 the following: 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance) moved:

``( c ) the spouse of the employee.''  
````spouse'' means either of a man or a woman who has entered into a marriage;''

For the purposes of subsection (1.1),

````spouse'' means either of a man or a woman who has entered into a marriage.''

That Bill C-23 be amended by deleting Clause 192.  
````spouse'' means either of a man or a woman who has entered into a marriage;'' 
````spouse'' means either of a man or a woman who has entered into a marriage.''  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance) moved: 
(2) The definitions ``joint and survivor'' 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance) moved: 
````spouse'' means either of a man or a woman who has entered into a marriage.''  
````spouse'' means either of a man or a woman who has entered into a marriage;'' 
````spouse'' means either of a man or a woman who has entered into a marriage;''

````spouse'' means either of a man or a woman who has entered into a marriage;'' 
````spouse'' means either of a man or a woman who has entered into a marriage.''  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
I see the member for Scarborough Centre here. 
He has been very clear. 
He does not believe in equality. 
I got a press release from the member for Yorkton-Melville. 
I am sorry, it is the Canadian Alliance now. 
The member for St. Paul's spoke eloquently. 
Let us be clear what this is about. 
That was the definition of marriage then.  
Marriage was for life. 
We know that many argued that divorce would somehow be the end of marriage. 
We have heard since then other alleged threats to marriage, such as contraception. 
I have to ask, what is the threat? 
I do not think so. 
The government did not make any meaningful attempt to defend it in committee.  
The Netherlands is moving ahead.  
Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):
Clearly this bill has something to do with marriage. 
What has the government done in response to that? 
It has done so, I would say, a bit late, but better late than never.  
What has the government done? 
It has not done anything radical. 
It has not done anything unusual. 
My amendment is a very specific amendment. 
I guess we are talking technicalities. 
This is the way I view it. 
Bill C-23 is an omnibus bill. 
In effect, therefore, the function of Bill C-23 will have been completed. 
All of the parts of Bill C-23 deal with other acts. 
They command that those other acts be amended. 
That ghost law will remain a law but will soon be forgotten. 
It will not be reproduced in the revised statutes of Canada. 
Otherwise, it would be out of sight, out of mind.  
He used his usual pejorative words such as ``dinosaurs'' and ``unholy alliance''. 
The shame is threefold.  
Indeed, they make it impossible for us to enjoy the practice of democracy.  
This is not an accident. 
Then they need not debate the issues. 
It has been since the time of Socrates. 
Enough of this name calling. 
Let us just deal with the issues.  
That definition is the common law of Canada. 
It is the position of the Government of Canada. 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, what does Bill C-23 do? 
She did mention one, that married couples still have to get divorced. 
I do not know what people in same sex relationships do. 
Perhaps they walk out the door when it is over. 
It is not clear from the bill.  
Public pressure against the bill has been enormous. 
It is no wonder that the people of Canada are reacting. 
They said that but they have done just the opposite.  
Do not be deceived. 
It will not appear in Canadian law.  
Some previous case law was also considered.  
For goodness' sake, why is the Liberal government not doing it?  
It does not really achieve anything. 
I will quote again from this leading legal expert: 
It simply says a conjugal relationship.  
A conjugal relationship implies that. 
That is what the dictionary says. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
That is a lot. 
What does this bill propose? 
A coalition was formed at the initiative of the group known as EGALE. 
It affects employment insurance. 
The bill deals, of course, with income tax. 
This bill also amends a very important tool, namely the Criminal Code. 
Incidentally, this bill has nothing at all to do with marriage. 
Because adoption does not come under federal jurisdiction, it is provincial. 
Let us look briefly at the reality of a conjugal relationship. 
The bill we have before us today is an omnibus bill. 
We keep saying that Bill C-23 is not about marriage. 
Notwithstanding, I will address some of the concerns expressed.  
The legal definition of marriage in Canada is already clear in law. 
It has been successfully defended and upheld by the courts.  
This bill is not about marriage. 
This amendment reflects this fact. 
This amendment will not change the law or the legal status of marriage. 
These distinctions will be maintained in federal law.  
At the federal level this period of cohabitation is one year.  
Common law relationships, however, as a fact based relationship, end on separation. 
These provisions do not apply to separated former common law partners.  
Bill C-23 does this.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Canadian Alliance):
Some might wonder what I mean by this term. 
Let us take a look at this philosophical stance. 
Many espouse to this stance without understanding that they themselves hold to this belief. 
Many people would say ``Yes, this is how I confront issues when confronted with issues''. 
That is all fine and good. 
``Yes there are no absolutes,'' claims the relativist. 
The house of cards argument falls in on itself. 
Should not anyone be free to choose their own perspective?  
Some have tried to make Bill C-23 a religious issue. 
I would say that it is this philosophical divide that crosses religious boundaries. 
I would not include myself in that category. 
Bill C-23 presents an issue before us that is not a religious divide. 
It is something I call the language game. 
Let us talk about this language game being employed by the government. 
These can cause a great deal of personal hardship and even economic ruin. 
Redefining terms is another plank used in the language game. 
On this particular issue, this is very clear.  
Who would be against equality? 
Who would possibly want to be perceived as anything but tolerant? 
Who could disagree with either of these statements?  
Let us look at the term tolerance. 
What does the word actually mean in light of public policy? 
What does the government call tolerance? 
What does the justice minister call tolerance? 
What does she mean by the words tolerance and equality? 
That is the first part of tolerance.  
Those who oppose it, oppose it on such. 
It goes down the wrong road and Canadians should be aware of that.  
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Canadian Alliance):
Madam Speaker, we have before us today Bill C-23. 
The gay and lesbian political groups are happy. 
The court was wrong to read that in at section 15(2) of the charter.  
The bill is summarized as follows on the second page of the bill: 
In that section it says: 
There is also the definition in Black's dictionary of the word ``consortium''. 
Consequently, there was no basic political consent in this country to do this.  
They said at the justice committee: 
We need to build community consensus on these things. 
Parties need to declare during elections these kinds of matters and seek mandates. 
No one should be discriminated against in basic human rights. 
There has been a deliberate confusion between rights and benefits. 
Common law status will now have wide interpretation. 
The change to one year will have unforeseen social effects. 
Therefore, this amendment does not truly preserve the traditional concept of marriage in legislation. 
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Bill C-23 hits us hard in the gut. 
As I can see, their consciences are likely to have the upper hand.  
This bill is not easy. 
People ask us ``Why talk about gays and lesbians?'' 
Who does not know people who are gay or lesbian? 
That is a bit backward. 
There is the marriage issue''.  
Why do I say that? 
The concept of distinct society was included in a preamble. 
It was a rule of interpretation. 
Personally, I am very, very pleased with that rule.  
Personally, I will support the bill. 
The answer is no.  
I told them ``It is an omnibus bill''. 
This makes Bill C-23 an absolutely incredible document.  
I had discussions with people in my riding. 
Some people ask many more questions than others. 
We would tell them ``What are you doing? 
You are living in sin. 
Finally, things have evolved. 
Do we provide the same benefits? 
I was asked how I saw it? 
When I was a teenager, people would ask me what I wanted. 
Back then, I said that I wanted to get married and have children. 
That was what I wanted. 
I did not get married and I have a little boy of four. 
I do not feel excluded from society in any way. 
I am a practising Catholic and I do not feel excluded.  
What concerns them is faith, religion. 
For them, marriage continues to be the union of a man and a woman. 
That does not change. 
It is the same way within the Progressive Conservative Party.  
That is all very well, but who am I to judge?  
This is a reality. 
Some will say that being gay or lesbian is not normal. 
I do not have the answer. 
Has it been seen? 
I have seen not such thing. 
Have hon. members seen signs proclaiming ``We are anti-gay. 
We are against lesbians''? 
There is some openness in this country. 
We know that members of the Reform Party are not keen on the supreme court. 
They could have taken more time to consult the- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Canadian Alliance):
That will be the whole point of my speech. 
I ask him too to look at reality.  
That is my theme today. 
This is not just an issue of personal conscience. 
It is the children who are hurt. 
Those are the consequences.  
Solid homes and families build a strong nation. 
A solid home and family is built on a firm foundation. 
That firm foundation is a lifelong marriage commitment. 
It is not a sexual relationship. 
That is the big flaw with Bill C-23.  
That is not the same as a marriage relationship. 
We have done some in-depth research on this. 
Because Bill C-23 is an omnibus bill. 
It amends 68 other pieces of legislation. 
That is the great flaw with this legislation.  
We must preserve the marriage commitment for the sake of our children. 
Let us never forget that.  
Benefits should never be based on a sexual relationship either. 
This bill should not undermine the strength of the family home. 
Those incentives should promote stable family relationships where children are nurtured and developed. 
The state needs to promote the commitment, not the sexual act.  
Without exception the criticism I received did not counter my arguments. 
It only called me names. 
Pinning labels on those who disagree is hardly legitimate debate.  
Today one can receive benefits from the federal government if one practises it. 
Here is another aside. 
The experience I have had in dealing with children is underscored by Statistics Canada data. 
I would now like to go through that. 
Here are some of the startling facts he found published in Statistics Canada data.  
Sixty per cent of domestic violence occurs in common law marriages. 
Forty percent of common law relationships end before marriage. 
How do these family breakups affect children? 
They are twice as likely to drop out of school. 
Illegal drug use is greater. 
They are nearly six times more likely to get in trouble with the law. 
Four out of every five convicts come from broken homes.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson:
It is a disgrace.  
I cannot force the government to do anything. 
It simply invokes closure- 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson:
Is this the new Canadian Alliance?  
The hon. member has two minutes left.  
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your intervention.  
I cannot force the government to do anything. 
It will simply invoke closure on a bill and will ram it through. 
The power will rest with the people. 
I have one more point. 
With all the interruptions I have had, I did not get through my speech. 
I would like to read a quotation from barrister and solicitor, Iain Benson. 
I cannot finish the rest. 
Maybe I will be able to finish it at a later time.  
The Montreal Gazette agreed.

This is an obvious double standard. 
I ask hon. members to stay away from that word.  
Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):
I am pleased to offer congratulations to Donald Sutherland and Neil Young. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
This government is leaning more and more to the right.  
GRANDS PRIX TOURISM AWARDS GALA 
Mr. Marcel Proulx (Hull-Aylmer, Lib.):
I congratulate the Outaouais Tourist Association for its excellent work.  
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Canadian Alliance):
Let us consider the following facts. 
It is unfortunate the minister lacks a consistent policy on the issue. 
CANADIAN CONSERVATIVE REFORM ALLIANCE 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):
I wish to suggest otherwise. 
At least one thing has changed. 
The Reform Party used to advocate the abolition of the Official Languages Act. 
Not so the Alliance. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
People's homes depend on it.  
Homeowners are very disillusioned. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
That statement is rather astounding, if not downright demagogic.  
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
On behalf of us all, I salute him and I thank him.  
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, PC):
I know the hours are countless.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, Canada's health care system is in crisis. 
What is the Prime Minister's answer? 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I think it was a very good investment.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, he does know how to mince it up.  
Why does he care so little about the health of Canadians?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, that includes the tax points. 
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
In 1993 the government put in $18.8 billion. 
It then went down to $12.5 billion. 
Now it is back up to $14.4 billion. 
That kind of math is this government's track record.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
This is the only government program where the money has been more than re-established. 
Because we have made cuts, the provinces have benefited a lot. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
The hon. member for Red Deer.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):
The question is very, very simple:
Why does the government choose grants rather than health care?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is a gulf between that party and this government. 
They are out of touch. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
There are 78 people working at Placeteco with a bright future.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
The government invested $1.2 million to eliminate three jobs.  
That takes the cake.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, when the grant was approved there were 64 people working at Placeteco. 
The company had some problems and faced bankruptcy. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
My question is for the President of Treasury Board. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the reply by the President of the Treasury Board.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Everything was above-board.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Talk about the pot calling the kettle black. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The hon. leader of the New Democratic Party.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, one thing that is very useful is the ineptitude of the NDP. 
It will help us in the next election.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
It is a monopoly, or almost.  
On the subject of performance, last week we raised a problem. 
Could the President of the Treasury Board explain the performance?  
The hon. member for Fraser Valley.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, at least now it is out in the open. 
On the weekend the Prime Minister was singing the praises of what? 
And David Dingwall went on to say that ACOA was an unmitigated disaster. 
What were they worried about? 
They were worried about patronage.  
Those members have said no to the unemployed in Cape Breton. 
They have said no to assistance for farmers, fishermen and miners. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):
Or perhaps he wants to be the godfather of Atlantic Canada. 
We can read between the lines pretty easily. 
That party says no to the poor and the unemployed. 
It does not even say, ``Let them eat cake''. 
It says, ``Let them starve''.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Canadian Alliance):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Canadian Alliance):
Today in the House he referred to this as government money. 
I have news for the Prime Minister. 
This is not the government's money. 
It is Canadians' money and they worked darn hard for it too. 
Yet we saw the Prime Minister milk this latest grant for all it was worth.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
This announcement today is a good first step in providing that chance''. 
This is from the premier of Nova Scotia, Premier John Hamm.  
Someone else said, ``I am a happy man today. 
Cape Breton really needs this. 
I have nothing bad to say''. 
The hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Recent price hikes have pushed these revenues even higher.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The other taxes remain the same.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, there was no mention of that. 
So, it has the money to take action immediately.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, that is simply not the case. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):
Rather obviously, that simply is not the case.  
The minister has had a long time to address these problems. 
People in HRDC have known about them for many months. 
Treasury Board is supposed to oversee the financial control of government money.  
They are an essential feature of any good management program.  
There is every reason to believe that we will correct the existing problems.  
CLONING OF HUMAN EMBRYOS 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We will be in a position to act after these consultations have been completed.  
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and Youth), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is a very positive suggestion by the hon. member for Ottawa Centre.  
We have to recognize the positive contribution made to this country by youth. 
These are challenges that youth face which we have to assist them with.  
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Canadian Alliance):
This is precisely what is currently going on at Human Resources Development Canada.  
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Canadian Alliance):
Why did the minister allow it to occur?  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
The minister had an opportunity to walk the talk. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
I want to be very specific. 
We are dealing with a crucial moment in the history of health care. 
We all acknowledge that the health minister's strategy failed. 
The federal government's plan fell apart. 
We are at a very critical turning point. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Last week was only the beginning. 
That is where we are going.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
It is very important to make sure that our harbours are well maintained. 
We are working toward making sure that happens.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Our wharf infrastructure is crumbling. 
Many others are in serious need of repair.  
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
I think his contribution was very important.  
We have taken an active role at the security council. 
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Canadian Alliance):
Records are not properly indexed. 
My question is for the President of the Treasury Board. 
The bell is ringing once again. 
Why will the government not answer?  
We must adapt to the new realities.  
We are going to increase active monitoring by the various departments.  
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.  
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
Thirty more have pending legislation on seatbelts for school buses.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
This is something which requires further study.  
Mr. Lawrence D. O'Brien (Labrador, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
I understand that Air Canada has launched its new schedule. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Canadian Alliance):
Why was it so bad then and so good now? 
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
My question is for the Solicitor General. 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Will we stop calling for studies and call for action to lift these sanctions now? 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Charles Hubbard (Miramichi, Lib.):
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I have three petitions to present. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I present a petition today. 
Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):
They ask us to make good on that commitment.  
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
MODERNIZATION OF BENEFITS AND OBLIGATIONS ACT 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):
That is exactly what will happen with the bill.  
It is opening up a Pandora's box. 
It is not modernizing benefits. 
It may be trying to modernize language. 
That debate has never taken place. 
Times change and the world situation changes. 
It deserved a good hearing and a good airing both here and in committee.  
That was not done.  
The first big failing with the bill is the lack of consultation. 
It never travelled one foot out of these hallowed halls. 
None of those discussions took place.  
None of those consultations took place. 
That is a gross failing of the bill. 
We will have intervener status all around for everyone from provincial governments to interested groups. 
It will be a lawyer's heyday, which is very unfortunate.  
I can see it coming.  
Where are we going? 
This legislation will end up in the courts. 
It will cost a pile of money.  
I do not blame the courts for this. 
The proper forum is this place. 
There needs to be a good healthy debate, lots of witnesses and lots of input. 
He is an acknowledged expert in this field. 
That is what the Canadian Alliance is attempting to do. 
That is what our report stage amendments are designed to do. 
Approval of our amendments will strengthen the bill. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
I am proud to be from the riding of Vancouver East. 
That is what we should keep in mind here. 
We should not be sidelined and sidetracked by all of these other political debates.  
It is the Canadian Alliance.  
Mr. Speaker, I have been trying to figure out what the alliance is. 
An alliance implies that one is in alliance with other partners. 
I do not exactly see people beating down the doors. 
It seems like it is the same old Reform Party.  
He said that children will suffer. 
I find this to be quite outrageous and insulting.  
That is what he said. 
Children are certainly suffering because of poverty. 
I want to call the member on this issue. 
That kind of debate is inflammatory and divisive. 
The member for Yorkton-Melville went even further in his attack. 
The remarks today were offensive to gay, lesbian and straight couples. 
We should reject that. 
We can see what is happening. 
This is something that has never been defined in other statutes. 
I am proud to say that our party has always stood for equality. 
We have always respected, accepted, encouraged and supported diversity in our society. 
This party has respect for and commitment to that. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):
The first has to do with the matter of definitions. 
That is the purpose of the amendment.  
I think we would agree with a lot of things about this amendment. 
I know I certainly would. 
Why should we care so much about the definition? 
I recalled back to a day when I was in grade eight. 
He then asked ``What is science?'' 
Science is the orderly arrangement of knowledge. 
There we have it. 
What is in a definition? 
It defines something as being exclusive from all other things.  
As we define things more and more clearly, we are progressing. 
That is not regressive. 
That is not the point. 
They are just simply liaisons and they are different from marriage. 
They are not marriage. 
That means that any other relationship simply is not marriage. 
It seems to me that is very fundamental. 
That is why it is so essential that we focus on the definition.  
This does not mean that they are not equal. 
A toe is not the same as a thumb. 
The head is not the same as a leg. 
However, they are part of a body. 
It is abundantly clear that is what is being proposed here.  
If not, what happens? 
We should tell the court what we mean without equivocation and without interpretation. 
The judge then has to interpret the application of that law in particular cases. 
That is what we need.  
What happens if we do not have a clear definition? 
It is very interesting to see what happens. 
First, there is confusion. 
What is it we are talking about? 
After a very careful and studied analysis, he came to a conclusion and said: 
As previously stated, (the Minister's amendment) is not an enacting section- 
Those watching must be wondering what in the world that means. 
In other words, it may have force or it may not have force. 
It is a matter of opinion, a matter of interpretation. 
The gentleman goes on to say: 
-it will not bring into force any legally binding definition of ``marriage''. 
Can anything be more clear and unequivocal than that kind of statement? 
That is what we are asking the government to do.  
I certainly am speaking consistently with what my constituents are saying.  
Is that not pretty clear? 
Only one person out of almost 125,000 voters in the area supports the bill. 
I encourage the government to do that. 
We are not here to condemn the government. 
We are not here to oppose the government. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, this is a very difficult debate. 
This is a very difficult issue for members of parliament. 
Those were, to a large extent, unsolicited by anything I did or said. 
This is a very difficult area. 
Some of the perspectives from faith groups have been very strongly stated. 
Those feelings are legitimate. 
Closure was introduced on this bill already. 
That was on the proposed bail-out of professional hockey. 
We know that there can be a battle of legal opinions. 
I am sure there will be in court cases on this. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):
As my colleague has just pointed out, this is a very important issue. 
Why are Canadians concerned about Bill C-23? 
That is the question we need to answer. 
There is no big open debate. 
That is the tradition that Canadians hold very important. 
It is part of our tradition. 
As Chesterton said, it is the democracy of the dead. 
It is the pronouncement of all the generations which have gone before. 
In fact, we have a legal opinion which states that. 
As I said at the outset, this will end up in the courts. 
That is where this will be decided. 
The government has refused that. 
Government members across the way have refused it. 
It is a chimera. 
It does not exist. 
There is no protection in this legislation for marriage as we traditionally know it. 
That is the first point that we want to make.  
What does conjugal relationship mean? 
It does not say in the legislation. 
In the Oxford dictionary it says ``Of marriage or the relation between husband and wife''. 
That is what it seems to mean. 
It is important that Canadians understand exactly what the government is getting at. 
We are legislators elected by the public to decide these issues. 
We should decide them based on clear definitions. 
We should establish the definitions. 
We should talk to the public and find out where they are on these issues. 
That is an abdication of our responsibilities, and it is wrong. 
Every legislator here wants to do what is right in their mind. 
They want to do the right thing. 
What does tolerance mean? 
Let us get to the bottom of that.  
If we respond in the negative, then we are intolerant. 
I think that is what we are called upon as legislators to do.  
It is fundamental to society. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):
Let us start with tax unfairness. 
That has not been fixed. 
Obviously the finance minister has recognized it. 
A second item is child pornography. 
Judgments are being postponed and charges are not being laid because of the particular legislation. 
This is anti-family. 
He is nine pounds and doing great. 
If I were refused access to that little guy it would hurt very deeply. 
The government has not done anything to fix that. 
There is the whole area of sex offenders on parole. 
I came back to Ottawa with a message from those parents. 
It would change the law in that regard. 
We cannot have these people being released. 
That is what is happening out there. 
The government is not friendly to families.  
The Liberals are great for having plans and programs. 
They love to spend on programs and deliver programs for which they will get credit. 
They do not need the government to take care of their children for them.  
I could go on. 
How about the marriage courts? 
How about the problems there? 
That is not a court system or a government friendly to families.  
We could talk about the medicare program. 
We hear the minister saying that the provinces have no plans. 
They do have plans. 
The lack of leadership is coming from this government. 
Now we have Bill C-23 on conjugal relationships. 
That is definitely anti-family as we know it. 
I have many quotes. 
We do not know what the minister really means by what she is saying. 
They are opposed to it. 
I am proud today to stand on their behalf to give that message.  
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
There is not a great deal of legal difference.  
Mr. Speaker, you are a lawyer and I am a lawyer. 
That and $1.10 will get a cup of coffee upstairs. 
To say that it is a soothing balm to some is to state the obvious. 
This is somewhat counterintuitive. 
Statistics Canada puts it somewhat more drily. 
The results are fairly clear.  
The figures for children by common law unions are by all means the most spectacular. 
Who says that all relationships are created equal? 
It is quite clear that children pay for divorce. 
It cannot be assumed that the public good will be well served. 
Certainly our children know that this is not true. 
The question is when will their parents clue in.  
Those are my comments. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):
That is how a democracy works. 
I stand here to represent what by far the majority of people have said. 
It boggles the mind. 
No wonder people are becoming cynical about the federal government. 
It does not listen and it is time that it did.  
We have a record in the House. 
What is the government's response? 
It cannot do anything about it, it just has to go along.  
I will provide some history. 
I have had the privilege of being in this place for over six years. 
It has been a great privilege but it has also had its frustrations of course. 
I found the statistics from that particular vote.  
It is one or the other. 
These were the numbers in the spring of 1996. 
I am hoping for 120 fewer. 
About 40%, 70 in number, voted against it. 
That was on the Liberal side.  
That also says something. 
In the Reform Party at that time 11 members were absent. 
Of the nine members of the NDP, only two voted yes. 
How we have slipped. 
They have prevented Canadians from having their say on this very important question. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Canadian Alliance):
Why is that so threatening to some?  
The minister is taking the easy way out by using the backdoor approach. 
Why not affirm the institution of marriage by using the appropriate legislative tool? 
In other words, her amendment would not truly protect marriage in legislation. 
She is just playing the political game.  
Marriage produces real and tangible public policy benefits. 
Who do we believe? 
All of this is very confusing coming from ministers of the government.  
It also practises corporate and administrative law. 
I quote what that firm had to say about Bill C-23: 
Allow me to quote further from the legal opinion: 
What does that mean? 
Bill C-23 is a very flawed piece of legislation. 
The Liberals refuse to be clear on who qualifies for benefits. 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):
The bill has opened up the debate on two fronts. 
What is a benefit? 
To whom would the benefits apply?  
All the calls that came in were against the bill.  
We had a very interesting discussion. 
That is what we should be aiming for. 
One of the ways to do that is through education. 
We have come a long way in that respect.  
I had the privilege of talking to my colleagues in the Bloc. 
I actually travelled with my colleagues in the Bloc. 
We have a fantastic relationship as friends and I respect them. 
To get back to Bill C-23, let us talk about benefits. 
The bill is absolutely flawed. 
The bill gives benefits based on sexual preference. 
It leaves out many other issues on dependency which should have been included. 
I would like to know why these issues were left out.  
The second problem originates with the definition of marriage.  
Parliament made quite clear the definition of marriage. 
That is the view of society. 
In Surrey, B.C., the school board is talking about teaching this to children. 
Some of us will have objections to that. 
It is a point of view. 
Religious groups are apprehensive about it. 
That is acceptable in society.  
The debatable question is about marriage. 
That is a major concern. 
The justice minister has made an amendment. 
This was done by the motion in June of last year.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Canadian Alliance):
Conjugal will likely mean intimate sexual activity.  
The Minister of Justice is also a distinguished lawyer. 
I believe she has taught law at least at one university in Canada. 
Its consequences will abolish marriage as a specific relationship under federal law.  
This is very troublesome. 
There will be court intrusion. 
Here is something that is very troublesome. 
He bludgeoned a person to death.  
Mr. Charles Hubbard (Miramichi, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, for many of us in Canada this is a very difficult issue. 
I personally feel we are offering a special status to certain groups in our society. 
Nearly every religion I have studied has had a great respect for marriage. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Under normal circumstances such motions would not be selected for consideration at report stage. 
Accordingly, both motions remain selected for debate and voting purposes in Group No. 1.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance):
We have seen many omnibus bills go through the House. 
That is where we continually go wrong. 
That is what is wrong here. 
I want to address some of the things that concern me. 
I had the occasion not too long ago to talk to four young fellows. 
I knew them all. 
First of all they did not know much about it. 
They will do so regardless of what we call their relationship. 
That is what many people are trying to say. 
It will be case after case after case.  
All of you people who do not like this, that is just too darn bad''.  
As a result there is much uncertainty about what conjugal means. 
Where are we coming from?  
And where are we going?  
That is the way this group is thinking. 
I do so because the people of my riding expect that of me''. 
That is what we expect of them.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):
They absolutely object to this kind of work. 
It is time for consultation of that nature.  
The taxpayers will have no opportunity whatsoever to have a say. 
There has been no consultation with society. 
The government has failed to do that on every count.  
I am pleased to see the Indian affairs minister here today. 
It goes on and on year after year. 
People do not want to live in that kind of society.  
Lord only knows what the Liberals stand for any more. 
I do not know. 
They talk a good talk but they never walk the talk.  
Personally, what it could mean frightens me. 
There will be no free vote. 
There will be no consultation with the public. 
The Liberals will do as they are told, as usual. 
The mighty powers of Ottawa have spoken. 
Sheep should rise and vote the way they are supposed to. 
Never mind what the people say in the ridings. 
They want it to end and so do I. It will take courage. 
It will take some initiative over there. 
Never mind the elites of our wonderful country. 
We are tired of the elites. 
What about the people? 
I will be here to cluck.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Canadian Alliance):
Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to enter into the debate. 
I have been called worse names. 
I am not one who hates. 
I was brought up not to hate. 
If somebody wants to give 98%, I will top that. 
Canadians are, thanks to their members, totally irate about this sneaked in legislation.  
Let us take a look at my own family. 
My wife's oldest sister stayed home and looked after her parents. 
She does not qualify for any benefits according to this bill. 
This government hates marriage. 
An accident took the lives of six men just like that. 
In other words, six widows are made just like that. 
When three of them re-married, they were cut off from those benefits. 
The other three just lived with a partner.  
If we can talk about 68 federal acts, what about all the provincial acts? 
There will be that many provincial acts.  
This bill, Bill C-23. 
We see the word conjugal with no definition. 
We see the word spouse and it can mean almost anything.  
I do not know where its constituents are. 
Are my constituents different from the rest? 
Let us get the information out. 
Let us get the judicial people into each of the provinces. 
Has it got the courage to do that? 
What would the government do then?  
I ask that question and I ask one favour. 
Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):
At page 6 of the brief it reads: 
First, there is a concern that benefits are being based solely on sexual activity. 
We note, however, that this terminology is not new in the law. 
The CBA has no position on whether benefits should be extended in this manner. 
That is exactly what is happening. 
I submit that was never the intent of the amendment.  
That was the government's position and that remains the government's position. 
It is obvious that the common law case law has provided the meaning of marriage. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Canadian Alliance):
It has been a tactic in Canada for far too many years.  
We will say what has to be said. 
We will say it on behalf of our constituents. 
No amount of name calling and no amount of labelling will stop us. 
They can keep on calling us what they want to call us. 
It will not stop us.  
Let us look at Bill C-23. 
Sixty-eight federal statutes are to be amended. 
What a glorious day this is for the lawyers of the country. 
It is a heyday for them.  
The government is too afraid to define marriage. 
Marriage is one of the main cornerstones of society. 
Yet the government refuses to define it. 
I am here to say that there was no consulting. 
Nobody came into my constituency or any other constituency that I know of. 
There is concern out there. 
That is a shame for a country that is supposed to be called a democracy. 
I cannot believe it. 
That is not addressed. 
They refuse to address it. 
I do not understand it. 
It didn't happen to you.  
No, it did not happen to me and I can tell the House why. 
They tell me what they want.  
What is said at that moment means absolutely nothing. 
It is all for show. 
We all know it and the people of Canada know it. 
It has never been anything more than that to the government. 
That is the agenda of the government.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):
The constituents of Surrey Central are calling me every day opposing the bill. 
My constituents are urging the Canadian Alliance to remain firm as a pro-family party. 
What is it that my constituents are opposing? 
The vast majority supports families. 
I will talk about the definition of marriage for a moment. 
Because they do not really believe in it.  
The Minister of Justice contradicts statements by other cabinet ministers. 
Let me talk for a moment about the definition of conjugal relationships. 
That definition is key to the operation of the bill. 
One minister says that sexual activity is involved in a conjugal relationship. 
Another minister says no, it has nothing to do with sex. 
There are other problems. 
Independent legal opinion confirms the ineffectiveness of the justice minister's marriage amendment. 
The same opinion supports the very substantive approach of the official opposition.  
The Liberals refuse to be clear on who qualifies. 
How do people know if they qualify? 
Many people will be launching lawsuits as soon as the legislation is passed. 
The elected representatives of the people should be making those decisions, and not the judiciary.  
There are two other problems. 
The bill says nothing about that.  
Let us talk about cost for a moment. 
Canadians have no information about how much it will cost taxpayers. 
Let us look at the anti-family policies of the government. 
Let us talk about taxes and families. 
We have a pro-family policy.  
Let us talk about child pornography. 
We have a pro-family policy but the anti-family Liberals will not do that.  
We have offered the government many opportunities to do the right thing. 
That is the exact text of all 19 of my amendments. 
This one is another letter of support for family values. 
I received many, many more letters.  
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Canadian Alliance):
There is obviously much to be said about it.  
Unfortunately, the government does not really believe in that. 
A few people have talked about this.  
There is even no agreement in those communities. 
I think about the same sex friends who are in same sex relationships. 
Many of them do not want to change the definition of marriage. 
They want to try to strengthen that. 
There are people in the community who feel that way. 
Obviously there are others who do not agree with that. 
But many of my friends have told me that.  
I will give an example.  
He was enquiring about benefits in that relationship. 
It is something we fundamentally believe to our core. 
My colleague before me mentioned that.  
That is very disheartening for this side of the House.  
I for one reject that suggestion. 
It was not intended to do that.  
These areas are certainly referred to in the amendments and in the bill.  
It was never intended to. 
I suppose one might have tackled this point another way. 
You did not appeal the Rosenberg decision.  
Now he is going to check with his friends.  
That entails obligations as well as benefits.  
No child ever had any control over where he or she came from. 
They simply end up in the world as one of us.  
The number of relationships falling under that rubric has grown in modern society. 
It may well continue to grow. 
That is simply a reality that exists in Canadian society. 
We have to take account of it. 
We do not need to be specific about the gender. 
Two good parents are better than one. 
Then we will want to do that for children.  
I will close by indicating my support for the bill. 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise on this debate today. 
There are a couple of points I want to focus on. 
The government has made an attempt to define marriage by bringing forward an amendment. 
The jury is still out. 
Obviously there is some question as to whether in fact it will do the job. 
I spoke to it originally, the last time we debated Bill C-23. 
I believe the bill has been put together quite hastily. 
Other very good options have been brought forward that could have dealt with this point. 
One of my colleagues brought forward another solution which he calls the registered domestic partnership. 
I think that is something on which we should be focusing. 
It is a lost opportunity.  
I am frustrated the government has refused to deal with that. 
It was very frustrated with what was going on with the billion dollar boondoggle. 
It wanted a diversion in the House. 
It did not look at all the options presented by my colleague and others.  
All kinds of court cases will result. 
That is my frustration with the bill.  
Why should dependency be based on a conjugal relationship? 
What exactly is a conjugal relationship? 
What I find frustrating is how the House operates. 
That is one of the frustrating aspects for me.  
He basically wanted to remove the sexuality from it. 
Benefits should not be based on sexuality. 
I think that was the way to go. 
The government has missed an opportunity. 
It has come back with an amendment I think because of public pressure. 
My office has received all kinds of correspondence and calls on this. 
The government hastily made an amendment to the bill. 
I do not think that question has been decisively answered. 
I think that still needs to be done.  
The government put this together at the last minute. 
It wanted to get something on the order paper. 
The government does not accept changes.  
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
British Columbia's minister of the environment wrote, and I quote: 
What we need now is a watertight federal ban on water exports.  
Mr. Lawrence D. O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Our goal is to shut off the tap at the source, not at the border.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
That is the reason I asked the question. 
Unfortunately the record has been quite shameful over the years. 
The five species of west coast salmon are in trouble. 
Atlantic salmon on the east coast are in trouble. 
Now it is $543 million.  
They will not accept the ability- 
The hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  
Mr. Lawrence D. O'Brien (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
We are taking these warning signs very seriously. 
Conservation of the snow crab resource is the priority. 
The motion to adjourn the House is deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.43 p.m.)
