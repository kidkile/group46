EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 87 
Monday, May 1, 2000 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP) moved: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
They feel proud of what we have accomplished. 
I would like to thank Joe Canadian for helping us out.  
In other terms we would call them the loggers and the farmers.  
His poem is entitled Sage and Pine .  
I've traveled to your cities, 
the smell of sage and pine!  
Now I'm just a country poet, 
Not prone to fancy verse.  
My grammar is atrocious, 
My spelling's even worse!!  
But my tales are plain an' honest, 
Like the children of the soil, 
The cowboys, ranchers and farmers 
Whose work is honest toil.  
The urban crowd don't like my prose 
they will pick at every line 
my poems ain't read in fancy theatres, 
where they sip champagne and wine, 
and I sure ain't rich or famous, 
But that just suits me fine, 
`Cause you don't need fame or fortune 
to smell the sage and pine.  
It is my belief that culture is the heart of a nation. 
There would be no book publishing or sound recording industry. 
There would be no theatre productions or galleries and museums. 
Basically, the cultural industry would collapse.  
Now it is time to devote that same attention, that same consideration, to cultural sovereignty. 
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
I should start by saying that I have a direct interest in this subject matter. 
They are driven to express themselves. 
It often means forgoing family and children. 
They do all these things year in and year out. 
We are tremendously richer because of their sacrifices. 
Mr. Saul is one of Canada's most respected writers and philosophers. 
We are absolutely nothing as a country without our creators and our culture. 
It is defined by our creators.  
The motion is not primarily about money.  
I do not think the question is one of money.  
This is clearly illogical. 
It says that standards for success in art is only as a commodity.  
History is full of great artists who died in poverty. 
I strongly support the important motion put forward by my colleague. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I believe the intent behind the motion is very admirable. 
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Canadian Alliance):
As Canadians we are all indebted to our artists. 
Tax relief should be broad based and not be targeted.  
I thank the Writers' Union of Canada for its correspondence regarding the bill. 
All taxpayers will pay less. 
The tax savings would amount to about $8.3 billion. 
Tax savings there would amount to about $2.4 billion.  
It would also reduce taxes on employment. 
Tax savings would be $2.7 billion.  
Tax savings would amount to about $600 billion.  
This would also eliminate discrimination against a new economy. 
Tax savings for Canadians would be about $1.89 billion.  
The tax savings would be $340 billion.  
In summary, these are the main advantages of the single rate tax plan. 
Everyone, including artists, would benefit from tax relief. 
There is no doubt we are in debt. 
Canadians certainly deserve it at this time.  
Motion No. 259 reads as follows: 
For example, who will be able to claim the status of artist?  
In Quebec, the tax threshold is a lot higher than at the federal level.  
I would like to give you a few examples. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
It is a tradition that has been valued throughout history. 
These types of success stories are worthy of recognition. 
However, we have to do more to help artists when they are starting off.  
Income averaging would be the best way to address that.  
That is one way this could be addressed.  
Some special tax treatment is available to those in the arts in Ireland. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
His party proposes to get rid of the CBC. 
The next $10,000 net income is also partly deductible.  
It is the creator, exactly the person we must encourage throughout our country.  
May I add that most of them are social democrat countries. 
He was a starving artist. 
Many people around the world come to Canada for that very reason.  
It is absolutely fabulous.  
They do not have to move away for a job. 
It is absolutely fabulous.  
I want to give a final plug for a couple of artisans in my riding. 
My wife does wonderful artwork herself, along with our neighbours. 
They get together once in a while to do wonderful watercolours. 
They do not do it for profit. 
They do it because of their love for culture, their environment. 
This is the type of nurturing that needs to grow.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEE PROTECTION ACT 
This bill is the product of extensive and substantial consultations. 
Bill C-31 also clarifies the criteria for inadmissibility to Canada. 
Bill C-31 will also streamline the assessment of claims. 
It simply consolidates several current protection criteria and corresponding protection decisions into a single step. 
Bill C-31 will also strengthen the integrity of our immigration system. 
These changes are important ones for a very simple reason. 
It is about respect. 
Family units will be kept together wherever possible. 
This is precisely the point of Bill C-31.  
Canada has been an enormous beneficiary of this global movement of people. 
We want to take advantage of those opportunities.  
Issues of immigration and refugee protection are very important to the country. 
They represent many of the core values that we share. 
I am working very closely with those provinces.  
Immigrants and refugees built the country. 
This is an important piece of legislation. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):
I want to talk a bit about what is in the act. 
Does the act deliver? 
That is the question I want to talk a bit about today.  
Those are good sentiments which the minister has expressed. 
That has to be encouraging, but will the act deliver? 
That is the question.  
I will talk also about some particular sections in the act which are good. 
Will these changes which are positive really lead to a better immigration policy? 
That is the bottom line. 
I will talk about that today as well.  
The immigration act is made up of three separate streams. 
In the economic stream there are several different categories. 
The focus on that clearly must be the improvement of the immigration system. 
That is the first stream, the independent stream.  
That is the first stream.  
Canadians welcome genuine refugees. 
I will get into that as I go along.  
Canadians are quite happy to accept the current number of approximately 23,000 refugees. 
I have not heard a great many people express concern about those numbers. 
That is the second stream, the refugee stream.  
Some different rules apply but basically it is the same process.  
Those are the three streams.  
There has been a lot of talk about that lately. 
My point of view is slightly different, but I will talk about that.  
The new immigration act deals with the non-administrative aspects of immigration. 
I am not talking now about how effectively it deals with that. 
It talks about who is admissible and who is inadmissible to Canada. 
It talks about the enforcement of the law to some extent. 
It also talks about other technical matters.  
What is an immigration system about? 
What was the purpose of immigration in my area of east-central Alberta? 
How were immigrants chosen and what process took place? 
We all know that things are not always good for agriculture. 
That is what should happen and what has happened in the past. 
The question is, will this bill allow that to happen again?  
Our system has failed us in that regard.  
Some major changes were made in early 1993 to that enacting legislation in 1989. 
Unfortunately, the changes have not worked very well. 
I am sure that is why she has tabled new legislation.  
How much deals with that in Bill C-31? 
Would it be a third of the act? 
Would it be half the act because it is an extremely positive side of immigration? 
The rest is left to regulation. 
That is one example of why the act is so thin.  
That is completely unacceptable. 
We have heard the terms ``people smuggling'' and ``people trafficking''. 
That the definition is there is a positive. 
The appeal does not necessarily have to be an appeal to the courts.  
If the one member panel is put in place, that should speed up the process. 
There are some changes which are clearly negative. 
I have already used the example of the independent categories. 
Too much is left to regulation.  
Landings have been returned to our system. 
They may never come back. 
That is not the intent. 
Immigration in Canada should benefit Canada. 
The whole idea of generally accepting far more people within Canada is a real concern. 
Our system is accepting people who have not been screened. 
I believe that is a concern. 
It has been demonstrated that it will not work. 
It is important that we do not allow that to find its way into legislation. 
I hope the government will see that it will not work.  
It would cause the same kind of problem. 
We want to immigrate'', and they will stay here throughout the process.  
Of course the process already has a terrific backlog. 
Many times, if the wait becomes too long, people give up. 
Those are some of the negatives.  
The regulations are very important. 
That is the way it has been interpreted. 
What does it really mean to have it in the application clause of the bill? 
It is in section 4 of the act. 
This bill will not help those people.  
Will the bill help genuine refugees? 
No, it will not. 
Does that not make sense?  
The United Nations has a body that is quite capable. 
I do not always give a lot of credit to the United Nations. 
I have concerns in many areas. 
If the government is compassionate, why does the legislation not provide for those people? 
It does not work for genuine refugees. 
Will the bill help to reunite families? 
I would suggest there is nothing in the new legislation to deal with that problem.  
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Bill C-31 was introduced on April 6, 2000. 
Refugee selection and family reunification remain under federal jurisdiction.  
This new bill must take account of the standards established in these documents. 
Unfortunately, despite a few references, the bill does not incorporate the relevant texts.  
However, article 37(b) of the convention that: 
-States Parties shall ensure that: 
(b) No child shall be deprived of his or her liberty unlawfully or arbitrarily. 
The convention also provides, in article 22, that: 
The whole issue of detention is another component of the bill. 
The debate is primarily on clauses 50 to 55.  
These three reasons are already included in the current act. 
However, in several respects, the bill broadens the scope of the provisions on detention.  
The bill broadens the measures pertaining to detention without warrant. 
At the moment, arrest without warrant is permitted only in rather limited circumstances. 
Any requirement for pieces of identity is a threat to refugees. 
What remains to be seen, however, is what these regulations will comprise.  
Instead, it ought to be enshrined in the law.  
I have two comments to make in this regard. 
At times, perhaps often, the ruling was negative. 
In fact, it slowed down or even blocked the whole process. 
It is new, and I would say it is important. 
This is the present state of affairs under the current legislation. 
They will now be ruled ineligible if the claimant: 
In this regard, I wish to make a comment. 
There is no denying that the process is slow and difficult to comprehend.  
This therefore creates a dual problem with a dual impact.  
This goes without saying. 
I even think that some Liberal members might agree with that statement. 
Another important factor is the introduction of appeals on the merits. 
A large percentage of claims are ruled ineligible on grounds of credibility. 
It will therefore be extremely difficult to challenge such rulings of non-credibility in writing. 
The government has, however, announced certain measures relating to family reunification. 
The problem is that we do not have the regulations before us. 
It is thus encouraging division.  
According to the Quebec Minister of Relations with the Citizens and Immigration, Robert Perreault: 
That statement was made by the Quebec minister of citizenship and immigration. 
As we know, Quebec is responsible for independent immigration. 
But the bill does not make this clear. 
There must be clauses spelling out Quebec's jurisdiction in this area.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Both he and I will be speaking to the bill. 
Unfortunately he was unable to be here today.  
People have been here for many years in some cases. 
This is certainly a principle and an intention of the bill that we support. 
We do not know what those regulations will be. 
That is certainly something I think all Canadians would support.  
I would certainly urge that.  
I would urge the minister to see what she could do about that. 
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Immigration is very important. 
My paternal grandfather came to this country in 1897 from Ukraine. 
My grandfather, Panko Solomon, went to the Fork River district. 
As an aside, my uncle still owns the property. 
Of course smugglers will move from smuggling cigarettes to smuggling guns. 
I am worried that there will not be resources. 
I would like to see it not only abroad but in Canada as well.  
Saskatchewan is a landlocked province in the centre of our country. 
The family reunification challenge has always been complex. 
In Saskatchewan we have been very troubled with the lack of speed to reunify families. 
As the minister has indicated, family reunification is very beneficial. 
The bill has many parts. 
Mr. Marcel Proulx (Hull-Aylmer, Lib.):
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Canadian Alliance):
Yet instead of going down, freight rates will be going up.  
The government's own experts have recommended a clear path to reform. 
Where is the transportation minister on this issue?  
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Religious rights are like the proverbial canary in the mine shaft. 
Two years ago I met with the minister of justice for Vietnam. 
The bottom line was that he did not believe in the rule of law. 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
The recognition of Armenian genocide is not complete yet.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
This is simply untrue.  
Canada has the best food safety regulations in the world. 
Quite frankly Canadians deserve better than this. 
They deserve the facts. 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):
THE LATE JACQUES BEAUREGARD 
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
Thank you Jacques for all your work. 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Everyone must develop new skills. 
Congratulations to the founders and partners of this new institution.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
It is also international workers day. 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
I wish everyone a Happy International Workers Day.  
OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY 
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
The day is commemorated around the world. 
The reality is of great concern. 
This means someone is being hurt every 9 seconds. 
Every year, over 800,000 work-related injuries are reported. 
Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of victims. 
We too feel the loss of their loved ones.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
His government has not introduced a single environmental initiative in the past seven years.  
When it comes to species at risk Canadians want legislation that works. 
The government has ignored its recommendations.  
Equivalency would be negotiated on a species by species basis utilizing the framework- 
The hon. member for Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia.  
CANADIAN EXECUTIVE SERVICE ORGANIZATION 
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia, Lib.):
CESO is in its 33rd year of sending Canadian volunteers overseas. 
Last year the organization provided over 23,000 days of volunteer assistance.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, it is good to be back. 
There has not even been an admission of guilt.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, the system does seem to be working very well for Liberals at least.  
On February 4, 1997 a company called Mode Conili Star was incorporated. 
On April 10 the company received three-quarters of a million dollars. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, this is certainly out in the public and this is exactly what happened. 
This is just another happy coincidence.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, members of the Reform Party do the same thing in their ridings. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to reiterate my hon. colleague's sentiments. 
I ask the hon. member to go to his question.  
The first couple of questions were getting a little bit close. 
We must go to the administrative responsibility of the government. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, listen to this list:
Confections St-Elie, Aerospatiale Globax, Placeteco, Fermco Industries and now Mode Conili. 
The list goes on. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
This is the law of Canada. 
COUNCIL ON CANADIAN UNITY 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is not the case at all.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Those are the programs and the young people are the ones who benefited from them.  
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have already answered that question. 
The programs I mentioned will be audited. 
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
That is who the government's friends were: young Canadians who benefit from such programs.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health.  
Time is even more of the essence. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We have raised more than NAFTA concerns. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the time has passed for watching with interest. 
The time has come for action on the part of the minister. 
The hon. member knows better than to use props. 
If the hon. minister wishes to respond I will permit him.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
The bill is before the legislature. 
There are amendments before that body and the debate continues. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Hon. Maria Minna (Minister for International Cooperation, Lib.):
The hon. member for Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
This is a woman's life.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
He looks a little fried.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I certainly would not agree with the comments of the hon. member.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Canadian Alliance):
Why did 80% of those funds go to something else?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
If money were the only answer, then that problem would be solved.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):
The member constantly hides behind the Canada Health Act. 
That is pretty rude of that bunch over there.  
I agree with the hon. member. 
There is a bit of rudeness on both sides.  
Mr. Speaker, the minister hides behind the Canada Health Act. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
This government has health as its priority.  
We are prepared to work with our provincial partners to make sure that happens.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Hon. Claudette Bradshaw (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
I will be delighted to sit down with her to discuss this situation.  
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
It would be inappropriate for the government to tell it what to do. 
This would, essentially, be interfering.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Therefore, this is an illustration of the co-operation between these two agencies.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question. 
Sometimes, perhaps it is worth seeing the glass as half full.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Will he do that?  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
My question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We are in the middle of that process as we speak. 
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
There has been no approval granted. 
Therefore my colleague the Minister of Veterans Affairs was entirely correct.  
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Mr. Speaker, we know no approval has been given. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
What I have said is that there have been no increases that have been approved.  
We will make that commitment. 
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the delegation was very successful on two accounts.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
I could go on for three hours. 
This is what the member does not want to recognize.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
He has not gotten back to me yet.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
The right questions are being asked.  
The United States has not made any decision with respect to the matter. 
It has not asked Canada to participate. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Let me say it again in English this time.  
Number one, sidewinder was not shut down. 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
There must be criteria. 
This is where other countries have found a problem. 
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I think what the hon. member is talking about is not concentration. 
It is the people who had concentration who want to sell their newspapers. 
That is a different problem from the question that was asked before.  
It is better to wait and see what he will do with his newspapers.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Canada can state its position on its own.  
On the other hand I used the occasion of my talk with the president. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Canadian Alliance):
Let me ask him a simple question. 
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the sidewinder was not shut down. 
It is as simple as that.  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions to present today on the issue of marriage. 
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a number of petitions to present today. 
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):

Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I also rise to present a petition with respect to genetically engineered foods.  
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):
There contain well over 400 names.  
Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am submitting three petitions to the House of Commons.  
Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Regrettably we are further from that decision today.  
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):
The petitioners urge the government to do something.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
They are looking for equity in the issuance of pay equity cheques. 
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Mr. Gar Knutson (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEE PROTECTION ACT 
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
We have some reservations about this bill. 
We have to look at those on a case by case basis.  
We cannot talk to people there. 
We only get a recorded message. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
I would like to set out the recommendations I have brought before the committee. 
The clauses of Bill C-31 on security are inadequate.  
In 1984, the last year of the Liberal government, Canada had admitted 88,239 immigrants. 
We know the value of increasing the number of immigrants. 
Figures do not lie.  
That is hardly a surprise. 
When dangers arose we took action. 
We are familiar with the immigration system. 
Chronic problems exist therein, problems the Liberal government has not addressed. 
Even worse, there are problems the auditor general had discussed before. 
Allow me to expand on these serious issues.  
Approved doctors carry out examinations and forward their advice to the officers. 
What medical risks are posed to Canadians? 
What new diseases are routinely transported to Canada?  
I am not satisfied that sufficient preventive measures are taken in the new bill. 
When will the criteria for medical admissibility be updated? 
What health conditions are considered to be a danger to public health? 
What diseases will excessively burden the health care system? 
This new funding will be eaten up very quickly. 
No one will ever know how many criminals are admitted to Canada. 
Foreign police records may not be updated or reliable. 
That is not all. 
What kinds of people are routinely coming to this country?  
I hope the new global case management system will soon be up and running. 
Where are these people going? 
How many criminals are passing through? 
What threats and risks are posed to Canadians as these unknowns walk our streets?  
As a party we are concerned about these potential criminals. 
That is why identifying these individuals at first contact is of prime importance. 
This resolution passed unopposed at committee. 
Members were supportive that it be included in the bill. 
This does not suffice.  
Fingerprints and photographs must be provided for in the new bill. 
A second resolution I proposed at committee involves safe third countries. 
These individuals would have a safe haven in a safe third country.  
Second, Canada is able to control its borders from undocumented arrivals.  
That is strange since it is beneficial to both countries.  
We do not need to start importing it. 
Clause 31 deals with those inadmissible on the grounds of having violated human rights. 
Would the minister please clarify a representative? 
Is it a government official or a national of that country?  
What does she mean by serious criminality? 
I am baffled at why the minister would not take all crime seriously.  
I am not comfortable with these numbers. 
She must now leave Canada to be able to apply for permanent residence.  
I congratulate the minister for the measures she is taking in that regard. 
Members of the Progressive Conservative Party will be at the forefront of this debate. 
As I said at the beginning of my remarks, we are the immigration party. 
He spoke both of Canada's official languages. 
Unfortunately they have very limited powers, resources and training. 
This is being looked at.  
In my riding I have seven border crossings. 
However, that is one border crossing. 
They will just pick another border crossing.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):
That is a good point. 
It is not what it says it is.  
We are at a stage where our country needs rebuilding.  
They were the ones who allowed that to happen. 
They allowed many people to come in under a general amnesty. 
That is the way they allowed high numbers to come in.  
Hon members should go to the 1990 auditor general's report. 
They were in office three years after that. 
Their record is no better and I think the hon. member should acknowledge that.  
My question for the member is about the issue of a safe third country. 
Because that was not done, the IRB has been a failure from the start.  
Mr. Speaker, I am happy to answer the member's question. 
The safe third country is something that has been bugging me all along.  
They could easily have applied through those countries. 
I do agree with the hon. member on that. 
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
But most of all, I would like to ask my hon. colleague a question. 
Mr. Speaker, the answer to this question will be very short. 
Both accepted immigrants during the years the hon. member mentioned. 
We responded to these problems.  
The Liberal government talks about 300,000 people. 
This is an approximate number. 
I do not think so. 
The last study was done in 1980. 
There has been nothing since then.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
It becomes a budget problem. 
The fact is that to do fingerprints and photos requires equipment. 
Equipment is available in most of the places but not everywhere. 
The problem is dollars. 
We will then be guaranteed that the money will be there.  
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
However, the time comes when we have to look at the whole picture. 
We have to rethink the way we do things.  
We are not talking about tinkering. 
I want to talk about why the very structure of the act should be changed. 
This bill opens our doors wider. 
The time has come to pass new legislation.  
This is framework legislation. 
Even so, not everything can or should be in regulations. 
Canadian immigration policies are built on three pillars. 
The framework legislation is based on those principles. 
The bill would guarantee fundamental rights. 
It clearly defines the power of arrest. 
I will be proud to support this bill when we vote. 
I urge my colleagues from all parties to do so. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I wonder if the member for Laval West could help me. 
Was the member for Laval West splitting her time?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):
I am wondering how she envisions this working. 
How is that going to work?  
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, the question is extremely appropriate.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
On questions and comments, the member for Lakeland, a short question.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):
The main organizers are in other countries, in the country of origin.  
I would like the member to answer that question. 
I have a second question which is on safe third countries. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I will be glad to answer the question just asked. 
This is just like the problem with drugs, for example. 
Mr. Jerry Pickard (Chatham-Kent Essex, Lib.):
It certainly is a privilege and an honour that Canada shares with some other nations.  
My riding of Chatham-Kent Essex is rich in ethnic diversity. 
That is why this debate is so important today. 
Therefore, changes are required in our Immigration Act. 
This will result in faster processing times. 
New funds have been designated to clear up backlogs. 
I request everyone in the House to give it support.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):
There is no attempt to deal with the administration of the act.  
That would be true if we did not have additional appeals inside the IRB. 
The administration is the problem. 
The auditor general pointed that out in spades two weeks ago. 
The administration is separate from the act.  
Attacking the administration really does not do anything. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):
I am sure that other members also received many telephone calls concerning this bill.  
They have given selective information to the media. 
People are making decisions based on government propaganda.  
However, it is only a liaison office. 
It does not give application forms for visitor visas. 
Because the election is around the corner the Liberals have started singing the same song. 
They forget that they can fool people only once.  
The government has failed to even make the changes based on simple common sense. 
Let me highlight some ineffective salient features of the bill. 
Therefore, the families could not be reunited. 
The people involved cannot work properly.  
However, the weak system failed to give him the landed certificate. 
He could not buy that taxi. 
We must not let it deteriorate further.  
The bill provides for higher maximum penalties for human trafficking and people smuggling. 
That looks good on the surface. 
It is a mockery of law and order.  
They do not care. 
Will the minister be going to all of those countries to stop those people? 
She failed to tighten our legislation here in this country. 
That was her job to do. 
She has failed to put teeth in the new bill. 
According to the auditor general, 60% arrive without documents. 
How can security checks be done?  
The legislation is small, but there is a truckload of regulations to follow. 
The legislation is like a blank cheque signed by the ineffective minister. 
What is the position of the Canadian Alliance? 
We see Canada as a land built by immigrants. 
We will continue to welcome new immigrants. 
We would support sponsorship for immediate family members. 
Our immigration policy would take into account Canada's economic needs. 
We would welcome genuine refugees to this country with open, warm arms. 
We would work co-operatively with the provinces on the settlement of immigrants. 
We would severely penalize those who organize abuses of our system. 
Our refugee system is such that it does not work for the genuine refugee. 
We are proud of that.  
I heard complaints that people were taking bribes in our embassies abroad. 
Another problem is with the backlog of cases in Canada. 
There is no right of appeal for a visitor visa.  
The system should be effective and working for genuine immigrants. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the intervention of my colleague. 
That would lead me to argue that the current system is not working well.  
It shows there is a need for some improvement in the immigration system. 
Would the hon. member comment on that?  
Would the member comment on these studies and the information revealed in them?  
They built the Canada of today that we are proud of.  
I will blame the government to some extent. 
In a way they are to be blamed. 
Let me give an example.  
Let me talk about the immigration fee which we call a head tax. 
This is institutionalized discrimination by the government.  
We should hire people based on merit. 
I believe the lines which define us are probably the lines which confine us. 
Those things should not be a subject of the 21st century.  
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I was fascinated by the hon. member's response to that question. 
It is nice to work with a minister who listens. 
I appreciate as well her work with the committee and her respect for the committee. 
I just returned from leading a multiparty delegation to Taiwan. 
It was a fascinating trip. 
Taiwan processes about 1,200 visas a day. 
It is the busiest visa office we have in the world. 
The Taiwanese have a saying about Canada, that Canadians live quietly in paradise. 
That is very interesting.  
We should all have these problems. 
Other nations should have these problems. 
Nevertheless, we are inundated by those who wish to come here. 
We issue something in the order of three million visas on an annual basis.  
Some criticisms of our immigration policy are legitimate. 
If they fail at the appeal they go back to claiming a risk review. 
If they do not like that they disappear.  
Currently the assessment of grounds for protection is handled in several stages. 
Essentially the working thesis of the bill is that the facts are the same. 
These grounds are not new. 
In the majority of cases the decisions are unanimous. 
The process will be made more efficient by the use of single member panels.  
The committee listened to hours of testimony. 
She has picked up on that. 
Again she has picked up on that.  
The other area the minister has beefed up is that of admissibility. 
This bill deserves the support of all members. 
This has been a long process. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
This bill makes changes in a number of areas. 
We can even say that, to a certain extent, they will have a discretionary power. 
There is also the issue of detention.  
The auditor general's report is very eloquent on this matter. 
That is my first question.  
Another issue concerns the detention of children. 
There is also the issue of the Canada-Quebec agreement. 
Our view is there should be more discretion in the hands of the officer. 
It should simply not be a rubber stamp process and then go from there.  
She has said there is more discretion on the part of the officer. 
That has cut out one point in the snakes and ladders process. 
Consolidation of the process is a good idea.  
It is a tough one for us to understand. 
I remember a couple of cases in particular.  
He has been practising as a physician for almost 20 years. 
He married and had a child. 
She was immediately denied. 
His mother did not want to emigrate. 
She did not want to come here to live. 
She was very happy. 
I finally went to the minister's office to get a ministerial permit. 
This year he wanted to bring over his mother-in-law. 
We had to go through the same tortuous process.  
For years I have been talking with the ministers. 
I happen to represent the University of Manitoba. 
It goes on and on. 
Why can Canadian citizens not enjoy this living quietly in paradise, as my colleague mentioned. 
It is not an easy issue.  
The problem is analogous to any problem of scarcity.  
It is a recipe for all sorts of corruption.  
What we have to do is take the profit out of it. 
They have worked on it very hard.  
I mentioned a committee. 
My colleague for Winnipeg North-St. 
Paul has a very large population of new immigrants in his community. 
We all work together. 
We first went through the initial offerings. 
The initial concepts were put forward. 
We met with staff from the department. 
I raised it with staff overseas. 
What we have here is an act that I believe is balanced but heavy. 
It has a stick that says we have to respect the law. 
It allows us to deal quickly and efficiently when the law is broken. 
It does it in a way that preserves the rights of people.  
We have collectively built a very powerful, a very prosperous and a very wonderful nation. 
We want to share it. 
I am a supporter of the work that has gone on here. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
We know that Quebec is very generous to refugees. 
It will have to continue to open its doors to refugees.  
The law must include firm commitments on this. 
Let me begin with the Refugee Convention and its optional protocol. 
That was also the case in the 1976 act, which preceded this legislation. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Why should we take that agreement further? 
Members probably know that my colleague from Beauharnois-Salaberry is a distinguished constitutional expert. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question. 
Canada had its share of constitutional debates. 
Some people seem tired of it. 
It is provided that in this regard the federal government has precedence.  
Our party does not believe this to be the case. 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
I would like him to develop his point of view more at length.  
I would like to hear my distinguished colleague on this.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
This past year I was elected as vice-chair of the committee.  
I was getting a little nervous. 
However, that of course did not happen. 
What happens in the case of a refugee? 
In years gone by that process has taken several years to play out. 
Do they get the attention? 
Do they get the media? 
Let me be clear. 
This is a human tragedy. 
This is as a result of bondage, of trafficking, of slavery. 
This is as a result of organized crime. 
I understand and sympathize with that.  
They are not the criminals. 
Why are they in detention now when it is so costly to keep them there? 
This is not an easy problem to resolve. 
We are dealing with language and cultural barriers. 
Why are they here? 
They rented a couple of houses. 
We all remember them. 
They were called the boat people.  
Today, with no education and no financial assistance, he has built a family business. 
He has kids and a wonderful life in Canada. 
That is what it is all about. 
They must have had it when they got on the plane. 
The minister says we have to close the back door. 
It is an interesting idea.  
The reality is, what is Canada if it is not a land of immigrants? 
My father came from Cardiff, Wales to work in the steel mills. 
That is one of the greatest things about this country. 
It is all about immigration.  
We recently dealt with the citizenship bill. 
It sends shivers up our spines to see how they feel about it. 
I sat in on some of the interviews. 
The London experience was very insightful, very interesting and very educational for me. 
I was astounded at how many we turn down. 
That was to Nairobi, Kenya. 
It is a city of six million people. 
It is a city where 500 people a day die in the hospitals from AIDS. 
It is a city where one dares not go out at night. 
People would think they were in Florida or Hollywood.  
Yes, Mississauga, of course, as the minister says.  
They live in danger all the time.  
I was never so proud to be a Canadian.  
We do wonderful things in this world through citizenship and immigration. 
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
Would he be welcomed in this country?  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for her very thoughtful question.  
The member made two points. 
The first was the issue of the best interests of the child. 
This is something we wrestled with at committee, because it can be difficult to define. 
In whose definition are the interests determined to be the best interests of the child?  
I believe we will do that. 
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
This is a tremendously important issue. 
Everyone in the House has spoken about their own heritage. 
Members of the House represent immigrants from all parts of the world. 
My own heritage is Italian and Scottish. 
He chose this country to build a life. 
It sets out the kind of vision we have for Canada in the future. 
It also defines whom we will not let in. 
That is as important a part of this debate as whom we let in. 
It is a reflection of our international obligations.  
It is an issue that has polarized Canadians in the last two or three years.  
The act has been amended numerous times. 
That polarization is on both sides.  
We have those groups on one side. 
We are contributors to both the good and the bad parts of the global community. 
Let us not forget that we live in the northern hemisphere. 
We are the consumers of the vast majority of the world's energy. 
We contribute the vast majority of waste and pollution to the world's atmosphere. 
I think we have to talk about our fair share and our obligations. 
Again let us be clear. 
Of the good things, I look at what the bill talks about. 
I am glad to hear there will be an increase in immigration officers. 
It would be my hope that the definition of crime would exclude those individuals.  
We commend the government for some of the points in the bill. 
I also have some other concerns. 
I know we will have an opportunity to examine them. 
He did not have a degree in computer science. 
He did not come with a lot of money. 
He did not have financial backing.  
He was the best.  
The minister says ``he was the best''. 
My family would agree with that. 
Surely poverty is not a bar to immigration to Canada. 
I know that the minister will answer these questions. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
The reunification of families certainly continues to be an important issue for Canadian society. 
Their education could be affected by their immigration status. 
The minister did answer the question and gave me some assurances. 
Perhaps the minister could also confirm something.  
I hope the minister will take the opportunity to enlighten us on those issues.  
Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
The new act states very clearly in clause 26(2): 
We think that is in Canada's interests and also in the child's interest.  
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
We should not be a haven for illegal immigrants. 
They are not here to embrace our nation but to exploit it. 
Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
This is not just something that Canada faces alone. 
This is an international problem which requires international solutions. 
I would like to highlight a couple of things that are in the bill. 
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
What has been Canada's reaction so far? 
Could the parliamentary secretary give the House reassurance to that effect tonight?  
Mr. Denis Paradis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
The study is scheduled for July. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.49 p.m.)
