EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 67 
Monday, March 20, 2000 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
ALLOTTED DAY-CANADA HEALTH AND SOCIAL TRANSFER 
The motion before us today is very simple. 
The issue is simple. 
We are talking about $1.5 billion. 
The finance minister increased that in this budget by $1.5 billion. 
In 72% of the cases there was no cash flow forecast. 
In 80% of the cases there was no evidence of financial monitoring. 
Almost half would have gone ahead anyway.  
All of the others would have been created anyway. 
The survey added: ``The sustainable results must be treated with caution. 
The estimates are still based on mere expectations, not real experiences''.  
They may disappear shortly.  
Another headline reads: ``Misusing federal grant money''. 
We have to wonder why. 
Another headline concerns Amtrak. 
This is just today's news.  
Another headline concerns DND overpayments. 
That just is not good enough.  
It is not good enough and we want it stopped. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I just wanted to make sure that I understood her correctly. 
Perhaps the member could clarify what she is saying. 
Mr. Speaker, what a nonsensical question. 
The member has the nerve to say that this money creates jobs. 
How does he know? 
Records have not been kept. 
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
They showed really advanced thinking and worked in remote communities.  
This group got together and got everything up and running. 
I would like the member's comments on it.  
Mr. Speaker, the point is well taken. 
We are not asking that any of the money put into these programs be cut. 
The government cannot get its story straight on health care. 
Is the government on or off? 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
We did not get any credible answer.  
What we got was a spectacle of stupidity. 
Let us talk about Earth Canada. 
We have seen an expose on EDC. 
The same has happened with Amtrak. 
Where is all this money? 
It is the pollsters who have to tell them. 
It shows how much in touch Liberals MPs are with their constituents. 
It is very easy. 
Health care is their number one priority. 
They are very much worried about it. 
The provinces are trying their best to balance the shortfall.  
What do we have? 
Let us look at grants and contributions. 
A simple solution is not to throw money. 
That does not create jobs. 
That would clearly increase productivity in the country. 
That would be the simple solution.  
What do we get from the Minister of Finance in the budget? 
I do not think it is even a modest tax cut. 
It is a band-aid solution. 
That would address many issues. 
That is where the money should be. 
At the end of the day it is the consumer who will drive the economy.  
At this time I would like to move the following amendment: 
The question is on the amendment.  
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
I will try to get an answer out of the member for Calgary East.  
Mr. Harris says he will spend every cent of it on health care.  
How do we do that?  
Mr. Speaker, that is quite an interesting and valid question. 
Does he think that?  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the member for Calgary East.  
The Reform Party is asking for $1.5 billion. 
The federal government has already increased the budget by $2.5 billion. 
The Reform Party is too late in asking for something even less.  
My question to the member is does he believe in medicare?  
Let me repeat this so that he can understand it quite clearly. 
We are not talking about the $2.5 billion.  
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
It is just part of the inconsistencies that we see.  
Let me address the issue of federal transfers. 
However, what is right and what is fair in the circumstances? 
Should this be one of our national priorities?  
Is this what we should be financing?  
Look at the debt burdens of the federal government and the provinces. 
Whose debts are the most onerous? 
Which ones should we give priority to as a nation in attempting to eliminate?  
Let us look at health care transfers. 
The federal government spends $3 billion directly. 
That is not right. 
This is why they do not want their politicians bickering and fighting. 
Canadians have a right to be upset. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it seemed very long to me. 
He is, after all, connected with the finance department. 
This year less than $1 billion will be given to health care by the government. 
They have not been cut. 
That can be drawn down immediately by the provinces.  
We will not give it no strings attached. 
We will not allow that.  
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
Some of these people are not capable of working. 
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
They are proven programs that Canadians have come to count on. 
That money is invested in communities across the country regardless of political stripe.  
These programs are about expanding opportunity for hundreds of thousands of Canadians.  
These programs are helping youth at risk to put new direction in their lives. 
They are helping them to learn the enormous value of helping their fellow Canadians.  
These programs are really working.  
These numbers show Canadians real value for their tax dollars. 
Once again the numbers tell the story.  
It increased again last year by another 73,000 jobs. 
We are giving them the power to seize the opportunities of the new century.  
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
They became victims of hepatitis C. The government has recognized this fact. 
The only thing it has done is pay off the lawyers.  
What does the hon. member think of this? 
Should these people be paid and paid now? 
Mr. Speaker, yes these people should be paid. 
The government is on record as saying that they should be paid. 
In fact the government is working very hard toward that end. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, talk is cheap with the government.  
It has not supervised the way the money is spent.  
Even the last audit did not evaluate the results of the program. 
It simply evaluated the administration of the program. 
The government is blowing hot air when it talks about jobs being created. 
The fact is, it does not know for sure.  
One audit states: ``The sustainability results must be treated with caution. 
The estimates are still based on mere expectations, not real experiences''. 
There is no evaluation of that.  
Mr. Speaker, I am not an apologist for the provinces, unlike my colleague.  
I suggest that is evidence. 
It then sat on $500 million. 
Clearly, the Government of Canada transfers dollars. 
Maybe the member should get her facts straight.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
I would like to read the motion for the benefit of our audience. 
This motion comprises two key ideas. 
First, I would like to call for calm. 
I would appeal for calm and dignified behaviour. 
Yes, everyone wants the Prime Minister to go. 
However, the decision to do so is his. 
I think a certain amount of composure is necessary in politics.  
That said, I want to return to the two elements of the proposal before us.  
I remind members of Emploi-Quebec. 
I would like to remind government members of a number of facts. 
This is no small matter. 
Management indicators is the administrative term used. 
Of these project files, 66% contained no analysis or documentation. 
In politics, debates must not become personal. 
This is a most worrisome situation.  
Before getting into the health aspect of the motion, I could give some other examples. 
How many investigations are currently under way in Shawinigan? 
My colleague, the member for Frontenac-Megantic could tell me. 
I think they are up to four.  
What can we say about what happened in Rosemont? 
That said, members understand the essence of the motion. 
These figures are based on the official figures of the Department of Finance.  
We must be patient with government members. 
Five hundred million dollars is not inconsequential. 
Additional staff are also needed.  
It is one half of the budget for all CLSCs in Quebec. 
The purpose of this strategy is to relieve the pressure in our hospitals.  
I see people who are getting closer and closer to their golden years. 
Some of our parliamentary colleagues are getting there. 
I am thinking of our colleague from Willowdale- 
Mr. Real Menard: -the Secretary of State for International Financial Institutions- 
You are no spring chicken yourself.  
Seniors are those over 60 years of age. 
These people will want to stay in their community. 
It is important that the government invest in home support services.  
We do not need that.  
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
I listened quite carefully to what he had to say.  
Now they have added $1.5 billion to the grants and contributions.  
What profession are you in?  
I have a question for the Bloc member. 
We are looking at pre-election politics now. 
We are maybe only a year away from the next election. 
What is the Bloc's strategy to try to offset that?  
I would not like to be unparliamentary, but hon. members will agree. 
We are wholly dedicated to defending the interests of Quebec, with clear funding.  
I believe that it will continue to be present in the next election.  
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
But they are the good Quebecers. 
That takes a heck of a lot of gall. 
Quebec nurses went out on strike. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien:
Listen to them, they are not prepared to hear the truth. 
Each time we say something to them, they are not happy.  
Get the money out of Toronto. 
Send it to Quebec City. 
They have to stop insulting people. 
They say they are the good Quebecers, and we are the bad Quebecers. 
I cannot accept that. 
I find that really insulting.  
Mr. Speaker, I only have one thing to say to the hon. member. 
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I will try to tone it down just a little bit here. 
I actually find this quite humourous, especially coming from the government. 
The member is quite right. 
Now we are down to about 13%.  
What I would like to ask the member is this. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I would like to have an opinion from the member on this if I could.  
What was the number one recommendation in the Krever report? 
That all victims be compensated, regardless of fault. 
I say shame on this government. Shame on this bunch of sheep and followers.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Regina-Qu'Appelle.  
The Reform Party members do not care about the CHST. 
Let us make no mistake. 
Reformers are not concerned about increasing the CHST purse. 
Where was the Reform Party after the budget? 
It had its own little campaign going on. 
In the article he talks about health care and says: 
Therefore, the system needs more money. 
This was said by a Reform Party member. 
Let us sort this out. 
The member goes on to say: 
No public funds are used in the private clinics. 
The private system would in effect be strengthening the public system.  
Exactly what would that include? 
It would support contributions to the Canadian Blood Services of $355,000. 
The answer is not to attack the programs. 
As New Democrats we have supported job creation. 
We have been very clear on that. 
We support student employment. 
We support job development in areas of high unemployment. 
How many RCMP investigations do we have now? 
It is no longer a partnership. 
It is a total disgrace and Canadians know that. 
This Reform motion really does not change that.  
The biggest threat in that regard is the Reform Party which is crusading for privatization. 
It will not solve the problem for HRDC. 
It will not even help medicare. 
This motion simply will not do it. 
That is why we in the NDP will not support it. 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I listened with interest to what the member said. 
I can tell her that half of what she was saying is not right.  
It is quite interesting. 
Where does the hon. member think the money is going to come from? 
Perhaps she could clarify that situation.  
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his good and fair question.  
The member raised the question of where that money should come from. 
We have been very clear in our position. 
We have been very clear about that.  
I hope that answers the hon. member's question.  
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I totally agree with the member. 
She sees the Reform members for what they are.  
We transferred emergency funds to the provinces. 
We transferred $1.3 billion to Ontario. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's question. 
It is a good question as well.  
There would be a real partnership.  
It seems to me that the onus goes back to the government. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
It is good to see him back after a bit of an absence. 
I want to say a few words in the debate today. 
There are 12 first nations in my riding. 
I see the member for Wild Rose hanging his head in shame. 
Perhaps that is why he is not speaking in this debate. 
Why would it want to terminate that? 
Why does it want to decrease its budget by $355,000?  
There is another one. 
With pride, says the Secretary of State for International Financial Institutions. 
Hospitals have closed because of the cutbacks in federal spending. 
And he said it was done with pride.  
If it happens in Alberta, it will happen in Ontario with Mike Harris. 
The tax cut should be the reduction of the GST.  
In terms of cash transfers, that is 13% or 14%. 
We all hear about it. 
Liberal delegates were saying it the other day. 
The public opinion polls are saying it. 
We have the money and the resources to do it. 
There are a lot of people advocating it. 
Ralph Klein is saying the same thing in the province of Alberta. 
There have been cutbacks in the services that should be provided. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
These are all grants and contributions. 
This is not some obtuse theory. 
This is what is in the budget. 
This is what would be cut if the Reform Party's motion went forward. 
I could go on and on.  
Where would he find the money? 
Madam Speaker, I guess it depends on where one's priorities lie.  
The member sits on the finance committee as well. 
We had a difference in philosophy in terms of what taxes should be reduced.  
However, for some reason the Minister of Finance did not listen to that advice.  
That is where we would get the money. 
The government is out of sync in terms of public opinion. 
That is what most people want.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I am glad the hon. member missed me. 
When are they going to speak out against that kind of garbage?  
It is confirmation of your stupidity. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Madam Speaker, I will answer the question. 
I did not see the film. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I do not think it helps us in the House.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Madam Speaker, after that bit of dialogue I am really lost for words. 
I do not know how to follow it. 
I will be splitting my time with the hon. member for Chicoutimi. 
I also want to say that the PC Party supports this motion. 
Those offices do a lot of good work. 
They have excellent people working in them. 
It is not the regional offices; it is the management, the top brass at HRDC. 
Eleven per cent did not include a budget proposal. 
That money came out of our pockets and the pockets of our constituents. 
I think we should be responsible. 
I think we should be understanding. 
We support sensible programming. 
This is not about standing and saying that everything in HRDC is bad. 
This is not a complex issue. 
Let us look at the Liberals' reaction to it. 
That is a direct quote from the Prime Minister. 
Allegations are made of slush funds. 
Surely Canadians deserve the truth in all these allegations. 
When Canadians have a question they deserve an answer. 
It has never happened before. 
I am sharing my time with the hon. member for Chicoutimi. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
They would cut $900 million for the Canada Foundation for Innovation. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's statement. 
However I can only speak to the motion that is before us. 
That is a general statement. 
That is not a specific statement. 
I am specifically looking at HRDC. 
That is the $1.5 billion increase. 
It is specific to that department. 
It is not specific to certain elements of that department. 
It is specific to the general budget of that department. 
We should not reward incompetence. 
In the meantime we are going to cut your budget. 
We are not going to increase it''.  
That is not saying that there are not good programs within HRDC. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I enjoyed the intervention of the hon. member for South Shore. 
There was never a whisper about them.  
It fair makes me weep, it does. 
There is a meltdown in the department. 
Someone needs to be responsible. 
That person is the department head, the minister and the Prime Minister.  
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
People have to go outside the country for surgery. 
It has produced a country on the brink of dissension.  
The provocation must end. 
That is a quick summary of the country's financial state. 
When Pierre Elliott Trudeau arrived, there was no debt. 
It grew to $18 billion in 1974 and to $284 billion later on. 
What counts in economics is the multiplier. 
We passed the free trade agreement. 
They all voted against it. 
This is what the Minister of Finance has done.  
But that was not enough for them.  
People want money in their pockets. 
It is the only way to fight poverty. 
Right now, the government is not fighting poverty, it is fighting the poor. 
All those quarrels lead nowhere. 
Give me any item on the government's agenda.  
I have some news for them. 
They will get a referendum and then some.  
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
I have some good issues of conscience to raise with him.  
I would like to remind him that the consent of the provinces is involved. 
If he wants figures, we will give him some.  
We have reduced the debt to $573 billion. 
We have eliminated the deficit. 
There were tax increases. 
That is what they managed to do.  
Those are eloquent figures.  
The Conservatives never did anything of the kind.  
They talk about referendums. 
This is a Conservative saying this and promising another referendum? 
Madam Speaker, I have a few remarks for my colleague.  
We are not the ones talking about referendums. 
For weeks, the government has been talking about a possible referendum. 
Not a single people can stand being in prison. 
A real confederation should be a partnership.  
The hon. member talked about the unemployment rate. 
This abysmal result has been confirmed by the United Nations. 
I find that deplorable.  
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
Our health care system is on life support. 
This is not true, as each province covers different services.  
Those who cannot pay their premiums are not covered. 
Compounding this is the fact that people are waiting longer. 
The fifth principle, comprehensiveness, means that necessary services must be covered. 
Throwing more money at a broken system does not help. 
It will not get the job done. 
That audit revealed the following:
Here are some examples of where the money went. 
That was kind of like icing on the cake''.  
No money has been paid yet. 
The RCMP is investigating. 
The list goes on.  
What is there to show for it? 
We are deeply concerned about the future of health care in Canada. 
No one wants to see people suffer when they fall ill. 
No one wants an American style health care system in Canada.  
All Canadians should have timely access to essential health care services. 
We can no longer afford to be complacent. 
We must find the best solutions and implement them. 
The longer we delay, the more people will suffer. 
All we need is the courage to implement them.  
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
This is the year 2000. 
They were told that it was fail-safe. 
They bought into it and went in for blood transfusions. 
After the fact they found out that they had tainted blood. 
It has not put one dime toward the victims.  
Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for the question. 
I would like to read a couple of them. 
This one comes from a constituent in Coalhurst, Alberta. 
Their handling of the tax money of this country is a disgrace.  
there no accountability to the people that have put you in office? 
Dear Mr. Prime Minister: 
The letter states further: 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Their tax and spend philosophy is just not acceptable. 
People care about that. 
It is not sustainable. 
It is the Liberals who are breaking the Canada Health Act. 
It is the Liberals who are creating a multi-tier health care system. 
Other countries have modernized their health care systems. 
We are in the bottom third of industrialized countries when it comes to health care. 
It is the Liberals who have destroyed our health care system. 
They are the ones who are not living by the Canada Health Act. 
It is not an accessible system. 
There are waiting lists a mile long. 
To get to see a specialist one might wait three or four months. 
That is not accessible. 
Queue jumping is going on. 
It is not portable. 
Last year 76 items were delisted from health care. 
It being almost 2 p.m. we will now proceed to Statements by Members.  
PRINCESS PATRICIA'S CANADIAN LIGHT INFANTRY 
Mrs. Judi Longfield (Whitby-Ajax, Lib.):
For their efforts they were awarded three Victoria Crosses.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
It is time for Canada to endorse the national missile defence system.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):
The hon. member for Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies.  
JOURNEE INTERNATIONALE DE LA FRANCOPHONIE 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Middlesex, Lib.):
This year will be no different. 
Its playbill looks more like a study of the classics. 
I strongly encourage everyone to come along and join the celebrations.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, today is the first day of spring.  
Mr. Ivan Grose (Oshawa, Lib.):
In 1957 Michael Starr was named Minister of Labour. 
He also served as honorary colonel of the Ontario Regiment.  
He will not be forgotten.  
JOURNEE INTERNATIONALE DE LA FRANCOPHONIE 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Quebec will soon be a member of that group, as a country.  
UNITED KINGDOM PARLIAMENTARY DELEGATION 
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
It is a pleasure to have them here with us today.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
The people of Taiwan must be allowed to freely choose their own future, including independence.  
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
For several weeks now, floods in Mozambique have brought enormous suffering to its people. 
The floods have seriously jeopardized Mozambique's ability to feed its people.  
ALCAN'S JOB SHARING PROGRAM 
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
I beg the minister to review this file objectively. 
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
The government has failed producers. 
Canadian farmers, like Nick, need more than empty promises. 
They need a meaningful commitment from the government. 
Mr. Prime Minister, the message is simple:
If you do not support agriculture, quit eating.  
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE 
Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard-La Prairie, Lib.):
I wish to tell RCMP authorities how satisfied I am with this decision.  
LEADER OF BLOC QUEBECOIS

JOURNEE INTERNATIONALE DE LA FRANCOPHONIE 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Long life to the Francophonie and a good day to all of Canada's francophones.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the opposition leader for his very interesting question. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Only $1 billion, Mr. Speaker. 
Again, we are asking the minister to give a straight answer to the question. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Key EDC decision makers have close links to the Prime Minister. 
The chairman of the EDC is a long time Liberal ally of the Prime Minister. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
It should do better research than that.  
It therefore did not grant any subsidy to Amtrak either.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
The Prime Minister blabs on about the fact that he will protect Canada but- 
The hon. member for Edmonton North.  
The Prime Minister talks about values and sharing. 
He brags that he will protect Canada from Americanization. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
That is the nature of the corporation. 
That corporation does very good work. 
Canadians are very pleased with all the jobs that have been created that way.  
COUNCIL FOR CANADIAN UNITY 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the secretary of state obviously got the wrong program. 
He should let competent people reply to the questions.  
My question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
This amounts to $12.3 million. 
And it is unprecedented.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
The federal government provided the ammunition in 1996. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
It will never stand in the way of our protecting Canadian medicare. 
That is true in the case of Alberta and it is true across the country.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Twice before he has withdrawn the bill.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Could he tell us about the $1 billion in the Amtrak-Bombardier affair?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, allow me to be very clear.  
The Export Development Corporation does not give grants. 
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Then the minister denied the truth of that document. 
By the end of the day the department reversed its earlier statement.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
It was explained later by the deputy minister that a mistake had been made. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
The minister's little six point plan was supposed to clean up all these problems. 
There was not going to be problems like this any more. 
The hon. Deputy Prime Minister.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
The auditor general reviewed the six point program. 
He wants to see it carried out.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
The hon. member for Roberval.  
Mr. Speaker, I will start again.  
We have just had the figures from her department. 
In 1998, Placeteco had 81 employees. 
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We decided to continue the project and work with the company.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, really, there are limits. 
Jobs at Placeteco have even been lost, after the money was squandered. 
This money was diverted to pay a bank loan.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
She denied any investigation.  
The department promptly changed its story to back up the minister. 
Is that not all just a little too convenient?  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have just taken the House through the numbers. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
I think the government owes Canadians an explanation, and I would like to hear it.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I meant a junior official and I feel very badly about that mistake.  
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
There is no problem on our side.  
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Federal Bridge Corporation complies with all provincial and municipal regulations and bylaws. 
There is no problem.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not know the answer to that. 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
How can he make such a statement?  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering-Ajax-Uxbridge, Lib.):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
The hon. member for Calgary Southeast.  
THE ATLANTIC GROUNDFISH STRATEGY 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Who was in power at that time? 
I do not want to embarrass the hon. member. 
Mr. Speaker, you tell him who was in power.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
When did that minister become aware of this special internal audit? 
When did the government decide to do something about it? 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. gentleman is on a fishing expedition. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
In Nova Scotia, John Hamm is suggesting user fees. 
My question is for the Minister of Health. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the question still remains:
The minister is failing to answer the question. 
What is the answer?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
It will increase, not reduce, costs.  
It is a draft bill. 
Last week the premier was talking about possible amendments. 
The bill may be amended. 
We have not yet seen the regulations. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
However, some of the bands do have accountability problems. 
Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Secretary of State for Amateur Sport.  
Hon. Denis Coderre (Secretary of State (Amateur Sport), Lib.):
Finally, we want to increase- 
The hon. member for Lethbridge.  
THE ATLANTIC GROUNDFISH STRATEGY 
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I now have found the facts.  
The auditor general's report we took very seriously. 
The auditor general has the proof of our implementation.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
Telefilm had been kept abreast of CINAR's activities since August 1993. 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, nobody lied. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
These cuts have hurt Canadian communities and destroyed jobs. 
They have jeopardized affordable rail service. 
They have hurt northern communities that are dependent on VIA.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Every important government in the world conducts its business this way. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Today, the first day of spring, what is the plan? 
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to answer this question. 
It is the first one I have had in this millennium from the hon. member.  
We are working very hard. 
We have federal representatives meeting with first nations bands. 
In fact, we have already signed agreements with two of the bands. 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):
What is being done to rectify these conditions?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I certainly agree with my colleague. 
Canadian wine producers are indeed making worldclass wines.  
That will bring to a close our question period for today.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
The correction is made.  
Hon. Denis Coderre (Secretary of State (Amateur Sport), Lib.):
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have three petitions to present today.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
This petition was put together by students at Elkford Senior Secondary School. 
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam, Lib.):
One in every five children live in poverty. 
We must work together to improve the lives of these children who live in poverty.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions both dealing with the same subject. 
I will only read one of them.  
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
This petition contains some twenty signatures.  
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my second petition is similar to the one tabled by the NDP member.  
It deals with those people who deliver mail in rural areas. 
This petition contains some 20 signatures.  
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
This is a sentiment that I think we hear right across the country.  
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
I am glad to present this petition.  
Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin-Middlesex-London, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions to present.  
Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin-Middlesex-London, Lib.):
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the second petition is from rural route mail carriers. 
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
It is on the subject of child poverty.  
I think we have seen that the government has done just that.  
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
ALLOTTED DAY-CANADA HEALTH AND SOCIAL TRANSFER 
The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the amendment.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
They are the Kevorkians of health care.  
What are the solutions? 
One solution is obviously that of funding. 
There is a need to return that funding. 
One only has to visit hospitals across the country to find that out.  
We need to stop scaring people and stop using emotion. 
Let us make that clear and stop scaring seniors in particular.  
Let us talk about the waiting lists. 
Let us talk about technology and the shortage of specialists. 
Let us talk about the brain drain. 
In 25 years one in five Canadians will be over the age of 65. 
We need to fix the Canada Health Act. 
We need a results based health care system, one that is centred around the patient. 
Above all we have to encourage provinces to try pilot projects. 
It is not the way to build co-operation.  
Let us find some solutions.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Perhaps the hon. member could elaborate on that.  
Does he or does he not support Bill 11? 
We have to try new things. 
It should be a pilot project. 
We should try it.  
That is what is wrong. 
And if it does not work, we will try something else.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member talked about solutions. 
His first solution was to throw more funding at it.  
We agree 100% with that. 
Obviously that needs to be restored.  
Everybody has a right to do that. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
The answer is a big fat zero. 
The hon. member knows he must address his remarks to the Chair.  
It is multi-tier. 
Thirty per cent of patients in Rochester are Canadians who are paying. 
There is the fact that so many others can jump the queue.  
Obviously it is the government that has created the two tier health care. 
They are the ones in government, not us. 
And when we are, we will fix that health care system. 
There will be funds and we will review that program.  
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
I said I thought HRDC is very important. 
Health care is very important. 
I just heard the previous Reform member talking about it. 
There are substantial moneys being transferred.  
We will need to spend less on hospitals if the economy is actually functioning.  
We transferred those moneys. 
That is what it was for. 
That includes, by the way, health research. 
I have heard nothing. 
I just want to mention putting our elementary schools on the Internet. 
The government did that. 
We put every elementary school and all other schools on the Internet. 
It occupied two pages in those newspapers. 
People read it with great interest. 
These grants and contributions are very important to me. 
It is very important to me that these grants be properly managed. 
This is simply one list, the list for Peterborough. 
The first one is Community Opportunity and Innovation Network Peterborough. 
At least one of those companies has become an international company already.  
Among the many things it does it conducts apprenticeship programs. 
We see Junior Achievement, Kawartha Lakeshore, a widespread area. 
Again it is youth entrepreneurship that we see there. 
I know my time is limited. 
I could mention the John Howard Society, which I have just done. 
My point is that in Peterborough these are good programs. 
In Peterborough these programs are well administered. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, the member says the Reform Party wants to gut these programs. 
It is utter nonsense. 
A $13.3 billion program is pretty healthy. 
What are the government's priorities? 
Government members talk about more funds being spent on that. 
I think the government is completely out of touch with the people of Canada.  
Madam Speaker, I thank the member for her question. 
I was mentioning the grants in my riding. 
The Victorian Order of Nurses and Home Care get support from this. 
These are worthwhile, known programs. 
We heard the discussion about the bill in Alberta. 
These are important programs that are operating now. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
That has to set some sort of record.  
I do not think the hon. member for Peterborough has begun to understand the motion. 
We are not just talking about HRDC. 
That just happens to be the gout du jour measure.  
That is what the manure pile the member refers to contains.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
I am a farmer and still live on the family farm. 
It is quite something to hear Reformers talk about manure. 
All they are noted for is a lot of crap.  
Having said that, this particular motion is really insincere. 
It is replete with duplicity and hypocrisy.  
What did they say? 
They said that it would add zero dollars.  
They stand for two tier American style health care. 
Canadians, quite frankly, reject that. 
We are not going to take it. 
Canadians will reject it and the government stands firm.  
There are all kinds of ideas that need to be looked at. 
Three come to mind very quickly. 
They will take a look at how best to approach that very important area.  
We want to examine that.  
Canadians want the health care system to be accountable. 
We do not have to go very far to see that. 
They are always trying to chip away at the institutions of our great country. 
They tear at the very fabric of that great institution. 
The first thing they did was call in the limousine and move into Stornoway.  
What was one of the next things they did? 
Canadians see through that. 
The flag flap was another interesting debate. 
A fresh start, they say, a new way of doing business, they say. 
He was in Mexico sunning himself on the beaches. 
Canadians see through it. 
Reformers cannot even get their act together. 
We on the government side will continue to protect the values of Canada. 
Canadians look to us to provide that. 
We will continue to do that. 
Unlike the Reformers, we will do it with honour and with dignity for all Canadians.  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I have been listening very quietly here to a little bit of unparliamentary language. 
Coming from the most corrupt government in the history of Canada- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I believe the hon. member has just gone into debate. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
That will not work. 
This is the party that just called health care a bottomless pit. 
The motion is very straightforward. 
Canadians will have no part of it.  
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
Premier Harris today has half a billion dollars sitting in the bank. 
He can use it yesterday.  
Madam Speaker, the hon. gentleman makes a very good point. 
The Reformers are talking about $1.5 billion today. 
We put in $2.5 billion. 
They should be supporting the budget. 
They should have been supporting the budget, instead- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Resuming debate, the hon. member for Kelowna.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
I would like to address the motion which is before the House. 
It reads as follows: 
I would like to address a number of the accusations that were made. 
They want health care to be the number one priority.  
Third, I want to look at the boondoggle in HRDC.  
Let us be abundantly clear that this is the motion. 
That is our purpose. 
That is the direction we wish to go.  
People in Canada, hon. members included, want health care. 
There are a lot of things about the health care system that are excellent. 
There is duplication as far as the federal and provincial governments are concerned. 
Something needs to be fixed. 
Very closely allied to that is the business of money. 
We need to pay for that.  
At this point I cannot help but look at the history of this government. 
I want to read into the record exactly what has happened.  
In 1996-97 it was $14.8 billion, a reduction of $3.6 billion. 
In the 2000-01 budget, which we just received, it was increased by $1 billion. 
That is what we are being told.  
What kind of business is that?  
Does that not make a lot of sense? 
That is exactly what we ought to be doing. 
That is what we are talking about and that is why we are concerned.  
That is where it lies. 
That is where the dignity and the respect of the government comes into question.  
Why does it not tell the whole story? 
Why does it tell only half of it? 
Why does it tell only that part which sounds good? 
Why does it not tell the people the rest of it? 
Does it think that doctors do not know what has happened? 
They know exactly what has happened. 
Ask the ministers of health and the provincial premiers what has happened. 
They know what has happened.  
Look at the bank accounts. 
I want to move a little further into the area of grants and contributions. 
How is this money being spent? 
That is really important. 
That really is a frightening situation. 
Billions of taxpayer dollars are being spent. 
Where are they going? 
How are they being used? 
These are very critical issues.  
Let me give the House another example. 
I looked at the numbers on the list. 
What did I discover when I checked into it? 
The money did not go to Kelowna. 
The Business Development Bank of Canada received $250,000 from HRDC. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
It is pretty easy to balance the budget, simply by increasing taxes. 
That is not hard to do, and the Liberals have done that.  
But who balanced the budget? 
The taxpayer; not the good spending of the government.  
This is not idle talk. 
We need to do this through the reallocation of resources that we have. 
We do not want to throw more and more money at these things. 
That is what is happening. 
Mr. John Cannis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I am really confused. 
Is more money going to add more duplication? 
Is that what he is saying?  
He has always been confused. 
I raised two points. 
Number one, there is an administrative problem that has to be fixed. 
Number two, more money should be put into the system. 
I mentioned specifically technology and other things. 
These are not necessarily the same thing. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
We are not asking for new money. 
That is only the tip of the iceberg.  
Let me show what the government is also doing. 
Who runs the Export Development Corporation? 
Pat Lavelle, who has been a friend of the Prime Minister for 40 years.  
That is what we have a real problem with. 
We are not asking a lot. 
It is not going to give patients the care they require. 
They are only words. 
The health minister on March 17 said in the House: 
It is obvious that the status quo, the current situation is unacceptable. 
That is a real tragedy.  
This is not an academic exercise. 
That is why we hope the government will support the motion. 
We hope the government will deal with that.  
Part of the issue of solving a problem is to understand what the problem is. 
As time passes it will get wider and wider.  
Numerous examples across the country demonstrate that.  
That in essence is what the Canada Health Act is all about. 
It was never meant to be all things to all people. 
I think they meant well to do it because the principles are good. 
What do we need to do? 
When we talk about funding, one-third of all funds come from private services. 
It is all very important for people's health care.  
Some money needs to be put in. 
The issue of prevention needs to be discussed. 
It has been proven to work. 
It is a reality today. 
Let us make sure that we do not have an American style health care system.  
We talk about a national drug strategy. 
What we are doing now does not work. 
This country has a shortage of over 500 doctors a year. 
We are going to hit a brick wall in the near future. 
I ask members on the other side to reflect on this critical situation. 
In closing I ask members of all political parties to support this motion. 
It will give the provinces some urgent funding for these two critically important programs.  
We are not asking for new money. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
He has been up front about this. 
The member has been very clear on that. 
He wants to run for the leadership of the party based on that principle.  
It will weaken that system which is exactly what we saw in the United Kingdom.  
We have a lack of resources. 
That is the bottom line. 
We have to put patients first. 
We have to put patients over politics.  
First, the hon. member should recognize the scarcity which he articulated. 
We have a two tier system today.  
I do not want an American system. 
All those systems have distinct flaws. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The member opposite gave an example of nurses. 
The population over the age of 65 will double in the next 20 years. 
Yes, some management changes have to be made. 
Mr. Jerry Pickard (Chatham-Kent Essex, Lib.):
I want to make sure that he gets his time in.  
Every Canadian believes that the health care system is in disarray. 
We have heard of a shortage of doctors. 
We have seen small communities that do not have doctors. 
They control the institutions that train doctors. 
They have an opportunity to move an agenda which they are not doing.  
We must decide how to train more doctors. 
We must decide how to provide more hospital beds. 
We must decide how research can take place.  
The provinces are asking the federal government not to get involved in their administration. 
It is a tragic mess. 
It is an issue of proper planning and changing our approach. 
It is an issue of dealing with home care. 
Yet once we turn the dollar over to the provinces we lose total control. 
We have no control at all.  
We all know this.  
Then what does the poor get? 
No, that is not fair.  
Harris is not a person to be trusted in this business. 
Let me turn to the Reform motion. 
It does not make sense.  
That appears to be a pretty big two-face to me.  
Let us stop to think about the positions Reformers take. 
That is why the Reform Party will never be the government of the country. 
Reformers bounce from pillar to post. 
They change with the drop of a hat. 
I have difficulty with what Reformers are proposing today. 
This year with all expenditures put together it will be $39 billion. 
There is a twisting of the truth, and that is too bad. 
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I listened closely to what the hon. member had to say. 
Madam Speaker, I am really pleased to answer that question. 
Reform Party members used to be Tories, Conservatives. 
I remember Brian Mulroney led them. 
They were here in the House. 
They had the same right wing agenda then as they have today. 
They said day after day the Liberals tax and spend. 
Are we proud of cutting? 
It had to be done and there is no question about it.  
They say ``We are going to get the economy rolling correctly''. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
I believe we do not have the same numbers. 
It all depends on the analysis one is looking at. 
Madam Speaker, the numbers I have come from official government documents. 
We added to that $1.2 billion this year. 
The people on this side of the House have said ``We have to plan''. 
We have to work with the provinces, which control the health budgets. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
First, I want to comment on the HRDC side of the equation. 
As time has gone on the numbers have been refined substantially.  
By any criteria whatsoever, those were not audits.  
Subsequent to the flagging of those files, auditors were sent in. 
Canadians should have that assurance.  
There are also ongoing RCMP investigations. 
There was a big story that Wal-Mart got a big grant. 
That was not the case.  
There was also the case of McGill University. 
The proper documentation was not within the file. 
He was actually knighted by Queen Elizabeth. 
We spoke about the importance of our health care system. 
That was according to Health Canada in 1996. 
That is the crux of the issue.  
The important thing is to determine whether we are getting good value for our money.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
I can readily understand his sensitivity with regard to that particular department. 
There are probably some useful programs. 
However, too much of it is for friends of the party opposite:
I have the numbers here. 
That is all we are asking. 
It is a pretty straightforward motion.  
Every member of parliament is subject to those rules. 
The member mentioned some companies, SNC-Lavalin and Bombardier. 
He did not mention Nortel. 
How about Pasteur-Merieux-Connaught? 
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Surrey North.  
People received less service. 
Beds closed and hospital services were reduced.  
The province did not know what to do. 
It reorganized the whole system. 
Health care of all things. 
I spent a lot of time working on the health care issue. 
Being a municipal leader at that time I had lots of town hall meetings. 
The province did not really move in that direction. 
The problems still exist today.  
These organizations employ approximately one million healthcare providers and serve Canadians across the country. 
They are governed by trustees who act in the public interest. 
2. Applying a growth factor of the cash component of the CHST.  
Therefore money is one of the solutions. 
It is ironic that people do pay for their health care. 
There are lots of services. 
The OECD standard is 75:25. 
It is time to put more money back into the health care system. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Certainly the government has restored all the transfers. 
We could go over the same old stuff. 
We did reduce the transfers but they have now been completely restored.  
We have been doing more of that now that we have topped up health care. 
About half a billion dollars is still sitting there not being utilized.  
Let me quote a few numbers here. 
Both the Liberals and the Progressive Conservatives were responsible.  
Back in 1972 our national debt was $16 billion. 
When the Liberals came to power in 1983, the national debt was $160 billion. 
In other words, it climbed from $16 billion to $160 billion. 
The cause of that is that we have borrowed too much money over the years.  
It is still too high. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I need clarification from the Reform Party. 
What exactly is it proposing with respect to an alternative health care model?  
We have heard the leader of the Reform Party call for a user fee. 
Which one of these positions is the current position of the Reform Party?  
Public health care does not provide these things. 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
It is in a crisis. 
I believe there is one very fundamental reason for this.  
Is that not special? 
By 2003-04 that cumulative total is expected to be about $35 billion.  
In 1977 federal cash transfers paid 19 cents of every health care dollar spent. 
What are some of the realities of the Canadian health care system today? 
Cuba and North Korea. 
The current system is just not sustainable and the government knows it. 
Again there are some very simple reasons for this. 
Simply put, Canadians are living longer and the population is getting older. 
Again the current system is just not sustainable.  
What about the costs related to new technologies? 
That is a whole other debate.  
What is the government's answer? 
In 1996-97 they were $2.84 billion. 
The TJF was $100 million per year. 
Yet the ministry has refused to do a forensic audit. 
In fact the minister even refused to answer my question last week.  
The spotlight is currently on HRDC. 
I urge all members to support the motion.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
The report came out in early 1997.  
What evidence does he have?  
Madam Speaker, the bottom line is that the provinces are starved for cash. 
I know the waiting list. 
I know the problems in my own province and in my own community.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
People are asking that health care be restored. 
We acknowledge the gap that still exists. 
That is obviously something that has to be considered for the future. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Maybe the member would comment. 
Are those the kinds of initiatives he would cut out of the budget?  
There are far too many areas of waste in the country.  
I just rattled off a few of them which came from my constituents. 
There is much waste in the country. 
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with a colleague. 
Our position is that both the federal and provincial levels have important roles to play. 
We understand the need for this balanced approach and so do Canadians.  
Here is a good example. 
This letter says it well. 
There is a role for both levels of government in social policy. 
These are not government MPs I am quoting. 
These are caring Canadians who work with individuals that need are help. 
Of course we should not, at least not as far as this government is concerned.  
I cannot support it either.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
And I am going to open it wider still. 
They are not the only ones who are dismayed by these results. 
We are upset about it too. 
The minister acknowledges responsibility. 
We are not happy about it and we plan to fix it.  
Accompanying that there has been an unprecedented release of information. 
The member opposite talks about this as a scandal. 
I am glad to have an opportunity to comment on that word. 
The history of this country does have scandals. 
This is not one of them. 
The opposition is not alone in its virtue.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
I think there is.  
I am not saying there are not problems. 
But should we throw out the proverbial baby with the proverbial bath water? 
I have yet to hear them. 
We know that the mentality of the Reform Party is provincial. 
We know that Reform would turn over the entire health care system. 
Reform members have called for the dismantling of the Canada Health Act. 
Canadians understand that is the role of the federal government. 
We need to look at them. 
Do they make sense? 
Are they taking away opportunities for Canadians? 
We think that is wrong. 
I speak from personal experience. 
We go to a hospital in my community. 
There is dust in our hospitals.  
I know that the men and women who work in those hospitals are overworked. 
What is the problem? 
We have cut your taxes''. 
Meanwhile they increase the debt.  
Even the premier of Quebec has recently jumped on the tax cut band wagon. 
He is afraid he is going to get left behind. 
Yet they cut health care services. 
What the debate should really be about is who is delivering what. 
That is what our health minister is talking about. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
We will try to fit in three questions and the responses.  
That is the responsible thing to do.  
Is there unanimous consent to table the documents as requested?  
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
They happened to use it in the bowling alley. 
It is simply not telling the whole story. 
We cannot say it is a lie. 
It is not the truth.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
I want to go back to the trust fund. 
They have the audacity to lecture me.  
Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a couple of brief points. 
They are actually higher. 
That is a fact. 
The member can look at the chart.  
They have a responsibility to deliver health care services. 
I do not think either one of those is a satisfactory solution. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I think the member owes an apology to the House. 
In fact the transfer payments in 1993 were $18.8 billion.  
It sounds like a point of debate to me. 
I am afraid the hon. member knows that. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
He said that the motion was to take money out of. 
It is not a motion to take money out of. 
This is a motion to deny the increase. 
Why should we deny the increase? 
Why should the increase be forgone?  
The issue of the scandal is not the programs. 
The Reform party supports the Canada Health Act. 
The Liberals do not honour the Canada Health Act. 
That is two tier health care. 
Those provinces and their Workers' Compensation Boards are queue jumping because of this Liberal government. 
People are being forced to go Rochester. 
Whose money is it? 
It will not let the provinces get away with actually managing their own money. 
I have heard it all day. 
Give me a break.  
There are seven more police investigations which are known to be going on elsewhere. 
Let us look at the justice minister's riding. 
Where did the vast majority, two-thirds of the money go in Alberta? 
She got $2.6 million of the $3.8 million. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
How is that for starters?  
We have interest rates that are at their lowest in 16 or 17 years. 
I wonder if he could put those into perspective when he responds.  
Madam Speaker, I certainly can. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I could agree to that. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
At the time, the minister answered: 
This is one of the problems we are experiencing these days.  
The Prime Minister finally realized it.  
People will get about $3.50.  
People will continue to live in poverty. 
The Liberals have yet to understand the problem in Atlantic Canada. 
Young people do not qualify. 
Will this government understand once and for all? 
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
One is that every hour of work is covered. 
Canadian women have made significant gains in the labour market. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
The scandal could involve between $1 billion and $3 billion. 
Here is the number for the public. 
It is 1-888-567-5844.  
There is another toll free number for members. 
I must wait 30 days before I get any answers. 
The parliamentary secretary is in the House to respond. 
I fully expect that she will read me an answer prepared by her officials. 
Tonight, I am accusing the Liberal government of trying to conceal the truth. 
Finally, I am accusing the government of patronage.  
That money is used for patronage.  
What did the government do? 
Is that not patronage?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am sorry to interrupt the member, but his time has expired.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Of the people who have paid premiums, 79% received benefits.  
The grant was made for activity in the city of Montreal. 
That has nothing to do with patronage. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The motion to adjourn the House is deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.30 p.m.)
