EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 58 
Monday, February 28, 2000 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
CANADA POST CORPORATION ACT 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
I want to state from the outset some of the problems. 
It is important to identify what is happening with the rural route mail couriers. 
That is why they are so frustrated. 
Something needs to be done.  
Clearly, I do not believe that is what they want.  
That is what we should be focusing on. 
Clearly, this bill does not do that.  
I would submit that they are not being treated fairly either. 
In fact it would probably make it much worse. 
That is it in a nutshell, much as it is done in the private sector. 
I cannot imagine anything so ridiculous.  
I cannot add much more. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
They are not, in any way, shape or form, considered under the Canada Labour Code. 
He also said that costs would escalate. 
It restricts them in terms of their economic lives.  
That is not what we are pressing for. 
We live in a democracy. 
Canada Post in past years has made a tremendous amount of money in profit. 
A lot of it came from rural route mail couriers across the country. 
We would all be happier for it.  
Many Liberal members come from rural ridings. 
They must speak with these people on a daily basis, I am sure. 
We may even applaud the Liberals for their effort on this very rare occasion.  
The question is whether or not there are fairness and equity in today's government. 
We have now passed into the new millennium. 
It is an important initiative. 
Their major link to government is through Canada Post, through the mail system. 
That is most unfortunate.  
The bill should have been presented many years ago. 
Basically what do RRMCs want? 
Why is it that Canada excludes that? 
The Liberals could even use it as an election ploy. 
Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
I know all members join with me in paying this tribute.  
To some this essential service is taken for granted. 
Let us examine very briefly the wording of subsection 13(5) which states: 
These conditions are spelled out in the contract documentation. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. 
Rural route contractors are treated and compensated fairly.  
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
We have been dealing with this issue as a party since before the last election. 
Where would the money come from to make this change?  
This is not a change my party is prepared to support.  
Let me however set our opposition to the specific measure proposed by the hon. member. 
These include the following. 
Rural routes will be contracted individually. 
Contractors will be compensated for these changes.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
In many ways it is a telling piece of legislation.  
Increasingly the government tends to cater toward urban Canada. 
We have to ask why. 
We are in a new millennium. 
Surely we do not have to go back to 1920 or 1930.  
For those people the rural route mail carriers represent a vital link.  
They do the same kind of work so it cannot be justified on that ground. 
What do they face because they do not have the same rights?  
Their employment can be terminated on 90 days notice. 
There are no benefits. 
They are denied bereavement leave. 
In the year 2000 in this country.  
There is the tendering process. 
There is no compensation for that. 
They do all kinds of extra work and they get no benefit for it. 
It comes down to why rural communities are treated differently. 
It is not just the NDP arguing this. 
The government has often taken rulings of the courts and incorporated them into legislation. 
The Canada Labour Relations Board is no different. 
It is not partisan, at least we hope it is not. 
It gives us some rational guidelines to go by. 
I would ask them to do so and support the legislation.  
I apologize to the House.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
He has decided now to support them by tabling this legislation.  
I would think this is not at all what we want to do here.  
That is important to note.  
I have and I think they are important to listen to. 
The good news is that Canada Post is listening. 
The corporation has taken concrete steps and measures to resolve their concerns. 
I urge all members not to support the bill. 
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
Most of them are working at minimum wage to deliver mail in rural Canada. 
I feel they have been mistreated for a number of years by Canada Post.  
Something has to change. 
Basically there are no rules. 
I commend the member for Winnipeg Centre for bringing forward this bill.  
Alice Boudreau represents the Organization of Rural Route Mail Couriers. 
She represents drivers from all across Canada. 
They are not living in million dollar houses. 
They bid for the right to deliver mail. 
They bid against other people in society. 
In the real world there is nothing wrong with that. 
Each one of us bids for a position in the House. 
We put our reputations and our careers on the line. 
That is true for every member of parliament.  
That is what Canada Post does. 
I do not think a union is the key to solving the problem.  
Yes, we know it is.  
I know that the member who interjected is a union representative. 
There is nothing wrong with that. 
None of us here is unionized. 
It is one of the most non-unionized provinces in the country.  
Let us re-engineer this arrangement between our rural drivers and Canada Post. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
CANADIAN INSTITUTES OF HEALTH RESEARCH ACT 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
There is nothing in this bill that is the least bit reassuring.  
That the debate be now adjourned.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
This motion is in order.  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
(The House divided on the motion, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the motion lost.  
Resuming debate, the hon. member for Rimouski-Mitis.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
In many respects, she finds it just as unacceptable to Canadians. 
Bill C-13 is important to us. 
However, as it is worded, it concerns us. 
The government's bill ignores the distribution of jurisdictions. 
Is this government that afraid of true decentralization?  
However, it is well known that research grants are awarded on the basis of merit. 
The Bloc Quebecois does not, however, say yes no matter what the price.  
We all accept, and understand, the urgency. 
But care must be taken to ensure that democracy does not suffer once again. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
I notice that she moved some amendments.  
Other countries have such a thing. 
The government should welcome these amendments. 
That is a point which really needed to be made. 
I am very glad the member for Winnipeg North Centre made that point. 
Clearly it is a conflict of interest situation. 
We can see how this could be a disaster.  
Certainly it would be a disaster. 
That is a glaring oversight.  
It is Bill C-91 all over again.  
It is common sense.  
One of my colleagues mentioned Bill C-91. 
That nightmare surfaces again. 
We all know how powerful the pharmaceutical lobby is already. 
Like it does with the Liberal caucus.  
Where do the Liberals stand on this? 
Where does the Reform Party stand on this?  
We support this bill. 
We support the idea of the Canadian institutes for medical research. 
We want Canada to be a centre of excellence for medical research. 
We welcome the opportunity.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
Many of us, myself included, have put forward amendments. 
I have put forward two dozen amendments. 
We could support it. 
That is where this whole exercise falls flat. 
We do not have a whole lot to be proud of. 
Let me give the House an example. 
The Prime Minister will determine who the president of the council will be. 
Why would the government not consider rejigging that formula? 
The Prime Minister has been around this place longer than any other member of parliament. 
Only when he takes office does the tune change. 
There are over 50 amendments to the bill. 
It simply wants to get the bill passed. 
We are suggesting that we could pass a better bill.  
This is reminiscent of the Liberal way of doing things. 
Let us get on with it and continue to engage in debate. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
These institutes are to replace the existing medical research centres.  
You can see how tricky the Prime Minister was at the time, in 1978. 
At the time, I was a member of the Parti Quebecois. 
We will try to talk members opposite into accepting them. 
We are concerned because we wonder whether Quebec will get its fair share.  
The federal government's track record is not good. 
This is why we have serious concerns. 
This is because today is budget day.  
The Minister of Finance has made deep cuts to provincial transfers. 
Earlier I was listening to a conversation. 
I was reading the newspapers on the weekend. 
What is going on at HRDC is scandalous. 
But it is not-it is further away. 
He even took his orders from Colonel Khadafi.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
The Bloc Quebecois' message is aimed primarily at him. 
I will quote from the bill. 
As it now stands, it refers to an interest in health. 
We want this research institute to really deal with research.  
This statement was not made by a mean separatist. 
No one wants the wheel to be reinvented. 
The government's bill is ignoring the distribution of powers. 
It negates the federal principle.  
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Human induced global change is a self-evident fact. 
Just look out the window today. 
Glaciers around the globe are becoming smaller. 
At the same time, more people are finding it difficult to breath. 
Our atmosphere has changed and is still changing at a frightening rate.  
Let us meet our Kyoto commitments.  
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, Canadians deserve a fair and just legal system. 
Since then Patrick Kelly has been fighting for a new trial.  
We are still waiting for the minister's response.  
Canadians, including Patrick Kelly, expect nothing less.  
Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):
Melanie worked hard to reach these heights. 
Canada is proud of the achievements of this young Quebecer. 
Brome-Missisquoi and all of Canada celebrate her victory.  
Melanie is an example of tenacity and perseverance for young people. 
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
Young Canadians have an important role to play in Canada's future. 
Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard-La Prairie, Lib.):
SCOTT TOURNAMENT OF HEARTS 
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
What a great inspiration she is to others.  
CANADIAN NATIONAL SOCCER TEAM 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
CANADIAN NATIONAL SOCCER TEAM 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
CANADIAN NATIONAL SOCCER TEAM 
Mr. Rick Limoges (Windsor-St. 
WORLD SPRINT SPEED SKATING CHAMPIONSHIPS 
Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):
Congratulations to these exceptional Canadians who make us all proud.  
CANADIAN NATIONAL SOCCER TEAM 
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
This victory will give a huge lift to the whole soccer movement in the country. 
We are all very proud of this great accomplishment.  
DEVELOPING YOUNG CANADIAN TALENT 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
It is a well known fact: the truth hurts.  
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Canadians can expect great- 
The hon. member for Kootenay-Columbia.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
To this point the commission has spent between $3 million and $4 million. 
Canadians understandably are asking why. 
The Prime Minister does not understand the difference between a dictatorship and a democracy. 
In a dictatorship the executive directs the enforcers. 
In a democracy there is a firewall separating the executive from the enforcers.  
The Prime Minister fails to understand this fundamental concept. 
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
What about Canadian content? 
The CBC continues to bleed from a thousand cuts.  
It is time to get with it. 
Who wants to be multi-billionaires? 
Who will pay down the road? 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
All members of all parties are aware of these programs. 
We do not intend to stop that. 
We want to make sure that the work is done properly, but we want to- 
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, let us see how these programs help people.  
The Right Hon. Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
No doubt today it will be the same.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Those are the reasons the Canadian people are still confident in this government. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
There are billions of dollars at stake here. 
How can Canadians be sure that there will even be any documents left to audit?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
There were 10,000 documents given from the files of HRDC. 
We have been completely open.  
Some auditing is being done in every department. 
Now we have four reports a year plus auditing in every department.  
That is why my ministers and I will do everything we can.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it was a truckload to be sure.  
Could it be that the next HRDC- 
I would ask hon. members to stay away from words like fabricated. 
They just incite the House. 
I would ask the hon. member to please put her question.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, members opposite are all the same. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The hon. leader of the Bloc Quebecois.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Two of these are being investigated by the mounted police, as the Prime Minister says. 
I find this worrisome. 
I am concerned that the scope of the problem is being discovered bit by bit.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, people can make insinuations. 
It is like the request approved by the member for Rosemont. 
That request was never approved by my office. 
No one in my office was informed of that request.  
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
If this not a good old Liberal method of burying embarrassing affairs?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is totally incorrect. 
What we have done is look at the files. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
What is the truth of the matter? 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have multiple representations from the individuals involved in this file. 
As I say again, it is extremely complex. 
That is being done and we will take action on its findings.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I looked at that possibility. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am in the House of Commons every week. 
Please address all questions and responses through the Speaker. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The RCMP will do its job well, as is well known in Canada.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let us be clear. 
We have made that information public to Canadians. 
We are now implementing a program that will fix the problem.  
That is what Canadians are asking us to do. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
That is the insult.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is no bluster on this side. 
Clearly we are taking action on this problem. 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Can the Prime Minister tell us why Mr. Vallerand should stay quiet?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
That is the position that all members of the House would adopt. 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Now, of course, he is invited to the APEC commission for an interview.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Is this not a source of concern to the minister?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is incorrect in her assertion. 
I would say to her again that we are taking this issue very seriously. 
We are reviewing our active files.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, membership certainly does have its privileges. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I do know this. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
He should be very careful in the kinds of allegations he makes.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let me try this again, for the umpteenth time.  
I am the Minister of Human Resources Development Canada. 
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):
Hon. Maria Minna (Minister for International Cooperation, Lib.):
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
My question is for the HRD minister. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
How can the member make such incredible assertions?  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
He ran for the NDP in the last election.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The hon. member for Acadie-Bathurst.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the same minister. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
CANADIAN INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCY 
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Indeed, these two companies received a total of $2.4 million.  
My question is for the Minister for International Cooperation. 
Hon. Maria Minna (Minister for International Cooperation, Lib.):
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Hon. Maria Minna (Minister for International Cooperation, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is work that we do in developing countries. 
There are also very large ones.  
We are doing projects in developing countries to assist them. 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this issue is very dear to my heart. 
I firmly believe that no child should be denied an education.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
That is what I am hearing. 
As such, that question is out of order.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
The RCMP has been investigating since June 1999. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
Our head offices go south and American plutonium comes north.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Hon. Elinor Caplan (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to the question. 
He and I both know that is the time when his question will be answered.  
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
What is the state of amateur sports in Canada?  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ind. Ref.):
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the losses are far too great as my colleague knows. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
What does the Prime Minister have to hide?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member should read all of the report. 
I gave a very good explanation.  
The hon. member for Drummond.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this file is being reviewed with the member of parliament. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The question was in two parts. 
I ask, Mr. Speaker, if you would review the blues. 
If it is necessary, I will get back to the House.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
We need to know that before- 
As I said, I will review the blues. 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
NATIONAL DEFENCE AND VETERANS AFFAIRS 
Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Fanshawe, Lib.):
We will deal with that later.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
ELECTORAL BOUNDARIES READJUSTMENT ACT 
Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. 
I ask you to recognize her, as is her right as a member of parliament.  
I did not see anyone rise when I called for motions. 
I am sorry, I looked, but I did not see anyone.  
If the hon. member for Quebec has a motion, I will hear her.  
Does the hon. member wish to move a motion on the notice paper?  
I will put the motion to the House.  
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT AND STATUS OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
It also deals with child poverty in society.  
The past 10 years can be summed up as a missed opportunity. 
This committee submitted three reports. 
This is the first conclusion that the Bloc reached.  
The provinces have less money. 
We also see that there is a tendency towards program homogenisation. 
The across the board programs of the Canadian government are seldom applicable to our communities. 
We wanted to use other financing channels. 
What does the Canada health and social transfer do? 
This is a lot of money. 
I will give an idea of what could be done with $21 billion. 
This is how it would affect the everyday life of each citizen. 
They would get better support.  
All this was ignored by the committee. 
Since 1993, we have been in a major social deficit. 
Families, especially poor families, are the ones who are suffering.  
That impact can be seen every day. 
In 1989, maybe the intentions were good. 
There is no vision of what some provinces have already put in place. 
There is no figure put on that strategy, and that is dangerous. 
According to some federalists, this is not what federalism is all about.  
It hampers local communities' initiatives. 
Do you know what some ministers tell us? 
They say ``Communities are asking us to get involved. 
We want to get involved''.  
I tell them there is a difference between involvement and investment. 
To invest is to respect the provinces' areas of jurisdiction. 
It needs room to manoeuvre in its budget.  
In conclusion, I move that the debate be now adjourned.  
Having moved the main motion, she cannot move that the debate be adjourned.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
They ought to be returned to Canadian authorities.  
Mr. Speaker, in that case, I would seek a ruling from you.  
Applications for emergency debate are by their nature for emergencies. 
What may be an emergency on Friday may not be an emergency on Monday. 
Those applications traditionally have had to be resubmitted. 
Mr. Speaker, I respect your decision. 
However, I have one other matter.  
I seem to be the victim of a procedural quagmire. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the government tightened the eligibility criteria. 
The problem is that these criteria are very difficult to meet. 
To be eligible, more hours of work are required. 
This is the first thing we noticed. 
Let us look at where the money came from. 
I cannot understand why the government member would ask me this question. 
The so-called black hole of spring could be remedied.  
This is particularly true for seasonal workers.  
We have been very vigilant with respect to the relaxing of eligibility criteria. 
They are required to accumulate inordinate hours of work to be eligible.  
I would like to conclude by saying that I am expecting questions from colleagues.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Please bear with me, because this was an excellent speech. 
I would like to ask her a question in three parts. 
Unfortunately, the number of children in poverty went up instead of down. 
However, the same party was at the heart of another scandal in 1984. 
Companies were disappearing, but some of them had never done any research and development.  
This afternoon, we will hear a budget speech. 
I am sorry but I must interrupt the hon. member, since her time has expired. 
The hon. member for Mississauga South.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
I think these are important areas for us to look at.  
We can take medical or dental expenses as an example. 
I raise that point for discussion with the House. 
Those are provincial decisions. 
The member from the Bloc Quebecois raised a couple of issues which bear some comment. 
The member also talked about social housing and homelessness. 
She will well know that this is not a simple problem. 
One aspect of this has to do with children. 
FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF THE MINISTER OF FINANCE 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.) moved: 
That this House approve in general the budgetary policy of the government.  
The details of the measures are contained in the documents. 
The size of our economy will surpass the trillion dollar mark this year. 
The deficit is a matter of history. 
Inflation remains in check. 
The government debt burden is declining. 
Canada's foreign debt burden is declining. 
Consumer and business confidence are at near record levels. 
Three years ago that trend began to turn around. 
This is clearly good news. 
That plan has worked. 
Our challenge now is to build on our new-found strength. 
Canadians know that this is the time to act. 
Nor will these forces pause for us to prepare. 
The challenges are here and the opportunities are now.  
Second, how can we provide every Canadian with an equal opportunity to succeed?  
In this budget, we outline our response to those questions.  
First, we will continue to provide sound fiscal management. 
After all, they worked for it. 
And fourth, together we will build an economy based on innovation. 
Today, that is what we are continuing to do. 
Nor is that the end of the story.  
As a result, equalization transfers as well are now at an all-time high. 
Mr. Speaker, let me now turn to our plan for building a stronger economy. 
These projections were sound. 
Let me now turn to the debt. 
Canada has not just eliminated its deficit. 
Beyond this the downward track must continue. 
Let there be no doubt, we will control spending. 
Within our borders we must strengthen our immigration system. 
In each of these areas we are providing additional funding.  
Let us address the new economy. 
The result is the most significant economic transformation of our time.  
Our goal as a nation must be to lead the way. 
But there is nothing inevitable about our progress. 
Government in turn must reduce the regulatory burden. 
What must government do? 
It must equip Canadians to succeed. 
Research and development is the foundation for new products and processes. 
Today, we take another important step.  
Gene research will save the lives of many. 
It will enhance the lives of still more. 
It is a fundamental value beyond debate, beyond discussion. 
Technology is key, make no mistake.  
Accordingly, this budget takes a number of targeted actions.  
First, we are announcing today the creation of a sustainable development technology fund. 
This budget gives effect to both proposals.  
There is another aspect of our plan that is of critical importance. 
Let me just say that we have heard them loud and clear.  
We hope to have an agreement by the end of the year. 
Our objective is simple. 
This budget honours that commitment.  
These initiatives focus on the needs of children. 
They deal with the services and the programs their families require. 
The principles underlying that package are as follows.  
The plan we are presenting today provides real and significant tax relief. 
It is anchored in two fundamental structural changes.  
We will restore full indexation to the personal income tax system immediately.  
Furthermore, while these amounts provide significant relief, they are only the start. 
In future budgets when we can do more, we will.  
In future budgets, when we can do more, we will.  
These structural changes mean substantial tax relief for all Canadians.  
For families, we are doing more.  
Ask any parent whose child plays sports or takes music lessons. 
Ask any parent trying to save for their child's education.  
The cost of raising children is substantial. 
Amounts for each additional child will keep pace with these increases. 
Most significantly, nine out of ten Canadian children will benefit from these improvements.  
In 1999 we eliminated the 3% surtax.  
Today we are also committing to eliminate the last of these legacies.  
For planning purposes, we have assumed that they will fall to $2.00 in 2004.  
This budget proposes action on three fronts. 
This budget does all of these. 
It also, however, includes one further measure.  
Let me give you some specific examples of how this budget will benefit Canadians.  
First, indexation will help lower income Canadians most. 
That is a savings of more than $1,600.  
This represents a savings of $1,244.  
That is a savings of more than $1,500.  
It is a budget that makes innovation the driving force of our economy. 
It puts more money into post-secondary education and health care. 
It acts to preserve our environment and to capture the opportunities it affords. 
It speaks to our values by recognizing the importance of children.  
This budget restores indexation to the Canadian tax system. 
We must lay the foundation on which they will stand. 
We must preserve the values on which they will build.
