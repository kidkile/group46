GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
Mr. Speaker, if the House gives its consent, I move: 
LABELLING OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS 
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I have the pleasure this morning of tabling two petitions.  
CANADA POST CORPORATION ACT 
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Canadian Alliance):
They ask that the government take action to make sure this is put into law.  
RIGHTS OF THE UNBORN 
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I concur.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
One has 715 signatures and the other has 220 signatures.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
ALLOTTED DAY-DEPARTMENTAL AUDIT REPORTS 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Canadian Alliance) moved: 
This is an extremely serious matter. 
We should not be having to ask that those reports be tabled. 
It is a shameful situation.  
Instead they are being hidden and kept under wraps. 
We have had a very difficult time receiving them. 
Again we should not have to ask that. 
Why are we asking for that? 
The department kept saying it had to translate them. 
It is completely unacceptable. 
The government has gone into an alarming bunker mode. 
Big brother is watching. 
We have some very troubling developments in the way the government is operating. 
This will be our concern for debate today. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
It will not work. 
That is not being done. 
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join in this most important debate. 
The motion before us should not be necessary. 
It is appalling that the official opposition must be forced to bring this motion forward. 
No, the minister released the damning audit for one simple reason. 
The audit paints the Ministry of Human Resources Development in a terrible light. 
Even the spin doctors cannot control this one. 
Of that I am certain. 
We only wait for the day when it occurs.  
We all know the access to information guidelines. 
The government maintains a vast database of information on everything that it does. 
I recognize the benefits of the Internet in this part of the equation. 
The guidelines also state that the citizens of Canada have access to these documents. 
All requests, by law, must be completed within 30 days.  
Let us look at the reality of the situation. 
Does the government meet its own guidelines? 
Unfortunately the government does not even come close. 
While many requests are submitted, the results are often extremely slow in returning. 
That should not come as a great surprise. 
However, some responses are as much as 90 days overdue.  
This is not acceptable. 
Furthermore, it is not right. 
In conclusion, I move: 
That the motion be amended by replacing the number ``15'' with the number ``30''.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The question is on the amendment. 
The hon. member for Waterloo-Wellington.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened with some interest to the member for Nanaimo-Cowichan. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I urge you to not allow other people to distort that.  
I had pointed out the name Canadian Alliance to the hon. member for Waterloo-Wellington. 
I do not think we had better go there. 
I really could not''.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The last presentation was made by the member for Nanaimo-Cowichan. 
I know the hon. member for Waterloo-Wellington will want to pose his question quickly.  
I was interested in the first ballot that went out from the United Alternative.  
We are speaking now of audits, transparency and accountability. 
It really is outrageous.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I feel very slighted by the member. 
He is not talking at all about what I had to say. 
I will, Mr. Speaker. 
Your judgment, as always, is dead on. 
I wonder if he agreed that loans to the- 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
I think it would be more appropriate for the House.  
We deal with access in audit reports in a timely fashion. 
Let us think about that for a minute. 
It would add time by approximately 15 days. 
It is appropriate to duly note that. 
It was a very important document. 
It indicated and undertook a comprehensive examination of the internal audit function.  
That is important to note. 
In the audit that came down there were a number of recommendations. 
I think Canadians expect that. 
I would like to do so for the record but I cannot.  
Why did we do that? 
By way of conclusion I want to say that the motion as presented is frivolous. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):
He cannot seem to get much right today.  
At any rate, I would like to ask him a couple of questions. 
The member said that the motion was vexatious, redundant and all of those things. 
I agree with that. 
We put it forward because it is a response to the actual facts.  
Why does it not release this information in a timely fashion? 
It must be because it is not proud of what is in it. 
Otherwise it would be having press conferences and blowing it up to all proportions. 
I would like the member to retract his statement that the motion is redundant. 
Talk about hypocrisy in the extreme. 
It really is too much to take, especially from the member opposite.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
They might disagree with the direction we take. 
I have no problem with that.  
I want to talk about some of the programs.  
The Canadian Mental Health Association could in fact be put in jeopardy.  
We corrected the problem. 
Many members of the House were part of it, even some members of the opposition. 
Are these people funded directly by HRDC? 
He passed away a month ago.  
He would take care of the keys. 
One of the important goals of Community Living is: 
There was a purpose to the video and he understood that.  
The mitigating damage as this flows downstream is potentially catastrophic.  
I wish members opposite could come up with a motion with some teeth to it. 
The big issue today is health care. 
We should be debating that issue. 
Have we put enough money into health care? 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Canadian Alliance):
The government is open. 
Access to information is clearly available. 
The Internet can be used. 
There is no problem getting information. 
The chair does a good job on the committee; I have no problem with him. 
Let them dig into the auditor general's reports. 
There is more information in them than they could possibly begin to disseminate. 
They could at least start by recognizing that the programs exist.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, there is a contradiction here. 
Either it is or it is not.  
The fact is that is not being done.  
Second, he keeps pointing out that these are such wonderful programs. 
That is a debate for another day. 
It could well be. 
However, that is not there.  
He claims it is being done but it is not. 
They are afraid that some reporter is going to show up. 
This is the community helping out in addition to government grants. 
Anyone who wants to contribute to that can contact Community Living.  
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
This is the figure the motion is intended to find out. 
Our friends opposite often have very delicate and sensitive hearing. 
What does that mean? 
The motion is asking for three things. 
It should be formal, normal procedure.  
I will list a series of responsibilities that must be recognized within departments. 
First, public officials are accountable. 
Ministerial responsibility ought to be restored. 
We do not have a problem with that. 
First we have the budget presented by the Minister of Finance. 
The auditor general can also reply to written questions received from parliamentarians. 
The auditor general cannot force the government to take specific action. 
Perhaps he will be followed by the Minister of Finance, who knows?  
It can be seen that his role is far more restricted.  
This auditor general needs to be recognized as impartial and non-partisan. 
But the Minister for International Trade has said nothing.  
What happened at Human Resources Development? 
An internal audit report was tabled, as is required. 
Internal audit reports are important documents and they are compulsory.  
Was there a cover up attempt? 
As we know, asking the question often brings the response. 
What data are contained in the internal audit report? 
Seven categories of programs were analyzed in the report. 
There is therefore $3 billion in programs that were analyzed.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
They are not asking for an increase. 
They know that budgets have been slashed. 
He pointed at the Prime Minister, the member for Saint-Maurice, as he said this.  
I would like to know what the member for Repentigny thinks about this.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Frontenac-Megantic for his question. 
The government shows partisan leanings too often, with examples such as this.  
The federal Minister of Health said ``It is not my responsibility any more. 
It is up to the premiers''. 
Departments should develop cost-effective means- 
I do not know what cost-effective means in this context.  
It is a bit of a paradox.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Our caucus does not disagree with either of those points. 
They are both valid points. 
After reading the motion I felt that it was very poorly crafted. 
Would that not be a theme worth dedicating one day of debate to?  
There are so many issues. 
We could talk about saving our national health care system. 
We could talk about cleaning up the environment. 
That is not being debated in the House of Commons today.  
What a condemning comment. 
What a waste of an opportunity and it saddens me.  
They are the two most overused words in the House of Commons.  
What does one become when one is no longer a reformer? 
If one is no longer interested in that anymore, one must be a conformer. 
The opposite of a reformist is a conformist. 
Maybe that is what we should be calling them now. 
We do come from diametrically opposed positions. 
It is not even a call for greater accountability. 
Any public spending is bad. 
All things private are good. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sure the hon. member for Winnipeg Centre is duly admonished.  
Mr. Speaker, I am happy to co-operate. 
I will call the party by its proper name.  
We cannot replace those people overnight. 
It is not like flicking a light switch on and off. 
They are not coming back. 
They have already slipped away and the damage has already been done. 
We are fond of saying that some cuts do not heal. 
All Canadians were shocked as the truth started to surface. 
We do and we appreciate that.  
I am quite proud of that. 
We have watched the federal transfer payments dwindle. 
I think it is back up to $14.5 billion in total spending.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Just a couple of weeks ago we had the auditor general before that committee. 
The recent internal audit at HRDC again pointed to the same types of problems.  
I thought to myself, what a travesty of the way to do public business.  
It pointed out some quite alarming facts. 
These are folks who provide financial administration. 
This is just the tip of the iceberg. 
We want to see timely audits that are made public. 
This is about democratic disclosure. 
It is about ensuring that there is transparency in government operations.  
The evidence shows us that this clearly has not been the case.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
The PC Party is supporting the motion. 
The accountability issue is critical. 
It would benefit all of us.  
I saw some of the most egregious examples of government spending with HRDC. 
We in the PC Party are supporting the motion. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
In fact the motion should have been put forward. 
I am a fan of internal efficiency audits. 
Why we did that was not to witch hunt. 
That is what happens in the federal government with the auditor general's department. 
I am a fan of the auditor general. 
Mr. Desautels does his job extremely well. 
Members of his staff are extremely competent. 
Let me give a little example. 
Four specific departments of agriculture were there. 
We had an audit. 
We showed them the deficiencies. 
There has to be a watchdog. 
There has to be a backstop. 
The parliamentarians in committee are the watchdog and the backstop.  
The motion today speaks specifically to that requirement of parliamentarians. 
It is an abdication of duty. 
Those were done in a necessary process. 
That is all the motion speaks to.  
That is fair ball. 
That is wrong, absolutely wrong. 
Let us talk just briefly about access to information.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):
Yet the Liberal government members are denying this.  
I would like to have the member comment on the Liberal government's ineptness. 
It is in continual denial.  
Mr. Speaker, the member for Elk Island is absolutely correct. 
It is just good management. 
The member for Elk Island is absolutely correct. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):
The motion before us is an interesting one. 
One of the best ways of providing accountability in government is to have openness. 
In fact there were pages and pages of blank paper. 
It had a population of some 200 people. 
I did that job for three years in that delightful community. 
I find it distressing that we have this motion today. 
First of all, as one of the Liberal members said, it should be redundant. 
I would change the wording simply to say that this motion should be redundant. 
We do not do that in any other case. 
My very strong contention is that it should.  
Here we are offering information''. 
It makes a great press release. 
It makes a great press conference. 
But what happens when it comes time to release the document? 
One of them is being breached.  
It is a contradiction of the whole concept of accountability. 
There is a vast difference in those two concepts. 
The government often says, ``We are so open, look at this directive''. 
To be very blunt, that was not true. 
That, to me, is evidence of a cover-up. 
One has to be psychic to do that or guilty of forging a document. 
It is part of the cover-up.  
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
The answer is, yes, to the best of my knowledge it does.  
Yes, I agree that it is part of its policy. 
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Canadian Alliance):
It was interesting to hear my colleague talk about being accountable. 
People were really accountable there.  
We are in the opening days of the 21st century. 
There is no information forthcoming from the government.  
That is why we are here today having this debate in the House. 
All of the legitimate issues could be dealt with in an expeditious manner.  
In his testimony he stated the reasons for this huge backlog at HRDC. 
I quote from his testimony: 
This is a regressive attitude for the government to take. 
The current attitude has always been a major concern of the information commissioner.  
That is a lot of taxpayer money and it is in question. 
All five are 45 days overdue.  
We do not need much imagination to figure out who the third party was. 
Then there is fisheries and oceans. 
Some audits received 30 day extensions requested for others. 
Then there is the National Capital Commission.  
That is not acceptable.  
If you don't have to grunt, nod. 
If you don't have to nod, wink''. 
That has been the attitude of the government when it comes to releasing information. 
The answer is obvious.  
Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam, Lib.):
The debt load was at an all-time high of some $490 billion. 
It is a good budget. 
Health and welfare needed more money. 
We gave $2.5 billion in the budget. 
I think that is a very fair comment. 
I am sure there would be more money in the budget.  
A Management Framework for the Government of Canada''. 
The government has introduced the millennium fund. 
Heritage Square submitted an application under the millennium fund for $84,000. 
I approved it and they received the grant. 
This project looks after 1,800 kids. 
This facility looks after the community. 
Every room is filled and they are looking for more space. 
These are things that are happening. 
These are things that our government is doing. 
The Reform Party voted against it. 
It voted against the municipalities receiving grants for the communities. 
I am just wondering what side of the fence Reformers are really on. 
Do they support the municipalities that they represent? 
I have been a politician for going on 28 years. 
I was in municipal politics for 25 years. 
I am appalled at some of the comments that I have heard. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
When people were misusing it, that ruling was reaffirmed and requested. 
I would like to have him repeat three times after me:
Canadian Alliance, Canadian Alliance, Canadian Alliance.  
The leader of the Reform Party lived at Stornoway for many years. 
It was to become a bingo hall. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The hon. member I know will address his remarks to the motion.  
Mr. Speaker, certainly in my community there have been a lot of HRDC grants. 
There are many, many things that can be done in my community. 
The Canadian Alliance Party members do not realize that. 
They do not believe in it. 
Those are things that I stand for and this is what our government stands for. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
The member said that his government was spending in a reasonable manner. 
Is this the member's idea of spending in a reasonable manner? 
Let him quickly give me three examples.  
It is there for health care. 
Is there something wrong with being a part of Canada?  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I hope that you understood the question I put to the member. 
I want him to give us three examples.  
I believe that what we have here is an argument, not a point of order. 
The hon. member for Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam.  
I could go on for three-quarters of hour.  
I came here two years ago. 
Every Wednesday all members of the House get together and sing ``O Canada''. 
We put our political stripes aside and everything else. 
No. It does not want to be part of Canada. 
It seems to resent us calling it to come aboard. 
It wants to stay away from here, especially when the national anthem is sung. 
They have some other kind of song to sing and nobody wants to listen.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
It makes us all feel some measure of achievement.  
It is a complex motion. 
The motion raises an important issue. 
This has been the policy of the Treasury Board since 1995. 
This is not a reaction. 
This has been our policy since 1995. 
Indeed, that is in place and it is done.  
As a result of that, some 37 files showed deficiencies. 
In a nutshell, that is what happened.  
In the first instance, this motion is talking about audits. 
Committees already have the opportunity. 
They are the masters of their own agenda. 
They can call for this information if they want to look at it. 
I do not believe that all reports should have reviews. 
That is contrary to what is prescribed in this motion. 
As a consequence, I will not be supporting the motion.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):
I listened intently to the speech of the member who just spoke. 
I'm going to vote against it. 
I don't agree with that''.  
What does he propose in its place? 
Does he proposed to hide them forever? 
We have all these audit reports, which are long overdue, and they are not available. 
Does he want to continue to hide it? 
If he votes against this motion does he have an alternate proposal?  
That cannot be clearer.  
I will repeat directly why I will not be voting for the motion. 
The motion is flawed not only in its language but also in its intent.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Therefore, there is a very serious undertone to the motion that is before the House.  
He should admit that the problem is there. 
Canadians have now come to expect that from the government.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his kind comments and his words of encouragement.  
That is unfortunate because it is at the expense of the interests of Canadians.  
Canadians have a right to know the facts. 
The motion calls for all audit reports to go to committee. 
I will not be supporting this. 
I am sure the member would not support it on that basis. 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Canadian Alliance):
I think there was some misinformation about the motion. 
The hon. member for Mississauga South was quite right. 
The memo is very clear. 
And, Mr. Speaker, I am sharing my time.  
It is very clear from this memo that the policy is in place. 
That policy is prohibiting Canadians from accessing information they are entitled to. 
It is their money that is being used. 
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
You do not need access. 
We gave you the file.  
The truth of the matter is that the government is withholding this information. 
He did not use the word transparency because he could not. 
It is to control the timing of the release of the information. 
Most important is that the government is breaking its own policies. 
It is breaking the policies and the established process of releasing government audits. 
It is not one audit. 
And it is not just one department. 
It is their audits as well.  
Government departments should be available to the public for scrutiny. 
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
We do not challenge that role.  
There will always be mistakes. 
That is the way life is. 
We are not proud of mistakes, but we will admit there are some mistakes.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
No, it was $13 billion.  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
I say with respect to the member, we have to be transparent. 
The people who are most in need tend to be those clients of HRDC. 
The government member is misrepresenting to Canadians where all the money is going. 
The taxpayers' money goes to many different areas in government spending.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
She had harsh words for the way the federal government now operates.  
The concern is not just about the appointments. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):
We are proud of and trust our public service employees. 
Who are those managers? 
It is the Liberals who are hiding something. 
I will list some of them. 
It does not want to reply. 
I want to speak about the treasury board guidelines. 
It has limited debate many times. 
It has used time allocation many times. 
It has beaten the record of Brian Mulroney.  
It is so undemocratic that it is almost anti-democratic.  
The government denies information. 
It exaggerates its own achievements. 
It misrepresents the opposition parties time and again in the House. 
It has not kept its promises to the Canadian public.  
The government time and again has exhibited a cover-up mentality. 
It will not correct mistakes and rectify the problems.  
We are witnessing the lack of political will by the government to fix the system. 
We are witnessing arrogance by the government. 
It abuses its power time and again in the House. 
The committees can be more productive and can analyze the audits we are talking about. 
They can analyze other issues and make recommendations to the government.  
This attitude is continuing. 
All members in the House should support the motion.  
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Canadian Alliance):
AIDA must be overhauled. 
The whole program must be reviewed and revamped to help farmers. 
Taxes on fuel and other inputs could be reduced immediately. 
Why not refund it now? 
MURDER OF HAITIAN JOURNALIST 
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
Mr. Dominique was one of his country's most respected commentators. 
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
PRIME MINISTER DAVID ODDSSON 
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia, Lib.):
He is an accomplished statesman, political leader and author.  
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Canadian Alliance):
It must be a Senate that is elected, effective and equitable''.  
The Prime Minister has a choice. 
Will he choose democracy over patronage?  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
I'd just as soon shoot myself. 
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale, Lib.):
HUTCHISON CREEK FISH HATCHERY 
Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam, Lib.):
He is also a great firefighter in my riding.  
FIRST NATIONS ACCOUNTABILITY COALITION 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):
The purpose was to hear concerns about living conditions on and off reserve. 
Leona, I salute you.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
In this, too, they are a fine reflection of their electors''.  
This intolerant attitude verges on hatred and racism. 
This is an embarrassment to the Globe and Mail and to Canada as a whole.  
Quebec is of nobler spirit. 
CANADIAN ARMED FORCES ASSOCIATION 
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
The launch date of April 1 was no chance matter. 
Congratulations to the Canadian armed forces association on its initiative. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
ORGANIZATION OF WOMEN IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
The activities of the Ontario chapter are presently focused on electronic commerce. 
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Canadian Alliance):
The time for empty talk is over. 
The time for action is now.  
Bring the provinces on board for this major task.  
The Canadian Alliance is actively working to find these national solutions.  
Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
Why will this minister not stand to protect the band members?  
Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
At election time they will make that decision. 
When they make the decision they will choose the best person on the ballot.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, the minister talks about government to government relationships. 
Why is he ignoring them?  
Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):
A crisis exists in Canada. 
The coalition reports waste, corruption and dictatorship rule.  
The hon. Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.  
Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
That is not the policy of this government. 
The policy of this government is to let first nations make their own decisions. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):
That is what it ought to be.  
The minister continues to hear the outcry of aboriginal people living on reserve. 
Others in Canada can access an ombudsman. 
Aboriginal people on reserve cannot. 
Will the minister respond to this request? 
Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Hon. Robert D. Nault:
This is the same issue. 
We do not make decisions on behalf of first nations without holding consultations. 
We are in the process of consulting with the leadership of first nations. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
What more does the minister need to request a police investigation?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, we never got an answer. 
Some people, including the minister, avoided the issue.  
Still, after an administrative inquiry, the accounting firm decided to ask for a police investigation.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's assertion is absolutely false. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
The patient was told she needed an MRI scan. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is nonsense. 
More than that, it is offensive nonsense. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
How does she explain that to Tories in Newfoundland?  
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I have a follow-up question for the Minister of Transport.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
It does not come cheap. 
I think that is very responsible.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I expect we would find no such thing.  
Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Let me use one example. 
I think that is hypocritical.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Seven years later, it pays only 13.5%.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Equalization payments will hit a new high next year as well. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
This year, as last year, we also transferred money. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):
Let us go to the Stoney Band in Alberta. 
Here the band councillors receive $1.4 million in salaries. 
Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are negotiating some 80 self-government agreements right now. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, the one thing we will need in those agreements is accountability. 
It is pretty straightforward. 
Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
The industry has concerns, however, and wants to see more concrete agreements.  
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
I hope in the coming days that I will be able to announce more agreements. 
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I get the impression that the minister is a little mixed up. 
I will therefore ask my question again.  
In fisheries, there is a very delicate balance. 
That is the question.  
An attempt is being made to imbalance the quotas of the various provinces. 
What is his answer to that?  
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
We are doing it in Atlantic Canada. 
This is good news for Canada and it is good news- 
The hon. member for Calgary East.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Both reports have dealt with the environmental aspect. 
The government is now studying how it will respond to those reports. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Only four months later in the budget, we have made that a reality. 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Trade.  
In 1999 the gap grew.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
We are working hard on that file.  
Significant differences remain but we will make further progress.  
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
I do not think the opposition member should question his own questions.  
As for the EDC, this is a very important subject on environment. 
There will be a legislative review. 
We will discuss these elements further as our government- 
The hon. member for Edmonton-Strathcona.  
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
It works out of two accounts. 
I have explained that in the House time and again. 
There is the corporate account and the Canada account.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are very sensitive to the plight of seasonal workers. 
Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
Their health and safety is at stake.  
This agreement was important and it was working. 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
The Ontario government has not yet substantively replied to us. 
This does not mean that we are not continuing with negotiations. 
We would like to continue so we can sign an agreement as soon as possible.  
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
He got the best deal and it only cost $70 million. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Mr. Speaker, all I asked was how much he paid. 
I would like to ask the minister again. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Canadian Alliance):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
They are initially made there. 
They are doing their job just fine.  
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
It is a program that we want to put into effect as quickly as possible. 
We are still looking at the location. 
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
The hon. member for Kings-Hants.  
MINISTER OF NATIONAL REVENUE 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Why does the minister's champagne tastes cost Canadian- 
The hon. Minister of National Revenue.  
Based on my duties I have to go to the province of Quebec very often. 
I go across the province often. 
I may have to charter planes on a regular basis. 
It is as simple as that.  
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
This is very important for us in this sector.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Canadian Alliance):
It is kind of like the HRD minister.  
Sometimes it even withholds funding like it did with Alberta.  
Hon. Robert D. Nault (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
The hon. member is correct. 
We always seek fairness. 
ALLOTTED DAY-DEPARTMENTAL AUDIT REPORTS 
The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the amendment.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):
There is a real dilemma. 
There is a huge contradiction. 
I would appreciate my colleague's comments on the Liberal contradictory statements.  
It is shameful that the weak Liberal government is opposing the motion. 
They are hiding their wastage and patronage and all those things. 
The government is hiding its arrogance. 
The government is becoming more and more arrogant day by day. 
It has more lame excuses and more delays in providing information. 
It denies the right to information. 
It lacks the political will to fix what is wrong with the system.  
We are witnessing day and night from the government a lack of respect for democracy. 
We have also seen that the government is not keeping its promises. 
It forgot what Canadians called on it to do. 
We are witnessing a cover-up mentality. 
The government has a cover-up mentality. 
The motion calls for all audits to be referred to a standing committee. 
All access to information requests are processed. 
The law requires, for example, that we respect the personal nature of certain information. 
We will certainly comply with it and therefore protect personal information.  
What it seeks is already available. 
Increasingly, decisions are made locally. 
Local managers have increasing responsibilities. 
This means operating transparently. 
It means taking action when problems arise.  
This study was completed in January. 
A Management Framework for the Government of Canada''. 
Some have suggested that we in government should not delegate authority at all. 
The motion before us today would take us backward, not forward. 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Canadian Alliance):
She is asking a lot.  
We understand the act and we understand exactly what the minister is doing. 
She is stonewalling, putting up excuses and not getting to the bottom of the issue.  
She knows that her own directives say to release these internal audits. 
She knows there are some sitting on the shelf right now. 
Yet she and her department refuse to release them. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I would invite members to address each other through the Chair.  
Mr. Speaker, the opposition member certainly does not have the right information. 
I cannot believe that he would make such a statement in the House.  
What does this mean? 
It means fewer procedures are required in order to have access to the information. 
What is this, if not transparency? 
It is extremely transparent.  
All these reports can be made public immediately. 
What is more, all parliamentary committees have the power of initiative. 
They may ask to examine any completed audit report.  
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, I must say that this is a bit of deja vu. 
Is it because the government is not following the law?  
Mr. Speaker, I am merely saying that the motion is unnecessary. 
That is what I am saying.  
The member is mistaken with his talk of complying or not complying with the act. 
It is not a question of complying with the act or not. 
So the motion before us today is unnecessary.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance):
She talks about modern management practices. 
Modern management practices require some accountability.  
How can this motion move us away from what we want? 
This is not a new Treasury Board policy. 
It has been around since 1994. 
I have never known of a single one. 
There has always been. 
They can do so at any time. 
They have the power of initiative in each of the committees.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
We make the distinction here.  
As soon as this report is completed, it is in the public domain. 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Canadian Alliance):
They are supposed to be public, but they are not. 
That is why this motion is before the House today.  
I will ask the minister once again. 
We will actively monitor this policy.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Canadian Alliance):
That public information included audit reports. 
I heard the minister say that. 
Recently, the same concept was reiterated by the information commissioner. 
That is why we brought this motion forward.  
We are now waiting to get access to these audit reports.  
In recent times something has changed. 
There are five more reports that we are waiting for. 
It does not stop at HRDC. 
This delay tactic seems to be spreading. 
It is not only HRDC. 
This delay approach is spreading to other departments. 
That is the reason for our motion today. 
When did all this start? 
The problem is that this is causing increasing delays. 
How big are the problems? 
It is more than 45 days. 
We have been waiting 45 days. 
Apparently it is taking more and more.  
In light of that, let us reflect again on the statements of the information commissioner. 
He said, ``Information delayed is information denied''. 
What is being hidden here? 
Let us look at the HRDC audit for a moment. 
That is what the motion is all about. 
We look forward to them supporting it.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
A Management Framework for the Government of Canada''. 
The member spoke about tabling all the audit reports. 
Since ``Results for Canadians:
That is exactly why there must be openness in government. 
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:
I am sure the member did not mean that. 
I am glad to note that he indicated that it was a perception. 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, government members opposite talk about perceptions and realities. 
Let us take a look at them. 
This has been exposed to the light of day through the HRDC fiasco. 
It is unbelievable and it cannot be hidden. 
Here is some that has slipped through the net. 
This is an unacceptable practice that is completely avoidable. 
She acknowledges that treasury board guidelines are being broken. 
This is the minister and the government that put these guidelines in place. 
I would argue exactly the opposite. 
It should already be out there in the open, and it has not been released.  
It has demonstrated that through its actions throughout the HRDC fiasco.  
We see it spreading to other departments now. 
It cannot hide from that reality. 
That is a reality and the government is in the midst of it. 
Canadians are not happy about it at all.  
Here is a question within an internal document: 
Why doesn't management make up its mind?  
The document goes on to say in answer to the first question posed: 
-the minister and the Deputy Minister have instructed us to follow the rules starting immediately.  
What does that imply? 
It implies that the rules were not followed previous to this directive. 
It is unbelievable that employees had to be reminded to follow the rules. 
So what are the new rules? 
The rules are not new. 
That is the implication of that comment. 
This document from the human resources department goes on further with another question: 
This is not an option.  
Canadians need to know this. 
I suggest that Canadians judge the government on its actions. 
What are its actions? 
That is unacceptable and that is why we are bringing the motion forward. 
They need to do that and they have failed to do so. 
It is almost like the Wizard of Oz. 
The government should be and needs to be held accountable.  
That is why we brought this motion forward.  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
We do not have a problem with that.  
What do I mean by that? 
They have tried to create a perception that this entire fund was mismanaged. 
The notion of blaming the officials, in my mind, is awful. 
We have to speak up and defend the officials. 
If they have made a mistake we have to take responsibility. 
I, for the life of me, cannot figure it out.  
Does this mean that the opposition wants to do away with HRDC projects? 
I see one of the members shaking his head no. 
I think Canadians see through that. 
That casts aspersions on the public service. 
Boy, did they ever make a mistake there. 
Its economic track record shows us that. 
To try to discredit EDC is really a shame.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas-Charlottenburgh, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House to move the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
ALLOTTED DAY-DEPARTMENTAL AUDIT REPORTS 
The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the amendment.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
We have him up to 13. 
The hon. member will not listen. 
I am only stating the facts. 
I do not think he would disagree with that. 
I would say, yes, there is a possibility of that.  
He said it about nine different times. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That is the question. 
The hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood.  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
The notion that we think somehow that everything we do is perfect, forget it.  
Canadians know that we make mistakes. 
That is my point.  
Mr. Speaker, again we have seen the minimize defence.  
I appreciate the fact that my colleague has admitted that the Liberals have made mistakes. 
Unfortunately the Minister of Human Resources Development has not done that. 
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
Mr. Speaker, this is really amazing. 
In my mind the minister has been doing a magnificent job. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
I think it is high time for a reality check. 
I do not include the hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood in the rhetoric. 
I was referring to the rhetoric coming from the other side. 
I must correct myself on that.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would offer that if this is a reality check, that is just unbelievable. 
I believe that is in order, Mr. Speaker, the suggestion is false.  
That is what timely release is all about. 
It does not support it at all. 
But we will see.  
This is a huge area of secrecy. 
They do not care about openness and I know why.  
It is because a government that is closed is a good target. 
Mr. Speaker, I am in despair with them. 
I just do not know what I can do with them.  
This is a government that stands for transparency. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):
I could not agree more.  
I do not disagree with that at all.  
He has not explained that to me at all. 
I do not think he has explained it to anyone. 
Would he please remember that is the case.  
I ask the hon. member, exactly what does he understand an audit to be?  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
I am very familiar with performance and proficiency audits.  
Why can I not get my audits?  
It has not been upgraded or overhauled since that time.  
I think we are headed in the right direction. 
I served a little while on the government operations committee in 1995. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Canadian Alliance):
But first of all I want to describe my personal experience.  
What a surprise I received when I got here. 
Government members really do not listen. 
The government delays its release.  
For example, I have made about 80 access to information requests. 
Some of the examples of government hiding information are almost unbelievable. 
Hon. members have heard that right, almost a year. 
There are other problems. 
What are some of the other problems? 
It has come up with a new excuse, cabinet secrecy.  
That is the bombshell I will tell members about. 
Here is what I found out.  
I will give a preamble. 
Here is the bombshell. 
Let me say this. 
This strikes to the very heart of democracy. 
There must be a free exchange of information. 
Without information as to how the government operates, we cannot hold the government accountable. 
Democracy just cannot work. 
Second, it is the money of the Canadian people that is being spent. 
They should know where that money is. 
We are talking big bucks. 
That really thwarts democracy. 
If it is being misused, that is also of great concern.  
Why do they say ``No, I do not want to take the breathalyser''? 
If a person refused a breathalyser, they can be assumed to be guilty. 
Maybe there is another bombshell I can drop right here. 
Everything was itemized except the column where the numbers should have been. 
It was completely blocked out. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, did I really hear right? 
That is exactly what he said. 
Mr. Speaker, the member has asked two good questions.  
The government has a deliberate strategy to confuse. 
That is the point I was trying to make.  
When questions are asked, the government indicates that it is explained. 
That is the problem.  
We agree that needs to be fixed. 
In fact I think he only has 70 members supporting it so far. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite for his reasoned reply. 
Therefore, the will is here.  
I have to stress that I am a legislator too. 
There is nothing wrong with that. 
Why should we always rely on the government to have the initiative? 
Why can we not band together and do good things around this place?  
If something is hidden we cannot make good decisions. 
That is what this discussion is all about. 
That is my main point. 
Let us not lose sight of that.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, it is really a very interesting debate that is taking place this afternoon. 
I appreciate that very much.  
We have to ask ourselves what kind of information it is that we want.  
We are talking about audits. 
Audits have been divided by various groups into different kinds. 
What we are talking about, at least in part, has to do with financial audits. 
In fact I wish to speak about financial audits primarily.  
That is what we are talking about this afternoon.  
What was the process used in spending the money? 
Was it spent according to the plan that was originally established? 
That has to do with the budget.  
Invariably, every year there is a statement that is brought forward called the supplementary estimates. 
These are estimates that are added to the original budget. 
The budget is the guiding document. 
It is the policy document. 
In fact the budget is a piece of legislation. 
It has the force of law, it is the law and it must be observed. 
To whom should that account be given? 
That account shall be given to the people whose money was spent. 
The money the government has is not its own. 
It is money that is held in trust. 
Did the government deliver the projects and programs? 
That is the first level of accountability.  
If less was spent, why were the costs of the project underestimated? 
If more was spent, why? 
Was it inefficiency or were there other reasons? 
The budget also establishes responsibility. 
If the minister does not do that, he or she should be held to account. 
The responsibility is his or hers and no one else's.  
This is your responsibility. 
That becomes the issue.  
What is meant by honesty? 
If the minister is a person of integrity the response would be ``I am responsible''.  
Have a look and see whether it is not so''. 
They do not bother to white out columns so as not to show certain numbers. 
Why would they not want to let out this information? 
It is a cover-up of some kind. 
There is also something else, and that has to do with freedom. 
That openness has to be guaranteed.  
Timeliness is absolutely critical.  
Whose money is this? 
Who made the decision? 
The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation made the decision. 
It had the money. 
What is going on? 
Why does it have to consult a third party? 
The corporation is responsible. 
The minister is responsible. 
I am here to hold the government to account. 
The government should not be afraid. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
It seems to me we are talking about two things.  
We could call it a performance audit, if we wished. 
That is what they want. 
That they do not want. 
That is exactly what we want.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a very simple question for the hon. member. 
He knows that I have a lot of respect for him.  
I am surprised that there is this assumption that voters can be so easily bought. 
I have never yet met a voter who could be bought. 
Maybe I have not asked the right questions.  
Voters in Canada are well informed. 
They are thoughtful and intelligent. 
I would be surprised if his voters are really that dumb.  
I want to recognize that the voters by and large are very intelligent. 
After all, that is what makes democracy work. 
We are kind of selfish people. 
Most of the people around here have a bit of a selfish interest.  
We do have a penchant toward doing that. 
We want to avoid that. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. John O'Reilly (Haliburton-Victoria-Brock, Lib.):
Therefore, we were very appreciative that these grants came into the ridings.  
As in the largest majority of the grants, I felt there were no problems.  
Of course we would like more money. 
I think that is normal.  
In my mind, Ontario is not Toronto. 
That is maybe what happens with the party formerly known as Reform. 
We never have a time where we are not busy. 
Let us think about that, 450 active dairy farms in my riding alone. 
Does he have dairy farms?  
Mr. John O'Reilly:
The internal waterway is a great resource.  
I firmly believe we are the most open in the world on that. 
Many thousands of Canadians depend on these programs. 
It certainly was helping the community.  
We have heard from Canadians all across the country. 
There are pockets that have great need.  
Some of them are very worthwhile and some of them we have our questions about. 
Some certainly should be looked at more closely. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
FIRST NATIONS OMBUDSMAN ACT 
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Canadian Alliance):
We are into the final hour of debate. 
I have listened to the aboriginal people who have showed up at these meetings. 
I have listened to their concerns. 
I had a speech for tonight. 
Instead, I will read into the record a letter calling for financial accountability. 
The Corbiere consultation process is proof of that. 
We believe the government is letting the fox get security for the hen house.  
Again, the grassroots people have been neglected and forgotten. 
There is no economic development in the First Nations communities. 
Few band members are privileged to be employed. 
The band members are not educated and they are kept that way. 
They do whatever they want. 
Their criminal activities are untouchable. 
The band members have nowhere to turn for help.  
I would like to quote from another article called ``Chief Injustices''. 
It will give members something to think about. 
It says ``if you dare criticize the abusers, you are ostracized. 
We went to meeting after meeting. 
The native people came up to us an told us they were threatened. 
This is what is going on.  
I will now quote some examples given by a judge. 
No charges were laid but the band lost over $50,000.  
The examples go on and on but does the government listen? 
Does the government listen to the grassroots people? 
Mr. John O'Reilly (Haliburton-Victoria-Brock, Lib.):
We take a different view. 
Our preference is for partnerships not paternalism and for co-operation not control.  
As funding arrangements have changed, so too has the issue of accountability. 
This is true of aboriginal and non-aboriginal governments alike. 
The simple fact is that most reserves are managing their finances properly. 
Our government would rather work with first nations- 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Would he stick to the topic, please?  
Mr. John O'Reilly:
First nations must have self-reliance. 
They cannot have a continued state of dependency. 
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Unfortunately, this money does not always reach those for whom it is intended.  
However, it is obvious that not all first nations are badly run. 
On the contrary, many aboriginals are very well served by their chief and their council. 
However, even in their case, a ombudsman could provide an important service. 
This bill is nothing new. 
This bill sets out how the office of ombudsman would operate. 
The federal government could draw a lesson from all of this. 
More recently, similar problems have surfaced in the Department of Indian Affairs. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):
Mr. Speaker, do I have a minute or so to make my presentation?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
The member is to be commended for bringing this piece of legislation forward.  
It was not just one or two isolated calls.  
First, we met confidentially, one on one. 
Second, we sent out questionnaires and had several returned. 
Third, we had three public meetings in the constituency. 
Some very interesting things came out of this process.  
That is recommendation number four under the category of democratic accountability. 
That is why they felt they needed an ombudsman.  
It is a very common problem across the country. 
It is not only the eight reserves in my constituency.  
This is what was said in one presentation: 
Higher government just refers it down to the local elected officials. 
An advocate, or an arm's-length agency. 
A hearer of all injustices within the aboriginal community.''  
That was a point which was made very clear.  
He is abdicating his responsibility.  
``It seems like a hopeless situation'', they said. 
``We can see a situation where our council, including the chief, is misspending money. 
We know this is happening and we have nowhere to go. 
This is the type of feeling which came up again and again. 
I believe this ombudsman position will help deal with part of that problem.  
I congratulate the member for Wild Rose for bringing this forth. 
What does the minister of Indian affairs suggest when we bring these problems to him? 
That is the way he talks.  
I believe that that is the case. 
They have not been dealt with.  
One hand out of the 70 went up.  
All the hands went up except one.  
This ombudsman will help deal with the situation of a lack of accountability. 
I hope everyone in the House will support this bill.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Canadian Alliance):
We were confronted by six women. 
She had no place to go. 
That is not the end of the story. 
The issue of the ombudsman is a real issue. 
It is a gut level issue that I have seen and I have experienced. 
Along with self-government there must be the position of ombudsman.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):
I am pleased to have them here. 
We are looking for support on the bill.  
I would like to remind all members that this is a very serious consideration. 
The only people that does not apply to are natives who live on a reserve. 
These kinds of inequalities must not exist. 
A no vote means no to accountability. 
I will remember how hon. members vote.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):

Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
My question read as follows: 
The Minister of Finance responded as follows: 
So which ones are telling the truth? 
The provincial Liberals or their federal Liberal cousins? 
This is a question that must be raised.  
Might this new method be to go the American way? 
That is the question that must be asked. 
The government should look at the bill and pay half.  
Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The federal government restored social transfers to their 1994-95 level.  
What does it mean for New Brunswick? 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
He was attacked for one reason-because he was gay. 
What does it mean for the criminal code to be silent on this important issue? 
It is a license to the thugs who get involved in gay bashing. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
As usual, the two questions I posed were very valid questions. 
There was no answer.  
Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
I hope his party adopts some of our programs.  
A few of these proposals share some similarities to the former GRIP program. 
The criteria it has established is split between essential and preferred criteria.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 7.16 p.m.)
