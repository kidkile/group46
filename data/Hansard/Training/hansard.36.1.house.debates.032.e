The House met at 10 a.m. 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
If the order for removal is sought by the crown, it is mandatory.  
NATIONAL HEAD START PROGRAM 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
I ask the government to work with the provincial counterparts on this matter.  
Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House to propose the motion?  
There is no consent.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I suggest that all questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Anything less would in fact entail an unnecessary burden to Canadian industry.  
That is the one concern.  
Certainly it is a widely held view in the House and in industry.  
I urge the House to pass Bill C-11 quickly. 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Largely this is a bill which simplifies and harmonizes Canadian customs legislation.  
It was a foot and a half thick. 
We still have 8,000 tariff lines for import duties into Canada. 
We can do even better than that and I hope we can in the future.  
In response to that we were able to clean up a lot of customs lines.  
We would even go further. 
Industry in general is starting to recognize this. 
Companies such as Teleglobe have been privatized. 
We have good trade agreements. 
We must move further to keep this bicycle rolling down the road. 
We see they have to be assessed duties. 
It is a very expensive regime to keep in place.  
The steel industry is one example. 
In fact, most of our trade does not occur that way. 
However, we have 8,000 customs duty lines left. 
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
This bill is extremely significant for Canada. 
The resulting savings will be of benefit to Canadian businesses and Canadian taxpayers.  
Moreover, the World Trade Organization shared that opinion. 
We have had it with this approach. 
It is not the first time that the government has acted this way. 
The most recent example was the multilateral agreement on investment. 
It is extremely difficult to do our job in the opposition under such circumstances. 
That was the case of the Canadian automotive industry. 
At that time, the association was strongly opposed to such a move. 
There is another matter I would like to speak to. 
The Bloc Quebecois shares this concern. 
We hope the Liberal government will finally be able to keep a promise. 
We are concerned about the automobile industry in Canada. 
It is imperative that Canada fulfil its international obligations.  
They are now converts. 
This is a disgrace, to say the least.  
Colombia is currently in the grip of what for us is an unthinkable crisis. 
The people of Colombia are being terrorized by paramilitary soldiers and guerillas. 
Colombian teachers have the world's highest mortality rate. 
Four out of every ten labour leaders in the world have been assassinated in Colombia. 
Torture and repeated violations of human rights are common occurrences. 
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
It sets out to do a number of things, not all of which are terrible. 
It will in part implement the free trade agreements, in particular NAFTA.  
It is simply foolish. 
It also means we have lost much more control of our economy. 
As I mentioned, the New Democratic Party remains the only party opposed to these deals. 
These deals have not done that. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to make a couple of comments and to ask a question.  
Letters were sent to interested parties. 
Advertisements were placed in some leading national newspapers. 
I wanted to clarify that for the record.  
I wonder if he could share some of that information. 
Our premier was part of the team Canada visits. 
There are few who would argue that we should not expand trade and our exports.  
The member picked up on the point I was raising. 
Surely nobody would regard that as good. 
Those efforts did not take us very far. 
I merely wanted to reiterate that. 
They must be doing something right.  
It leads the country in economic indicators. 
It must be doing something right. 
I just wanted to make that point. 
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
I noticed that the New Democratic Party does not support Bill C-11. 
That was my first comment.  
Here is my question. 
My hon. colleague may also have attended the industry committee sittings. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from the Bloc for his question.  
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
At least they are consistent in their opposition to free trade. 
Today, I reiterate these words.  
However, there are some concerns that need to be addressed.  
I will address these two main points today. 
They ask for a period of administrative tolerance. 
The Alliance of Manufacturers is but one example of this concern. 
These are the most affected parties. 
We also heard concerns from vehicle manufacturers groups. 
This plan is not logical. 
It is not fair to the automotive industry. 
By trying to rush through legislation, the government is missing the point. 
Why take the chance of negatively impacting jobs and investment in Canada?  
This is the most complex tariff system in the world. 
We know it and our trading partners know it. 
Work still needs to be done.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
No changes are made to vehicle tariffs. 
Mr. Speaker, that was not our intention. 
Those are the things that drive businesses crazy.  
That is really where we are to with that.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
I wonder how many people in Newfoundland are listening to his comments today. 
He said that the NDP is against free trade deals. 
What we are against are deals that hurt Canadian workers. 
He, coming from the province of Newfoundland, should know that better than anybody else.  
Let me remind him of what happened in Mexico. 
We were told that their standard of living would rise. 
Those are the types of deals which we are against.  
Mr. Speaker, just a brief reply.  
It is a great day for Newfoundland. 
Is the House ready for the question?  
The question is on the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to talk today about Bill C-18.  
It will help our customs officers at the border points. 
We have very much our own customs unions on side with us. 
They are our customs officers at the border points.  
Now this gap has been closed because we can do those charges. 
We have very good lookouts and intelligence. 
It is a very necessary piece of legislation. 
They will have the adequate necessary training. 
This decision was taken after much investigation. 
We will ensure the safety of our customs officers.  
We have been dealing professionally with this situation for a long time. 
This will correct our situation. 
Now we have this legislation. 
It is a very low annual figure.  
We want them to be carried out in the most professional manner. 
We have given the legal tool that was missing.  
This is a very important piece of legislation. 
It is one that has been long awaited. 
I am very pleased.  
It is not a long piece of legislation. 
It is not a difficult piece of legislation. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
This is something which is most sensible.  
There are other reasons why they could be stopped, but not necessarily for that offence.  
They all seem to be in support of this bill.  
What exactly are those costs for training those public servants in this respect?  
Again, we have seen no estimate of what costs are associated with that. 
She did not really explain why. 
She just said ``Under my watch they will not be armed. 
The risk of violence comes from violent criminals who cross our borders. 
These student officers are in some places such as Pearson airport. 
I have another question for the government. 
That is a reasonable question. 
That is an important point to us.  
I have another question. 
What kind of training will they receive? 
That question is not outlined.  
Perhaps it will in the course of this debate.  
Those are good questions. 
They are not only directed to this government but to predecessor governments as well.  
We stand for a criminal law regime which can be enforced. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Yesterday in the House the hon. member for Elk Island said in part: 
We request that he do so. 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
These are extremely important amendments. 
This is not a new bill, however. 
What provision does the Customs Act make at the moment? 
Currently customs officers' powers apply primarily to merchandise entering or leaving Canada. 
Let us be clear about the changes. 
Bill C-18 proper contains four clauses. 
This is reassuring, since it is an important power. 
The certificates of designation will be issued by the minister. 
As will be seen later, we have some concerns. 
These are very important sections. 
This provision can be found in proposed paragraph 163.5(2). 
What are sections 254 and 256 of the Criminal Code? 
Their actions will have legal consequences, eventually.  
These are very clearly delineated powers. 
There are concerns regarding this bill. 
I will mention four points. 
The first one is the need to properly train the designated officers. 
My second question concerns the need to cooperate with provincial authorities. 
Another issue I am concerned with is costs. 
We are told that there are about 80 border points. 
What are the costs for these 80 stations? 
My fourth point concerns infringements of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Now the bill is back before the House today. 
This is something which is needed in this country. 
Today the customs officers do not have that power. 
I want to give some information which is relevant to the debate this morning. 
In many cases the driver is long gone before the police arrive. 
This is something which is long overdue. 
It should have been done a number of years ago.  
I have in my hand a letter which was written by a customs officer. 
I believe this sums up the need for the legislation: 
One in particular displayed signs of impairment. 
Consequently, these motorcyclists were allowed to proceed.  
With that, I offer our support and hope the House will do this expeditiously. 
I am sure that he will make sure that occurs this morning. 
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Impaired driving continues to be a cause for concern.  
Those numbers are startling. 
A modern customs organization is what we expect to have. 
Bill C-18 will extend those powers to include Criminal Code violations. 
In it the officer recounts a recent experience he had with an obviously impaired motorcyclist. 
Therefore, that will increase their chances of catching those people at the right time.  
That will remain the responsibility of provincial law enforcement agencies.  
The department received only 448 complaints about the conduct of officers. 
This represents a one-to-nearly 240,000 ratio. 
I am sharing my time with a colleague, the member for Sarnia-Lambton.  
Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):
This, as we know, represents trade and tourism for Canada. 
We want to stop them.  
This bill certainly goes a great distance in balancing that inequality.  
This bill responds to three factors. 
I could say the same thing about the people in my riding.  
As such I think this is a good piece of legislation. 
I believe it deserves the support of this House.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
It is in fact a very timely piece of legislation. 
I would go so far as to say that it is a good initiative. 
I am encouraged to see the government bringing this legislation forward.  
I am sure this will be discussed at the committee level. 
This has to be given more thought.  
There is some irony in the timing of the bill. 
I have heard other members refer to increased traffic at our borders. 
This has been taken into account. 
That is certainly beneficial to this country.  
It will allow customs officers to carry out their daily tasks more effectively.  
That is something that could be explored.  
Generally speaking the feedback I have received on this initiative is positive. 
This might be a reasonable limitation. 
I have a few concerns about the impact of Bill C-18. 
I do not think that is the intent of the legislation. 
It is a very important and timely piece of legislation.  
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
It does not replace them in any way, shape or form. 
We are just upgrading and putting in facilities where needed. 
Maybe the hon. member would wish to respond. 
I have more details if he wishes them.  
I think that is reassuring. 
We are having our customs officers perform their functions at the border points only. 
I think what we have here is a beneficial piece of legislation. 
We take that responsibility extremely seriously.  
Case law has been voluminous in this regard. 
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Chair would beg the indulgence of the hon. minister. 
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal:
Mr. Speaker, I thank hon. members for giving me this opportunity to speak. 
Certainly she is very able to speak on this issue.  
Customs has always been vital to Canada's safety and prosperity. 
In 1997 this is still a key part of their mandate. 
We want to take advantage of this unique position. 
We have the numbers to prove it.  
Day in and day out our customs officers do a magnificent job. 
However, we want to give them the tools to do better.  
We have a compelling argument why this legislation is needed. 
I refer to a case involving Jonathon Yeo. 
Officers hands will no longer be tied when dealing with criminals.  
This bill is a product of consensus. 
Everyone sees merit in it. 
Members across have spoken of the merits of this bill and are fully supportive.  
A first response capability will strengthen an already strong partnership with the law enforcement community.  
These powers will enhance our contribution in the fight against crime. 
We are not asking for sweeping powers. 
Not all customs officers will be given this expanded power of arrest. 
We have considered these views very carefully. 
Therefore we will not arm Canadian customs officers.  
In closing, I would like to summarize the changes this bill will bring about. 
Change is nothing new for the men and women of Revenue Canada. 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
I would like the minister to confirm whether my facts are correct on that basis. 
I would like to hear from the minister.  
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal:
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.  
These will be people who are permanent and they will be designated. 
That is the whole purpose of designation.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal:
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member from Esquimalt. 
I share the view of the member. 
It is very important to protect our borders. 
A number of initiatives were brought forward in the last Parliament. 
We are looking at smart borders by utilizing technology.  
Certainly that is a very important concern. 
It is not easy to manage. 
It is a priority for me to ensure that we protect our borders.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
That is my first question.  
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal:
Clearly there is a cost to upgrade some facilities. 
Both the upgrade in some infrastucture and the training will be $5.5 million. 
I have stated this figure in a number of previous speeches. 
If the member were reading his press clippings he would clearly understand that.  
Perhaps the hon. member does not know this. 
This is an increase in expanding powers under the Criminal Code. 
It is under the customs act. 
Maybe that was the point the hon. member was making. 
We do not feel it is necessary. 
We will provide that option to them. 
We are looking for the best product available to provide to our officers.  
This will be good for the officers. 
I have read of a number of groups that are supportive. 
This is a good bill that should be supported by all members of the House.  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
I understand that many people involved have very little training. 
But there we have it. 
The minister assures us that he is doing his job well.  
I would like the minister to think about that.  
I think we need to address that. 
It sounded like a pretty lawless place. 
That happens to be in your neck of the woods, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. John Maloney (Erie-Lincoln, Lib.):
These statistics are very disturbing. 
This fact is most disturbing.  
In fact, it was shocking. 
Most people in my riding just could not comprehend this. 
The result was Bill C-89 that was tabled this past March. 
On October 30 he fulfilled that commitment. 
They already undergo extensive training on search, seizure and arrest. 
They want nothing less and our border communities demand nothing less.  
We certainly do not want to put them at risk. 
I was very happy to see that this concern was taken into consideration.  
Why has it taken so long to get to this position? 
The situation is not a simple one. 
We have to do it right. 
I am confident the proposed legislation is both reasonable and workable.  
Customs officers do not carry firearms. 
Arming them could invite more violent behaviour on the part of travellers.  
They will provide a first response only. 
For these reasons the government has chosen not to arm our officers.  
It would probably be very minimal. 
As I have indicated, this is good legislation. 
It should hopefully be passed unanimously by the House. 
The concerns being expressed today are very minimal. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
We could end up giving these border guards extra resources legally. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
It is a very good one.  
The situation of one person being on the border would never happen. 
There are many people on all shifts.  
They definitely need the resources to do the job. 
The hon. member asked if they would have the proper training or the proper education. 
I have indicated that is a necessity. 
They should be properly trained for that. 
Resources will be committed.  
Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his excellent speech. 
The member has written to the department. 
It is my firm belief that concern for Canadians is not a partisan issue. 
We do not want to hassle people as they cross the border. 
We want proper risk management. 
We want to stop smuggling. 
Our goal is to help the tourism industry. 
We will have a very sophisticated, modern customs administration. 
We can be very proud of the people in customs. 
I thank the hon. member for her comments.  
They have worked very well with me, with their national executive and with departmental officials.  
We have come up with legislation that is certainly to be desired. 
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
Let us go back now to the bill. 
Will this procedure be carried out in co-operation with union representatives?  
Will their pay be higher? 
How will these changes be reflected in the existing collective agreement? 
Will the seniority clauses be respected? 
Where will he get the money to train customs officers? 
Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
That will not change.  
They are very supportive. 
There are situations where children are being abducted. 
This is a better situation. 
We will have the legal authority to charge and to detain.  
These are very positive measures. 
We have to work with upcoming technology, new technology. 
I wish that were true, but it does not necessarily happen that way.  
We will now proceed to Statements by Members.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
I was delighted to have been asked to attend.  
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
The Grey Cup and Canadian football help to define us as a nation. 
It is part of our cultural identity. 
Canada needs a Grey Cup and we need to appreciate the tremendous value it has. 
It has helped define us as a nation.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
The Living Arts Centre will be the heart of downtown Mississauga. 
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
Canadian Pacific decided in 1994 to dismantle this section of track. 
Ms. Claudette Bradshaw (Moncton, Lib.):
Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
He had a way about him that one just could not ignore. 
Bob was fast, feisty and a fierce competitor when it came to political debate.  
We love you, Bob, and we thank you, Evelyn. 
LATVIAN AND POLISH INDEPENDENCE DAYS 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
However, this freedom was very shortlived. 
Under Soviet occupation it was lost. 
In Poland it gave rise to solidarity.  
The hon. member for Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans.  
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
Let us keep it competitive.  
Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard-La Prairie, Lib.):
All these measures reflect values that we as Canadians hold dear. 
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
Once again, congratulations to the people of Newfoundland.  
Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Fanshawe, Lib.):
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
It is also time for Canadians to share in our celebration. 
The billion dollar grant will be repaid in full. 
NORTH BRAMPTON YOUTH DROP-IN CENTRE 
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
The current prime minister denies the whole thing. 
He says there were no Liberal ministers involved. 
Two prime ministers and two different stories. 
Which prime minister is telling the truth?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The documents were tabled in the House. 
That was a statement made by Mr. Mulroney, through his lawyers, in January 1997.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the prime minister says that no Liberal politicians were involved.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the RCMP said that it is still carrying on the investigation.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, what has this bungled Airbus investigation accomplished? 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, again I will quote from the agreement. 
That is what was signed between the parties in January 1997.  
The hon. member for Edmonton North.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to get this straight. 
The prime minister says that no one is guilty until they are proven guilty. 
Canadians will be thrilled to hear that.  
I cannot blame him for that.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
That is the system that has worked well in Canada and that I respect.  
The police are responsible and are doing their job.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
They are nervous about it. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
That was the settlement agreed by the parties in January.  
SEARCH AND RESCUE HELICOPTERS 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
There is obviously a great deal of confusion regarding this important issue.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
As soon as they are, the House will be informed accordingly.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the helicopter issue goes back a long way. 
It was their prerogative. 
They chose to talk about something else. 
Too bad for them.  
Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member has provided the answer herself. 
Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert, BQ):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
But presently, we are at the review stage. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Deficit reduction is required. 
I cannot confirm those figures however. 
The cuts that are being made are being done in a fair and reasonable fashion. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister, once again, is trying to evade the question. 
I am talking about his government's taxes, not those of the provincial governments.  
This will cost jobs for students, two to three summer jobs.  
How could the Prime Minister accept this? 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
They know it contains false information and false accusations. 
Why will they not withdraw that letter?  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
They are in fact allegations.  
The terms of settlement are clear. 
Mr. Rejean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
The hon. member can, therefore, be glad that negotiations are under way. 
We trust that they will continue, and that a settlement will soon be negotiated.  
Mr. Rejean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
When we have the appropriate measures- 
That would have put our fiscal deficit out of reach. 
The hon. member for Calgary Southeast.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we are glad to finally hear that admission. 
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
The hon. member for Rosemont.  
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The provinces said that the Canadian position is a position- 
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
Yes, it is easy for you to say that now. 
There will be an agreement. 
Now we know what the provinces are prepared to do. 
The hon. member for Rosemont.  
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Today, he is content to follow the American position.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we consulted the provinces. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
That amounts to over $3,000 in new CPP taxes per working Canadian.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we acted after 15 years of inaction. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
When will the minister simply admit how unfair this plan really is?  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
We have taken the responsible course. 
Our senior citizens can rest assured that they have an indexed pension- 
The hon. member for Saint-Jean.  
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are acting totally responsibly. 
Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the secretary of state responsible for financial institutions.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
However, privacy is an issue which is of very great concern to us. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we already have. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
That is the question.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is clearly out in space on this.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
The two parties have been in negotiations since yesterday. 
They negotiated and according to reports I have, they are doing very well. 
I hope that very soon we will have a negotiated settlement.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Canada Post wants to meet those demands by eliminating jobs.  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
That is what we are doing. 
That is what is on the table.  
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
They need their money now.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Our government does recognize the financial difficulties of students and it is taking action. 
Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):
Why were they not ticketed? 
Why are they flying above the law?  
Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):
Part of those regulations are that emergency landings can be made. 
This was an emergency landing. 
It was under the regulations and it was an appropriate use of that airstrip.  
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Yesterday's attack in Egypt sent shock waves around the world. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
We did talk about those kinds of issues.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport. 
I am pleased to give him the opportunity.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
I do not propose to negotiate in public. 
I hope that all sides can be bound by the results of that study.  
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
My question is for the Minister of Transport. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
We have to find other ways. 
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Brian Mulroney is an innocent man and the Prime Minister knows it. 
To allow the investigation to carry on, the Prime Minister is suggesting that there is- 
The hon. member for Nanaimo-Alberni.  
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
My question is what is the position of the government in Kyoto? 
Secondly, what is the plan to achieve these targets? 
What is the position? 
What is the plan?  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we still have not heard any position from the Reform Party. 
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Colleagues, I urge you not to bring any props into this House. 
The question then I will rule out of order. 
That brings to a close our question period.  
And I have a point of order from the member for Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough.  
Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):
This advice came by phone and subsequently by letter.  
These students are clearly not staff of the House of Commons. 
Clearly this is a serious matter of privilege. 
It is a prima facie case of privilege.  
With your permission I would move that motion.  
Once again, with your permission, I would move a third motion on this.  
The hon. member for Sarnia-Lambton has made his case. 
I would like to look into some of the allegations he has put forth. 
I will reserve judgement on this until I get more information. 
I want to satisfy myself. 
On a second question of privilege, the hon. member for York South-Weston.  
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
I was elected, just as all other members were elected, by constituencies. 
I would ask that you review the practice.  
We have been able to get in more members of Parliament.  
I find no problem with that.  
In that way I believe it has improved.  
I am always open to suggestions from members of Parliament. 
I will take your suggestion under advisement, if that is what it is. 
Mr. Speaker, you did not give me the opportunity to finish my submissions. 
I am afraid you have misinterpreted my submissions.  
I do not want to enter into a debate with the hon. member. 
I have been trying to get the questions in, in a reasonable amount of time. 
I would encourage all members. 
I am very, very much aware of that. 
By way of improving the question period I will take the suggestions under advisement.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to rise. 
An extensive negotiation process went into that.  
I thank the hon. member for his opinion with regard to that. 
Was that his point of order?  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
If it proves to be beneficial for them then so much the better.  
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
I hope you will take that into account, Mr. Speaker. 
I appreciate the magnanimity of the member. 
Yes, I will take that into account.  
Ms. Colleen Beaumier (Brampton West-Mississauga, Lib.):
It is absolutely impossible for me to understand how this could happen. 
Of course I appreciate the hon. member's remarks. 
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
The information has been well documented by the hon. member for Sarnia-Lambton. 
I will look into the matter and try to get to the bottom of it.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
I raised the same concern a month ago in the context of the process. 
It is being decided by the Board of Internal Economy. 
We are not being given direct input.  
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
I do not want you to get into any secrets here.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
The Board of Internal Economy consists of representatives of the various parties. 
I thank you very much for your interventions. 
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Lotbiniere is quite correct. 
He has the floor to respond to a question previously put. 
We will resume debate after the hon. member has responded. 
I also asked a few questions that were not answered. 
She replied that she had received a letter. 
So, with this in mind, the Bloc Quebecois would like things to be clear.  
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
We want to take advantage of our advantageous position. 
The bill will transform enforcement of the Criminal Code at the border considerably. 
This makes a huge difference in the enforcement of the Criminal Code at the border.  
They will not take part in investigations under the Criminal Code. 
Mr. Gary Pillitteri (Niagara Falls, Lib.):
I am proud to lend my support to Bill C-18. 
American officials alerted Canada Customs that an armed man was heading back into Canada. 
Sadly, Canadian officials did not have the legal right to detain him. 
I believe that the proposed legislation is consistent with the jury's recommendation.  
Customs officers in my riding have raised the issue of bullet proof vests. 
Many of the youths in my riding get jobs during the summer as customs officers. 
In fact, it could be a serious mistake. 
Arming them in fact could invite more violent behaviour on the part of criminals. 
Police will intervene at the earliest possible stage.  
They have always acted professionally and completely within the scope of their authority.  
I am in favour and I lend by support to Bill C-18. 
I am in favour of and I am pleased to support Bill C-18. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
However, let us just talk a little more about this bill. 
It is a failure of this bill that it does not address that. 
This bill also does not address the cost factor. 
I will give one example right now and I will get to more later. 
That sends a message of absolutely zero penalty to the criminal.  
I will go through them piece by piece.  
The hon. Minister of Justice knows this right now. 
We have again failed to do this.  
Over 80% of rapes are never reported. 
This cannot be overlooked. 
It is in fact essential for us to do that.  
I think we need to keep that in mind.  
Cigarette trafficking has also been a serious problem. 
It was to bring forth the export tax. 
The government did that but it also dropped the price. 
What did the Conservative government do at that time? 
It stuck its tail between its legs and removed the export tax. 
It does nothing to diminish one aspect of cigarette trafficking. 
Finally, I will talk about endangered species. 
The smuggling and trafficking of endangered species in Canada is a serious problem. 
They cannot do it.  
Individuals who are trafficking in gall bladders laugh at the penalties. 
But there are some solutions.  
Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
He believes quite honestly that students will have the first response powers. 
That is definitely not the case. 
I have stated that a number of times in this House today.  
I believe that we have a smart border in Canada. 
I do not say that just because it sounds nice. 
We use our intelligence networks to target high risk situations.  
It is a very large border. 
We expedite our trade. 
It has grown from the time we took power in 1993. 
We are dealing with 158,000 large importers and exporters. 
It is a big responsibility.  
That is really important to understand.  
The numbers are phenomenal and they are growing. 
This is very important for the hon. member to understand. 
As the hon. member mentioned, trade is very important to our country. 
It is a serious issue for the people of Victoria. 
It is ludicrous for us. 
It will hurt the Americans even more so if the visa requirement is imposed.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
On questions and comments, the hon. parliamentary secretary.  
Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are all aware of relevancy. 
We are constantly looking at ways of doing our work better. 
We are aware of the seriousness of this issue. 
I think we have an unusual consensus in the House. 
I would like to thank the hon. member again for her statement. 
We never ever want to see a tragedy like that repeated in this country.  
DRINKING WATER MATERIALS SAFETY ACT 
The Chair recognizes the member for Macleod on debate.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
That would be why she is not here.  
I am strongly in support of it but there are some difficulties. 
On this issue members of the Bloc and I are in concurrence.  
Water control has traditionally been a provincial matter. 
For the benefit of all Canadians, let me list those organizations. 
I went to each one of the organizations. 
I have quite a series of documents from them. 
I want to highlight some of their concerns. 
Let me start with the Canadian Safe Drinking Water Systems Coalition.  
I read that the minister says consultation was broad and thorough. 
It says neither are in fact accurate.  
This group has a number of concerns. 
It goes through a host of things the bill purports to address.  
This group gets quite specific. 
It simply says the bill is unnecessarily intrusive and expensive.  
They are not small groups. 
One group I mentioned comprises 600 Canadian manufacturers and installers. 
Many other areas are far more desperate for funds than this area. 
Let us cut this monster word down to something understandable. 
This organism causes diarrhoea. 
It is not treatable so it would be a good idea to prevent it. 
Most Canadians would recognize that.  
This is not something common to Canada. 
Unsanitary conditions are the main problem. 
The bill will be singularly ineffective in combating cryptosporidium.  
Reformers try not to only oppose. 
There are problems with our drinking water. 
They are generally problems at source. 
Some municipalities do not have a clue how much is leaking. 
Funds should be spent to start fixing the infrastructure. 
There were more scientific studies to look at our drinking water in a broader context. 
I found them to be quite satisfying. 
We have been paying attention to our drinking water. 
The Great Lakes are a fascinating source. 
It is a mini capsule look at how we are doing with the environment. 
The study measured PCB levels in herring gull eggs. 
Broad categories seem to come from our legislators today. 
They are very broad powers of inspection. 
They are unspecified fees. 
The regulations should come back to the health committee.  
Bureaucrats are not the best individuals in this area. 
This bill is unnecessary. 
This bill is intrusive. 
This bill is potentially expensive. 
For those reasons I will oppose it vigorously.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Clause 3 states that its purpose is: 
Was general neglect the option chosen? 
But what about this gap? 
How wide is it?  
On the Quebec side, we have our own provincial regulations. 
Municipalities have tangible and critical responsibilities in the area of water management. 
They must ensure that individuals and businesses can drink this water. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We are not fools, however. 
It does this, of course, in the name of public health. 
That is totally wrong. 
We all want to be on the side of the angels. 
Who would not want our drinking water to be safe? 
Clause 5, under the National Drinking Water Directives , reads as follows: 
( b ) the physical and chemical properties of drinking water; 
( c ) the aesthetic characteristics of drinking water; 
( d ) the methods for analysing drinking water; and 
Not only is this duplication, the powers conferred on inspectors are very broad. 
At clause 17.(1), the bill states: 
Who will decide where and when to act? 
Who will determine that it is appropriate or necessary to obtain a warrant? 
But the Minister of Health was very careful not to read that part. 
Is there any need for another piece of legislation?  
Fish are federal until they are out of the water, then they become provincial. 
The shores are provincial, but the ports are federal property.  
There is something absurd in all of this.  
No one really believed this. 
It dictates national standards on the quality of drinking water. 
Mr. Speaker, I would now like to table an amendment. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
On every other front we are seeing the opposite. 
We are faced with a government that is rapidly moving out of regulatory approaches. 
Let me put it in context. 
My question today is where does this legislation come from? 
What is it intending to achieve? 
What regulatory framework does it fit into? 
What is the result of that approach? 
We have lost a valuable research bureau on drugs. 
Come on, a regulatory body of utmost importance has vanished. 
$2 million to $3 million. 
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
This is a very important debate. 
I do not see a quorum. 
Perhaps I should ring the bells. 
And the bells having rung 
I see a quorum.  
The hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre may resume her speech.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
Mr. Speaker, the drug bureau is gone. 
However, we know the agenda is still alive and well.  
Where is it on the agenda?  
That raises a very serious point with respect to this bill as well. 
Now they are wondering where this legislation came from.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, on a point of order.  
We feel it is very important. 
I am calling for a quorum count.  
Oh, the hon. member is calling for a quorum. 
I see a quorum.  
The hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
All the evidence points to the contrary. 
We do not have any evidence to the contrary. 
What will it accomplish? 
How will it protect us? 
What does it mean?  
We have a council for water quality. 
It begs the question why this legislation? 
What is it for? 
What is the rush?  
What are the priorities of this government? 
Where is that on the priority list? 
Why are we not dealing with that in this House? 
Why do we need to change the standards? 
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened to the hon. member speak against this proposed legislation. 
I believe the hon. member's heart is in the right place. 
She brought up some very thoughtful questions. 
She made some very thoughtful interventions.  
I want to comment on a couple of the questions that the honourable member asked.  
The first question was why the haste in bringing in this bill. 
This bill was first tabled in December 1996. 
This is not haste. 
It is obvious that you cannot do all things at once, but this is important.  
Why do we need this bill now? 
The whole concept of good public health policy is to be proactive. 
It is to protect people, to prevent. 
It is called preventive health care at its very best. 
That is what the legislation is about.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
Those are the key issues. 
That is what I would like to hear from this government. 
Mr. Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough-Agincourt, Lib.):
We have been at this almost a year. 
How much longer do you want to wait? 
I know the hon. member will want to address the Chair in his remarks.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
If that is not privatization what is?  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
I have quite a correspondence from them. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
He meant to say member and he said minister. 
I believe that was the mistake that was made. 
Perhaps the hon. member for Macleod wishes to clarify the point.  
I did mean member. 
I was speaking of the Minister of Health having received this information.  
I trust that clears the matter up.  
And the bells having rung: 
The House resumed from November 5 consideration of the motion.  
(The House divided on Motion No. 7, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
ALLOTTED DAY-GOODS AND SERVICES TAX 
The question is on the amendment.  
(The House divided on the amendment, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the amendment lost.  
The next question is on the main motion.  
Is there unanimous consent to proceed in this manner?  
I declare the motion lost.  
See list under Division No. 24 ] 
AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF CANADA (QUEBEC) 
The House resumed from November 17 consideration of the motion.  
The question is as follows:
Mr. Dion, seconded by Mr. Chan, moved that: 
Paragraphs (1) to (4) of section 93 do not apply to Quebec.'' 
2. This Amendment may be cited as the Constitution Amendment, year of proclamation (Quebec).  
(The House divided on Motion No. 4, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
Non-compliance may result in the recipient having to repay the grant.  
This is a well drafted bill which would require little amendment to the present legislation. 
It is intended that specific dollar amounts be advertised. 
Canadian taxpayers have paid money into this film.  
There are those of you who say art must be subsidized in order to survive. 
Many projects are funded through a number of government programs. 
This legislation is by no means focused on one region of the country. 
We are talking about very substantial money here.  
Again, this is reinforced by the statistics mentioned previously.  
Are they proud of these programs or events that are put on? 
Some say too little, some say too much. 
Why not advertise that fact?  
Give credit where credit is due, to the taxpayer.  
This bill is also about accountability. 
I read from the proceedings of the committee. 
The minister ended up making very light of this letter. 
Obviously this is a rather unusual title. 
In fact, the content in my humble judgment of this particular book is clearly obscene.  
I went on to say, however: ``I am not the censor. 
First of all, you say you do not want to be a censor. 
I could not believe my ears when I heard her actually say this.  
This is absolutely unspeakable and uncalled for. 
Yet the Canadian taxpayer is paying for it.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
There is not unanimous consent.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Non-compliance of this requirement may result in the recipient having to repay the grant.  
I strongly support this bill. 
Typically, everyone washes their hands of taking responsibility.  
Bill C-204 is a step in the right direction. 
This leads to the question:
I do not think the purpose of this bill is objectionable. 
Perhaps this government will see the light and introduce a similar bill.  
Bill C-204 fills one of those gaps. 
It is a small step in making us more accountable.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
I find this a reasonable idea. 
This sort of problem has never been raised on the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage. 
It appears in big capital letters. 
That does not cause any problem.  
Once again, this poses no problem.  
Now it proposes a bill that seems to have no purpose. 
It is up to parliament to set the overall objectives of cultural policy. 
The government implements those objectives by funding cultural organizations. 
It ought not to go any further than this. 
This approach is of no interest to either Canada or Quebec. 
When they refused, he realized his mistake and cancelled his directive.  
Its title is very precise. 
It is the Cultural Grants Acknowledgement Act. 
It has a very narrow focus. 
This obligation would apply to individuals as well as to corporations and organizations.  
I believe the bill in one sense is based on a sound principle. 
Government money is taxpayers' money. 
Private donors and sponsors routinely obtain such acknowledgement. 
There is no reason why governments should not. 
These grants are singled out from within a particular ministry, the Canadian Heritage portfolio.  
Why should we restrict legislation to cultural projects alone? 
It is well understood and documented how this should be accomplished. 
The policy regarding acknowledgement in the Department of Canadian Heritage is open and transparent. 
We heard some examples of that from the Bloc member this evening.  
By and large current measures can be characterized as self-regulatory. 
They work reasonably well. 
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
It is something which cultural industries are already doing voluntarily.  
They do not always attach the dollar amount publicly at the event. 
They go to be elevated, delighted, challenged and revitalized. 
Canadian cultural industries are grateful and eager to thank the funders of their work. 
I would like to see the level of support for our artists increased. 
We can put a price tag on everything if we want to. 
There is a myth afoot that there is no accountability in the arts.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
We give money to agencies without the need for accountability. 
We simply say ``here is the money, spend it any way you wish''. 
They find some of the most obscene ways to spend it.  
It was incredibly obscene.  
It has no market in Canadian society. 
We need to stop it. 
Instead it is being used for this kind of garbage.  
I commend my hon. colleague for presenting it.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
It is an attempt to use dollars- 
If you would have heard what I heard on CBC- 
I have heard many things on CBC that have offended me. 
There is no accountability there.  
I don't know.  
We have come a long way. 
My colleague from Dartmouth explained it like this. 
We go to a public event to be educated, sometimes to be offended. 
We do not go to be offended but sometimes we are. 
We go to be stirred. 
We go to be enlightened. 
We go to create the kind of debate we are having here today.  
I speak in favour of the freedom of the artist to express himself or herself.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The time for private members' business this evening is just about over. 
From the perspective of the Chair it was a very good debate.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, indeed the speaker prior to myself put his finger on it. 
The speaker spoke of the right of artistic expression. 
That is a shame.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
The employees are not stupid. 
I look forward to hearing him boast about his wonderfully charitable offer.  
If my hon. colleague replies in this vein, I will believe him. 
Let us also remember that there is still the threat of special legislation.  
They too are taking part in the public effort. 
The government must work with, not against, its employees. 
I have only this to add: do the fair thing.  
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):
The government will continue to fulfill its obligations to pay equity. 
As part of its commitment, it enacted legislation for Canada in 1978. 
It has paid over $1 billion in pay equity payments. 
This means further delays. 
Furthermore, any of the parties could file a judicial review. 
A joint resolution will get the cheques in the hands of the employees sooner.  
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
APEC represents 18 countries. 
The people's summit was an attempt to bring a balance to this process. 
They do have rights.  
That is not the way APEC sees it. 
APEC curtails democracy through informal understandings. 
They were not allowed to participate. 
There was no money for transportation. 
It would have allowed them to fully participate.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member, but her time has expired.  
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 7.39 p.m.)
