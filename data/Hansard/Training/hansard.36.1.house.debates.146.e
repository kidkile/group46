The House met at 10 a.m. 
PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTION AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS ACT 
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
New technologies provide new capabilities to collect and manage personal data. 
Bill C-54 provides that assurance and much more. 
These will provide a model for electronic commerce in general. 
However, as exemplary as this code is, it has been voluntary. 
Now we are enshrining its principles in law and we are making significant improvements.  
The private sector also has an extremely important role to play. 
The organization should then look into the complaint and attempt to resolve it.  
In such cases there must be a second avenue for redress. 
This legislation provides that avenue. 
Experience has shown that industry self-regulation has not been up to the task. 
That the question be now put.  
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
This is an example of industry self-regulation.  
It also brings forward a very serious concern regarding the patient-doctor relationship. 
For this reason Bill C-54 should be supported. 
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
I was involved in broadcast media at the time.  
All these changes have always served the public at large, the general public, well. 
The purpose of this legislation is to support and promote electronic commerce. 
This contention is based on a comprehensive review of the CSA code. 
Discussions of e-commerce become a little complicated. 
These types of transactions have been in existence for quite some time. 
Electronic data interchange is no longer restricted to large corporations or governments. 
The Internet is becoming increasingly popular at home.  
The wording lends itself to a broad interpretation.  
This shortcoming will affect the bill's credibility.  
This is another method frequently used by our friends opposite. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Bill C-54 is the unfortunate result of that promise.  
I will point out some of the weaknesses in Bill C-54. 
This is a weak bill whose centrepiece is its schedule. 
The minister did not do so. 
On top of all these shortcomings, there is an even greater concern. 
The issues are clear. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
My concerns have to do with identification and security of information.  
I think there would be if I did that. 
I have no intentions of doing that, but it is an electronic possibility.  
It used to be that people recognized voices on the phone. 
We do not yet have an adequate means of defining the source of electronic information. 
Part of the legislation includes development of electronic signatures. 
However it is one thing that could be done.  
A physical signature is inadequate to identify a document.  
Another way of doing it is as is done now in electronic commerce with banks. 
How can we do that if we are sending something to an organization? 
Most of us have PINs on our bank card or on our MasterCard. 
How do we do that electronically? 
This is a digression. 
It is a very interesting process.  
I never got around to marketing it. 
This is one of the things that has to be dealt with very severely, identification. 
There are other considerations which I think are also very important. 
We hear over and over again that in this country we are taxed to death. 
That has to change.  
I am distressed with this government. 
It has had some success. 
If we took that away we would not have a balanced budget. 
The government has done that on the backs of those people.  
Otherwise we will have them out of the economic loop. 
They can be sent anywhere around the world.  
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
The federal government and every province enacted similar legislation. 
In 1994, the Quebec law extended the protection of personal information to the private sector.  
We have no objection to that. 
Instead, Quebeckers' rights are being diminshed.  
It is worse than that. 
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville, Lib.):
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
The federal government is giving the following: $12.9 million for artistic and cultural development; 
$1.5 million to the Theatre du Nouvel Ontario, in Sudbury; 
$100,000 to the Festival franco-ontarien; 
$2.5 million annually to TV Ontario and TFO; 
These concrete measures confirm the federal government's commitment to the franco-Ontarian community.  
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
They are gathering dust as we approach Remembrance Day. 
Some issues have existed for over 50 years. 
The veterans of Canada want our government to listen now, not later. 
Our veterans' concerns should not be a new millennium project.  
Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):
That is not likely to change in the very near future.  
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
Farmers are being abandoned by this Liberal government. 
We cannot deny it.  
In Canada we have a farm income crisis on our hands. 
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
The hon. member for Ottawa Centre.  
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the staff and volunteers of UNICEF.  
Instead of asking for candy they will be collecting coins.  
It will help to save the life of a needy child. 
We can make a difference.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the farm income crisis is taking its toll. 
In September the stress line received 147 calls. 
The hope is going. 
You can only struggle for so long''.  
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the next election in Quebec is of paramount importance.  
The hon. member for Laval Centre.  
MEDICAL RESEARCH IN CANADA 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
In Canada, public funding in this respect is very clearly insufficient. 
The hon. member for Riviere Churchill.  
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
There are huge tracts of land with extreme living costs. 
ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN QUEBEC 
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
Fortunately, Quebec can count on a dynamic Liberal team- 
The hon. member for Shefford.  
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
The hon. member for Quebec has the floor.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Mr. Ivan Grose (Oshawa, Lib.):
The age of the aircraft is seldom a major contributing factor. 
It all comes down to maintenance. 
Properly maintained aircraft can last virtually indefinitely.  
These aircraft are becoming too expensive to maintain and must be replaced. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
The quality of life of Canadians living on reserves is a national shame.  
This will never happen as long as the money is paid to band administrators. 
The process is plagued with financial mismanagement. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
First the Reform Party wants to apply it to the deficit. 
Now the Reform Party wants to give it all back. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
The Prime Minister has promised us a public debate on employment insurance. 
He has broken that promise. 
We have had no hearings. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is certainly participating in the prebudget consultation debate. 
He was with the committee when we were in parts of western Canada. 
The member has been here in Ottawa participating in the debate. 
Who do we hear from in that debate? 
We hear from Canadians who come forward and talk about Canadian priorities. 
The debate is ongoing. 
I encourage the hon. member to continue to participate.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I guess the Prime Minister thinks he is above the law.  
Mr. Speaker, the word is withdrawn but the question still stands.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Perhaps I could encourage the member to attend. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
We need more troops, not fewer.  
The government has a choice. 
The hon. Minister of National Defence.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, as usual the hon. member's research is faulty. 
There is no deficit. 
There is no overspending. 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN QUEBEC 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Discontent is setting in among the federal Liberals.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I talked about a referendum which we would win. 
Does the minister not realize that- 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Their only goal is to promote sovereignty.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
There is a process in place right now that will be followed.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
The fact is Canadians do not want government to control the newsroom. 
They do not want the boardroom to control the newsroom. 
They want reporters to cover the news free of pressure and free of bullying.  
Will this government back legislation to protect editorial independence?  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
The Competition Act is a valid act. 
I believe we will address the issues.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The firing of Dussault is between Mr. Palmer and Mr. Dussault. 
It has nothing to do with the government. 
It has nothing to do with the Minister of Finance.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary secretary mentioned John Palmer. 
Why is there a conspiracy to muzzle? 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
One would think there are real questions to ask around here.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
I talked to the Jacobs family last week. 
According to them they have not received one minute of counselling, not one minute.  
What was the $50,000 used for? 
Where did it go? 
What was it granted for? 
What is its whole purpose?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
ICE BREAKING IN PORTS 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
Yet, the minister's words have nothing to do with the facts.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this issue has been in the forefront for several years. 
In fact there has been intense consultation over the last four years.  
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
We have consulted extensively with the industry. 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's question.  
I have appointed a mediator to this dispute. 
Both parties are not meeting at this time. 
SHEEP PRODUCTION IN QUEBEC 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
He has written back to me and said that he was not interested.  
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the minister knows that the federal government is to blame. 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will repeat again. 
That was their decision. 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Trade.  
We cannot hear questions and answers. 
The hon. member for Peace River.  
Mr. Bob Speller (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it must be Friday. 
The government has been doing things very actively for the benefit of farmers. 
Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Solicitor General.  
This is very costly to the Canadian taxpayers. 
What exactly is being proposed to crack down on this problem?  
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
We have approximately 16,000 of them coming into Canada every year. 
As we speak the solicitor general is discussing with his- 
The hon. member for Surrey Central.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Jamaican officials refuse to answer questions and turn over the files. 
In fact they shredded those files.  
Why not use the money instead of wasting it?  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
That program was fully expended in Jamaica. 
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
However, we are not taking any chances. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the minister of financial institutions.  
Can the minister tell us whether there will be a trade-off? 
Is that the trade-off?  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Can he speak directly to that question and answer it now? 
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
We want to hear from Canadians and we want to hear from the committees.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the era of post-panamax shipping is upon us. 
Will the minister commit to these needed changes?  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
The Halifax port authority will be treated like all other port authorities. 
Consultation has been going on. 
We have formed an advisory group representative of some of the interests he raised. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, once again the hon. member has his facts wrong. 
They will reflect a broad range of interests dealing with users.  
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
We are in the implementation stages of the agreement that has been struck. 
Canada has committed to send verifiers. 
Canada has now raised its commitment to- 
The hon. member for Calgary East.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
The hon. member for Jonquiere. 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has raised a number of concerns which are not valid.  
First of all, Pearson airport is operating safely. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Obviously the minister was telling us that Nova Scotia comes last.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
The minister, on the other hand, wants to Canadianize the fisheries.  
Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Middlesex, Lib.):
Mr. Bob Speller (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I can give these assurance.  
NAFTA provides protection to those Canadian steel producers which export to the United States.  
Our steel industry is a good steel industry and we are fair traders. 
We will continue to protect it.  
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
He is trying to come to a resolution of this matter as quickly as possible.  
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  
The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Now it has become the victim of the government's cost cutting. 
If Night Rider goes under, people will die.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
There is a long term solution and a short term solution. 
It deals with matters of social assistance. 
It deals with the issues of cutbacks as a result of government belt tightening. 
This is a complex problem and we should all work together to solve it.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
We would be very interested in this. 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
If the minister wishes to table a document she may do so. 
We will consider the document tabled.  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
JUSTICE AND HUMAN RIGHTS 
Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions to table in the House today.  
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
This petition is signed by several thousand citizens.  
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTION AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS ACT 
We do not think this approach respects the Canadian Constitution.  
That is what former federalist premier Robert Bourassa said.  
This bill is extremely disappointing. 
We had a debate on telemarketing in the House. 
I am in favour of this approach.  
This is what the bill is all about.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
I believe they are deliberately trying to misrepresent the facts.  
That is important to note.  
Let us be clear here because it is important. 
Finally, Bill C-54 will complement Quebec's legislation. 
To suggest otherwise is misleading, false and quite frankly, incorrect. 
It is important that Quebecers and all Canadians know this.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
I will give more examples later.  
(a) industry and technology in Canada; 
(b) trade and commerce in Canada; 
(c) science in Canada; 
(e) corporations and corporate securities; 
(f) competition and restraint of trade, including mergers and monopolies; 
On December 19, we wrote the Minister of Industry a letter along these lines: 
You therefore played a role in developing the unregulated grey market of satellite dishes. 
On February 26, the minister answered my letter of December 19. 
He said that he understood my disappointment and the disappointment of the consumers.  
This contention is based on a comprehensive review of the CSA code. 
Every day, we discover something about this government. 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
But yesterday, the government unilaterally changed the order of the day.  
I partly understand it. 
I quote from the committee report: 
I resume the quotation: 
What is our goal in all this? 
What do we seek for individuals in this? 
Finally, the committee recognized the following rights for citizens: 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
This is a bill whose form and content will both create confusion.  
Second, the legislation is muddled.  
In clause 5(2), the bill provides: 
Its title alone makes this clear.  
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
This bill is designed to support and promote electronic commerce. 
I will quote the title of the bill: 
What are the issues related to this bill? 
The issues are different, of course, for the various stakeholders. 
The figures, which are just astronomical, speak for themselves.  
We must first establish confidence in the digital economy. 
This is the challenge for the industry minister. 
For these people, the challenge is also quite clear. 
The information provided gives both the number of children and the age ranges. 
This is computer technology at work. 
Here is another case. 
The number of hidden cameras is on the rise. 
In 1996, there were 200,000 hidden cameras in the U.K. alone. 
What about the bill? 
Does it meet the expectations it created? 
The answer is far from clear.  
The member has only one minute left.  
Does the hon. member have leave to complete his remarks?  
Mr. Speaker, the question I was asking is:
Does this bill meet our expectations? 
As I said, the answer is far from clear.  
First, the legislation has different titles at the federal and provincial levels. 
The protection of personal information comes second.  
English newspapers talk about this bill in terms of a ``lightheaded government approach to cyberspace''. 
Third, this bill grants new discretionary powers to the governor in council. 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
I believe you would find consent for the following motion: 
PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTION AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS ACT 
The Bloc voted against that legislation.  
We deal with issues one at a time but we deal with them. 
Let me come back to the main point.  
This legislation is not impeding on that legislation. 
It is muddying the waters, distorting information. 
But they are not journalists.  
This legislation will allow them to do their job better. 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak after the Liberal member. 
Unfortunately, I do not get to do so often.  
Who knows what tomorrow will bring?  
It is a step backwards from it. 
As far as protecting personal information is concerned, Quebec sets an example. 
Quebec is the only government in North America to have such an act. 
Mr. Owens also indicated and I quote: 
So, we would be backtracking compared to what is being done in Quebec. 
The annual report says: 
This contention is based on a comprehensive review of the CSA code. 
The report says also: 
The government is more likely to be sensitive to these arguments. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
That government will be re-elected because it has done a good job. 
I invite my colleagues to take part in a show of exuberance.  
Let us talk about this bill. 
The very title of the bill is unbelievable. 
It goes like this: 
With high marks on the bar exam.  
What do they say in introductory law? 
They say that the best legislative texts are the shortest ones.  
We will not let that happen. 
Clearly, it is not too late. 
I see that my time is almost up. 
As everyone knows, it is a full time job. 
It is also an exhausting job.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. Lee):
The hon. member's time has expired.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, there is surely no doubt that electronic commerce is here. 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral:
The Acting Speaker (Mr. Lee):
I would be happy to put the request of the hon. member to the House. 
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. Lee):
The hon. member realizes that unanimous consent was not accorded at that time.  
Mr. Speaker, there is surely no doubt that electronic commerce is here. 
Ensuring increased confidence in this process is, without question, a good idea.  
Seventy per cent of Canadians are without Internet access. 
One of the greatest barriers is cost to the individual.  
Tech costs and the Internet on-line costs are very prohibitive.  
Of course, that is no longer the case.  
Smaller businesses will be hard pressed to survive because of the prohibitive cost.  
Is this what we want in Canada?  
Another aspect, of course, is job loss. 
Do we need more unemployed in Canada?  
I will not be supporting it.  
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
The titles of both laws give us an important clue. 
This really concerns me. 
Once again, that is what we will see with this bill.  
Clause 27 says that: 
This is not what happened.  
What about that Quebec legislation?  
There is nothing ambiguous about section 5: 
Every person has a right to the respect of his or her privacy.  
Every person has a right to the respect of his reputation and privacy. 
(4) keeping his private life under observation by any means; 
(6) using his correspondence, manuscripts or other personal documents.  
The information contained in the file shall be made accessible in an intelligible transcript.  
There is no such clause in the federal legislation.  
And the count having been taken: 
And the bells having rung: 
There is a quorum.  
I just counted them. 
The hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean's time has expired.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I counted 20 members. 
Members are counted if I can see them. 
I could see 20 members. 
I counted them personally. 
I am satisfied that there were 20 here.  
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral:
The matter is settled.  
We are asking you to reconsider.  
I counted 20 members present. 
I can see them in the House here. 
Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. 
Could you quote from Beauchesne's?  
We ask for a quorum check once more. 
This is a matter of integrity.  
You cannot check the quorum the way you say it can be done. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
That is a key point.  
This is a concern of people and I have to raise that concern. 
I am glad I have had a few moments to do that.  
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
When we talk about electronic commerce, what exactly are we talking about?  
These types of transactions have been in existence for quite some time. 
Electronic data interchange is not longer restricted to large corporations and government. 
So far so good. 
It would be terrible.  
But we have the tools to make it very difficult for them. 
One should not generalize and panic.  
Our credit card number is handled by strangers.  
But it is true that there are fraudulent uses of credit cards.  
Mr. Speaker, could you, please call the House to order?  
Yes, this is ridiculous. 
And it is such a great speech.  
That is where all the question of electronic commerce facilitation kicks in.  
What are the two problems that can arise in terms of protection of personal information? 
That is the first problem.  
Then, there is also the misuse or illegal use of the information. 
It is here to stay.  
It makes sense to do so. 
We can condemn duplication. 
We can say that things should have been done differently. 
We can propose ways other than those used in the past. 
But the governor in council is really the cabinet. 
We can see right there that the ideology is totally different.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
That means more than simply changing our approach to e-commerce. 
It is extremely important that we come to grips with this challenge. 
the Internet is a lot like an adolescent in some ways. 
This industry is in a period of change and transition. 
I can look at something on the Internet from Finland, for example. 
Finland may be guided by completely different rules than Australia. 
I was interested in hearing the comments of my colleague in the Reform Party. 
How can we tax these financial instruments and these exchanges through commerce?  
No other sector has been as dominated by technology as the Canadian financial services sector. 
We are grappling with the idea of trying to control the Canadian financial sector. 
We must recognize that this industry is controlled largely by changes in technology.  
Some people have bank branch myopia. 
They somehow think the prevalent provider of banking services is still the bank branch. 
That is the Liberal way.  
I commend my colleagues opposite. 
There has been a proselytization that should be commended. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
The title reads as follows: 
What is the short title?  
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral:
Clause 4.2.5 of the same schedule says: 
There is a world of difference between shall and should.
