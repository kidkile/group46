Every day the McCrae House in Guelph-Wellington works to keep his memory alive.

May you continue to do so for many years to come.  
Mr. John Maloney (Erie-Lincoln, Lib.):
Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):

Mr. Carmen Provenzano (Sault Ste. Marie, Lib.):
Algoma Steel provides thousands of direct and indirect jobs in my riding. 
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
The provinces must stand firm and not retreat. 
This is a clear and apparent circumvention of the law.  
Once again I implore the provinces to stand firm. 
The Alberta court decision must be appealed.  
QUEBEC'S TOURIST INDUSTRY 
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):

We appreciate their efforts and are most grateful to them.  
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
Now 50 years hence 
Canada's merchant navy veterans 
Are still held hostage 
These determined veterans now fast 
On the steps of this House 
To garner government will 
To correct what has been wrong for far too long.  
These men are not seeking great wealth 
For the years from the war 
To be recognized as war veterans 
To have prisoner of war benefits 
To have fair recompense for years of denial of equality 
To have recognition on ceremonial days.  
Why, Mr. Minister, are these men 
Driven to risk their health?  
Please answer their call

A world renowned neurosurgeon, Dr. Drake was an innovator in his field.

The hon. Lucien Lamoureux was a great parliamentarian.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
Mr. Speaker, the truth is the truth. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, here are the relevant facts. 
Can the Prime Minister explain to these people why he continues to rip them off?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, what we are debating at this time is not very complicated. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Now we want to see them prove it.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what we are debating. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is time for the Prime Minister to wake up. 
The dollar fell dramatically today. 
The economy shrank for the fourth month in a row. 
We know the government has been in a coma for the last six months.  
Why do they not follow their own advice?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We have said that they create 85% of the jobs in Canada. 
So 85% of that is one million. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
There are many cases like that.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):

There is a debate under way, and there will be a budget.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
The involvement of the Prime Minister's Office in the APEC matter is clear. 
Pelletier, Carle, Goldenberg, Donolo, the list is growing. 
Why this undemocratic choice?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We invited people to come here for the APEC summit. 
These people included Jose Ramos Horta, the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize. 
Here is what this famous individual had to say about Suharto's arrival in Canada.  
The hon. leader of the New Democratic Party.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister had a choice. 
Why did did this Prime Minister choose to side with Suharto?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
He came to Canada as an APEC member. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
I believe they do.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
I ask the hon. member to get directly to his question.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We have collaborated with the commission. 
Let the commission do its work. 
I have nothing to hide, absolutely nothing to hide. 
That is why we are happy that the commission will start its work on Monday. 
Let it do its work.  
When the inquiry is over I will be here. 
I am here every day, sir, to reply to your questions. 
I am not afraid at all.

There are new witnesses every day:
Craig Jones, Chief Sparrow, Mr. Vanderloo. 
The paper trail is getting longer and longer.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is what the leader of the NDP said. 
It is the same thing. 
She accused Mr. Goldenberg of calling the president of the university. 
AUDITOR GENERAL'S REPORT 
Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Does the Prime Minister agree with his press secretary? 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
There is an instrument to do that. 
It starts its work on Monday. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Why does he not get up and answer them? 
Why did the Prime Minister do that?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member is trading his interest for the truth- 
Mr. Speaker, I think Canadians want to get to the truth. 
The commission starts on Monday. 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
We will continue to do so. 
STANDING COMMITTEE ON FISHERIES AND OCEANS 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
The minister will do in one of his own to save his own hide.  
Why is the minister covering up his own failures by having his fisheries chair fired?  
I do not know that this deals directly with the minister's responsibility. 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
What we want to know now- 
The hon. member for Louis-Hebert.  
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Yes, I can, Mr. Speaker, and we have already done it.  
QUEBEC'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
On each occasion, it excluded the Canadian government.  
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague for his excellent question.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
My question is to the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
I would agree with him.  
Do we have the process perfectly worked out yet? 
No, we do not. 
Most important, the question is whether it is the right thing to do. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
That is how unemployed Canadians feel about the EI system. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Whenever it decides this government is committed to balanced budgets. 
The EI debate is not just about premiums. 
It about making choices. 
They also want reinvestment in programs.  
We have prebudget consultations in front of the finance committee. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, that answer helps us realize our worst fears. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am glad we are having the debate. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I dismiss that suggestion by the hon. member. 
I ask the hon. member to perhaps check his facts.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The Minister of Finance had nothing to do with it. 
I am responsible for OSFI and this was my decision as the superintendent''. 
Clearly it was Mr. Palmer's decision.  
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Trade.  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
He has not done anything so far.  
The hon. parliamentary secretary.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We have already begun working on those recommendations.  
The hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Immigration. 
The hon. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.  
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
I do hope they will leave our country of their own free will.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Will he do it now on programs that will save young people's- 
The hon. Minister of Health.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
That is going to be the focus of our efforts.  
It is going to involve effort. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Now it is the end of September and there is still no legislation.  
Mr. Speaker, I met with the veterans on two occasions in the last week. 
The bill will be before the House before the end of the year.  
PRESENCE IN THE GALLERY 
We have in our gallery today four former Speakers of this House.  
I am going to handle those after tributes.  
I refer of course to Mr. Speaker Lucien Lamoureux. 
His family is here today in the gallery.  
I will recognize the Right Hon. Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
He was appointed acting speaker of the House in 1963. 
He was again re-elected Speaker in 1968 and in 1972. 
His nine year tenure as Speaker was an eventful, at times electrifying period.  
Through it all Lucien presided with dignity, diplomacy and wisdom.  
He was able to maintain order and decorum. 
He was a gracious host and an impressive emissary.  
He drove himself hard and he made many personal sacrifices. 
More often than not, he achieved his goals.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
The word distinguished does not seem adequate in describing Mr. Lamoureux. 
From the time of his formative years Mr. Lamoureux was destined for greatness. 
He would stand out amongst his peers.  
His roots ran deep in the Liberal Party. 
The urge to serve at the federal level was compelling for Mr. Lamoureux. 
Mr. Lamoureux carried it off with the usual aplomb, balance and calm. 
Mr. Lamoureux won a landslide victory over his NDP opponent.  
After that he was appointed as ambassador to Portugal from 1980 to 1985. 
I would like to add a more personal observation on this excellent individual for Canada.  
I will never forget coming to this House and watching him in operation.  
Some have called him the best speaker in modern times. 
While his style, wit and nature have been emulated, they have seldom been duplicated.  
It was another distinction bestowed on this most deserving of gentlemen.  
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
In 1954, Mr. Lamoureux left Parliament Hill to practice law in Cornwall.  
During that time, he presided over 3,010 days of debate. 
Both times he was re-elected with a strong majority.  
In September 1974, he gave up active political life. 
From 1980 to 1985, he served as ambassador to Portugal. 
After his retirement from public life, in 1985, he settled in Belgium.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
He was extremely respected by all members of the House.  
We have had many good Speakers. 
We have an excellent Speaker in the House today. 
I remember the minority parliament in 1972-74. 
We also had the Social Credit Party led by Mr. Caouette. 
Those were days of great tensions and great debates in the House. 
He was able to keep this place running very efficiently.  
I had tremendous respect for him. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Lucien Lamoureux was a legend in his own time. 
His wisdom guides us still as we continue that evolution.  
The words of its preamble best describe this initiative. 
Some members have spoken today about their personal relationship with Mr. Lamoureux. 
When he planted them, I am told they were about seven feet high. 
There are many trees at Kingsmere of course. 
We here in parliament are the recipients of the seeds of his wise decisions. 
We have lost a great Canadian. 
We thank you for that.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Is there unanimous agreement?  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
The standing orders require that I raise this at the earliest possible opportunity. 
However there is no comparison. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
Not to my knowledge, Mr. Speaker. 
I will to go to the government House leader.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
That is the first opposition.  
That is the second point.  
For all these reasons this is not a question of privilege. 
Obviously that is not applicable in this case.  
Mr. Speaker, take it under advisement.  
I thank the hon. member for his advice but I have already made the ruling.  
HOUSE OF COMMONS SEATING PLAN 
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
The decision on where the parties would be assigned their- 
I have read Beauchesne's. 
Mr. Speaker, I am not sure that I can cram it into a minute. 
That applied until last week.  
I fundamentally disagree with that.  
The third party, the third; the fourth, the fourth; and the fifth, the fifth. 
There is no such thing as a bad seat in the House of Commons. 
Is the member rising on another point of order?  
This point of order is over.  
REQUEST FOR TABLING OF DOCUMENT 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would ask the Speaker to rule that the document be tabled.  
Would the hon. member give me the time to review the blues?  
If he did not quote from it directly then there is no point of order.  
CANADIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE SERVICE ACT 
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have three petitions to present today.  
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
It would seem to be a straightforward question. 
I have noted the date on which it was presented. 
I will look into the matter as soon as I possibly can.  
Shall the remaining questions stand?  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
I know that it concerns Megantic. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
The motion is transferred for debate, pursuant to Standing Order 97(1).  
Shall the remaining Notices of Motions for the Production of Papers stand?  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Bill C-42 is a short bill. 
What the bill does is straightforward. 
It will toughen the existing Tobacco Act. 
Although the bill is short, it is not an isolated action. 
The health facts are clear. 
There are some worrisome trends that could add to that toll over time. 
We need to take continued and effective action to reverse those trends.  
Tobacco is addictive and over time it is often deadly. 
It has made its way throughout our culture and indeed cultures throughout the world.  
Legislation, educational programs and taxation have all been part of this mix.  
We know they are studying the various factors involved in making the decision to smoke.  
So who are they studying? 
Posters and billboards advertising them are everywhere. 
There are many factors that influence a 15 year old's decision to smoke. 
This House has historically demonstrated its awareness that smoking kills. 
The same was true with the Tobacco Act. 
Reformers, New Democrats and Progressive Conservatives stood with us on it. 
I will now turn to the regime the bill sets out.  
At the core of this bill is a five year transition period. 
There are two types of events for the purpose of this bill. 
The next phase for those grandfathered events would last three years. 
That stage would end after three years, as I said. 
On that date, tobacco sponsorship promotions would end.  
Those events will not be grandfathered. 
Some may ask why we have decided on a period of five years. 
In fact I know that process has already begun.  
Indeed we keep track of the steps that other governments are taking on this issue. 
Let me offer some examples.  
It intends to pursue a transitional strategy on the way to that ban.  
Canada is on a course to beat them all. 
Our legislation is among the toughest and most far reaching in the world. 
We are proud of that. 
The tobacco control initiative is co-ordinated and it is comprehensive. 
Both provincial strategies complement our own actions at the federal level. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It would be 20 minutes each.  
I think that was an interesting omission.  
I found quotes that are eerily similar. 
How have we done? 
Bill C-51 banned all tobacco ads. 
It is 10 years down the road. 
What happened to Bill C-51? 
It was considered a breakthrough. 
The law was circumvented. 
It was circumvented so fast it would make one's head spin.  
It would be tough to disagree with that.  
In fact we prevented procedural wrangling as we supported it. 
Here we are debating Bill C-42 today. 
If that is not a weakening, I have never seen a weakening.  
In 1988 parliament said no to cigarette ads. 
In 1998 we are here saying the same thing. 
I ask that in deep sincerity. 
Does anyone really believe this?  
What objective gauge is there of the effectiveness of our anti-tobacco measures? 
I believe there are four. 
I would like to go over each one of them.  
The second good gauge is the number of cigarettes those smokers smoke. 
It is fairly easy to graph that. 
This is followed by epidemiologists across the world. 
I will not spend a lot of time on that but it was a mistake.  
Rothmans in 1988 made $54.55 million; today, $112.3 million. 
It is 1% toward those education components. 
Let me be so plain, there is a weakening here. 
Formula One was used as a lever. 
It was in Montreal. 
There was a threat that it would leave Montreal. 
There was a unity component to it and there was an election just coming up. 
That is what it has done.  
What is happening in Formula One elsewhere? 
France, Germany and the United Kingdom stood firm and powerful. 
They were not timid. 
The head of the whole group is ready to do this voluntarily.  
Air Canada has stepped up to be the title sponsor for Formula 1. 
Is that an unusual thing? 
The world is moving rapidly. 
Canada is moving timidly.  
What other major events in Canada have also seen their sponsorship replaced? 
The Canadian open is now sponsored by Bell Canada. 
It used to be sponsored by a tobacco company. 
Women's tennis is now sponsored by Corel. 
I give those companies high marks for coming in and replacing sponsorship which was inappropriate. 
What type of sponsors? 
There are the banks, oil companies, computer firms and the list goes on. 
Here are the things they would sponsor. 
I cannot imagine how those events will not find sponsorship that is proper.  
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
I do not think anyone in the House would minimize the importance of this act.  
The issue of risk to health is not really the issue here. 
Simply put, because it will not really do that in the long run. 
Why do I say that?  
That is just not acceptable. 
I have eight children. 
Three of the four oldest had brief times in their lives when they smoked. 
How many will get cancer in later years? 
How many will eventually die? 
I believe Canadians feel that is totally unacceptable. 
It shows once again little regard for the health of Canadians.  
What are the results? 
This claim, however, is not holding up in the face of reality. 
These events do not need tobacco advertising to exist.  
It is for these reasons that I cannot support this bill. 
I urge all caring members of this House to oppose this bill.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
At that time, in other words, all tobacco company sponsorship signs will be totally banned.  
In fact, all of the clauses in Bill C-71 referred to future regulations. 
At second reading, debate was limited to a single speaker from the Bloc Quebecois. 
Originally, barely a day and a half had been set aside for this stage. 
This was really ridiculous. 
Studies are also covered. 
This total prohibition will take effect immediately following the five year transition period. 
The European Union intends to prohibit all industry sponsorship by 2006. 
Organisers have until October 1, 2000, to make a choice. 
This is an investment in the economies of Montreal, Quebec and Canada.  
The fight against smoking is one that must be waged by all of society. 
A habit that has been around for many generations will not be easily changed. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
It costs our health care system billions of dollars. 
Yet this is what the government is proposing to do today. 
We are not getting the answers.  
The provisions due to kick in tomorrow would restrict sponsorship advertising. 
Nobody is falling for it. 
We cannot let that happen.  
Why could we not begin the immediate restriction in terms of off site sponsorship advertising? 
I have seen it. 
Children go to corner stores to buy candy, to buy comic books. 
Why are they inundated with glossy images of attractive events associated with tobacco?  
When can we expect precisely when this ban will come into effect? 
We have to have guarantees that this timetable is entrenched in law. 
We want to see their documents which show they knew tobacco kills.  
Can Bill C-42 pass tomorrow? 
We all owe them a debt of gratitude.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
It is hard to believe.  
That is the seriousness of the problem. 
Sadly the government is doing nothing about it. 
They rank with the biggest of the biggest and they are extremely powerful.  
As a result, the government is going to save money.  
It is such a bizarre statement, claiming it is factual.  
I am of course talking about Senator Colin Kenny. 
He does not want the government to backpedal on what it should be doing.  
This is a good example of what the Senate can do. 
What the senator is proposing is workable and very doable. 
We simply cannot attack advertising or education. 
We have to attack three major components.  
One would be the price point. 
The price point of cigarettes is determined to a large degree by taxation. 
I have mentioned taxes and education. 
The third thing is advertising. 
They are promoting lifestyle. 
I believe that was the market that particular cigarette company was after. 
It is one of the biggest selling cigarette brands in the country. 
Cigarette companies are targeting their audience. 
They know who their audience happens to be, the younger members of our society.  
I have mentioned taxes, education and advertising. 
The government caved in. 
Who did it cave in to? 
This is even more bizarre. 
It caved in to the smugglers. 
Who did the government hurt? 
Who did the government help? 
I guess it helped itself. 
It was wrong and it is still wrong.  
I want to put these amendments on the record. 
It probably does not go far enough as far as I am concerned. 
This would prevent tobacco companies from increasing the exposure of sponsorship promotions. 
It would prevent tobacco companies from increasing the financial dependency of sponsorship recipients. 
It would stop the sponsorship problem from getting worse. 
A simple amendment would prevent this scenario from occurring.  
Fred McCain died just about a year ago. 
It was the same situation as with Mr. McCain. 
Things have evolved over the last 40 years in this country. 
We now know that smoking is a danger. 
We now know that 250,000 young Canadians take it up every year. 
That is the only bill that we will support. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Unfortunately there is not time for questions and comments.  
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC) moved: 
In this fiscal year we are expected to get roughly $896 million. 
The population of the receiving province is also a factor. 
Since 1987 Newfoundland has lost approximately 60,000 people. 
Of course, there is not much of an incentive for any province to develop.  
However, the deal applied only to that particular project. 
That equalization program can keep a province from starving. 
And catch up we must.  
It has a lot of iron ore, nickel and hydroelectricity. 
We need revenues to do more than merely replace equalization. 
We need revenues to augment our economic situation. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The role of financial transfers in the Canadian federation has a long and rich history. 
They are under our constitution an area of provincial jurisdiction.  
The federal government does not say where such resources must be spent. 
Decisions on how to allocate such revenues are at the discretion of provincial governments. 
As the province's fiscal capacity goes up its equalization entitlements go down. 
As a province's relative fiscal capacity goes down entitlements go up. 
It is the way equalization has worked for over 40 years. 
The formula is the very basis of the program.  
This motion would do just that. 
As Canadians we are there for each other. 
We help each other out when times are tough. 
It allows the province to benefit from natural resource development projects. 
As I said earlier, equalization is a program that works and works well. 
It is distinctly Canadian. 
For 40 years the program has been there for provinces when regional economies faltered. 
It will continue to be there in the future.  
It was because of its importance to Canadians from coast to coast to coast. 
Canadians want strong national programs that are efficient and equitable. 
Equalization as an enduring program fulfils these criteria. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
I think the member is well known for such diligence.  
The motion addresses the question of equalization. 
However that decrease is smoothed out over time. 
Those of us in the official opposition could not agree more strongly. 
It does not grow on trees. 
It is not just printed by the Bank of Canada. 
There are people in my constituency in Alberta of modest income. 
This is not an equitable form of redistribution. 
We must treat all provinces with some degree of equity. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, it is an interesting debate.  
It is not that we intervene in the marketplace. 
That is the real offence of the right-wingers in this country. 
I am also concerned about an argument that I heard just the other day. 
We need to be aware of this as there is some truth in it. 
Those who supported the free trade agreement should be concerned about it. 
There would not be this effect that there used to be. 
It is a very interesting argument and one that bothers me. 
It is not something I would like to see. 
Anything which poses a danger to this should be of concern.  
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to close the debate. 
We are all very much aware of how the formula came about. 
Simply put, we need economic development and jobs. 
From those revenues, we will only lose 70 cents on the equalization dollar.  
We need the equalization formula improved. 
This improvement needs to be applied to the other resource developments as well. 
That is the whole point of the motion, a change in the equalization formula. 
If there is no change, there will not be a catching up. 
I am willing to listen to an alternative to that. 
Do hon. members agree to call it 6.30 p.m.?  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
They are referenced there quite clearly.  
We have also witnessed the Prime Minister in the thick of the protest. 
Camera angles have caught him at that. 
A ministerial statement in the House is appropriate. 
It would not interfere with the inquiry in any way, shape or form. 
It has nothing to do with political interference. 
Let us stop the stonewalling. 
Ms. Beth Phinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
The commission is an independent civilian board. 
About 300 of these complaints result annually in independent investigations. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
This raises a couple of concerns. 
It would have been revealed to be the kind of mistake that it truly is.  
What kind of answer did I get? 
I never said it went to a NAFTA dispute settlement panel. 
That is an entirely different matter, an entirely different aspect of the agreement.  
Ms. Beth Phinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Ethyl has terminated its legal actions.  
The government's right to regulate in the public interest is not in question. 
The government's position is clear. 
Nothing in the MAI would prevent the government from regulating in the public interest. 
(The House adjourned at 6.32 p.m.)
