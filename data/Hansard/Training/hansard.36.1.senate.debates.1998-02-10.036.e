Tuesday, February 10, 1998 
The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
The Late Honourable Guy Charbonneau 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Indeed, I am proud to have been a friend of his.  
Our Speakers are equipped to defend every senator but themselves.  
Who would have thought that Guy Charbonneau would need anyone's help?  
As Speaker, he also chaired the Internal Economy Committee.  
The heights by great men reached and kept, 
Were not attained by sudden flight; 
But they, while their companions slept, 
Were toiling upward in the night.  
May Guy Charbonneau rest in the peace he so richly deserved.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
This was a courage which was a special kind of hallmark for Guy Charbonneau.  
To his family, we extend our deepest sympathy.  
His retirement was so short as to barely have existed. 
God had other plans for him.  
I would do it all over again if I had to.  
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson :
Guy was a pillar of the Progressive Conservative Party for 50 years. 
You will have seen, as I have, the determination in his eyes. 
No one can deny his loyalty to his country and to his political party. 
I first met him over 30 years ago. 
It is to be celebrated that he lived long enough to see this happen.  
Like anyone involved in politics, he had his detractors. 
Both were young French Canadians at the outbreak of World War II. 
The other, as is well known, chose not to do so. 
Mr. Charbonneau is no longer morally our Speaker. 
When he opens his mouth, we will not hear what he says. 
When he decides something, we will not want to know about it. 
When he enters the Senate, we will not see him. 
If he sits again on the Chair, we will only see an empty chair. 
I am sorry to say that Speaker Charbonneau has ceased to exit. 
He is a ghost.  
You have been prostituted by two men:
Lowell Murray sitting there, and Brian Mulroney. 
To his wife Yolande, his children and their families, you have my deepest sympathy. 
I came to know him after my appointment to the Senate in September 1988. 
The years that followed were turbulent. 
Then came the famous debate on the GST, which caused a lot of ruckus. 
Speaker Guy Charbonneau kept the ship afloat with courage and determination. 
Historians will assess this period of our history.  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
I want to offer my most sincere condolences to his wife. 
I will not repeat what has already been said. 
The Late Honourable Gerald R. Ottenheimer, Q.C. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
It was a matter on which Senator Ottenheimer had firm convictions. 
However, I do not accept that that can be the sole criterion. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
His love, passion and facility for languages was renowned. 
This famous line of his may have to suffice for now: 
Honourable senators, there are no nuances in that. 
He and I had many discussions about that. 
To his family, we extend our deepest sympathy.  
Hon. C. William Doody :
I have known Gerry Ottenheimer for most of my life. 
His academic career was quite remarkable. 
He would take his notes in Greek. 
It was certainly secure, no question about it.  
He also spoke Russian. 
Gerry was a pioneer. 
The cheering throngs of PCs were difficult to find. 
As a matter of fact, they were non-existent. 
I was proud to have known him. 
I shall certainly miss him. 
I think we will all miss him. 
Honourable senators, I also want to remember Gerry Ottenheimer.  
However, there was a time when the Tory Party was not at a low ebb. 
One of those times was during the Peckford days. 
I did get to know him better through that commemorative service. 
One is doing a Ph.D. in sociology and will be teaching at Memorial University. 
He treasured his daughters and his family.  
He treasured his books. 
His wife told me that he would be careful with each one of them. 
He was a learned man who had a love of learning and books.  
He treasured his roots. 
He treasured those roots. 
He was a dedicated politician. 
I should like to offer him some lines from Stan Rogers, that Nova Scotia balladeer: 
We rise again in the voices of our children.  
We rise again in the laughter of our songs.  
We rise again like the waves on the ocean.  
We will remember Gerry Ottenheimer and remember him well.  
Honourable senators, I also was deeply saddened by the loss of Senator Gerry Ottenheimer.  
I valued his gentlemanly character and his good humour.  
He was Leader of the Opposition from 1967 to 1969.  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
It was clear to me that there was something special about Senator Gerry Ottenheimer.  
I later found out how easy it was for him to pick up new languages. 
I discovered his incredible talent while travelling with him. 
He worked relentlessly, determined to ensure that minority rights would be respected. 
Unfortunately, you know what my circumstances were; I was unable to attend that debate. 
It was the first time in 34 years. 
Incidentally, I was elected 34 years ago today. 
Gerry Ottenheimer, who was fighting for his own life in Newfoundland. 
I also travelled with him. 
I had begged him to come to Lebanon and Koweit with me. 
You should have seen him. 
I visited him in Trinity. 
Listen to the names of his four daughters:
Geraldine, Suzanne, Bernadette and Anne-Marie. 
Four daughters with names like that in Newfoundland. 
I will get an opportunity to see them again next summer. 
Hon. P. Derek Lewis :
To his wife, Alma, and his family, I extend my deepest sympathy.  
Their hospitality was wonderful, as my Newfoundland colleagues well know.  
After he sat down, he would then get up and pace some more. 
Alma was always having to buy him new shoes for every occasion.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, please rise for a minute of silence.  
Honourable senators then stood in silent tribute.  
Opening of 1998 Games at Nagano, Japan 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government :
The Olympics mean many things. 
The Nagano Olympics are the last winter games before a new millennium. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Have we sunk so low that we have virtually nothing to offer? 
Are we a sideshow now among our allies? 
Are we an international afterthought?  
Wither the Canadian forces? 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Are you requesting leave to continue?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I thank you for your indulgence. 
In any event, the whole thing just gets worse. 
Honourable senators, to have equipment in place takes time. 
Dedication of Medical Profession-Tributes 
Without their dedication, how could we survive?  
I know this from my own personal experience:
They then directed me to be taken to the London University Hospital Science Centre. 
They are there on call. 
The surgery that they performed on me that day was successful. 
The Late J.B. Salsberg 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Yet J.B.'s life was anything but peaceful. 
Following his father's wishes, as a youth he studied to become a rabbi. 
With hard work, he earned quick salary increases to $5 a week. 
This experience transformed Salsberg into a tribune of the working classes. 
He always carried the torch with humour and honour. 
Meanwhile, he became a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Canada. 
Salsberg was invited to secret workers' meetings across Canada. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, may I have leave to continue?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
About this time, he married Dora Wilensky, the love of his life. 
In 1959, Dora died prematurely of cancer. 
They had no children, and J.B. never remarried.  
He became a tribune of the working classes, and he was re-elected. 
An inspiring orator, he was usually drowned in a sea of heckling in the legislature. 
J.B. was a true believer. 
This included an angry confrontation with Nikita Khruschev himself in the Kremlin.  
In 1957, returning to Toronto disillusioned, he denounced Communism. 
This effectively destroyed the Communist Party in Canada forever. 
Joe's heart was broken.  
He turned to business and community affairs. 
Joe knew each member of my family intimately. 
Joe had an encyclopaedic knowledge about politics and people. 
He knew each member of my family - my paternal uncles, my maternal grandfather. 
"Each man," he said, "must do what he must do."  
It was J.B. on the line, whispering to me in Yiddish. 
J.B.'s response was, "Because...they are still listening in Ottawa." 
As I said earlier, J.B. was a true believer. 
I am still hurt when I see, or hear people being cruel to one another."  
Then he was asked, if he were to write his epitaph, what it would read. 
Business of the Senate 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I am sure you have all come back refreshed and full of enthusiasm.  
I should like to introduce to you a new Page.  
He is studying political science and history at the University of Ottawa. 
Welcome to the Senate as a page, Robbie.  
Pages Exchange Program with House of Commons 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I welcome you both to the Senate. 
I trust that your time with us will be interesting and worthwhile.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Bill to Amend-First Reading 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Bill to Amend-First Reading 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I have heard you making an intervention.  
Honourable senators, that was the preamble to my motion.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
This is Notices of Motions, which take notice. 
Honourable senators, I ask leave to move the following motion this afternoon.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
I hear a "no." 
That the committee present its final report no later than March 31, 1998. 
Social Affairs, Science and Technology 
Veterans Affairs Subcommittee Authorized to Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators, to proceed now? 
Concerns of Albertans-Notice of Inquiry 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Canada, of course, will be playing a support role, as Senator Forrestall indicated. 
I asked for this in November of last year. 
That could only lend strength to the commitment we have made. 
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
It concerns an aspect of organized crime which is particularly serious in New Brunswick.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, as usual the honourable senator raises a very important point. 
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson :
Honourable senators, I have another question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
I should really like to know what the minister is talking about.  
What is the Solicitor General talking about?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Minister Scott has had many discussions. 
I am sure the honourable senator would agree with that. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Justice renewal, of course, is a priority of the government. 
Can correspondence from these governments on this issue be released to us?  
There was an extensive review of this issue last year. 
One term is widely bandied about, and that is "restorative justice." 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
I assume that there has been some risk assessment concerning that issue. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Some kind of decisive action must be taken. 
We are told that it will not be a ground force intervention. 
Honourable senators, I understand perfectly well. 
That is a concern of the entire world. 
There are no winners in a situation of this kind. 
We still hope that a diplomatic solution will be found. 
However, we cannot prolong a decision. 
They are the people who will be immediately affected. 
Has Canada been in diplomatic contact with those countries?  
The answer is a very definitive, "Yes; on a continuing basis."  
Hon. Norman K. Atkins :
Honourable senators, my question is to the Leader of the Government. 
If so, what criteria will be applied to its decision-making process?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The government still believes that that is the correct route. 
Science, Research and Development 
Cuts to Funding of Medical Research-Government Position 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, as I indicated, the budget will be brought down on February 24. 
Senior researchers are pleading for more money. 
The government's position will be made known in the 1998 budget.  
I know you will.  
However, there is another group of taxpayers who is also greatly in need of help. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I am sure that the officials responsible are quite cognizant of the need.  
Delayed Answers to Oral Questions 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :

The United States has no such system, nor do Australia, Great Britain or Japan. 
Much has been said and denied on both sides of this chamber. 
My objective is to appeal to common sense, to good politics. 
We owe it to ourselves to act on that commitment.  
I do not mean a consensus among interested parties only. 
However, those groups alone do not make a national consensus. 
For this you need people, lots of them. 
I think such a group of people exists. 
They are from all walks of life and every part of Canada. 
It seems unlikely that these numbers have changed drastically since the last election.  
I would be very surprised if he has since changed his mind.  
I am sure most of you are aware of all of these. 
This is never a good idea. 
It is also, in some ways, a tax on jobs. 
An additional 34 per cent can only use simple reading material. 
I am sure you will all agree that these figures are startling. 
Broadly speaking, this is because literacy affects our productivity. 
It affects our competitiveness. 
It influences our ability to do business successfully in the global economy. 
It is therefore vital that we ensure that our fellow citizens know how to read.  
Here we get to the crux of the issue. 
It makes good sense. 
This is particularly true for our youth. 
Young people are our future. 
They are our single most important asset. 
Today, it is based on service and technology. 
They provide for the many services we have and need in our society. 
However, taxes on reading material should be exempt from this general rule.  
The removal of the GST from reading material is, or should be, a priority. 
It makes economic sense. 
On motion of Senator Carstairs, for Senator Adams, debate adjourned.  
Establishment of Special Committee-Debate Continued 
Hon. William M. Kelly :
I should like to adjourn further debate on this motion until Tuesday - 
The Hon. the Speaker :
This is your motion.  
This would put the order in limbo until March 3. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
On motion of Senator Carstairs, debated adjourned.  
Reports on Social and Economic Development 
However, unfortunately, very few Canadians are aware of those reports.  
This particular report is a very important report. 
That report is very much a social audit. 
It is important that we begin to look at these reports that Canada is submitting.  
On motion of Senator Carstairs, debate adjourned.  
Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
Leave having been given to return to Government Order No. 2: 
It has considerable support from the marine transport sector.  
In most cases, this represents a continuation of the status quo.  
The need to borrow must be justified on a commercial basis.  
Many options exist for the future of ports aside from transfer to the private sector. 
Provincial, municipal and community groups can develop innovative arrangements. 
This system is a crucial waterway but it is also a business. 
The federal government would retain regulatory control over navigation in the seaway.  
The existing seaway authority would be dissolved in due course.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, I appreciate very much the introductory remarks of our colleague. 
We on this side look forward to getting at this bill. 
We will want to have this bill examined, but not in all respects. 
We will want the standing committee to call witnesses. 
The bill has been a long time in preparation. 
This bill is too important to hurry. 
On motion of Senator Forrestall, debate adjourned.  
The Senate adjourned until Wednesday, February 11, 1998, at 1:30 p.m.
