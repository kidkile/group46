EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 11 
Monday, October 6, 1997 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
CANADA PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
This legislation will enact the joint federal-provincial agreement reached last February. 
The changes reflect just that. 
What have we done to strengthen the plan's financing? 
The pay as you go system made sense given these circumstances. 
The pay as you go financing is no longer fair and no longer appropriate. 
It will pay for an individual's own benefits plus the unfunded liability. 
It is the fairest way to honour our commitments. 
The costs of pensions will be spread evenly and fairly across generations.  
The increase for a worker at the average range will total no more than $24.  
This is not a tax grab. 
I know it is difficult for members of the opposition to understand that. 
Let us get the facts straight. 
Yes, 9.9 percent is a real cost and no one denies it. 
I submit that we have made the right choice. 
First, let me tell you what remains the same.  
All benefits, now and in the future, will remain fully indexed to inflation. 
The ages of early retirement, normal retirement, or late retirement all remain unchanged.  
Let me describe them.  
In the past they were based on a three-year average. 
The administration of disability benefits will be further improved. 
The appeal process will be streamlined and the legislation will be applied more consistently.  
Changes will limit the extent to which these benefits can be added together.  
There are those who would purport to eliminate that benefit.  
There are those who would gut the benefits. 
That is not what Canadians have told us.  
They are arguing in a vacuum. 
What has been done? 
Once again Canadians have been consulted and Canadians have spoken.  
It is what Canadians have asked for and it is what Canadians are getting. 
Canadians will start to receive regular statements on the pensions they are earning. 
Federal-provincial reviews will take place every three years, instead of every five. 
The CPP investment board will provide quarterly financial statements. 
As with all plans, public and private plans, there are always administrative challenges. 
What are the issues? 
This is very interesting. 
It is what Canadians asked for and it is what we will do.  
This will permit the changes to take effect on January 1, 1998. 
They no longer want to see government reacting. 
Securing Canada's retirement income system is a priority. 
Our approach was different. 
It is a priority of the government.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
He talked about people who wanted to gut the benefits to the plan. 
Those are the defects I would like to get into. 
Indeed it is the duty of the official opposition to point out these defects.  
The first is a legal reason. 
This is something we ought not to do as a matter of principle.  
However that is only the narrow, technical, bureaucratic intent.  
We should keep the needs of these women uppermost as we consider pension reform.  
Often they are working as hard as they possibly can. 
We know the skepticism with which young people view the Canada pension plan. 
This is politically motivated nonsense.  
In 1996 a study was done by Lin, Picot and Beach. 
Statistics Canada provides all the background information.  
They were not worth the powder to blow them up.  
This is also the view of the Department of Finance and its advisers. 
Let me read into the record some of the evidence of that.  
It has to do with the subject of ultimate accountability. 
What does he list? 
They are going to make regular reports. 
They are going to issue quarterly financial statements. 
They are going to issue annual statements.  
A pension plan cannot be operated without meeting these minimal requirements.  
What does Bill C-2 do? 
That is one of the reasons the fund is in trouble.  
How is the corporation to be accountable? 
What criteria are taken into account in the appointment of its directors?  
It is their money. 
It is a chipping away at the bottom by tax increases.  
It eliminated the deductions of RRSP and RRIF admidistration fees.  
What Reform would like to propose to the House is the following. 
Third, an improved survivor benefit. 
These super RRSPs would be mandatory. 
Individual RRSPs would be funded by means of employee and employer payroll deductions. 
This is an idea that is being explored elsewhere. 
Why the government is blind to it we cannot understand.  
That would be the vote, would it not? 
The Chair has ruled that the amendment is in order. 
It appears to be a reasoned amendment. 
It is giving reasons why the House would not proceed with the Bill. 
Accordingly, the Chair is satisfied that the amendment is in order.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
This reform has three main components. 
At present, there is enough money in the fund for two years. 
The minister's proposal is to increase this period to five years.  
However, we have a number of concerns that I will address shortly.  
All in all, eight provinces, including Quebec, have endorsed the proposed changes. 
The problem would become a political football in no time.  
Briefly, the government wants to make the system viable, affordable and equitable. 
There are similarities and there are differences. 
Let us look first at the similarities.  
Contribution rates will rise rapidly. 
They will then remain stable. 
This is exactly what Quebec intends to do. 
In both cases, plan viability is what counts.  
Another point is the new policy on Canada Pension Plan investments. 
The plan is also periodically reviewed. 
That is a good thing. 
This will remain unchanged in both Canada and Quebec. 
All CPP benefits will remain fully indexed, as will QPP benefits. 
First, let us take a look at the death benefit. 
What is a death benefit? 
The federal plan is currently identical to the QPP in that respect. 
This amount will be indexed. 
The Quebec Pension Plan recognizes this reality.  
The second difference concerns disability benefits. 
This makes allowance for progressive diseases, which is very important. 
There is another rather complicated difference. 
The difference is complex, as is the calculation. 
Mr. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
When the government abolishes that it will instead introduce a seniors benefit. 
It was passed into law in 1966. 
The Canada pension plan is a pay as you go plan. 
The plan pays out a fully indexed pension to people 65 years and older. 
That is basically the philosophy behind the plan. 
It is really a transition toward a partially vested plan. 
It also has in it the privatization of the administration of the plan. 
I want to look at a few details of that this morning. 
Premiums will increase 73 percent over the next six years. 
The maximum contribution will go from $975 to about $1,635.  
That is a concern to us as well.  
I say that is rubbish.  
Despite that, the plan is still affordable.  
This will rise to about 8 percent by the year 2030.  
That should be of concern to us as parliamentarians as well.  
Disability pensions will become more difficult to obtain. 
Another point is the whole question of survivors and death benefits. 
When that happens it will be more difficult for them to build schools and hospitals. 
It will create more inequity in the country once again.  
We should be looking at maximizing the creation of jobs or minimizing unemployment. 
That will also be a concern. 
That will be a huge fund. 
That money should be invested in the main in this country.  
The premiums are estimated by some to be around $500 million for that work.  
These are some of the concerns we have at second reading. 
They are concerns we would like to explore at the committee stage.  
There would be a better return. 
Everyone would pay into it.  
What about the ordinary citizens? 
That is exactly what would happen.  
That is the whole philosophy of the Reform Party. 
I oppose that and our party opposes that. 
Thank goodness the majority of the Canadian people oppose going off in that direction. 
It is the law of the jungle. 
We have to fight against that. 
That is one reason I am concerned that this plan is moving in that direction.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
It is clear there are some important issues.  
The Reform Party has no social conscience.  
He wanted to share his numbers with us. 
He has been retired for seven years.  
He suggested there should be absolutely no change.  
We cannot have it both ways. 
Perhaps the member missed it.  
We do not have to have a decrease in disability benefits or in survivor benefits. 
The biggest payout is in the pension plan.  
I do not believe we should penalize disabled people. 
We do not have to do that based on the present economy.  
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member spoke about things he is concerned about in the plan. 
He spoke about making it more progressive. 
The NDP Government of Saskatchewan chose not to support that proposal. 
I will do whatever I can to push that idea.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
I would like to ask the member from the NDP a question. 
Mr. Speaker, of course not. 
I never suggested that. 
There has to be a restructuring of the plan.  
That is the main thrust of the argument I am making.  
That is where I differ from Reform Party members. 
That is why I oppose it. 
I want the gap between the rich and the poor narrowed. 
But the Reform Party would not understand that.  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker,I listened to what our socialist friend has said. 
I think they are trying to use smoke and mirrors.  
Where does he live? 
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
In 20 years there will be only four people working for every person who retires.  
Of course the Government of Quebec has a different plan. 
We have known that for some time. 
The federal government is not alone in deciding what direction we have to take. 
This is very much a plan that requires a joint effort.  
This was way below the rates that could have been obtained in the marketplace. 
It was certainly a lot less than a private sector plan earned. 
No wonder Canadians were concerned and certainly worried about the plan.  
It boils down to something quite simple and very straightforward. 
It says ``here is an idea'' but there are no actual numbers. 
I guess the answer is tough luck. 
They will get recognition bonds.  
Who will pay for this? 
The first is that CPP must be self-financing. 
That is the second benchmark.  
They are not asking for favours. 
They are not asking for special treatment. 
How would we meet these objectives? 
Otherwise we are turning in circles.  
There is an answer that has to do with demographic changes in society.  
They are eligible for certain programs. 
The health care system take is higher because of a growing population. 
We need to understand these things.  
My point today is quite simple. 
Not only do we need to understand them. 
We need to plan for them. 
We have to take a completely different approach. 
I will be happy to speak to the issue of return.  
We need a separately managed Canada pension trust. 
That is very much the route we should take. 
Of course it is not perfect, as an institution. 
So it is a concept that is worth imitating. 
In this case, we think that is what it should do.  
We would offer some intergenerational equity with regard to how we deal with pensions.  
These are not rumours.  
I am not making this up. 
It is as though he put up a sign saying: 
``They were open for business. 
Please come and ask for your money''. 
It is signed by the Minister of Finance.  
The government must take steps to keep spending under control.  
We also need to improve the security and returns of registered retirement savings plans. 
That means more flexibility in registered retirement savings plan.  
That is a commitment the minister has yet to make.  
Our market is too small. 
We cannot forget seniors benefits. 
We have to plan. 
Has the government planned? 
What numbers are available? 
I assume it put some numbers out. 
We are all waiting anxiously to find out. 
We know how easy it is to travel on a Canadian passport. 
The Government of Canada has certainly demonstrated that to us.  
These Canadians deserve some equity. 
I leave this as an idea. 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Why did he not take action on that? 
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
The government you are talking about was four years old, Mr. Speaker. 
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
The member for Ottawa Centre might as well enjoy that overblown argument. 
I do not know whether he actually thinks that Canadians believe him. 
I know he will bear that in mind.  
Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Quebec East, BQ):
It is strange to hear this expression of concern coming from the Conservatives. 
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
Surely not; that would be too glaring a contradiction.  
What was the situation awaiting us in 1984 when we came to power? 
That is the real story behind all the rhetoric. 
That is the real story.  
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
The Conservatives had a chance to fix the system. 
They knew full well then that it had serious problems. 
Now I hear this member putting on this caring, sharing concern for the Canadian public. 
They like to talk, talk, talk, but no action.  
I cannot believe that he could stand up here and say this.  
Say it again, $4.3 million.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
Mr. Speaker, when you exaggerate to that point you certainly render yourself insignificant.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
Mr. Speaker, this is the same- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I think that the member for Sherbrooke owes the member for Okanagan-Shuswap an apology. 
I do not think the hon. member is rising on a point of order. 
I think he is rising on a point of debate. 
The hon. member for Sherbrooke, a brief response.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
That is certainly my advice.  
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Half of my constituents are new to me. 
I represent a large number of seniors. 
Those individuals have shared their opinions with me. 
In turn I have kept the ministers and the prime minister involved.  
They have not changed their minds. 
They are a very consistent bunch, the people of Ottawa West-Nepean. 
They wanted to ensure the security of their income. 
They wanted an assured benefit when they reach retirement age. 
The government as a whole also consulted with Canadians across the country. 
In co-operation with the provinces, hearings were held in 18 different cities. 
A number of the principal features of the CPP remain unchanged. 
Third, the retirement age remains unchanged.  
This legislation also ensures the continuation of full indexation.  
The cost of keeping the CPP sustainable will be shared more equitably under the legislation. 
The CPP provides more than just retirement pensions. 
It provides disability benefits to contributors who are no longer able to work for example. 
The CPP has other benefits that RRSPs do not have. 
The CPP was set up as a contributory plan. 
These are employer and employee contributions. 
There is some unfinished business in the legislation before us. 
SUPREME COURT OF CANADA 
Ms. Claudette Bradshaw (Moncton, Lib.):
He is recognized for his knowledge and his fairness. 
In addition, his devotion to language and minority issues is highly regarded.  
After all, Mr. Bastarache is a francophone- 
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member. 
The hon. member for Saanich-Gulf Islands has the floor.  
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the residents of Saanich-Gulf Islands.  
This Liberal government plans on doubling Canada pension plan premiums. 
This Liberal government is implementing the single largest tax grab in the history of Canada. 
The scam is irresponsible and unacceptable. 
People are fed up.  
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
MEMBER FOR LAVAL WEST 
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
The Liberal member would do well to look at her own situation. 
In June 1995, she went to Haiti as an election observer at taxpayers' expense.

Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
The health minister has been inundated by letters on this issue. 
These irate citizens have influenced the minister. 
This is a victory for them. 
Ms. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member. 
The hon. member for Yukon.  
The hon. member for Yukon.  
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard-La Prairie, Lib.):
But the member's comment goes much further. 
The Bloc leader is in fact encouraging ethnic grouping.  
Out of respect for Acadians and for the whole-

Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Every contribution is known. 
We will wait for the investigation. 
I do not know who she is referring to. 
Let the police do their work before making frivolous accusations.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this truly is a wait and see government. 
It says wait and see about everything. 
Therefore, it is no surprise. 
We do not need to wait and see. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
This is a fabrication by the hon. member.  
Everything has been done above board and according to the rules and regulations of-

Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
He obviously did not seem aware of the fact.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, no surprise was involved. 
They gave us the information. 
As soon as we got the information we acted directly. 
The member suggests they were supplied. 
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is also for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
That really demonstrates clearly that we are taking the matter very seriously.  
I can assure the House that we will take every measure possible. 
But, Mr. Speaker, there is a human factor- 
The hon. member for Halifax.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, most importantly I have raised the matter with the Israeli government. 
We will raise the matter there.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
The $600,000 used came from the employment insurance fund. 
How could this happen?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to clarify the issue here.  
Therefore, the money does not from the transitional job creation fund.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
How is this different from the way the Tories did it?  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
If they are interested in the truth they should listen.  
Maybe the hon. member should- 
The hon. member for Elk Island.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, they changed it all right. 
They replaced the Tories with Liberals.  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to reassure the opposition about this very important matter.  
My officials confirmed to me that the process was transparent. 
We therefore went ahead with it.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
I have a question for the Prime Minister. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Where is that evidence? 
Will he table it in the House today?  
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
This is before this quasi-judicial board.  
We respect the process. 
Maybe he could understand that this time.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member is more interested in theatrics than in facts. 
We have to deal with the facts.  
He should know better. 
He should be responsible and understand that there is a process.  
We respect that process and will continue to respect it.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
So he took action in his own department. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
That is exactly what the minister did. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, they are investigating a very specific case. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):

The hon. member for Calgary Northeast.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not agree with the preamble to the question.  
We are looking at the 160 recommendations of the Somalia inquiry. 
Very soon we will issue our response. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Now it is time to purge the bureaucrats from the ranks. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we do not have people who are trying to hide the truth.  
We are not waiting for the response to the Somalia inquiry report. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the Environment.  
I would ask the hon. member to go directly to his question.  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
This is not a new agenda. 
This results from the 1996 program review cuts. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):

Harmonization is a totally different topic.

COMMENTS DURING QUESTION PERIOD 
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Canada is relying more on reservists to meet its military commitments. 
This is the second time this bill has been presented to the House. 
I presented it to the House during the last Parliament. 
It would be a welcome addition to part I of the labour code. 
I look forward to debating it in the House.  
CROWN LIABILITY AND PROCEEDINGS ACT 
There is urgent need for this type of legislation in Canada. 
People are imprisoned because they do not respect the law. 
I would encourage all members of the House to carefully consider this legislation.  
Unfortunately it died on the order paper. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):

Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will not use my full five minutes. 
I look forward to the committee's discussion of this bill. 
I thank the House for its time.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
We know where that kind of promise went the last time. 
It went all over the place. 
How can that be a benefit to children and grandchildren?  
We have to anticipate. 
That is why we have to act now. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the member's comments. 
What will this bill do with regard to those current beneficiaries?  
They will not see a reduction in their benefits.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
What about the small business, the extra tax on small business? 
They will not be able to patronize small businesses. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
It continues to repeat the mistakes of the past.  
I salute the citizens of Calgary and Alberta. 
I am proud to be a representative of that city and that province.  
Canadians dislike paying for inefficient government. 
Canadians dislike intrusive government meddling in their personal affairs. 
They dislike being told by government how to manage their paycheques. 
The dimensions of this rip-off, however, are not well known. 
All this with contributions soaring.  
Talk about unfairness and political cynicism. 
Investors flocked to him. 
I do not believe the government has even begun to do that.  
After all, this huge pool of capital would be a great temptation to any government. 
When they die their children and their spouse will inherit the capital. 
This would go a long way toward eliminating poverty for elderly widows, for example.  
Their attitudes could have- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I call for a quorum count.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We have a quorum call. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Calgary-Nose Hill.  
Even the Liberals admit that payroll taxes kill jobs. 
It also kills their prospect for jobs today.  
I hope the government will listen. 
He said ``A politician plans for the next election''.  
That is what the Liberals are doing. 
They know there is a mess in the Canada pension plan. 
I urge us to take that obligation very seriously.  
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
She is obviously expounding their super RRSP program.  
CPP is not only a pension plan but is a disability insurance policy. 
That is not true.  
Let us talk for a minute about the disability portion of the plan. 
I can make a couple of points. 
We all know we could become disabled. 
There are no guarantees for any of us. 
We want to protect and we will protect.  
There are plenty of good ways to do it. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
She called it the Ponzi scheme, which is not an unfair analogy. 
I think she explained it rather well.  
The time has come.  
There are many of them. 
It does not make sense to ignore that proposal.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we are into a full blown debate on the issue now. 
Let us be clear. 
We are talking about a potential $200 billion. 
There is nothing arm's length at all about the investment board. 
We need to be very concerned and be very vigilant that it does not happen.  
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
I conducted three of these meetings in my riding. 
The conclusions of the people of Durham are very much part of this legislation. 
They wanted to see an independent board. 
They want this money set aside and managed in a businesslike fashion. 
That is essentially what this act attempts to do.  
That is a substantial fund for this country.  
They do not come into the general revenues of the Government of Canada. 
By definition in the Oxford dictionary clearly they are not a tax.  
Members are talking about a $100 billion fund. 
We have to ask what does it mean. 
I suspect this is going to have a double effect economically. 
It is going to provide more capital for small and medium size business. 
As businesses expand they either borrow or raise equity. 
Businesses are expanding, building new buildings and plants and facilities. 
Invariably when they do that they create jobs.  
By definition those are some very significant funds.  
The Reform Party is not interested in that because it is a very positive thing.  
The important thing is Canadians want to know their funds are being invested. 
Now they will be able to see where their money went. 
There will be a quarterly report which will show where their money has been invested.  
I suggest she read the financial statements. 
The hon. member for Calgary-Nose Hill called it a rip-off.  
What is it going to be? 
Are they going to be concerned about intergenerational transfers? 
Are they going to be concerned about a 200 percent return on investment? 
Are they going to be concerned about clawbacks to seniors pensions?  
The bottom line is they cannot have it all ways. 
They cannot argue out of both sides of their mouths all the time.  
We went to the people and we asked them how to do it. 
It will depend on the demographic shifts in our country.  
Many governments in the past have shifted this on to other administrations. 
The problem would get worse and worse. 
However, we have faced reality and are dealing with the problem.  
That is what this government has done. 
This is good legislation. 
I encourage all my fellow members to support it.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
I wonder if the hon. member has read any of the studies.  
Mr. Robert D. Nault:
Name the countries that have it.  
The Chilean government has it. 
The Government of Chile did it. 
Mr. Speaker, we have a privately funded plan that already exists in our country. 
I have read some of those reports. 
However, we have a three tiered system in Canada. 
Our RRSP system is one of the most generous in the world. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
I await an answer from our colleague, the member for Durham.  
It is not a closed shop. 
I think basically that is what people are asking for.  
In the old system we did not know. 
We were not very sure where that money was going. 
I think this is very much progress and an improvement.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
That is Liberal economics. 
That is the Liberal way. 
Give us a chance''. 
How can they do that?  
It is good management.  
It was interesting to listen to the member. 
I did not see that on any of its platform documents. 
I have not seen that anywhere.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Mr. Lesage said, on June 9, 1965: 
In this regard, the interests of Quebeckers are many. 
That has been strength of the Caisse de depot et placement. 
As Mr. Lesage said: 
And this is still according to Jean Lesage, in 1965. 
It cannot substitute for the government in any way whatsoever. 
Finally, other tools have been announced.  
The Caisse is expected to play a diversified and necessary role.  
And the very last paragraph: 
And I hate to think what Quebec would be like now. 
I will once again quote Mr. Scraire: 
This is an urgent matter. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Portneuf for his question.  
The objects, as stated in clause 5, are as follows: 
I wondered how that could be. 
Mr. Gary Pillitteri (Niagara Falls, Lib.):
What did we learn? 
All of these themes are mutually sustaining. 
A better investment policy is vital to preserving the CPP.  
The consensus in favour of this principle was clear. 
The question now is why this new investment policy is necessary. 
Why not continue with the existing policy?  
Clearly there is a lot at stake in the investment of the CPP fund. 
Canada's capital markets are mature, well developed and growing. 
Moreover, the new investment fund will grow gradually in its first few years. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
I know of a plan that is actuarially sound. 
I heard about one tier, two tier and three tier. 
Canadians want to be sure that the future is more secure.  
The hon. member was talking about the MP pension plan. 
I think he has just been elected. 
I wonder if he knows the policies of his own party. 
I hope he can stay in the House in order to qualify for it.  
Perhaps my colleague could mention that. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. friend for the question.  
What I am hearing across the floor is funny. 
It is always the same rhetoric for the haves. 
This gives them that opportunity. 
They should be able to know that some security is there for their old age.  
There is an additional reason for us to do this expeditiously. 
We have to give the provinces the time to do this. 
They could come into effect within a year.  
They have to agree. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
When we talk to seniors they are concerned about the future. 
They are trying to appeal to people who feel vulnerable at the moment. 
That does not say that life is going to be great for people. 
That is going to impose incredible hardship on a lot of people.  
It is a modest reduction but nevertheless a reduction.  
Is this something that we actually want to do as members of Parliament? 
And fewer benefits at that. 
There seems to be something wrong with some of the basic logic.  
There are 1.4 million children living in poverty. 
One out of five seniors is living in poverty. 
We have a long way to go. 
Why was this legislation required? 
When it was set up back in 1966 the economy was different. 
There were some assumptions built into the benefit levels and the premium levels. 
I do not think there is a single Canadian who would argue against that. 
Whether it accomplishes that is another question.  
One is the fact that transparency will be built into the system. 
That is a positive feature of the legislation. 
That is also positive. 
For that we must all be pleased.  
What are some of the concerns? 
It will take a lot of dollars out of Canadian communities.  
That money will be plucked out of that one small local economy. 
It will not be there to circulate time and again between businesses and so on. 
That will make a very major dent into the employment situation in that community.  
Will it give them a better chance? 
Will this give them some confidence? 
The answer is no.  
Will it give consumers more confidence to go out and purchase goods and services? 
The answer is no.  
This has to be a concern. 
I am not talking about only small or medium size. 
It is a payroll tax by any definition.  
I think it is fair to say this is a major payroll tax increase. 
What impact will it have on the ability of the country to produce jobs?  
We can look at the fund. 
We can debate its merits and the way it is constructed. 
We can look at the Quebec government plan. 
This seems to be a very honourable motive. 
That is another concern.  
We are not convinced that a 73 percent increase is necessary. 
Then the increase in premiums could be significantly lower.  
We have some serious concerns about the legislation. 
I emphasize the impact on those who are disabled. 
Is this really the kind of legislation we want to introduce?  
Is that really what we want to do? 
This legislation says we will.  
Obviously I could talk about a number of other items. 
We will have an opportunity to raise these concerns in committee.  
With the changes being proposed, will that be the case in the future? 
I obviously think not.  
They are probably listening to me speak today. 
I know how they will respond. 
They are very generous people who live a very modest lifestyle. 
They will scratch their heads and wonder if we have gone crazy. 
We live in the richest country in the world. 
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the member for Kamloops. 
I have raised the issue of CPP disability before. 
For 1997 that will amount to $10,597 a year or $833.17 a month.  
If they did not have an insurance policy they would not have coverage.  
Could he repeat it?  
Would the cost of that insurance put jobs in jeopardy? 
I really could not say. 
I would have to look at the actuarial tables and attachments.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
The member for Kamloops agrees. 
We thank him for that.  
We thank him for that. 
Perhaps we should invite him over to sit with us. 
He did voice some concerns. 
It would be a huge cost. 
A much more modest set of changes along these lines would be acceptable.  
We believe in the public pension plan system. 
We believe in a public pension plan. 
The changing economic times require some changes. 
We believe the government has gone excessively too far. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Happily this is not so with the Quebec pension plan.  
How does our colleague react to that? 
Is he afraid Toronto will get it all?  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Many Canadians are concerned about the Canada pension plan. 
They are concerned about its features, about its security. 
These things are not true.  
It is not an income redistribution program. 
Who was retiring in the mid-sixties? 
The Canada pension plan system is not just a pension. 
Possibly it is misnamed. 
There is some flexibility.  
Possibly they did not work. 
It allows the income to be split. 
In addition to the pension portions there are important insurance components of the CPP. 
There is a survivors benefit. 
The plan is much more than simply a pension. 
Many of my colleagues have talked about the funding as being pay as you go. 
Members have also noted that we have two years' worth of benefits. 
A lot of the discussions we have had today have been around the investment board. 
I wanted to talk a bit about the problems. 
Those are the mathematics which are in place now. 
Fairness and equity are important issues and important challenges.  
It is a universal program. 
It is there for all Canadians.  
I will give an example. 
He called it scandalous.  
First, Canadians are living longer than they did in the past. 
That means retirement pensions are going to be drawn for longer periods of time. 
The baby boomers are coming. 
There are going to be more seniors. 
In fact today we have five workers for every pensioner. 
Who could deny the disability benefits that are applicable? 
Parliamentarians are not deciding what we should do and why. 
There were public consultations and they happen every five years. 
Therefore, it is not going to be income tested.  
These are the results of consultations with Canadians.  
Their pensions will remain indexed. 
There is no change in retirement age.  
We are going to move to a fuller funding. 
We are also going to create the investment board. 
It will be on a gradual basis because that is the Canadian way. 
We want Canadians to have a chance.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Markham.  
What was it afraid of? 
Nobody would want to save anymore for their retirement anymore.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
It is something which has been obvious for years. 
It is a pyramid scheme.  
Did they not see these things?  
We have heard it say no problem before. 
There are problems in the way the plan is being presented. 
I am saying to the government today to make sure that consultations continue.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville, Lib.):
That is simply not true. 
I am glad that the member agrees that there is a need for reform. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her comments. 
The hon. member says that consultations have been ongoing since 1996. 
We want to ensure that does not happen again.  
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
However, I agree that we have to decide on a course of action quickly. 
We should not prolong or delay the deliberation of this bill.  
I would like to address three main points which arise from the legislation.  
CPP premiums will rise at a faster rate than originally planned. 
Bill C-2 sends out messages to three groups. 
Therefore the need for private pension plans is even more relevant.  
I would argue none. 
It is imperative that the government strive for fairness with the pension system. 
Women will be hit hard by the proposed amendments. 
Premium increases place greater burden on the working poor than on wealthy Canadians. 
One must consider the following points with respect to the proposed amendments. 
Canada pension plan premiums will rise at a faster rate than originally planned. 
The plan no longer will lend funds to the provinces at preferred rates. 
Canadians realize that it is imperative for them to begin planning for retirement in advance. 
The Canada pension plan must be fair and equitable to all Canadians.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
That is what I thought it was initially set up for. 
That is what we must strive for.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
It is an important question which has been raised.  
We should then also look at who is affected by tax breaks. 
Both are payroll taxes.  
Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
I would also like to congratulate you on your appointment as acting speaker. 
I congratulate you for your efforts.  
The Canada pension plan is one of the defining features of Canada. 
We are not only fixing today's problem. 
We are putting in place a plan for the future. 
We need to meet today's economic and demographic demands.  
We are not afraid to take the challenges of responsibility. 
We took the challenge of dealing aggressively with the deficit and we met it. 
Now we are taking the challenge of securing the future of the Canada pension plan.  
I want to emphasize that we have not developed these proposed changes in isolation. 
Change it if necessary but keep it. 
Fourteen percent of one's income is too high and we know that. 
Once more, Canadians are unwilling to pay 14 percent. 
A member across the way asks when did we realize this. 
It is very clear. 
We have been working on this issue. 
It did not have the nerve to straighten things out and correct things. 
Quite clearly we have done a great deal of consultation and we are moving forward.  
This is compared to the current rate of 5.85 percent.  
Some of my colleagues opposite have described this increase as a tax grab. 
CPP contributions are not a tax. 
They are contributions toward pensions. 
The premium payments will not go into the government's general revenue. 
CPP contributions represent an interested investment by Canadians in their own future. 
It is not a tax.  
Contributing to CPP is not paying tax. 
I think it is important that Canadians understand that.  
In many cases benefit payouts would not change at all.  
The ages of eligibility for retirement, early, normal or late, would be unchanged. 
We cannot bring the program back into balance without making some adjustments.  
During our consultations we were told that we should go easy on making the changes. 
We believe we will accommodate that concern through this bill.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
That begs a question. 
The answer unfortunately is no.  
What did we get for $1 billion? 
Nothing, not a single helicopter.  
That is money that could have benefited our health care system.  
Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
The Canadian forces are often called upon to perform difficult and sometimes dangerous work. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
As well, 20 percent of additional quotas are sold from individual fishers to the corporations. 
In truth the corporations control 70 percent of the total allowable catch.  
Other examples of concern are the dumping of by-catches which is still ongoing. 
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
That is certainly what this minister of fisheries is doing.  
The government is living up to that commitment. 
Mr. Harrigan will be looking at the situation as it affects the five eastern provinces.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Simply put, they have been evasive, sloppy and inaccurate. 
After more than a week our questions remain outstanding and unanswered. 
The Canadian passport like the maple leaf is a trusted symbol of our country. 
That means it jeopardizes the safety of those Canadian travellers as well.  
Over the past week the government has said that the passports were forgeries. 
Then it said they may have been forged or stolen. 
It goes on and on.  
Surely after nearly two weeks of inquiries the government should know the truth.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
We have obtained the two forged passports used in Jordan.  
We believe this message has been heard in Israel.  
Foreign minister Levy expressed his regret at what had transpired. 
He undertook to provide the results of the investigation to Canada.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, before I came to the House I travelled extensively. 
The Canadian passport is a ticket to freedom. 
It may be the most treasured passport in the entire world. 
Our passport is a key which opens the door for Canadians wherever they go.  
Ron did contact foreign affairs, both over there and here in Ottawa. 
In fact, we can think of nothing that was done at all. 
Jordanian acquaintances told him there was talk of killing westerners. 
Instead of taking action the government stalled. 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
We do believe this message has been heard in Israel.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
I am rather amazed by that. 
We understand that, we know it and we support it. 
We need to find those answers.  
The question is simple and straightforward. 
There has been a flip-flop on the government side. 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
The answers that I am giving reflect the knowledge of facts such as they are.  
It was refused categorically at that stage.  
Our examination then indicated that the passports were forgeries.  
Mr. Speaker, point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House adjourned at 6.59 p.m.)
