The Senate met at 2 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
The Late Honourable Paul David 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Business of the Senate 
The Hon. the Speaker :
If you are agreeable, perhaps we should wait another five minutes. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The delegation is led by Mr. Vladimir A. Torlopov.  
On behalf of all honourable senators, I welcome you to the Senate.  
The Late Honourable Paul David 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Last week, the Senate lost one of its illustrious members. 
April 5 1999 marked the passing of the father of Quebec cardiology. 
With his demise, Quebec and Canada lost a great man. 
His dedicated work and international reputation brought him many honours. 
I want to quote the moving words spoken by his daughter, Therese, at his funeral: 
Your greatest victory was overcoming the difficulties of the past seven years. 
I discovered a new man.  
I offer my sincere condolences to his wife, Dr. Lemire, and his children. 
Honourable senators, I wish to pay tribute to a remarkable man, the Honourable Paul David. 
L.O. David wrote a biography of Laurier and the history of the Patriotes.  
One of the things we have to thank him for is the celebrated Prix David.  
It is his greatest achievement.  
He began his political career at the age of 65. 
Hon. Therese Lavoie-Roux :
He never got embroiled in partisan discussions. 
He was there to serve others, not just one political party.  
This research fund analyzes all applications for research grants. 
It is well known in Quebec and plays a very important role. 
Hon. Wilbert J. Keon :
Imagine the courage that he showed at that time. 
The Japanese Heart Institute in Tokyo had not been created. 
However, Dr. David was totally unique. 
Dr. David touched so many in so many ways. 
He touched me in tangible ways that I will cherish forever.  
Dr. David was appointed to the Senate in 1985, by Mr. Mulroney. 
At that time, donors were rare. 
Dr. David explained things simply so everyone understood. 
He said, for example, that there was going to be a heart operation. 
Everyone was afraid of it, no one wanted to go. 
His presence, his image and his calm reassured people.  
His departure leaves us in great sadness.  
We have lost a most honourable individual.  
Kosovo-Problems of War 
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
I introduced this topic on March 25. 
Unfortunately, neither NATO nor the U.S. presidency was listening to either one of us. 
I spoke about the foolishness of the bombing project at that time.  
It is also wrong militarily. 
There are nothing but mountains and more mountains. 
I was originally hired by Mr. Tito to establish their geological survey. 
This is the type of country in which our troops will be operating. 
Lastly, I think it is morally wrong. 
The end never justifies the means.  
Commemoration of the Holocaust 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
How can one best commemorate the Holocaust? 
He was introduced to my mother by my uncle. 
They also settled in Toronto.  
During that visit, one afternoon I - 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators, to extend the honourable senator's time?  
The library graces two sides of that small square. 
The Jewish cemetery has disappeared completely. 
So, honourable senators, the Holocaust is more than a word. 
Man's random and episodic outbursts of inhumanity to man continue. 
International Policy Conference on Children and Tobacco 
During that two-and-a-half day period, we had 22 hours of meetings. 
Sixty delegates from some 31 countries participated.  
United Kingdom Report on Racism of Police Officers 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
I had an opportunity to read it over the Easter break.  
The report recommended that the: 
I believe that this definition is an important step towards dealing with race relations. 
Racism must be defined by those who are on the receiving end. 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Wednesday, April 14, 1999, I will move: 
Hon. James F. Kelleher :
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Wednesday next, April 14, 1999, I will move: 
Health Care in Canada 
Hon. Wilbert J. Keon :
North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Involvement in Yugoslavia-Relationship to International Law-Notice of Inquiry 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, my question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Could the minister provide the Senate with some specificity? 
He is back in Canada today.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I believe I indicated earlier that I have confidence in the Security Council. 
The veto power is not something new. 
Diplomatic Efforts Surrounding Events in Former Yugoslavia-Request for Information 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, Canada continues its consultations with Russia, Ukraine, and other countries. 
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
Honourable senators, my question is also to the government leader in the Senate. 
That remains an outstanding question. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Basically, it was too late by then.  
The Rambouillet agreement is dead.  
Has Canada taken note of that?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Yes, indeed, it has, honourable senators. 
The suffering of innocent civilians should not be further prolonged. 
- finally, to permit the international community to verify compliance with these undertakings.  
He did not say that Canada is actually pushing this idea. 
Honourable senators, the Secretary General has the continuing unequivocal support of Canada.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
...we have neither defined victory nor established any real goals.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
They have been destroyed!  
They will all be dead!  
Think of the consequences if we had not taken action. 
It is to be hoped that the bombing will end at an early date.  
After you have destroyed everything.  
The diplomatic route failed at Rambouillet and action was required. 
NATO, which includes Canada, responded in a responsible way. 
I do not believe anyone disagrees with that. 
Are we ready to send a properly trained expeditionary force? 
That is a long series of questions. 
I believe I answered some of them earlier.  
I do not know what would be the chain of command there. 
The question was not that hard to follow. 
I asked what troops are combat-ready that we can send?  
However, I shall attempt to find that answer for the Honourable Senator Forrestall. 
NATO Forces in Former Yugoslavia-Plight of Kosovars 
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
That is my question, and it is a concern. 
It is not confrontational. 
Nobody in the world did anything. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Canada is one of five countries involved in strategic strike campaigns. 
Hon. James F. Kelleher :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Too slow, too cumbersome, too complicated and doesn't have enough teeth.  
Over two years later, nothing has been done to address this problem.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I would be very pleased to do that. 
I know that this is a subject which Senator Kelleher returns to quite frequently. 
As a former minister of trade, he has a special interest in this area.  
If I am wrong on that, then I am open to correction.  
Our hope is for a speedy bilateral settlement between the two provinces.  
Honourable senators, the honourable senator is not as well informed as I thought he was.  
You would not be the first one to feel that.  
Do not blame Ottawa, honourable senators. 
Ask the provinces why they are not making use of those provisions.  
It does not work. 
That is why the Ontario government became so frustrated. 
That is why they have taken this action by themselves. 
Honourable senators, I shall certainly bring that matter to the attention of my colleagues. 
Our objective is to promote open markets within Canada by eliminating all barriers. 
Answers to Order Paper Questions Tabled 
National Defence-Land Forces Command Budget Shortfall 
First Nations Land Management Bill 
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
Five of these bands are in my province, the province of British Columbia.  
Honourable senators, I sit on the Standing Senate Committee on Aboriginal Peoples. 
As parliamentarians, we are put in an impossible situation in many instances. 
Often the accusations are more extreme than that, unfortunately.  
What are we to do with it? 
We are studying the issue in great detail at the present time. 
In the majority of cases, they have been forced to take that course. 
It is a constitutionally protected right, according to the courts. 
The Supreme Court ordered a new trial. 
Let us face it, we are all here to stay.  
Where is Parliament in this? 
However, as a parliamentarian, I have no say. 
The courts have dictated.  
I am not here court bashing. 
I cannot be less partisan than by quoting a former Liberal prime minister.  
There is no mention of the Musqueam Indian band. 
Taxes were paid to the City of Vancouver. 
The federal government must do this. 
The minister has stated that the land codes must meet her approval. 
The verifier is a party independent of Canada or the First Nation. 
Perhaps that is not so bad. 
Perhaps we are getting away from DIAND and the minister, and what have you. 
Perhaps this is an improvement in some ways. 
Clause 28(1) of Bill C-49 states that: 
It is unclear what "other first nation purposes" may include.  
There is no supervisory role in this procedure for the minister.  
Let us not disappoint our friends in the other place. 
I know how often you are forced to vote a certain way. 
I was the caucus chairman of 211 members at one time. 
I know exactly what happens. 
No, I will not name names. 
I said I would be non-partisan so I will not name names. 
Let us do what is correct for all Canadians.  
I received tons of letters. 
I have some of them here.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Your Honour, would you question such a great speech? 
May I continue, sir?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I have spoken to people all across my province. 
Then he asked if I was shocked by that response. 
Honourable senators, the will is there, if we do things correctly. 
Premier Clark is running roughshod over the Nisga'a agreement. 
British Columbians want to support this proposal. 
Their hearts are in the right place.  
Otherwise, I would not be standing here today. 
Or taking care of your chicken.  
Senator St. Germain : - or taking care of my chicken.  
Honourable senators, we must take part in the debate on Bill C-49. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Report of Committee-Debate Adjourned 
Hon. John B. Stewart :
Honourable senators, I move adoption of the report.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Did you wish to speak, Senator Stewart?  
We will do the best we can.  
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
This is a measure that I do not think we should take lightly. 
The committee did an excellent job. 
We made a number of amendments. 
In the main, I accept the amendments. 
Further, will we be used as a conduit? 
Thus, I see that there are some mechanical difficulties that must be addressed.  
That may be true. 
A pilot project may be put in place in Anchorage, Alaska. 
I think an amendment has improved the legislation. 
These cases were taken up informally. 
Honourable senators, I should like to ask the honourable senator a question.  
She referred to the situation where a traveller presents herself or himself for preclearance. 
Clause 10(1) of the bill states: 
Senator Stewart is right. 
The amendments will now eliminate that situation. 
Therefore, it remains to be seen how that will be implemented.  
The penalties have been lessened. 
Therefore, that part has been corrected.  
As I say, we have come light years from what we had. 
Previously, we were at the total mercy of the American system, in my opinion. 
We are now saying that it must be the answer. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I have a question for my colleague Senator Andreychuk. 
The question is what is a legitimate amount. 
Must the Americans pass similar legislation?  
There are not enough travellers coming from the United States.  
I should like to ask a supplementary question just to get more information.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, the time period has been far exceeded. 
Is there leave granted to extend the question period?  
The same is true on the East Coast. 
Those are existing patterns both from Europe and from Asia.  
I believe it commends itself that way also.  
I therefore disagree with you on that score.  
It certainly is a convenience.  
Now it will be law. 
This bill is before us so that we may enjoy that convenience.  
On motion of Senator Kinsella, debate adjourned.  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
On motion of Senator Carstairs, debate adjourned

Tomorrow will be the 14th day that this matter has been stood. 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Review of Nuclear Weapons Policies 
Leave having been given to revert to Order No. 128: 
Honourable senators, I rise on a point of order. 
As this motion is in my name, I have some interest in it. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I thought I had heard the word "stand" when the order was called. 
It cannot be debated at this time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I find myself in an awkward position because the matter has been stood. 
However, I could consider a request by the Senate to revert to this order. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
The matter can then be adjourned in the name of another senator. 
Of course, the Government of Canada is represented by the cabinet. 
Honourable senators, recently we passed another motion dealing with NATO.

Yes, thanks to free trade!  
Let us look at market debt. 
The debt rose from $208 billion to $508 billion. 
Honourable senators, fair tax relief is there also. 
The initiatives of this budget are mutually reinforcing. 
On motion of Senator Kinsella, for Senator Lebreton, debate adjourned.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
On motion of Senator Kinsella, for Senator Eyton, debate adjourned.
