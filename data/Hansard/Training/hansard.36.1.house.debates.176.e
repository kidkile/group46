Monday, February 8, 1999 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
ORDER PAPER QUESTIONS-SPEAKER'S RULING 
First of all I want to thank the member for raising the matter. 
The hon. member brought up this matter as a point of order. 
Standing Order 39 has several components. 
I will now address each of the three distinct issues submitted by the hon. member.  
Most importantly, I must attest to the impartiality of the Clerk's staff. 
In my opinion this recommendation to divide the question was not an arbitrary one. 
As with any interpretation of rules there is unavoidably an element of judgment involved. 
I thank the hon. member for bringing this matter to the attention of the House.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your ruling on this issue. 
That is as it should be. 
There is leeway on the government side with the 45 days. 
The member has four questions and four it shall remain. 
I appreciate the comment made by the hon. member. 
From my perspective that is an avenue which should be pursued in this fashion. 
He does not of course question my ruling, but he is asking for some guidance.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I thank you for your ruling.  
I thank him for that clarification.  
The House resumed from November 4, 1998, consideration of the motion.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
I want to say a few words about each of those headings if I might.  
We all pay tax on our income. 
We are seeing many examples of that around the world.  
In Canada we have seen the rising sea level. 
We have seen temperature change in certain regions of our country. 
They cause food shortages and losses exceeding the financial capabilities of the insurance industry.  
We can talk about social inequity. 
We see many reasons to support such a motion. 
There are also many individuals and organizations supporting this particular motion. 
We have seen passenger trains being pulled off the rails. 
They are using trucks instead of boxcars. 
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
The motion reads as follows: 
The Bloc Quebecois will be supporting this motion. 
To put it clearly, this benefit is considered to be income, and therefore taxable. 
There seems to me, therefore, to be a problem of equity here.  
As our colleagues so aptly pointed out, and I quote: 
That is to say nothing of the environmental aspect. 
For the record, I will go over them briefly.  
The government will spend millions to correct this environmental mess. 
We are moving step by step on the road to a better world. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The government recognizes that encouraging the use of public transportation is important. 
I want to thank the hon. member for bringing this important issue to our attention. 
I believe that the measure will be reviewed as part of the national process. 
It would therefore be premature to take any action in this regard immediately. 
We know the results. 
We have made progress in a number of areas. 
The issue of greenhouse gas emissions is global. 
We have a global commitment to deal with it. 
We will deal with this issue in a collective fashion. 
There is a difference. 
In this motion we are only focusing on those individuals who are employed. 
The issue should be approached from a much wider spectrum. 
The government is supportive of initiatives that will deal with greenhouse gas emissions. 
With that being said, I would urge hon. members not to support the motion.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
The fact is that we have made commitments in Kyoto. 
Global warming is real. 
He was also very clear in terms of his opposition to the motion. 
Initially when I saw the motion I had some concerns. 
We already have a tax code in Canada that is far too complicated. 
Our party is supporting the motion. 
The environment and economics are inextricably linked. 
In fact we cannot do that. 
It is not appropriate to do that and it is not logical.  
We need to explore this issue further.  
We are recognized around the world for our relatively pristine surroundings and environment. 
It is something we cannot take for granted.  
Perhaps we should recognize that important evolution. 
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
We have heard that already this morning in previous speeches.  
The first issue debate around this point raises is the notion of costs. 
There is lost productivity associated with traffic gridlock. 
These types of costs transcend not only ministries in the federal government. 
Sooner or later these costs have to be captured and have to be paid.  
To put it bluntly this initiative goes against the grain. 
It does illustrate the role the tax system can play in encouraging certain behaviours.  
We need to look at fiscal policies that encourage sustainable behaviours. 
This motion is certainly attempting to do just that.  
I congratulate the hon. member for bringing this motion to the House. 
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, the recommendation of the member for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys is praiseworthy. 
It has been proposed by the Federation of Canadian Municipalities each year since 1990, imagine. 
Towards a Sustainable Budget''. 
In 1997 the same committee produced the report ``Kyoto and Beyond:
Meeting the Climate Change Challenge''. 
So far this recommendation seems to have been ignored.  
However, Revenue Canada was unable to provide the data. 
The Amalgamated Transit Union has organized a campaign. 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
The Reform Party would work to create a flatter, simpler and fairer tax system. 
Let us look at the Liberal record.  
This is the dilemma I face. 
To work out this problem, I thought about the infamous Peter and Paul. 
This compounds the offensiveness of the original taking.  
This leaves us only with one other option: decreasing expenditures.  
The difference here is very important. 
It should do this by cutting the fat.  
I respect his position. 
He believes, as I do, that the tax system should be transparent, fair and simple. 
Canadians must be allowed to make choices. 
I think the motion has merit and deserves support.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
It has been a pleasure to hear those comments. 
Those are the types of issues that should not be an if/or. 
We know what the effects will be and we should respond to that.  
I thank my hon. colleague for presenting the motion.  
That is what we will continue to do. 
That is what we are doing with this motion.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
FEDERAL-PROVINCIAL FISCAL ARRANGEMENTS ACT 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Equalization has a long tradition. 
These estimates will be updated later this month.  
Currently seven provinces benefit directly from equalization payments:
What makes this happen? 
The floor provision is the other side of the coin. 
This will mean more predictable protection for provincial governments.  
However, the taxation environment is not static. 
However, let us get the facts straight. 
We have not changed the revenues which equalization takes into account at all. 
This renewal follows more than two years of consultation with the provinces. 
I submit to this House that this has been done.  
It is important to build on this groundwork and finish the renewal. 
It is important to have new legislation in place before that happens.  
The legislation intends to maintain the fairness with which the equalization program is delivered. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Equalization is linked to taxation. 
It is linked to the finances of the provinces. 
It is linked to the financing of social programs. 
It is linked to the social union. 
It is literally linked to the financing of federalism itself.  
It was a beautiful theory. 
It was beautifully laid out. 
Everything was connected to principle and analysis.  
I got halfway through and he started to laugh. 
I will read into the record a brief description of the federal equalization program. 
It is only 10 paragraphs. 
This is a miracle in itself. 
It deserves a little recognition.  
Here, therefore, is the official description of equalization: 
Equalization is an unconditional transfer. 
Provinces receiving equalization may spend it in accordance with their own priorities. 
Three provinces do not receive equalization program payments-British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario.  
Equalization transfers are determined on the basis of legislated formulae. 
Equalization is subject to ceiling and floor provisions. 
It is just part of the mystique.  
Now that is the program as it is described. 
The broader financial and political considerations affecting equalization are as follows. 
The federal government would always assume 50% of the approved cost of health care.  
In light of these circumstances, what is required? 
What is required with respect to equalization? 
These have to be considered together because they are all tangled up together. 
There is no record other than defending the status quo.  
It is mere tinkering with regard to tax policy. 
Meanwhile, Canadians continue to pay more for less in terms of social services. 
Canadians must look elsewhere for substantive reform of the financial underpinnings of federalism.  
I do not want to be entirely negative. 
It just clings to the status quo and adds a little tinkering. 
That is its only contribution.  
This position has been well articulated by both the Alberta and Ontario governments. 
Listen to what I am saying. 
Listen to the orders of magnitude. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
With all due respect, I would differ.  
Why do we have them? 
How are payments arrived at? 
Now there are 30. 
A list is compiled for each province.  
We may come back to this later. 
There are individuals who are getting a lot of political mileage out of this. 
There is nothing complicated in equalization. 
Hard work can be done on every aspect of the fiscal parameters.  
My preference would be the fiscal system. 
It is a system that has captivated me for many years.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
Four billion dollars a year.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. Thibeault):
Do you know why they are talking and laughing across the way? 
That is why they are raising their voices. 
They do not wish to hear the truth.  
Let us also look at New Brunswick. 
His figures are also a little tendentious.  
Ontario does not get any.  
It will be more advantageous for everyone. 
The principle of equalization payments, however, is to calculate per person. 
Now a little trip to the west, the land of Reform. 
Two out of four.  
And what about British Columbia?  
British Columbia does not get any.  
But instead of serving them, they are laughing and saying any old thing. 
I would be ashamed if I were in their shoes. 
They would go back to their riding and condemn such behaviour.  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
As I was saying, we must be very careful with figures. 
We must review the principles behind equalization. 
They can be checked. 
In fact, all the figures that I am presenting can be checked. 
This is productive and job creating spending. 
These figures can and should be verified. 
We would even have had an extra $1.4 billion to play with.  
In politics, two things in particular are important.  
The members opposite are laughable. 
The overall picture has to be presented. 
We are going to address these further in committee.  
There is nothing magical about equalization payments, nothing arbitrarily determined. 
I thank my hon. colleagues for their attention.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
We all like the idea of level playing fields. 
We do not like different playing fields or uneven playing fields. 
Every other province is consistent. 
By and large, it works like this. 
Basically it is a history lesson. 
It is a reflection of the province qualifying or not qualifying for equalization payments. 
There is an interesting history lesson in these statistics.  
I want to reflect on a view that was previously stated. 
I remember the old days when it was 50:50. 
That was the way it was supposed to work. 
However, over the years that old playing field just about tipped upside down. 
They should feel sorry for what they have done and they should rectify it.  
We have to take this more seriously. 
Let us consider how the social union was struck. 
Unfortunately that is the way it is done. 
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
There are some interesting issues in this bill which I want to address.  
We see some key changes in this equalization agreement. 
My colleague made reference to casino revenues. 
But it provides a little extra money for Quebec and perhaps it needs it. 
There is an issue which is very important to Saskatchewan right now. 
My province of Saskatchewan is experiencing an agricultural crisis. 
Farmers are desperate to get their crops in this spring. 
They have no revenues to do that.  
Agriculture is not something we benefit from locally in Canada. 
The government is offering only $450 million for all of Canada. 
Saskatchewan might get 40% of that in a particular year. 
The government has to consider that.  
Reformers do support a level playing field for Conrad Black. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I have a couple of comments.  
There is no inequity there.  
Quebec does not have as many roads but it has a lot of ports. 
Saskatchewan does not have ports. 
Should we follow that line of thinking? 
Then we get on to the whole subsidization issue.  
The member made reference to the amount of the increase in equalization. 
He did not think it was very much. 
It is not the Liberal member of parliament from Ontario. 
I am glad the member raised this issue.  
I thank the member for raising that issue.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
I am going to focus on a couple which I do have some concerns with.  
One is on the lottery and gaming revenues. 
I have concerns with this for a couple of reasons.  
In some cases there has been loss of people's entire monthly incomes. 
Health costs are provincially borne costs. 
I would argue that it is short-sighted to consider these casino revenues. 
We have to recognize the importance of equalization within Canada. 
It is a cornerstone of Canada's social policy. 
It is something we should be proud of as a country. 
That is something we should be proud of.  
That is something we have to be very careful of.  
First, we should not increase tensions on a federal-provincial relations perspective. 
I will give an example of the wrong-headedness of some of these policies. 
I participated recently in a conference on education. 
This is a global phenomenon. 
These trade barriers need to come down.  
I am talking about equalization of opportunity, not strictly equalization payments. 
This will take more than simply equalization payments.  
That again is a strong education system. 
That will give him a little better chance to summarize at the end.  
At this point I would like to proceed to Statements by Members.  
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Vancouver Kingsway is a very culturally diverse riding. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Middlemen take the rest, but they are pikers compared to government. 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
I congratulate both the nominees and the recipients. 
Their dedication to their craft has not gone unnoticed. 
CITIZENSHIP AND HERITAGE WEEK 
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
People and cultures from all over have therefore helped build Canada. 
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
Bon voyage to the contest winners.  
THE HEART AND STROKE FOUNDATION OF CANADA 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
NATIONAL YEAR 2000 PREPAREDNESS WEEK 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
The hon. member for Drummond.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Fortunately the Reform leader's doomsday predictions have not come anywhere near to being realized. 
THE LATE KING HUSSEIN 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, today the world mourns the death of King Hussein of Jordan.  
I had the privilege of meeting the King a few years ago. 
What was most striking about him was his humility, grace and kindness. 
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Quebec theater is alive and well indeed. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the Liberal government's neglect of aboriginal people is an outrage. 
There are no jobs. 
They are not able to buy healthy food for their families. 
They have poor housing and overcrowded conditions. 
Some do not even have clean drinking water.  
In the Shamattawa First Nation, four out of five young people are addicted to solvents. 
The Liberal government's programs for aboriginal people are a sham. 
They do not go nearly far enough. 
It is time for the government- 
The hon. member for Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle.  
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
THE LATE KING HUSSEIN 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
The leaders of all G-8 countries, except Canada, are in Jordan. 
This is a diplomatic snub. 
It is an affront to our historical leadership in the Middle East. 
While we should be mourning the loss of Jordan's King Hussein- 
The hon. member for Beauharnois-Salaberry.  
THE LATE KING HUSSEIN OF JORDAN 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
CITIZENSHIP AND HERITAGE WEEK 
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
This is the essence of the week. 
We can all take pride.  
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, at times the heritage minister does some strange things. 
Now that is a feature film policy.  
If they do, they will face the wrath of the Criminal Code of Canada.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, King Hussein was a leader, a diplomat and a fighter. 
Why did he not go?  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
The Prime Minister had a lot of time to make plans. 
It is about sending a message that Jordan is a valued friend. 
Why did he not go?  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
The hon. member for Edmonton North.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, now it is someone else's fault. 
The President of the United States attended.  
The Prime Minister had a special obligation to Jordan today.  
Canada is the chair of the United Nations Security Council. 
We are trying to influence the peace progress greatly.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
The Prime Minister wished to be at the funeral. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Once again he has requested funding for the students. 
When is the solicitor general going to make the wrong right? 
When is he going to announce funding for the students?  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have received a letter from Mr. Hughes. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
What is there to inquire about? 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
My staff and I are evaluating the letter and we will respond to the letter.  
AGREEMENT ON SOCIAL UNION 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
The leader of the Bloc Quebecois could ask the Premier of Quebec about this. 
He would get some answers that would surprise him greatly.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
So what has become of the famous resolution on the distinct society?  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
The Prime Minister had wished to be present. 
He indeed sent staff in advance to Amman, Jordan. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Unfortunately that did not occur.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Farmers are asking where the programs are. 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
If the provinces do not want to assist they will have to explain that- 
The hon. member for Medicine Hat.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Last week the Reform Party presented its plan to the House. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
That would do a lot of good for Canadians. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT CANADA 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Why are recovery quotas three times higher than anticipated fraud?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
The minister should read the information his department is putting out.  
The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Here are last Friday's figures again. 
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
The questions today are about his proposed budget. 
The hon. Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The other document we have in front of us is the Reform Party proposal.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Here is the record, here is the agenda of the finance minister. 
There have been $38 billion in tax increases since 1993. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Again I go back, Mr. Speaker. 
What is it afraid of?  
It is afraid people will truly understand what in fact it stands for. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to correct an error if I may. 
There is an ongoing attempt to confuse Canadians.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
I have a question for the defence minister. 
Who is guarding Canada's coastline?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have an air force that does this. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
I will quote again from those documents. 
Who is guarding Canada's coastline?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
From what I have heard from him before, he does not get his research right.  
We certainly have a navy. 
We have an air force. 
We have an army. 
They are all doing their utmost to protect Canada's sovereignty. 
Yes, we have fewer resources. 
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. John O'Reilly (Haliburton-Victoria-Brock, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question concerns the student summer job action program.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I cannot wait for minister's statement period.  
His punishment for this crime was a one year sentence. 
Why should a judge be required to take that into account? 
What does it matter?  
Mr. Speaker, I do not know the particulars of this case. 
He has to read the law and he has to interpret the law. 
I think that is what the judge did in this particular case.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
She was subsequently sentenced to community service.  
Why such pathetic sentences for these horrendous crimes?  
The hon. parliamentary secretary.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
This government keeps saying to wait for the budget.  
There were no beds.  
Will the government now recognize that the situation is extremely urgent? 
Will it attempt to cut a cheque immediately for health care?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, time is running out.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
That will do it. 
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We will evaluate it annually. 
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Benoit Serre (Timiskaming-Cochrane, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois claims that we are neglecting francophones outside Quebec. 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
But here at home Maclean's magazine actually relies on- 
We have a question here. 
The hon. member for Peace River may begin again.  
Mr. Speaker, I will try that again. 
Can the heritage minister please explain how that will help Canadian publishers?  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT CANADA 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
The two amounts do not match.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is no harrassment. 
Personally, I did not like the tone of the memo. 
This is what the employment insurance reform is about as well. 
This is our political philosophy. 
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
My question is for the Minister of National Defence. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Middlesex, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence.  
Kosovo has been in the media a great deal for the past few days. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
They were at the table as of this weekend. 
The hon. member for Wild Rose.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
They are a done deal. 
The aboriginal people who are the victims in these cases want to hear the answer. 
Why are aboriginal killers being treated differently than any other Canadian in these laws?  
Mr. Speaker, my answer to the question still stands. 
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
There is no question. 
We have done this in discussion with the fishing groups. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Now postal rates are going up. 
Service is going down. 
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Therefore it is appropriate that its financial structure responds to what the competition is doing.  
Every year 170,000 new addresses are added. 
Naturally it will continue to have universal service for Canadians.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
In Kosovo we are facing a situation of enormous proportions in terms of human tragedy. 
We will go through a proper process to determine to do that. 
THE LATE KING HUSSEIN 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
The people of Jordan whatever their background owed much to King Hussein. 
He brought his country into the modern world. 
But King Hussein persisted despite opposition from many of his neighbours.  
His compassion for the suffering and misfortunes of others was legendary. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
What is the difference between a politician and a statesman? 
They attended, just as did Yasser Arafat and Syria's President Assad. 
He was a bridge between the Arab world and Israel. 
He was a bridge between the west and the east. 
May God sustain and guide his successor along the same path.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
A number of Quebec businesses contributed to the development of trade links with Jordan. 
We can only hope that these ties will be continued under his successor.  
The death of King Hussein was also a crushing blow to his people. 
In every way, his long reign was a totally remarkable one. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
King Hussein ruled Jordan for 47 years. 
His reign was characterized at times by turbulence and great upheaval. 
His contribution to the peace process in the Middle East will live on.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
People the world over are mourning the loss of this great man. 
King Hussein was an exceptional world leader.

Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I wonder if I could get a specific timeframe on that.  
Mr. Speaker, I know the member's concern. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am reluctant to allow question period to continue. 
The hon. member rose on a point of order. 
It does not appear that he is. 
Shall the remaining questions stand?  
FEDERAL-PROVINCIAL FISCAL ARRANGEMENTS ACT 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the issue of equalization is fundamental to Canada. 
Equalization has represented a cornerstone of the social and economic policies in Canada. 
Manitoba would be one of the provinces that would be cut out of equalization. 
I will give an idea of the impact on Manitoba. 
We all believe in the free market. 
All these policies tie together.  
We will not stand by and see a ghettoization of Canada. 
Our party has always been committed to these goals. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
It is basically a mobility issue.  
The member should be careful in his choice of language. 
I would hope the member would want to clarify his views on equalization in Canada.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his comment.  
At no time did I say that we did not support equalization. 
In fact I defended the tenets of equalization vociferously.  
Without equalization we would have a ghettoization. 
I hope that clarification is to the member's satisfaction.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
That perception is very real. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
He raises a very good point.  
In fact at some point in the future that may occur.  
Those problems would not disappear simply because of the lack of equalization.  
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate what the member had to say. 
I do not know. 
Would the member comment on that?  
I do not honestly believe that equalization payments contribute to dependency. 
Those areas do not represent a dependency. 
The hon. member raises the very important issue of dependency. 
He does have a point. 
However, that cannot be done simply through equalization. 
Frankly, that is what is really lacking at this point.  
Fundamentally, that speaks to what this legislation is all about.  
Canada was built on a principled set of tenets. 
That did not happen last year, nor did it happen 10 years ago. 
It happened literally hundreds of years ago, but it happened. 
That is an example of how this country was built.  
No. That is what built this country. 
It is not a Canadian principle.  
That is what the Reform Party has based its entire debate on. 
Their question is how do they take down the program.  
By simply providing tax relief to Canadians. 
What will this tax relief do? 
It will provide the provinces with the opportunity to be able to tax their citizens. 
What does it really boil down to? 
What does that really say about the Reform Party's position? 
This means every man, woman and child must stand solely for themselves. 
Is it a great country building principle? 
Quite frankly it is one that I reject out of hand.  
Reformers are really saying that they want all persons to fend only for themselves. 
I do not accept that notion. 
I do not agree with it whatsoever. 
The country was built on a more solid foundation than that. 
I am very delighted that I am allowed the opportunity to speak on equalization. 
What kind of education would they receive? 
Quite frankly, why have Canada? 
Why be a collective? 
Why be a nation based on principles of equity? 
It speaks to what Canada is all about. 
That may be odious and terrible for the opposition. 
Today, Newfoundland and Labrador leads the country in economic growth. 
I am very proud of that. 
That growth will define the fact that we will no longer require equalization payments.  
That is accomplished in part through equalization.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
There was not a word about that. 
Somehow that slipped his mind.  
Let us be very clear about a couple of points. 
The value of exports are double. 
Our economy is growing. 
Now we are seeing a dividend from that. 
That is a Canada that the Reform Party does not understand.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
This is simply, completely, totally inaccurate, false, wrong and misleading. 
We support the principle of equalization. 
The people of Alberta, B.C. and Ontario generally support equalization as well. 
He went on to say that this is an important principle in our federation. 
Kudos to Newfoundland and Labrador. 
It is not our objective over the long term to be a recipient of equalization. 
It is the objective however of the Reform Party to keep us in that position.  
The Reform Party's position has always been that tax cuts are the answer. 
They just do not understand this fact. 
Polls do not say much when it comes to building Canada. 
The Reform Party members do not understand that and it is about time they did.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
The Reform government will put $2.5 billion back into health care. 
Now we are getting to the heart of it, Mr. Speaker. 
Let us put it in perspective. 
That is something the Reform Party does not agree with. 
They cannot stand it- 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Unfortunately the Reform Party cannot support this bill. 
We would like to see a different approach taken.  
Maybe he did not know that. 
I think he has a lot of explaining to do.  
I will get into some of the specifics of this bill. 
The Reform Party has problems with Bill C-65 for a number of reasons. 
I should explain first of all what this is. 
That is a tremendous amount of money. 
It amounts to about 8% of the federal government's budget every single year. 
Yet are we having a major task force look into this? 
Are we having a big discussion about this? 
This was a great disaster. 
All of a sudden he has $30 million in excess of his budget. 
He will have a balanced budget. 
It shows us how open to political manipulation the current system is. 
That is about as clear as it is. 
In other words it is wide open to interpretation. 
However the current government in power wants to structure it, it will structure it. 
That is not reflected in the formula. 
Some provinces are discriminated against because of the huge discrepancies in the cost of production. 
In my judgment we have another disaster there.  
I want to give some examples of that. 
Look at something like the infrastructure program. 
It was based on levels of unemployment. 
Again we see a whole bunch of money going from some provinces into other provinces.  
I would argue that we need transparency. 
Then we ask whether or not it is an appropriate amount. 
Maybe there needs to be a more straightforward formula. 
My leader spoke of that earlier today.  
I do not want to make that the central part of my speech today. 
I want to talk about how we create have provinces. 
We believe there should be ways to do that. 
I think he would be shocked to find that out. 
Maybe there is a way through lowering taxes to attract investment to Atlantic Canada. 
In fact we would increase spending on social programs.  
We would cut spending for the CBC. 
They see all the manipulation that goes on whereby government ministers reward their friends.  
That is a little bit ridiculous. 
We argue that those things need to be cut. 
We would like to see the CRTC cut. 
It is a terrible waste of money. 
That is what goes on in the Liberal government. 
We are going to continue to push for that to happen.  
It is not by giving them a program. 
It is not by becoming a huge welfare state. 
It is the private sector that will create prosperity for people.  
The political allocation of scarce economic resources simply does not work. 
So it throws more money at the problem, but it never gets fixed. 
It just keeps getting worse and the government cannot figure it out.  
It is time that my friends across the way embraced a new approach. 
It is time for tax relief.  
CPP premiums are rising by about $1.4 billion. 
It is simply not so. 
We have seen disposable income fall like a stone. 
I would argue that Canadians can ill afford that. 
Who really balanced the budget? 
Was it the finance minister?  
I think that Canadians balanced it. 
The finance minister balanced the budget on the backs of taxpayers. 
We need to put an end to all that.  
Already the government is headed for a budget this year of around $109 billion. 
It was $3 billion over budget last year. 
Our argument is very simple. 
That is absolutely ridiculous.  
We want to raise personal and spousal allowances to $7,900.  
Those are some of the things we want to do. 
We want to drop the three rates down to two rates. 
It would mean that a lot of money would go into people's pockets.  
Let me give one example as I close. 
That is what tax relief would do for Canadians.  
My friend from Newfoundland would argue that his government could spend it better. 
I think that family would argue with that. 
The hon. member has demonstrated that he clearly does not understand equalization. 
Equalization works on the basis of a formula. 
It is not subject to political manipulation.  
I would like the hon. member to ask that question. 
That question was asked in the provincial campaign. 
The answer that Newfoundlanders and Labradorians gave was emphatically and categorically ``No. 
We have made that pretty clear. 
We would increase it by $2.5 billion.  
We sent it out to about 15 million households across Canada. 
We made that very clear.  
We would make cuts to the Department of Canadian Heritage. 
We would cut the bureaucracy of Indian affairs. 
We have made that very clear.  
Those are some of the areas where we would cut. 
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
We cannot be a part of a legal process. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for her good question. 
We understand that there are remote communities which do not have access to private broadcasters. 
We have specifically said CBC television.  
It would be nice if it could actually come to some kind of agreement. 
We think that is a huge mistake. 
We would like to see these things settled and settled once and for all. 
We think we owe that not only to natives but to Canadian taxpayers in general.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Would the member like to reconsider his statement? 
I do not buy the member's argument.  
We see politicians using huge piles of money for their own political ends.  
I reject the member's arguments. 
I think they are false. 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
I want to review the three sections. 
Section 36(2) goes on to read: 
The question on equalization was: 
The vast majority of participants supported the principle of equalization. 
To quote from the B.C. unity report: 
I would like to relate what we are talking about on a more individual basis.  
I will go to the example of the cost of universities. 
This country has three so-called have provinces. 
In 1998 Maclean's reviewed the universities in a special issue. 
The complexities and intricacies of equalization are an accountant's dream. 
They are all different. 
It also does not take into account some of the geographic differences in the country.  
It does not address the real problem. 
However, we should also be honest about the program. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened to the member's comments with interest.  
There is something going on here which the member did not give credit for. 
Not only that, the member did not attempt to inquire. 
The member should explain herself.  
Mr. Speaker, I will certainly explain myself. 
I am sorry the member did not listen to my speech. 
I do not apologize for that. 
That is not equalization.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
She does her research well.  
Then the transfer payments kick in to even things up. 
The only solution, obviously, is for Quebec to become a sovereign nation.  
The government is Ontario and that is part of our problem.  
I mentioned the immigration program. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
We object to the equalization which is entrenched in the charter.  
It is an automatic statutory entitlement program. 
The government is attempting to collapse debate by not putting up any other speakers. 
We will not do that. 
One of the many problems with this formula is that it is extraordinarily complex. 
It is incredibly difficult to get to the bottom of that. 
I think that is just plain wrong.  
We also need a system that is fair. 
I have talked about the unfairness inherent in the system today.  
I think that is part of the problem with the formula.  
That is not equity; that is inequity. 
This is not how to design a system of social equity.  
What does that mean? 
Really that is what this is all about. 
They have the same jobs. 
They are working just as hard. 
This was in about 1992, several years ago. 
We are penalizing success. 
I am not suggesting that for a moment. 
That is inevitably going to be a factor. 
I hope my colleagues will look more closely at this issue.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I have a couple of comments on what the hon. member said.  
One comment concerns the property tax issue. 
He is correct that the auditor general has flagged it as an issue of concern. 
It is a bit of a difficult situation.  
That has some flaws in it as well. 
The hon. member said that equalization provides a disincentive for provinces to raise revenues. 
I just do not follow that argument.  
However, I said that it does put them in a difficult position. 
Let us take one concrete example.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
He denied it and then he went on to explain how it is a disincentive. 
He cannot have it both ways.  
The question to the member is simple. 
It is an unfortunate outcome of this kind of system.  
That is the whole point.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
My party supports this concept.  
That is the cornerstone of my party's policy. 
Therefore, why are we opposed to this legislation? 
This legislation falls short of achieving this goal.  
Can the government not use taxpayers' money more prudently? 
Why is 70% of the country made up of have not provinces? 
It is difficult to understand. 
Let me highlight some of them again.  
The formula for determining the distribution of funds is overly complex and convoluted. 
It penalizes provinces which display industriousness and innovation.  
I would like to elaborate on my last point. 
Today oil prices are quite low. 
This has led to hard times and layoffs in the oil patch. 
This is because Alberta has diversified its economy to avoid such situations.  
The federal government could learn much from the Government of Alberta. 
It could also take some pointers from the Government of Ontario. 
What are we to do with this inherently flawed equalization program? 
The official opposition suggests a new approach. 
We must also eliminate the arbitrariness of the current program and eliminate bureaucratic interference. 
We must create a transparent and accountable manner of addressing regional inequalities. 
This could be achieved through a simpler formula.  
However, this government should not take this goodwill and generosity for granted. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
This is not legislation. 
This is merely a proposal on the part of the Reform Party. 
People in my province cannot understand this formula. 
The Reform Party has stated that.  
We agree with equalization. 
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened intently to my colleague's speech. 
I do not agree.  
Let us not worry about that. 
We will leave it to the decision of Canadians.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Bill C-65 deals with the period from 1999 to the year 2004.  
The equalization program is important to the Canadian Confederation. 
Let us look at the process. 
The key element in the equalization formula is the representative tax system commonly called RTS. 
The RTS ought to be comprehensive, representative, accurate and appropriately categorized.  
It should not represent imaginary, unfair or unrealistic measures. 
It should be representative of the actual tax system.  
I will give six examples to prove what I am saying. 
Still other provinces charge no tax at all. 
They are not equivalent. 
Another example is user fees. 
It is a tax with only a semantic distinction.  
In just 10 years it doubled. 
The RTS base does not cover these newer gaming activities. 
The revenues are treated differently for equalization purposes. 
Again we are mixing apples with oranges.  
The RTS has become less representative of the provincial taxing policy. 
We will see if the government is addressing these gaming inequities in the bill.  
The fifth example is resource taxation. 
Resource taxation is an area where the ground is always shifting. 
Rent is a measure of taxable potential, not actual but potential. 
Rent associated with them can also differ significantly. 
These differences are not captured by the value or volume of production.  
The sixth example is property taxes. 
Still the government has not developed a suitable measure. 
The government is using the wrong yardstick instead of the 36-inch one.  
The base needs to be assessed rather than observed. 
The tax base is the income earned by the taxpayer, not the potential. 
The value of the stock must be estimated or assessed.  
Assessments inevitably involve judgment and judgments can differ. 
They can differ from item to item. 
In addition, the assessments are infrequent and use different base years. 
Thus the assessments are not comparable within the same municipality either. 
The government therefore lacks a common measure of property values. 
There is no agreement on the appropriate base for taxing property. 
The current property tax base measures relative fiscal capacity.  
It continues to measure a yard with a 26-inch yardstick.  
There are many flaws in the present equalization program. 
It should be completely reformed. 
Ceiling and floor levels were also introduced. 
I will not elaborate on that but it does not work favourably. 
The overpayments are treated as non-interest bearing loans to the provinces. 
Last year it cost the federal government $38 million. 
The federal government does not charge interest on the underpayments.  
The government has manipulated the program for political favours. 
The government has had five years. 
I wonder what the government has been doing for five years. 
The Liberals have denied the opportunity for public consultation or academic input into this case. 
This process is characteristic of this government. 
It is not fair that our system is such a conundrum. 
There is no reason for that to be the case. 
This could be a simple series of calculations. 
That is where the problem begins.  
The measurements should be accurate, reliable and sound. 
In this case they are not. 
Why would the Liberals allow such measurements to be used? 
The program presently costs $48 million. 
Eventually it will cost $242 million.  
I will not do that. 
I am proud to represent my constituents who would not do that either.  
Like British Columbia and Alberta, Ontario is a contributing province. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
They want to make money by exploiting the weakness of people. 
This is a serious problem that the governments are going to have to address eventually.  
Mr. Speaker, I sincerely thank the hon. member for bringing forward this issue. 
I know he is sincere in coming forward with his question.  
The smaller businesses were suffering and complaining. 
It is mostly seniors who are affected by the disease. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
The equalization program is one of the cornerstones of the country. 
It has played a major role in defining the Canadian federation. 
That is a very important principle within equalization.  
Seven provinces currently receive equalization payments:
There is no change to the basic structure of the program.  
Those are the principal elements of the bill before the House. 
This is second reading. 
If you believe it, pal.  
Reform members want to deny the fact that at committee important work is done. 
I know the Reform Party has made some suggestions. 
That is why it is there.  
I spent the afternoon listening patiently to the speeches. 
I am sorry but that is just not correct. 
It is absolutely wrong and the member should correct the record for what he said. 
They do not have to wait a half a year. 
The employment insurance system is very specific. 
The member should clarify the record.  
If only she asked the question, she would have had the answer.  
That was not the case at all. 
If they raised their taxes then they would lose some equalization dollars.  
The system is much more complex than that and takes things into account. 
It provides for five-province averages of tax rates.  
They have used time and time again a rhetorical question: ``Is this fair? 
This could not be fair''. 
There is a reason for that and I will offer it to the House. 
Why did they not try to answer the question? 
Canadians have a right to know all the facts. 
These are important points for Canadians to know.  
That is just not the case.  
They know what the rules are. 
It is a transparent process. 
They know what the calculations are. 
I think that is a very important aspect. 
I appreciated the opportunity to put some of these points on the record. 
I welcome those suggestions from the members. 
This is the opportunity to do it. 
If they believe they have adequate opportunity, they can make changes. 
That is the way democracy works.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
That is the purpose of this letter.  
This is not something that just happened yesterday. 
The previous commissioners requested funding.  
This whole APEC situation has been a black eye on Canada. 
A number of things have happened in this inquiry. 
A minister has had to resign over this issue. 
The former chairman of the commission has resigned over this issue. 
The two other commissioners have resigned over this issue. 
We are all looking forward to the results that Mr. Hughes will come out with.  
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the more things change- 
For months now, the opposition has held to a position that is fundamentally contradictory.  
The opposition's position is completely illogical.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
The government claims to be concerned about the problems but it does little about them.  
Unemployment is over 70% and over 90% in some areas. 
There is homelessness and a lack of clean drinking water. 
Preventable diseases like TB are prevalent. 
When I go to these communities I can hardly believe what I am seeing. 
The human tragedy of these conditions is heart breaking.  
Shamattawa is a sad example of all of these problems. 
Shamattawa is not the only community that this Liberal government has abandoned. 
One that I definitely want to mention is Garden Hill. 
This community of about 2,700 people was shaken by a terrible tragedy last month. 
The lack of health care professionals does not only affect first nations. 
Thompson has a severe shortage of doctors. 
Doctors are leaving and nurses are being laid off because of government cuts. 
These cuts are affecting all northern communities, first nations and non first nations alike.  
Take the God's Lake first nation. 
The Liberal government must do more to address the conditions on first nations. 
These conditions would not be tolerated in Toronto or Shawinigan. 
They do not even come close to what is needed.  
Token gestures and empty words are not enough.  
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
The Government of Canada is concerned about the living conditions facing the residents of Shamattawa. 
The first nation anticipates the construction of two portable classrooms to begin in the spring.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
In fact I do not really know where the comments of the minister came from.  
That certainly was not our prime motivation.  
Certainly this has had a devastating effect. 
Already an awful lot of people are living very close to the poverty line. 
It is a very marginal area. 
It has had a huge impact.  
We believe there have to be dramatic changes in the eligibility. 
They should be getting benefits in the neighbourhood of 60% of their working earnings. 
People came forward who had previously received in the neighbourhood of $350 per week. 
We are hoping that substantial changes will be put into effect in the next budget.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
(The House adjourned at 6.48 p.m.)
