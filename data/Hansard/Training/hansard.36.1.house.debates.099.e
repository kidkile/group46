GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions. 
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
The opportunity is now for the government to do this. 
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
These petitioners draw the attention of the House to the following. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
These petitions are coming in vast numbers and will not stop. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have the honour to present three petitions this morning. 
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
QUESTIONS PASSED AS ORDERS FOR RETURNS 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, on October 28, 1997 I asked Question No. 33. 
There seems to be a reluctance to answer the question. 
He said that he had answered half of them. 
If he had I guess I would be finished.  
The parliamentary secretary is beginning to remind me of Bill Clinton. 
Clinton said that Monica Lewinski was going to- 
I think the parliamentary secretary has got the point. 
Does the hon. parliamentary secretary wish to address this question also?  
Yes, I think that is appropriate.  
Is it agreed that all remaining questions stand?  
ALLOTTED DAY-HEPATITIS C 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP) moved: 
I will be sharing my time with our leader, the member for Halifax.  
The government refused and in the ensuing vote the government position was upheld narrowly. 
It worked to some extent. 
The government won that confidence vote by 155 to 140. 
That is the Canadian way.  
Thanks to this government pharmaceutical costs have been going through the roof. 
Tommy Douglas is recognized as the father of medicare in Canada. 
No one knows the hepatitis C issue better than those who live with the disease. 
They must be at the table for the next round, as this motion indicates.  
Let the victims now have their say on how to address their financial needs.  
In this Chamber we tend to deal with a topic and move on. 
That is the Canadian way.  
We have been given a second chance to do the right thing. 
This file is open once again. 
Let us not blow it this time. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
That responsibility remains to all victims of hepatitis C. 
You are in my heart and prayers always. 
We have a responsibility now to move forward. 
Let us accept that as a challenge to all members of the House. 
The Chair finds the amendment to be in order.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
They did not have the option of banking their own blood. 
Therefore they had to accept tainted blood.  
We have to do the just and honourable thing. 
I cannot imagine why all of us do not have the same feeling. 
Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin-Middlesex-London, Lib.):
This is what has been so lamentable and so tragic.  
They have insisted on reducing the matter to issues of legal liability. 
They have insisted on saying they cannot set precedents. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
There is a hopeful nature to what I am to say today. 
Although the issue is not resolved and is not completed, I see positive movement.  
I give credit today to the victims. 
I have actually met some of them. 
It is lucky if it has enough money to afford faxes. 
It is borrowing computer equipment for the Internet and whatnot.  
She also said that I could use her name and her remarks. 
I ordered the ALT test. 
It was the most specific sensitive test available to us at that time. 
I used the ALT test throughout my medical career. 
If he had added that proviso, he would have been on firm ground. 
That is the common name of the test. 
It was the most specific test we had available. 
This is not a negative talk at all. 
They only want funds if they are sick. 
They also need to be there because they have the best numbers figures. 
They have gone through these. 
In my hopeful comments I also want to look to the future. 
What does the future hold for our blood system? 
What will our new system do to prevent this? 
Would it be prevented by the new blood system? 
Who should be in charge? 
The federal Minister of Health should have that mantle on his shoulders. 
It is not something he can delegate to someone else. 
It is not something he can throw away.  
New therapies are coming along which are so exciting to these victims. 
Is this not our desire, to have these people cured rather than needing compensation? 
I want to pay tribute to Joey Hache. 
He does not live very far from here, so down he came. 
He sat up in the gallery. 
He watched the voting. 
He wrote out his questions to the Prime Minister. 
He could not ask them, but who could? 
I am very hopeful today for the victims. 
I want so much to be able to stop this haranguing. 
That is my sincere hope for the sake of the victims.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
Many of the provinces are under financial restraint. 
We have seen inflated figures, figures which I think are completely unfair. 
If we extrapolate that in Canada we will find that the figures are far different.  
In a sense it shamed other governments into following its lead.  
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
I believe it has a class four designation.  
Is this research facility involved in any of this at all?  
It is the perfect facility to be leading the charge in this way. 
The facility certainly could and should be involved.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
But these people were also infected and have suffered unprecedented prejudice. 
For the benefit of our viewers, the motion reads as follows: 
These the Hepatitis C Society of Canada could provide. 
We are in favour of this aspect of the motion.  
The answer is clear, however. 
I believe the answer is self-evident.  
In recent days, a number of new elements have been brought into the picture. 
A vote of confidence on this issue could topple the government. 
Nova Scotia's throne speech is scheduled for May 21.  
This is unfair and unacceptable. 
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Consultations are continuing and will continue as formal negotiations with victims and their representatives proceed.  
While this way of doing things carries many complexities, it has several advantages. 
This would undoubtedly enhance the perceived fairness of any settlement.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
We all have to be encouraged by that.  
There were consultations by the federal Minister of Health in all cases. 
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
It is an important debate and I thank the members for their support. 
There was no reason for it. 
Basically it was a position that no one could defend and certainly not the government. 
It came up with what I call an artificial date or box of convenience. 
It was based on when testing was available.  
That in itself was also a very shallow argument.  
The government's position is completely untenable. 
It leaves thousands of Canadians outside a compensation package.  
It is a shame. 
That was the strategy the government decided to pursue. 
The answer is no they cannot. 
Where will it leave the poorer provinces? 
What has changed in the equation? 
I do not think a heck of a lot has changed. 
I do not think that is right.  
We are going back to square one again. 
Some of the things he stated are pretty outrageous. 
I do not know how he can retract those words. 
I do not think that is healthy.  
I think their point of view has to be at the table.  
He routinely mentioned 60,000 victims.  
He is saying this for a reason. 
That has to be corrected. 
That is one of the reasons why the victims have to be there. 
I think they can talk intelligently about what those real numbers might be.  
We do not know. 
I think that is one of the things to be established from day one.  
We will continue our pressure on the government, particularly on the health minister. 
I hope these victims are compensated and the real story comes out.  
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the discussion about a date is causing some confusion. 
It is not an arbitrary date. 
It is not a whimsical date. 
It is a date everybody is looking at.  
It is important to understand that. 
Let him as well address some of the issues that flow from that.  
I think it is important to underscore that this is not an untenable position. 
It is a position that everyone has agreed has some basis in reason and rationality. 
Mr. Speaker, I cannot believe what I am hearing from this parliamentary secretary. 
Nothing is going to change.  
The only people who support that position are government members. 
On that, I rest my case.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a procedural question for the member for Charlotte. 
We give a recommendation and members will vote according to how they feel.  
I wonder how Conservative members will treat this non-partisan opposition motion today. 
Will they treat it the same way? 
Will they be voting freely without whip constraint? 
I hope members on the other side can do that. 
I know we certainly will.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
We hope today marks the turning point. 
Let us not drop the ball. 
We have had five weeks of emotional, difficult debate in the House. 
They are looking for compassion and justice. 
That was an important step. 
We took hope yesterday. 
Today we want to see that hope become a reality. 
We would like to see the government open the door a little further. 
Today the parliamentary secretary said a couple of very disturbing things. 
Yes, there were consultations earlier on. 
We have it in writing. 
We have documentation from the minister showing his concern and compassion. 
They need to be included. 
They want to be part of the discussions. 
We have before the House a very positive suggestion to do just that.  
Today let us not hurt those victims once again. 
For once in the House we have some solidarity. 
There is support from all quarters. 
We are working together to do the best thing, to do what is right. 
Let not the parliamentary secretary diminish those efforts. 
It is that federal regulatory body that failed. 
Let us today make the right decision. 
I understand my 10 minutes is about to lapse. 
Let it happen today.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member for her presentation on this issue. 
We have to put this together. 
The challenge for us now is how to creatively approach this issue.  
I have consulted with my constituents. 
Patients have called me. 
When we say all, we have to speak of all.  
We will have to approach this in a very creative, non-partisan and careful way.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments from my colleague, the member for Winnipeg North-St. 
We have presented today a resolution that is in the spirit of non-partisanship. 
That is the right thing to do.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is similar to that posed by my Conservative colleague. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
Mr. Speaker, I want to put all of this into context. 
Our position has always been clear on this. 
We will not change our position. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I am very honoured to rise to speak on our motion. 
We need people who will not sacrifice or compromise their values. 
That is the reason I chose to enter politics. 
The principle of economics is ruled by the head. 
It comes from the heart.  
We need not be concerned with the economics. 
We should now be looking at doing what is right. 
We are setting a stage that generations down the road will look back upon. 
Our motion calls for an invitation. 
We see it with respect to our aboriginal peoples. 
We see it so often in many aspects of our lives. 
Halifax West constituents care about this issue. 
Many of them have approached me and asked my stand on the issue. 
The first is how we approach question period. 
I have spoken about this matter before. 
We do not listen properly. 
We are constantly yelling while people are trying to talk and express their views. 
The Speaker says a prayer. 
We need to think in terms of the heart. 
The money element is not that terribly important. 
Armed with my rules and regulations I went out on my first case. 
I can't feed the children''.  
She took me to show me her cupboards and her cupboards were bare. 
Her refrigerator was bare. 
She wanted me to come and visit her. 
The money will take care of itself. 
We have to let the heart rule in this matter.  
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Yes, there is a federal regulator. 
That should be a priority.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his comments. 
I certainly wish to assure him that my remarks are more than rhetoric. 
My remarks come from the heart, as I am sure his do.  
It will involve all parties as well. 
I thank the hon. member for his comments. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
The provincial ministers in any case would want it that way. 
In that regard we are prepared to support the motion in question.  
He did a fantastic job.  
That consensus has been breached but not by the federal government. 
This is typical of the Reform Party members. 
The Canadian people do not believe a word of it.  
I do not deny that. 
Today that is no longer the issue before us. 
In one case, we know there is some deviation. 
It is our opinion that this would certainly serve a very useful purpose.  
When such a meeting is held should the Hepatitis C Society of Canada be invited? 
I have no way of prejudging the result. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
I think the government House leader has interpreted the motion correctly. 
He has done a superb job. 
I extend my congratulations to him as well.  
I think that is helpful. 
This will certainly assist the ministers of health.  
We have to recognize one thing, however, even on the passage of this motion. 
But it does not say that the premiers would agree to it. 
That is a different matter. 
They will have to answer for themselves in that regard.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
In fact, it was somewhat negative on this motion.  
He certainly did in the first one.  
Mr. Speaker, I had previously thought this was a serious issue. 
I hope other members consider it a serious issue. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
The federal government is the regulator of the blood system. 
This role has recently been confirmed and clarified by Justice Krever in his final report. 
There has been extensive consumer involvement in both processes. 
These consultations have been a source of many new ideas. 
As a government we will continue to do so in the interests of all Canadians.  
I want to speak about the New Zealand experience. 
While original the no fault scheme was relatively generous, in 1992 it was changed. 
This is not a large amount of money. 
We need to note that is certainly most important.  
Their input remains critical to the refinement of our policy. 
It will be an integral part of the process and I support that.  
As soon as we come to realize this we will all be better off.  
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
It is a letter from a victim's perspective. 
This gentleman lives in my riding. 
I met with him over the weekend. 
I have had conversations and correspondence with him before that. 
His name is Floyd Hubbard. 
He wrote the following to me on Saturday: 
I contracted hepatitis C through heart surgery in 1983. 
My enzymes went down, but I've never been so sick in my life. 
This is the medical treatment you (Liberals) say you'll help us get. 
Well I for one don't want it again. 
That is better than Interferon, the only treatment for Hep-C.  
He didn't think I was entitled to it. 
I had to beg. 
Do you know how this feels? 
Today it takes me hours to shower and dress. 
No wonder there's so many marriage breakdowns. 
I hardly ever see them. 
This is a disease of loneliness, shame and isolation.  
I had a good paying job, a 12-acre farm and a business. 
It's all gone as a result of this disease. 
What do I have left? 
They said ``Let us into the discussion. 
Let this not just be a deal that is struck by politicians. 
They said ``Give us a compensation package for all. 
If it is not for all then it should not be for any''.  
They said ``Compensation should be on the basis of wellness. 
It has become to many of them an abandoned boat void of government compassion. 
Let us not dwell on this rock of cruelty. 
In effect, Liberal members decided to hide behind a rock of silence. 
In closing, I will be voting in support of the NDP motion. 
In this regard my actions in the matter will speak far louder than words. 
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
A couple of comments made by the member opposite deserve some attention. 
The member would be well placed to recognize that. 
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
It is a position the government has been shamed into.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for the question. 
This is exactly why we wanted to open this question up at committee.  
He is the top regulator. 
The minister has to take responsibility for it. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
These arguments led to expanding the compensation package for victims of tainted blood. 
In our opinion the exercise of this leadership involves three things.  
Justice Krever said clearly that such tests were available. 
This too is a fallacious argument.  
The official opposition finds this argument both hypocritical and false.  
This is precisely what the federal government should do in this case. 
These people are persistent despite their illness and lack of resources.  
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
It was the government that resisted our inquiries.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Halton.  
This is I think one of the problems. 
All the social problems were known and I think it could have been handled.  
You get a different aspect and a different approach. 
Is it not better to handle it in that larger context?  
I think the answer to that is yes, it is better handled in that context. 
The health committee in this parliament is one of our best committees. 
They do their work, and why not in this particular context.  
It is generally assumed, by the way, that somebody is liable in this case. 
The basis for a proper solution is available within the existing governmental services.  
We can bring it to a solution in this particular way.  
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question from the hon. member. 
In that context, I believe the minister would be in agreement with him.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
He made some very thoughtful and insightful comments and observations.  
I wonder if he could answer this question. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for that very thoughtful question.  
The fear is there.  
We are getting into the area of human resources. 
Part of a comprehensive solution must involve the ministry of Human Resources Development. 
It must involve an expanded and an accelerated view of disability pensions. 
We need that sort of comprehensiveness. 
It is in the social security network. 
It may need extra shortfall funds in particular cases. 
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
There are some very good reasons for that. 
That message has got to be made very clearly. 
During the last five weeks there has been a disease in this House. 
It is a disease called political opportunism. 
That disease has some symptoms that are clear. 
The first one is selective memory loss. 
The second symptom is failure to recognize where responsibility really lies. 
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I think the hon. member is engaging in debate. 
I did not hear the hon. member make any reference to any particular party.  
My recollection is that he was referring to the debate in the House in general. 
I am sorry my hon. friend feels so sensitive about it.  
When you lie you really take offence to it.  
Mr. Speaker, I have been called worse by better.  
There were 13 provinces and territories involved in those decisions. 
I would be lost for words defending Rock too. 
I spoke about the reversal of policy. 
The Reform Party must bear the brunt of responsibility for its reversal of policy. 
I point out that the maintenance of the Canada pension plan- 
The hon. member should be careful if he is rising on a point of order. 
I think I heard words that were quite unparliamentary from him. 
Maybe he is raising a point of order about his own comments. 
I invite him to be very careful in his choice of language.  
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your warning and your advice. 
I am sorry, but I think the hon. member is engaging in debate. 
The hon. parliamentary secretary is stating his view. 
The Canada pension plan is there for those people. 
As modest as it is, it is there for those people at any age.  
Reformers wanted to do away with it.  
We will be voting for the NDP motion this afternoon. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
There was responsibility there.  
They are part of the answer and their unanimity is absolutely necessary.  
I share the feeling of concern for all victims. 
Quite frankly in this case there is no other choice.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
What about the other half? 
That has been the question in this House for the last two or three weeks. 
They should be ashamed of themselves.  
They came to an agreement and the minister defended that agreement.  
Mr. Speaker, I heard the speech from the member from the other side. 
He was talking about where the compassion was. 
He was asking a question of the official opposition during his speech. 
I would like to ask the hon. member- 
You are on debate.  
I am sorry, the time for questions and comments has expired. 
We are at the point of resuming debate.  
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
As long as you are not sharing your time with another member of your party.  
Mr. Speaker, I think it is time for a reality check. 
The member went on to refer to the health minister as his hero. 
I am sure he ought to be aware of the phrase worshipping false idols. 
He was accepting liability. 
That was the major thrust of his submissions in the House week after week. 
The member refers to a reversal of policy. 
We are still hearing this notion of culpability and fault. 
How can the government pretend to have any credibility whatsoever? 
They either believe it or they do not. 
In effect Premier Harris was saying that all victims ought to be compensated. 
Once again that argument has been totally abandoned. 
It seems that their credibility has been abandoned as well.  
There is no accountability. 
That dollar amount is on the table. 
That is the Canadian way. 
It is the right, just and compassionate thing to do. 
It is the right thing to do and the Canadian thing to do.  
Let us put the matter in context. 
I do not believe Canadians have yet to comprehend the magnitude of this tragedy. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for my hon. friend. 
They want to avoid the smell. 
They are trying to get away from it. 
A number of other concerns have been raised as a result of this issue. 
It ought not to have been a confidence vote. 
That is quite clear. 
The country is strong. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened with close attention to the hon. member's speech. 
There is one thing though that I would like to ask him about.  
The numbers may in fact be a lot lower. 
I was wondering whether the hon. member would care to comment on this point. 
It seems to me the government has not been forthright. 
We know that hepatitis C will affect people in different ways. 
We know a certain percentage will die. 
Others will lead relatively normal lives. 
Fatigue may set in, extreme fatigue.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
I think they have some positions which are completely untenable. 
He has stated that the file is closed. 
As it is almost 2 p.m. we will now proceed to Statements by Members.  
Mr. John Maloney (Erie-Lincoln, Lib.):
The public record will show that she was one of the best.  
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
They braved the enemy's sea 
To supply Allied war need.  
Cold lonely duty, constant targets of an unseen foe 
No buglers to hail the oncoming enemy blow.  
Simply, the sudden shudder of a ship as torpedoes explode 
Is the only notice of impending doom for the lucky.  
Lucky because being alive, there is still hope 
For others, the shudder ushers death.  
When the war did end, all were veterans but them.  
Fifty years have slipped by, yet they still question why 
They are not veterans in life, but will be in death.  
The world owes a great debt to Canada's Merchant Navy.  
Best we not forget.  
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
The efforts of these young players have brought them to an extraordinary victory.  
They all deserve our congratulations.  
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
This year's theme focuses on alternatives to incarceration. 
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
This stress takes many forms.  
Some are deeply in debt. 
All of them are stretched to the limit.  
The hon. member for Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford.  
Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
We must invest in our young people if our society is to prosper. 
The hon. member for Repentigny.  
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
They set an example for us all.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
There is certainly no disadvantage on the ice. 
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Both Erin and Marie are here with us today in the gallery. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
In 1953, the Liberal Prime Minister, Louis Saint-Laurent, tried to subsidize Canadian universities. 
The third try was by the current government. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
NAFTA poses a threat to our ability to stop this sale. 
THE LATE ROBERT DE COSTER 
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
We extend our condolences to his family, his relatives and his friends.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
What is the reason for this shoddy bookkeeping? 
To keep Canadians from seeing a surplus.  
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister is still a big part of a problem. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition talks about negligence. 
This is when you come to the conclusion that it started in 1986. 
Let us find out when the negligence occurred. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this sounds like some kind of courtroom argument. 
This is the way the government has taken this from day one.  
This question is not that tough for the Prime Minister. 
It is not tough at all. 
I think we will ask it until he answers it directly. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We said that when there is negligence there is responsibility. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
What did they do with it? 
They ignored the test.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is not sticking to his own position. 
What about victims before 1981? 
Is the hon. member suggesting a two tier system for victims?  
The member is caught in the falsity of his own arguments.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
When it comes to care, the provinces are on their own.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Saint-Maurice, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we will stick with the provinces. 
Did negligence start in 1986 or in 1981? 
What about the victims before that? 
That would be a third category.  
It is very important for the ministers to meet as soon as possible. 
It is exactly what happened with the accord we have- 
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
I wonder whose interest he was considering last week. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
They are very concerned about it.  
I ask the Prime Minister today, is this file closed or not?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Saint-Maurice, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have made a deal with the provincial governments. 
Last Friday they all said they were sticking to the deal.  
That is one provincial government that decided it would not respect the deal. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the provincial government in Ontario offered a couple hundred million dollars. 
I think that is pretty substantial.  
The health minister has said that abandoning victims was the right thing to do. 
He closed his mind, he closed his heart and the victims know it. 
They do not trust him.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The minister of health for Ontario did not want to do anything. 
Reform wants to cut all social programs but they are bleeding hearts on this one. 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the President of the Treasury Board.  
The hon. member for Mercier.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
What exactly does the Prime Minister believe in today?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The member should consult with his own leader. 
ASSISTANCE TO ICE STORM VICTIMS 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the finance minister. 
They pay 20% more in taxes. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
I ask the minister, and it is the same as my question before. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I just have. 
That is the kind of thing we are going to continue to do.  
ASSISTANCE TO ICE STORM VICTIMS 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT 
Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the finance minister is intentionally twisting our questions.  
When is this grossly unfair system of taxation going to change?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, let me try again.  
The minister is in charge of this nation's finances. 
Research shows that his tax policies are harmful to families. 
I will ask the question again. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The volume of residential building permits increased in March, up 12%. 
Are they not houses that are being built for families? 
Mortgage rates are down. 
Does that not benefit families? 
Everything this government does has benefited Canadian families. 
That is why there is so much optimism.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is also for the Minister of Finance. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I will take the minister up on his offer.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
I want to raise the issue of money with the minister. 
It was lowered to $88 million. 
Mr. David Iftody (Provencher, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
Rail line transportation remains an integral feature of agriculture in western Canada. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
The government is pleased to do its part in helping this along.  
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
Julie is a single working mother of two. 
Now she finds herself owing another $186 to Revenue Canada.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, in the last budget 400,000 Canadians were taken off the tax rolls. 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
We want to renew the entire youth justice system. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
In fact I would like- 
The hon. member for South Shore.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Thousands of families are waiting his reply.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We have done a lot of consultation through the Harrigan report. 
We have done evaluations of the TAGS program. 
Ms. Colleen Beaumier (Brampton West-Mississauga, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
I have written to the committee. 
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Trade.  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
We are doing everything we can in order to facilitate- 
The hon. member for Winnipeg-Transcona.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
We talked about the various options. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, a couple of new immigrants came to my office last week. 
They are highly respected physicians. 
My question is for the minister of immigration. 
Why is the government misleading immigrants? 
Why promise and not deliver?  
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
STANDING COMMITTEE ON HEALTH 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Standing Order 65 outlines the procedure for moving motions. 
Subsection 4(1) of the Official Languages Act reads as follows: 
On June 20, 1994 and November 7, 1996 the Speaker ruled: 
This committee is in breach of the standing orders and the law.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
The member complaining argued that this should not apply to motions. 
The Commissioner of Official Languages studied this case and concluded: 
joint chair referred only to the unilingual nature of the text submitted by the complainant.  
The Commissioner of Official Languages established members rights under the law. 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would simply like to make what I think is an important point.  
I think that there have traditionally been differences in the way the two are handled.  
That is his own very particular issue. 
One is regularly permitted in the House, and the other is not. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, just to clarify. 
I believe the House leader on the government side is correct.  
First, we are talking about motions, not briefs. 
Generally speaking, we would like the committees to solve their own problems.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
I did not hear the Right Hon. Prime Minister refer to a document.  
Mr. Speaker, then what did he quote from?  
I do not want to get into a debate.  
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
He made a statement which was in the course of debate. 
I do not know where he got the information, but there were no documents- 
He made it up.  
I did not say that. 
ALLOTTED DAY-HEPATITIS C 
The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the amendment.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
I know he was a member of the Liberal government at one point. 
He has a great insight into the dealings and happenings in caucus. 
This is information that is filtered out to the media and others.  
On that basis they voted with the government. 
Yesterday he declared, honest to God, the file is closed. 
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
This is why this motion is of the utmost importance. 
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Why is the Minister of Health agreeing to go to the meeting? 
Does he intend to go to the meeting with cap in hand?  
He put up, up to $200 million. 
We all know the reason the federal government agreed to pony up $800 million. 
They have said that a new development has occurred. 
If a broader consensus emerges, all the better for all of us.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
The government has said yes to those between 1986 and 1990. 
They had no option at all. 
They had to take what the government gave them.  
I pray that is going to be addressed. 
Mr. Speaker, I will repeat what I said before. 
The government is looking at this motion today in a very positive way. 
The future will tell.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
My remarks will address some of the concerns she raised.  
The headline is ``Why the hepatitis C decision is correct'': 
This part of the letter is especially important: 
Donated blood with the presence of antibody to hepatitis B core antigen was not used. 
Public policy must be based on sound underlying principles. 
After 1990 obviously it applied it.  
I suggest there may be a problem there.  
It is not compensation if there is no negligence. 
I note that the Leader of the Opposition did not suggest that. 
He has changed his tune.  
He has recognized that negligence is the only justifiable reason for compensation. 
Hospitals now have the occurrence of super bugs. 
We are in danger of setting a very dangerous precedent. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
The evidence is clear. 
However, there is considerable debate, as we see from the letter writer, whether an agency- 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The member is clearly misrepresenting what I had just said.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
There is no doubt that after 1986 we should have done it. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
It is clear the system failed as early as 1981. 
As soon as the mishap occurs a lawsuit occurs. 
We do not want that to happen in our system. 
After all, our system cannot be risk free. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
I maintain that is a step in a positive direction.  
Thanks to the Canadian people, the file is not closed. 
That is a good thing.  
That should be done for a number of reasons. 
First of all the Canadian people have asked that we do it. 
They have shown compassion. 
There are past precedents for doing this.  
I say that for a couple of reasons.  
What is it today? 
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
It appears that the Liberal government will be supporting the motion. 
What mathematical calculation was used? 
How was $1.1 billion arrived at? 
Indeed that money will now have to be increased to compensate all victims.  
I also want to comment on the first part of what the member said. 
I am pleased the House is going to support the motion today. 
Let us have those hearings in public. 
There is no reason the hearings cannot be televised. 
Just as important, the Canadian people could see the response of their governments. 
Let us have a transparent process. 
I would certainly favour any motion anyone puts to that effect in the House.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the answer is yes. 
The buck stops where the buck stops. 
According to the law in this country it stops with the federal regulators. 
I think the member for Winnipeg North Centre has summed it up very well.  
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Obviously we are talking about the Liberals. 
They refuse to accept that they have a responsibility. 
Yet clearly they do. 
For their benefit, I am going to read the motion: 
Why are we introducing this motion today? 
Because the initial agreement satisfied no one. 
They had lost their hearts and were not looking beyond their billfolds. 
That is the problem in this country at the moment. 
We are in opposition and we are doing the best we can. 
We have not done too badly in the past month, either. 
These same people support the government one vote at a time. 
It is sad to see 16 or 17 year olds with such an attitude.  
What is even sadder is that they are right to think this way. 
It is, in large part, the one at fault. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The parliamentary secretary indicated that consultations have taken place. 
This is the first I am hearing about it. 
On that basis at this moment I am not prepared to give my consent.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
I am thinking of health and education, among others.  
Is it a problem for her province's health system?  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question.  
It is just not going to happen. 
That is why the responsibility must lie with the federal government. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for her comments. 
Mr. Speaker, I will repeat what I said. 
I have no doubt. 
I know what kind of situation we are living in. 
It is not a nice scenario. 
I do not see any improvement until at least the next provincial election.  
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
There is a huge discrepancy in terms of the actual numbers of victims. 
We do not know on what basis that formula was arrived at. 
It tends to boast every day about how well- 
We know he is the one running the show in this country. 
There is money on the table from some provinces, at least one province. 
Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
However this single example is not one which can really be compared to our own. 
Ireland created a social program. 
How else do we compare ourselves to Ireland? 
Does it have the same democratic structure? 
The answer is a definite no.  
When do we copy other countries' policies? 
Among these countries nobody has followed Ireland's approach, nobody.  
Let us look at Italy which has only given some very limited help to hemophiliacs. 
It has excluded everybody else. 
That is really where it ends. 
What has Russia done? 
Nothing that we know of. 
What has the United Kingdom done? 
The same goes for France, Japan and Germany. 
Germany is conducting all legal claims through the court system.  
We did so because that fits our rationale. 
Is that a purely legalistic approach? 
Has anybody else in the G-8 done this? 
Let us go beyond those nations for the moment. 
Is this an example we really want to follow?  
People with hepatitis C are now left out of that system. 
They are suing their government. 
We should not be copying New Zealand. 
We should be learning from its experience.  
Finally, there is Australia. 
Australia has settled its litigation out of court. 
We do not know exactly what has happened because there the agreement is secret. 
This does sound awfully familiar.  
It hedged its bets. 
Its rationale was purely legal. 
It suited its particular circumstances.  
We have gone beyond that. 
No other comparable country has included so many people as this country has. 
No other country has been as responsible as we have. 
It is not a blind follower.  
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, it does not matter what Canada has done. 
Even though we are a leader it still is not enough.  
There has been a need to reduce transfer payments. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
There is no real opportunity. 
They will jump and dance to his tune. 
I would like the hon. member to respond to that.  
It is frequently a difficult and onerous task to decision make. 
It falls upon the shoulders of government to do so. 
Many times we have to make decisions that are difficult to make.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Thomas is an editorial writer, an opinion writer for the Star . 
I worked across the hall from him when I was at Queen's Park.  
I want to share some thoughts. 
I think this is really the debate that has to happen. 
That does not necessarily mean that we would simply support that. 
It should be a public debate, no question. 
The member for York-South Weston says we should have it with the public. 
This motion by the NDP is a good motion and. 
They would be witnesses. 
That would be interesting if we had impartial witnesses at the last round of negotiations. 
We would know what the minister of health, the Hon. Elizabeth Witmer, said. 
I have great respect for her. 
I worked closely with her in the Ontario legislature. 
I got to know Elizabeth and I have great respect for her.  
If it was on television, all the better. 
We would know what was being said. 
What do we have here? 
That was his response.  
What do members think Reform Party members would offer in terms of compensation? 
Imagine their bleeding hearts? 
That is exactly what they would say. 
It would be nothing. 
The hypocrisy that we have seen over this issue has no bounds. 
It is absolutely astounding.  
We hear from members opposite that we should listen to the people. 
I have talked to residents. 
I have had a couple of calls. 
Kyle had a fever. 
He was very uncomfortable. 
If we want a universal health care system, let me tell members what would happen. 
They ordered a helicopter to take him to the sick children's hospital. 
Twenty-four hours later Kyle Martin was dead.  
I talked to his father. 
Here is the message to the Martin family. 
I do not know who is going to pay for that. 
I do not know how we are going to fund it and make it sustainable.  
Let me say that to the member for York South-Weston. 
I support the Minister of Health in this. 
Who was he representing? 
The reality is he was just propping up his Minister of Health.  
It was not compensation based on compassion. 
He rises in this place and challenges everyone in the House to a debate. 
We do not need lectures from that member. 
How long would he be kept on the ice? 
How long would he even be allowed to sit on the bench? 
He would be booted off and told to go have a nice day.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
The Liberals say we have the best health care system in the world. 
Who are they kidding when they dare to compare it to Russia? 
What type of comparison is that? 
The difference is we have not had an economic and political meltdown. 
We have a budget surplus. 
These are things Russia could only dream of in decades.  
Mr. Speaker, as usual the Reform Party is about one speaker too late. 
That is a party that is misleading the Canadian people on this issue and many- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Not in this case.  
I was asked to go to Romania as well. 
Canada is known to be the best country in the world in which to live. 
The opportunists are over there on the government side.  
None of us is perfect. 
The Liberals have made a mistake. 
The Minister of Health has made a mistake.  
I want to thank the province of Ontario very much for taking the leadership role. 
I give credit also to Mr. Johnson in Quebec. 
They should have been at the table the first round. 
That is where they should have been. 
We would not be having this kind of debate.  
You will recall, Mr. Speaker, the minister did say ``This file is closed. 
We're not going to do another thing''.  
He is not opening the door all the way. 
I cannot believe it. 
The Liberals are still saying the same thing.  
The government does not know how many.  
People had to take whatever was given to them. 
Therefore the government does have a responsibility and a big one.  
I do not sit in this seat and try to be an opportunist. 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
It is not fair to anybody involved. 
I am sure the member agrees with that.  
However, he and I were not in that room. 
We did not hear what the Minister of Health put on the table. 
That is how I see the minister.  
As far as I am concerned, it was wrong. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
However, they chose to ignore that. 
Yes, Mr. Speaker, I agree with the hon. member. 
Certainly it is politics. 
Talk about calling us opportunists. 
I would have to say the opportunists sit on the government side.  
It really bothers me. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
The issue facing us is one of fairness and equality. 
They come to us from all walks of life. 
We have heard excuses. 
Those individuals do not matter to this government. 
The government's position is an excuse and that is all it is. 
I would suggest that probably is not the complete truth. 
The minister also stood here and said that it would bankrupt the health care system. 
It is about compassion. 
It is about fairness.  
That is not negotiation, that is bullying. 
It was bullying on behalf of the federal government because of money. 
Make no mistake about that.  
Then there is the other excuse. 
A precedent has already been set. 
Those are the excuses. 
There are class action suits which are filed now by a number of organizations. 
It is a legally compelling argument. 
It is not going to happen. 
We know full well that the class action suit is going to be successful. 
We know that it is financially sound. 
Then there was the Pearson airport fiasco. 
But that was politics, that was okay. 
This is total transparent politically. 
We have a government that bullied the provinces into making a negotiated settlement. 
Premier Filmon walks tall. 
They stood up and said that they were going to do it anyway. 
Even the majority of backbenchers on the government side want that fair package.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
That fact cannot be escaped from.  
Paul took up this issue as early as in 1990. 
He has succeeded certainly to a great extent. 
The ministers of health from across the country will be meeting. 
Let us give them an opportunity to discuss the new plan. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of the member from Winnipeg. 
It is not the responsibility of the provinces. 
Do not hide behind the provinces.  
If it is wrong, the government should live up to that responsibility.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I just received an interesting letter. 
It is dated today and is from the premier of Ontario. 
I would like to paraphrase a couple of the comments.  
The premier says ``I urge the federal government to make the same commitment''. 
The letter is addressed to the Prime Minister of Canada. 
It is a very interesting and provocative letter. 
This is only fair and compassionate. 
I just hope that the Prime Minister will listen.  
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
It is working well because what happened in terms of the province of Ontario.  
I have been having a number of meetings with them. 
We actually observed what was happening. 
I believe that is happening.  
When one votes on a matter of confidence, one votes confidence in one's government. 
I do not believe for a moment that compassion is the only necessary motivation. 
I support this motion.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The next question is on the main motion as amended. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I declare the motion, as amended, carried.

I declare the motion carried. 
(Bill read the second time and referred to a committee) 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS AND NORTHERN DEVELOPMENT 
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP) moved: 
We want the government to listen to what students are saying. 
The number of bankrupt graduates is now estimated to be 37,000. 
As we can see the facts present a very different kind of reality.  
The implications of this are staggering.  
It means that students are forced to contend with very unreasonable rates. 
The bottom line is that the banks are unaccountable to the public. 
When students are faced with this they have nowhere to turn.  
For various circumstances, she had to go on social assistance. 
That is what it means when we have turned the power over to the banks.  
The issue of privatization goes even further. 
It is not just Canada student loans. 
Post-secondary education is a right that has to be accessible to all Canadians.  
This is completely the wrong kind of approach. 
We are seeing the eligibility criteria change and student debt continuing to rise. 
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and Youth), Lib.):
Debate on the hon. member's motion is timely. 
The response is entitled ``Ensuring Opportunities:
Access to Post-Secondary Education''. 
It is a comprehensive document. 
The standing committee's report provided the government with very helpful advice. 
We are now in the process of working on their implementation.  
The discussions surrounding harmonization are continuing to progress. 
In fact, I will deliver one to her.  
This will enable some 50,000 more borrowers to become eligible for the program.  
Beginning in 1999 interest relief will become graduated.  
It is very comprehensive, very accessible and very flexible. 
It also has a high mobility factor. 
Students will be able to study almost anywhere in Canada. 
This is not necessarily the case now. 
We are now providing a Canada education savings grant. 
What we are proposing is a program to deal with the real world. 
In some way they have reached those people who are most in need.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Let us address this motion section by section.  
First, the motion is calling for us to reverse the privatization of Canada student loans.  
In the period 1990-91, 25.78% of student loans had default problems. 
In 1993-94, 29.79% of student loans had default problems. 
There is a combination of problems. 
That was the estimate, but the government exceeded that. 
That is just for one year.  
We are talking about some pretty substantial assets. 
In order for the banks to pick up this responsibility they wanted a 5% premium.  
It was projected that the premium would be $16 million. 
That is based on approximately $700 million that was given out in student loans.  
That is one of the problems associated with post-secondary education in this country.  
Another problem underpins everything. 
I remember a party either in the 1993 or the 1997 election. 
They had debt, debt, debt. 
As a result we have all sorts of massive default, default, default. 
There is a serious problem on our hands.  
That is the real problem. 
There has not been a delivery on the jobs front. 
That is why they are having problems.  
When everything is taken in, students are not paying that much. 
The problem is that there are no jobs for them.  
The Liberals say they are going to promise jobs and it does not happen. 
The NDP says we should have the government look after student loans. 
Unfortunately the government has an abysmal record on student loans. 
Students are therefore left between a rock and a hard place. 
And there comes the Reform Party.  
Education is a big priority for all of them.  
If students find work when they graduate, they repay the student loan. 
This is better than what we have right now. 
Right now it is a simple on and off switch. 
They do not pay any of it. 
That addresses two of the big problems.  
I would like to address the lack of spending priorities. 
You will have to help me out again, Mr. Speaker. 
There was a party which campaigned in 1993 and in 1997. 
I remember who it was. 
In education alone it was $1.5 billion. 
What about the money we spend on foreign aid? 
Are students not more important? 
What about subsidies to profitable corporations, the CBC? 
I could go on, Mr. Speaker, you know I could.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
In my opinion, we are hearing a real heartfelt cry. 
Why is this so? 
The decision was made to create a system of scholarships. 
A choice was made. 
However, Quebec came up with a different model. 
It will be administered, not by government, but by a private foundation. 
The hon. member does, I must admit, show good intentions. 
There is no question of Quebec accepting any national educational standards. 
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support the motion. 
We do not know whom they will be. 
It will not be administered by the government. 
We will not have any say in it. 
The Canada student loans have been privatized. 
Where the government has moved out, the banks have moved in. 
They are not accountable to the public. 
They do not have to report to us. 
They will never be able to afford it on a minimum wage job.  
How do banks treat students who have incurred this debt? 
One missed payment equals a default.  
He has phoned every day. 
He does not even have a bed. 
He sleeps on a foamy.  
He is afraid to answer his phone. 
He pulled himself through that. 
In 1995 the Liberals gave the banks responsibility for the loans. 
Where they used to be fully guaranteed by the government they no longer are. 
The last budget provides a clause giving banks more power to refuse student loans. 
This clause goes on outside the scrutiny of the House of Commons. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Today's development gives us all a second chance. 
There is no doubt we have been through five very hard weeks. 
What is clear is that this deal has not withstood the test of time. 
It is not in the tradition of how we solve problems. 
We know what will not work. 
That is clear now. 
Third, we must go to the table with additional funds and not empty pockets. 
That should be clear more than ever today.  
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
She wants to extend it. 
We already know what has happened to the Red Cross. 
It exists no more. 
It suffered for its responsibility. 
I think for that he should be complimented.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I want to pick up where my counterpart from the NDP left off. 
That is the point I am going to make tonight.  
That is a flawed position simply because it leaves people outside the package. 
The question then becomes what happens if someone was infected on December 31, 1985. 
They would be left out. 
That is absolutely wrong. 
There is no logic to it.  
The government is telling us that a test did not exist. 
In other words, the government could not possibly pay for this many people.  
The point is the government can afford to compensate all victims.  
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
MULTINATIONAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mega corporations did not elect this government, people did. 
The MAI would tie the hands of our own government. 
Fortunately many political leaders are now showing common sense.  
Our Liberal government still seems to be deep in the pockets of large corporations. 
I ask the government which choice it will make. 
Let us ensure that the government does not wake it up.  
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
It comes off a draft on the Internet last May. 
That is the basic reason. 
No one has taken us over. 
Canada is the master of its own house. 
A multilateral agreement on investment will simply enhance that in years to come.  
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre-Rosedale, Lib.):
I think it behoves us as members to look at it seriously. 
We discussed this and heard issues.  
However they must be looked at in a certain light. 
It must be guaranteed that we protect our culture. 
That makes a lot of sense. 
What did the minister do? 
The minister is to be congratulated. 
This was not for us to ratify after. 
We know now from the newspaper reports what has taken place at those meetings.  
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
They will resume at that time and Canada will continue to make vigorous representations.  
BC MINE IN BLACK LAKE 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
Now it is one minute to midnight. 
Is it because the asbestos mines are located exclusively in Quebec? 
The time for diplomacy is past. 
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to respond to my colleague's intervention. 
The hon. member raised the point that active measures were not being used. 
Active measures are working. 
(The House adjourned at 7.37 p.m.)
