The Hon. the Speaker :
He is majoring in psychology.  
On behalf of all senators and the Senate, I bid you welcome.  
Response to Newspaper Article on Senator's Residency Qualifications 
I would like to make some points with respect to this matter: 
This is not true. 
I never spoke with legal staff five years ago about this. 
I never had any problem about residency.  
Senator Lucier has underlined the word "says."  
I wonder if Jack Aubry is questioning the fact that I have cancer. 
4. I would like to have these points clarified but not in the media. 
I truly appreciate all the support I have received from my colleagues regarding this subject.

Committee Authorized to Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
Hon. John B. Stewart :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, there are two points:
Watch out for the pepper spray!  
By way of recapitulation, this issue is important for all honourable senators. 
Senator Stewart has explained to us that that is the main concern. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
It depends upon the answer.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, we must make an effort to allow committees to sit. 
They do invite witnesses, many of whom come from out of town. 
We inconvenience them if we are not able to hear from them.  
They have tried to make their speeches on either Tuesdays or Thursdays. 
Senators on the other side have attempted to do the same thing. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
That worked for a while. 
That is an improper practice.  
However, we need that assurance first.  
We did sit yesterday, which was a Monday. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
He just felt it was not necessary.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Conduct of Business-Notice of Inquiry 
Hon. William M. Kelly :
Honourable senators, I give notice: 
Reduction in Transfer Payments to Province of Quebec-Request for Particulars 
However, the figures indicate otherwise.  
Yet, the government claimed yesterday that it was implementing a stable transfer system. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
New Brunswick will lose $11 million. 
Atlantic Canada's loss is their gain.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I thank the honourable Senator DeWare for doing the mathematics for me. 
I shall certainly bring those very legitimate concerns to the attention of the responsible minister.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I do not know the positions of the individual provinces. 
The meetings of officials have proceeded for several days. 
I thank the Leader of the Government for his answer. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I do not believe a final agreement has been reached on that. 
And I stress this last part: 
...given current commitments to action.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
It provides very important data. 
I am glad to hear that.  
Where does the Canadian delegation stand with respect to this concept?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government):
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
I would first like to know what conditions the Prime Minister was referring to?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The will of Quebecers to leave must be clearly expressed. 
In addition, of course, any process that would lead to secession must respect the law.  
What does the law say on secession?  
The Prime Minister has said he was prepared to negotiate. 
This is what we have always said.  
Bear in mind that this minister is a separatist. 
I repeat what he said: 
This is what we have always said.  
Mr. Chretien has acknowledged that the federal government would negotiate. 
I am sure the Prime Minister would take all of that into consideration.  
Not that I am aware, honourable senators. 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :

Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I am not sure what is the present position. 
The answer, honourable senators, is that they have been consulting with the fishing industry. 
I believe the position of the industry is exactly as suggested by my honourable friend. 
That is something else that I will have clarified for him.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The matter of the helicopters is under active consideration by the government.  
Cabinet met last Thursday. 
Cabinet will meet again, then. 
I am pleased to hear that.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Where are the other six? 
Are they on ships at sea? 
We have 30 in the inventory.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the answer is yes, there are 30 helicopters in the inventory. 
As I indicated yesterday, 24 were cleared, and six remain to be inspected. 
They will be inspected by December 18.  
I will bring forward an answer for my honourable friend.  
Were we criticized for not being able to live up to our obligations?  
Not to my knowledge. 
It is my understanding that those helicopters are at sea on exercises. 
As to precisely where they are, on whatever ocean, I cannot positively say. 
It might be a military secret, as a matter of fact.  
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson :
I will come back to this again tomorrow and the next day.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
No, not that I am aware, but it is an interesting question. 
I will bring forth an answer.  
Delayed Answers to Oral Questions 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
(Response to question raised by Hon. Donald H. Oliver on November 25, 1997) 
For a pension fund, long-term investment performance is paramount.

The Hon. the Speaker :
Canada Pension Plan Investment Board Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Now, we must complete that work and pass the bill by Christmas. 
I do not think that we are handmaidens. 
We do not have to take orders. 
We must do what is right.  
They will have some reduced benefits and some increased costs. 
I will tell you for whom this is important. 
I have a daughter who is 24 and a son who is 21. 
Many of you have children and grandchildren. 
As inflation eats away at it and the numbers rise, that number remains the same. 
It stays the same. 
Elect the Liberals and it will be high!  
If we elect the Liberals, inflation will be high? 
We already know that! 
Let me continue in that vein. 
I do not get it. 
I will try to explain it today, and - I hope I can convince you.  
The CPP is part of a larger program that Paul Martin is introducing. 
We strongly believe that this measure is a payroll tax and a job killer. 
Yesterday, Senator Kirby said it was not a payroll tax. 
Honourable senators, there are elements of truth in all things nefarious. 
That is why we call it propaganda. 
They made only token consultations. 
It is not a question of means justifying the end. 
In this bill, the means and the end are equally wrong.  
It is becoming a habit; a habit that is hard to break.  
He has followed three policy themes to accomplish that end.  
The government transferred debt.  
It should not be for the directors to agree or disagree. 
On this record, it will fail.  
It then writes cheques for something else. 
Look through the bill. 
It is simply paying more money for less benefits. 
Anyone can do that. 
We must remember that the author of Bill C-2 is Paul Martin. 
Paul Martin is a real smart guy. 
He later apologized to the Canadian people for misinforming them.  
Now, $900 million later, we have no helicopters that fly safely. 
He penned the Red Book to renegotiate the free trade agreement. 
He took all the kudos after the 1993 election.  
I have heard of no agreement. 
No one here has heard of an agreement. 
Let us give Canadians a Christmas present by defeating this bill. 
Let us kill the bill.  
We are well aware of the Liberal record. 
I outlined the government's record on making promises. 
We know its record on responsibility. 
I can just see it. 
When this bill is in shambles, Paul Martin will be 95. 
Jean Chretien will be 95 or 96 or 102.  
They will still be in power.  
He will not take responsibilities. 
I don't know who, but I'm not responsible."  
They did not take any responsibility after cancelling the EH-101 contract. 
They are still talking about it in cabinet. 
"Trust us," they say. 
They entered into a social contract with their citizens. 
It was they who did it. 
"We will take your money and provide you with a pension," they said. 
We have had the audacity to reach 50!  
They limited their breeding. 
People were, shall I say, "fuddling". 
It was not their fault; it was the fault of scientists. 
The cause, they say, was social behaviour. 
That is what caused the end of this pension plan. 
It is one other social plan gone astray. 
The good old days are gone.  
We have another problem. 
Again, science has interfered with a social plan. 
It was the perfect pension plan:
From the beginning, the CPP was simple, but it was misnamed. 
It was misnamed because it is also a life insurance program. 
However, it is a silly program when it is part of a pension plan.  
It is also a disability program. 
I want to give senators an historical perspective. 
There have been many amendments made over the years to the CPP. 
Yet, the government has said, "We will not touch that fund." 
However, they touched the other fund. 
Since 1973, they have been making new legislation and implementing new programs. 
We saw this stuff today when we were studying the Estimates. 
The government has said that we did it, as Tories. 
Retirement and earnings tests for individuals were eliminated in 1974. 
There were not as many old people. 
There was a great number of working people, and lots of cash. 
They said, "We can throw it around." 
Now, if you have more than four kids, that is fine, too. 
The cash was there, so they used that cash.  
Legislation was enacted for spousal credits. 
When people get divorced, they have to keep up with the times. 
They can split the benefits. 
That was not done before. 
At the inception of this program, that was not allowed.  
It costs more money. 
I am not saying that is bad. 
It takes strength and intelligence.  
Meaning we are not intelligent?  
Not as much as the women are.  
Then the benefits were extended. 
I know what that means. 
That is fine, if the government wants to do that. 
That costs more money. 
Well, two guys who live together for one year may not be gay. 
How would you know?  
You want surveillance cameras?  
So there is an opportunity for fraud. 
This is not a pension program. 
Let us make that clear. 
It is not legislators' fault. 
Are you quoting the Reform Party?  
These are the other guys in the other place. 
He was speaking of Martin and Pettigrew.  
There is the big change from the last election.  
...an expanded RRSP program; and tax relief to seniors. 
I think I have explained some of the ideas we got from the government side. 
Now they want a smaller CPP.  
However, Preston Manning could never explain the first program. 
Well, they could not get it together. 
I can see why.  
They are making false accusations in the House about people. 
It is the typical Reform program we have come to expect. 
Remember, they have a tax plan with a flat tax. 
With the flat tax, you reduce the amount of exemptions. 
We are not getting any ideas from them.  
Now I will turn to the Liberals.  
This is a government program they do not want to advertise. 
That is not true.  
That is why they have an agreement today. 
We tried to get it done in 1986.  
You could not do it.  
Because the Liberals would not agree. 
I will defend my government, and my honourable friend will defend his.  
You are reading from the wrong script.  
It is obvious that my honourable friend does not have any notes.  
I think I am getting to honourable senators opposite.  
Honourable senators, we will not need to pay the price. 
What is in it for you? 
What is in it for the Minister of Finance? 
How do we know they are right? 
Why not take more time, honourable senators?  
Having listened to you, we know they are right.  
Why not take the time - 
I would like to look at other aspects of the problem.  
Honourable senators, the government is proposing to amend the CPP. 
I will address these shortly.  
This strikes me as an important question. 
The government's response to this fundamental question is obligatory collectivization. 
Here we have a classic case of public mismanagement. 
And now they have learned nothing from this sad tale:
However, how can the performance of a monopoly be assessed? 
There is a long list of horror stories involving monopolies. 
You may tell me that such things also happen in the private sector. 
I am referring to the Investment Board.  
Do you realize how much power these people will have? 
Three billion dollars is $3,000 million. 
Theoretically, this is $600 million a day. 
Do you think that the heavy machinery required for these operations will be efficient? 
Private enterprise is aware of that. 
It seems only the government is not.  
I will return to this shortly.  
My fourth point concerns investment policy. 
Canada's economy represents about 2.5 per cent of the world economy. 
We have seen this in Quebec. 
The matter of the pension plan's objectives is basic. 
In this respect, the legislation must be clear. 
It was not Mr. Caouette's money, it was real bucks. 
Can you imagine what kind of arm-twisting this will lead to? 
To collectivize an operation is to politicize it. 
Contributions will increase by 70 per cent within five to seven years. 
Is it a good thing to increase the role of the state? 
This is what is being done here. 
Who can possibly think that it makes sense?  
What happened in the past? 
I simply note that this is the way things have been done for 40 years.  
Look at the performance of crown corporations. 
In other words, good management started once the government was no longer involved.  
We must be careful before transferring money from the private to the public sector.  
Let us now look at the impact of the plan on jobs.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Your 15 minutes are up. 
Is leave granted to continue, honourable senators?  
I would like an answer to this good question.  
Another question concerns the interprovincial competition that can be expected. 
They will borrow, but at a higher rate. 
Now, how are these 800 to be selected and monitored? 
There is likely to be arbitrariness and patronage.  
In addition, the Board will be everywhere and inevitably set conditions. 
This concentration of power, this centralization will be unhealthy. 
This technocracy and its perverse effects make me nervous. 
The regulations governing investments and the behaviour of administrators have not been revealed. 
They are not ready. 
What guidelines will there be for administrators? 
A parliamentary review is therefore vital before their implementation.  
Here is an intelligent response to the challenge before us. 
Hon. Philippe Deane Gigantes :
You talk with admiration of private investment management. 
It may not be a big deal for you, but it is for small investors.  
Some damage is done every day. 
But it is the private sector. 
Bills at second reading are always good measures. 
I saw more than my share in 40 years. 
Ministers come up with their legislation and they promise miracles. 
The minister's comments do not have nearly the same impact after three years.  
No one is forced to invest in Royal Trust.  
The public is made up of individuals. 
These individuals are private persons. 
It is a matter of choice. 
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
He brings that experience to this forum.  
Therefore, I will ask Senator Bolduc.  
This involves a question that I asked Senator Kirby yesterday. 
It is a question of accountability. 
Yet we are placing it in the hands of 12 people.  
Honourable senators, that is a very good question. 
There is one thing in the bill that is very acceptable. 
The Auditor General will be able to look at the management of the Investment Board.  
As a result, there will be some accountability in the form of an audit. 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Honourable senators, I have a brief question for Senator Bolduc. 
This is a serious matter.  
Honourable senators, I do not question the issue of accountability. 
When you talk about "accountability," I would suggest that that is second best. 
It is better than nothing but, in my opinion, it is second best.  
Hon. Michael A. Meighen :
Honourable senators, this is precisely where I wanted clarification. 
You mentioned decentralizing the decision-making process, did you not? 
There is no doubt that it could be more difficult for some provinces. 
They were informed; and they could understand the information they were being given.  
Investors are getting good returns.  
Two lessons are to be learned from that. 
That is a travesty. 
That, to me, is not responsible government whatsoever. 
For example, on October 1, Senator Michael Meighen asked the following: 
My question relates to employment insurance premiums. 
He went on further to state: 
On October 23, I asked the following: 
It will have a multiplier effect. 
You have bought off the seniors, and you are hitting the kids. 
They will not forget that.  
On October 30, Senator Tkachuk asked the following: 
In other words, it is and will be perceived as another tax.  
On November 5, Senator Oliver said: 
In effect, that will keep things in relative control.  
As others have said before me, people are living longer. 
On November 6, Senator Oliver asked: 
How many Canadians must pay the price for the planned increase in premiums?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I would like to finish my speech, if I may.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted for Honourable Senator Stratton to continue?  
On November 18, Senator Oliver said: 
When that many Canadians are unaware of what is happening, we have a severe problem.  
On November 20, I said: 
I will quote Senator Meighen, who said: 
It has been 51 days!  
On November 25, I said the following: 
To quote from their paper: 
Was the government listening when I asked that question? 
Senator Graham said, "Of course, yes." 
As we know, no amendments were passed.  
Seniors, as a whole, do not know about these changes. 
To that inquiry, Senator Graham replied, "Yes." 
He said that that was the communication plan on the part of the government.  
This concerns employment insurance and the reserve. 
I then went on to say: 
Provincial finance ministers met in Ottawa. 
I think last night they had dinner with Finance Minister Paul Martin. 
In an article in The Globe and Mail yesterday, it was stated: 
I predict that that is about to happen.  
Hon. Thelma J. Chalifoux :
What is the honourable senator's opinion on that?  
Even in terms of communications, there is very little. 
I did not agree with the Canada Pension Plan. 
They have to travel 240 kilometres to the closest bank. 
Many do not speak English. 
What would you do in this case for these people who have nothing?  
I thank the honourable senator for her question. 
I am asking you.  
You cannot do that immediately. 
One needs only consider the situation of Chile. 
That was the government's way of dealing with it in Chile. 
The only way to communicate is eyeball to eyeball. 
You have to get out and talk to people in their backyards. 
We are not in power now. 
You should push your people.  
On motion of Senator Gigantes, debate adjourned.  
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
When shall this bill be read the second time?  
Hon. Orville H. Phillips :
Honourable senators, I rise to speak in support of Senator Cools's amendment. 
We should be mindful of these growing questions and concerns.  
I commend Senator Cools for bringing this amendment forward at this time. 
The police followed a truck to Mr. Feeney's residence. 
They said the door was open and they entered. 
There they found Mr. Feeney asleep. 
He still had blood on his face and on his shirt. 
They arrested Mr. Feeney under a warrantless arrest.  
It is my interpretation that they still possess that authority. 
It is not enshrined in the Criminal Code. 
It is one of those principles that came into our law from the British system. 
As Senator Cools pointed out, no statute was broken. 
Honourable senators, the Supreme Court ignored the rights of Mr. Boyle. 
They felt the police action had no bearing or outcome on the decision. 
However, there again, that is merely my interpretation.  
I emphasize again that Mr. Boyle had the right to his life. 
That is their function, and Parliament has referred it to them. 
However, the enactment of laws remains the function of Parliament. 
Parliament is the highest court in the land and that must always be so. 
Many aspects of her amendment are worthwhile considering. 
However, I feel she has omitted to take into consideration one aspect of our legislation.  
That is why we have Royal Assent. 
Motion in Sub-Amendment 
Hon. Orville H. Phillips :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I have a problem. 
Offhand, I do not know if you can amend a reasoned amendment. 
I must look at the precedents. 
Debate adjourned to await the ruling of the Speaker. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
No announcements were made that hearings were being held, contrary to what is usually done. 
The list of witnesses changed almost from hour to hour. 
As a result, it tended to stray from the substance of the reference before it. 
Indeed, section 29 could not be clearer. 
It reads as follows: 
Provincial legislation to establish linguistic schools is already being put into effect. 
These can be established without amending section 93. 
The Parti Quebecois, in opposition, voted against it at the time. 
Franco-Protestants and English Catholics were particularly concerned. 
It is headed: "Confessional Schools and Services." 
I will read the two pertinent paragraphs. 
One usually speaks of going to a French or an English school. 
We have in Quebec two classes of English-speaking Quebecers.  
Quebec has been repeatedly criticized for this discrimination, and rightly so. 
It is a sentiment which is certainly not shared by members of the Quebec government. 
They must not be treated lightly, particularly as they affect minorities. 
This opinion was written and delivered following the hearings of the joint committee. 
It is very pertinent that we are all aware of them.  
- which is the Quebec Education Act passed in June - 
- upholds the principle of freedom of choice in schooling. 
Given their authorship, I think we have to reflect seriously on these thoughts.  
He is as well placed as anyone to reply to concerns expressed here and elsewhere. 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Honourable senators, education is everyone's business. 
First, a brief word about committees and their work. 
I prefer Senate committees.  
Senate committees are less partisan, more thorough and more careful. 
This made our task doubly difficult.  
We must view the evidence before committees with care. 
The federal resolution differs substantially from the Quebec resolutions. 
They are both appended to the report for your consideration.  
The Government of Quebec knew this. 
We in Parliament knew this. 
This is now clear and unequivocal.  
That is a misnomer.  
In essence, section 93 is a series of privileges rather than full rights. 
Clearly, this is not the case here. 
Even here, we had difficulty in definition. 
Notwithstanding that, we still treated that majority as if it were a minority.  
I will not go into that aspect of this debate. 
The evidence we heard was extensive, definitive and clear. 
I hear Senator Wood. 
I will deal with her concerns in a moment.  
I believe no viewpoint was excluded from our deliberations.  
The committee made a thorough investigation of that evidence. 
Let me for a moment repeat what we heard. 
There was some dissent. 
There is no question at all that some in those groups feel detrimentally affected.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I regret to interrupt but the allotted 15 minutes has expired. 
Is leave granted for Senator Grafstein to continue?  
They are not without some type of relief and I will address that later.  
However, this is an issue of linguistic rights. 
We gave that up in 1982.  
Senator Pitfield knows this well. 
He was an architect of the Constitution Act, 1982. 
Who put it in?  
We said so in the report.  
This left two groups, small but important, who claim to be detrimentally affected. 
These are the two groups to which Senator Bolduc referred.  
There were certain spokespersons representing these groups. 
The Catholics were represented by English-speaking priests.  
Again, in Senator Bolduc's thoughtful speech, he refers to these groups. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I regret to interrupt once again. 
The clock now says six o'clock.  
There is agreement that we will not see the clock, Your Honour.  
Having said that, their rights are of concern.  
Access to public funding in Quebec for denominational education remains available in Quebec. 
Since we are projecting the future, that is my prediction for the future.  
We did not deny them an opportunity to be heard. 
I want to read those letters into the record because they are important.  
A different situation exists in Quebec. 
Nevertheless, our assembly did not oppose the choice to amend section 93. 
They did not oppose.  
This does not mean that this exercise was one of perfection. 
I share, with Senator Pitfield and others, concern in that respect. 
However, that is history. 
Senator Pitfield was there. 
They talked about pluralism - for the very first time. 
Honourable senators, I fully support the report and the federal resolution. 
Hon. Therese Lavoie-Roux :
Honourable senators, I would refer my colleague to the transcript. 
The transcript will speak for itself.  
He and I have a different viewpoint on section 23(1)( a ) of the Charter.  
Honourable senators, I have a question for the honourable senator.  
I do not agree with the concept of my honourable friend's consensus. 
They appeared before the committee. 
This is one of the largest groups in Quebec. 
Again, honourable senators, this is a question of evidence. 
I refer all senators to the transcript.  
We had Catholic school boards and Catholic teachers. 
Yes, the resolution is imperfect. 
We had to bend imperfect tools to see whether they fit our minimum requirements. 
There was a caveat there that my honourable friend forgot to read.  
Actually, reform is well under way in Quebec. 
The new system, it seems, will be in place for the next school year. 
New linguistic boards will be set up. 
I do not see any.  
Honourable senators, there is constitutional law. 
Quebec wants to proceed by the rule of law. 
That is not my question.  
They want to be under the law, as does the Province of Newfoundland. 
They want to be under the Constitution. 
My question has nothing to do with that answer. 
It was renewed in 1982 and given protection from the Charter. 
The two resolutions are completely different in content and intent.  
There will be elections to the boards in June. 
Again, honourable senators, there are two solitudes here. 
I believe that education, in pith and substance, is a provincial matter.  
That is not the question.  
That is what the Constitution says.  
I do not disagree.  
That is what section 93 says.  
No, section 93 does not say that.  
I respect the Constitution.  
Honourable senators, this is a lawful request done in a lawful way. 
That was admitted in front of the committee.  
They want to erase religious instruction from the school system, which is imposed on them. 
That is the reason. 
Do we want to be party to that?  
That is what we are being asked to do.  
I do not know. 
However, I will not argue that point.  
Honourable senators, I am trying to follow practice and procedure in the Senate. 
I am addressing the report of the special joint committee. 
For me, the question is elucidation for honourable senators to consider that report. 
To me, the evidence and the outcome are clear. 
That is what I have said in my speech. 
Honourable senators, I have listened to your arguments attentively. 
You have argued your case like good lawyers. 
There is no doubt about that. 
You say it is a provincial problem. 
There are two parts to my honourable friend's question.  
Fat chance when it comes to education! 
In that respect, I support the report and the resolution.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted, on division.  
AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF CANADA 
Paragraphs (1) to (4) of section 93 do not apply to Quebec." 
2. This Amendment may be cited as the Constitution Amendment (year of proclamation) (Quebec).  
Briefly put, I support this resolution. 
As the witness said, there would be a superimposition of organizational structures. 
The same thing would happen in Quebec City. 
Clearly, what was - and still is - at issue is the legitimacy of the amendment.  
Honourable senators, I strongly urge you to support this resolution. 
What is the connection between the two?  
Let me give you my version of the facts. 
They would really appreciate having some time to implement these changes.  
On motion of Senator Kinsella, for Senator Simard, debate adjourned.  
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration

Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :

Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?
