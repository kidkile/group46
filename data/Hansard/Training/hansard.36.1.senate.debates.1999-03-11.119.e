The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
More than 1,000 people will be participating. 
This is a first for Canada. 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
We do not realize the magnitude of our dependency on computer technology. 
Take the food production industry, for example. 
What should we be doing as senators? 
The Hon. the Speaker :
They are here as guests of our Senate Banking Committee.  
I bid you both welcome to the Senate.  
Access to Information Act

Thursday, March 11, 1999 
The Hon. the Speaker :

The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is it agreed?

The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act 
Bill to Amend-First Reading 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Canada-Europe Parliamentary Association 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Energy, the Environment and Natural Resources 
Notice of Motion to Authorize Committee to Extend Date of Final Report 
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Tuesday, March 16, I shall move: 
Human Rights in Tibet 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Tuesday next, March 16, 1999, I will move: 
Justice Reform and Violence Against Women 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Hon. W. David Angus :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Presumed Transgression of International Rules of Protocol-Government Position 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Which international rules did the French minister break?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, Canada's reaction was entirely appropriate, given the circumstances. 
Jurisdiction of Quebec on Matters Relating to French Culture-Government Position 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
No, absolutely not, honourable senators. 
Debate on Cultural Plurality and Diversity-Government Position 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
I presume it was read by the Government of Canada. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I am not aware of the specific details on that particular point.  
Hon. Jean-Claude Rivest :
This has been done in total harmony for years.  
Honourable senators, we are talking here about process. 
Again, you must draw the line sometime, somewhere. 
You must bring this matter to the attention of those who are most concerned. 
Incompatibility does not enter into it. 
This is a decision that was made by the Government of Canada. 
Hon. Pierre De Bane :
He implied that only two prime ministers used them.  
I thank the Honourable SenatorDe Bane for reminding us of those important historic facts.  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
One thing cannot be changed. 
This is a country that recognizes a striking difference. 
It will be increasingly noticed and noticeable.  
Mr. Minister, you are a member of cabinet. 
Would you tell them there to ask their advisors to calm down? 
Did that person explain the situation in Corsica to you? 
Like it or not, his is a democratic government. 
In Corsica, there are revolutionaries, people operating outside the law. 
It might be acceptable to compare them to the FLQ.  
My colleague Senator Rivest referred to this a few minutes ago. 
I trust that you will not use that comparison again.  
That reference did not come from any briefing notes or any other such source. 
In the province of Quebec, the most francophone of provinces, the word "approve" is used.  
It reminds me of the stamp we see on pieces of meat, "Canada Approved." 
The word "approve" is one which should be disposed of in these relationships.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
Does the minister have a response as to the status of those windows?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The chapel at Shannon Park is closed six days per week. 
The chapel at Cornwallis is open seven days per week. 
All of the arguments used by the Chaplain General do not stand up. 
I should like the minister from Nova Scotia to support us on this project.  
Senator Comeau suggests that the chapel at Cornwallis is open seven days per week. 
The decision to keep the windows in Halifax was made by the Chaplain General. 
I would be happy to bring these new revelations to the attention of my colleague.  
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
In fact, they went as far as asking them to resign.  
It is more serious than the drought years. 
Income levels have fallen by some 70 per cent.  
They are upset with the program and the way in which it will be administered. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I thank the Honourable Senator Gustafson for bringing this matter to our attention. 
The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate that the following communication had been received: 
Secretary to the Governor General 
Privileges, Standing Rules and Orders 
Consideration of Ninth Report of Committee-Debate Adjourned 
I am particularly pleased and proud to see this project finally come to fruition. 
I am also sure that they will become dedicated members of the committees.  
I strongly believe that we will all benefit from their presence. 
I emphasize the word "regular." 
What is so hard to understand about this?  
I believe Senator Robertson's memory is failing her. 
Furthermore, I have considerable difficulty understanding Senator Robertson's reaction. 
My question is: "Little time for what?"  
How has this harmed her?  
Talk about the path of least resistance!  
Honourable senators, such behaviour could be detrimental to the Senate's reputation. 
It should no longer pass without comment, nor should it be tolerated.  
That independent senators present a request to the selection committee; 
That an independent senator cannot sit on more than two committees; 
That only one independent senator be allowed on any given committee; and 
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson :
Honourable senators, after those superfluous remarks, I move the adjournment of the debate.  
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
I understand that under the Constitution we are all appointed as senators. 
It refers to senators appointed as independent senators. 
They choose to remain designated as independent or named as independent senators.  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
I am quite sure both sides are anxious to see this situation resolved.  
On motion of Senator Robertson, debate adjourned.  
Statement of Minister of Finance-Inquiry-Debate Continued 
Hon. Norman K. Atkins :
However, it would not be responsible for me just to criticize. 
We must offer alternatives in addition to demonstrating where the government has gone wrong.  
What all of this obscures is what budgets should be about. 
On this later point, I find agreement with the minister. 
In fact, few Canadians are better off today than they were before budget day.  
Honourable senators, we cannot devalue our way to prosperity. 
Canadians at all wage levels have been paying more and getting less. 
We cannot forget that economic activity is not an end in itself. 
It is a means to an end. 
We are failing to attract foreign investment into our economy. 
At this rate, our standard of living will take 231 years to double. 
Compared with the major and fast growing, smaller OECD countries, - 
- such countries as France, Australia, Ireland and Norway - 
We cannot allow this to occur. 
How can we become more productive? 
Policies must be directed at these problems.  
The rate of domestic investment has fallen well below that of other industrial economies. 
Fiscal responsibility also must address the national debt. 
These targets must be worked out with care. 
The tax income bracket should be fully indexed. 
The other Senate member who will be on this task force is Senator Lavoie-Roux.  
Let us look at health care for a moment. 
This was to be the health care budget. 
Yes, the government is putting money into health care. 
This government continues to fail in the areas of leadership and vision.  
Health care sources must be integrated. 
Our resources must not be working in isolation, one from the other.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Are you requesting leave to continue?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
There are three problems before us: 
First, there are the high dropout rates. 
I should like to spend a few moments now addressing the problem of accessibility. 
Some students are graduating with crippling debt loads. 
Solving it will require imagination and, perhaps, a review of history.  
This was a massive investment by the government in the future of this country. 
Again, these are the types of problems which require vision and imagination to deal with. 
What has this government done? 
Honourable senators, this is a cruel joke being played on the military by this government. 
What about developing a program for reserve units that really works?  
There is also no mention of equipment in this budget. 
This area is completely ignored in the budget. 
It lacks vision and imagination. 
On motion of Senator Graham, debate adjourned.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The government has carefully considered Mr. Hughes' recommendation.  
On February 23, 1999, the government announced the criteria for the funding arrangement. 
Second, it is up to the complainants to select the team of lawyers.  
Fifth, the government will pay for reasonable disbursements.  
Commissioner Hughes endorsed this arrangement. 
The complainants want state funding to bring this application in the Federal Court. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it agreeable, honourable senators, that this correspondence be tabled?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
It was moved by Senator Carney, seconded by Senator Bolduc: 
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Multilateral Agreement on Investment 
Hon. J. Trevor Eyton :
Senator Spivak raised a number of interesting points in her remarks. 
I shall now give a little background. 
At present there are some 1,600 bilateral agreements linking OECD nations. 
This includes Canada, which has agreements with 24 countries. 
To this end, the MAI reflects three central elements. 
First, it lowers barriers to foreign investment. 
Lastly, it provides a binding dispute settlement process for settling problems.  
Clearly this is not so.  
Old ways and practices have fallen by the wayside. 
People are uncertain where it is all leading. 
They feel insecure and resistant to even more change. 
Obviously, the MAI is not perfect. 
There are bound to be differences in the ways in which language is interpreted. 
This means we must invest. 
We need to encourage others to invest here. 
Foreign investment is crucial to our national well-being. 
In fact, it creates one-tenth of all the jobs in this country.  
Honourable senators, by all means, let us be part of a new and satisfactory MAI. 
Hon. John B. Stewart :
Perhaps I should ask them seriatim.  
The first question relates to foreign investment coming into Canada. 
Thank you for the question. 
My next question is perhaps under the heading of a rich seam of anxiety. 
A fishing person or a company gets a quota. 
They are not even crew members on the boats. 
This is a real concern, not just a hypothetical one that I am conjuring up.  
Has the senator had an opportunity to look at that specific problem?  
The future is always hypothetical.  
You can do it all, but you are simply not allowed to discriminate.  
I am certainly not an expert in that area.  
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
Perhaps the honourable senator would entertain another question. 
Would the MAI not open the doors for that to continue? 
Will we have little banana wars going on all over?  
It is not especially our concern. 
In fact, the U.S. has gone outside that body. 
I think it is an improvement. 
I do not say it is a perfect world, but it is an improvement.  
It is almost a constitutional concern. 
In our case, we have the cultural exemption in NAFTA. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Election of Canada to United Nations Security Council 
Honourable Senator Graham, P.C. ) 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, this is an important inquiry raised by the Honourable Senator Roche. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein rose pursuant to notice of March 9, 1999: 
A civil society does not grow without constant cross-pollination and constant nurturing care. 
The OSCE structure is light. 
Let us hope that its reach does not exceed its grasp. 
This challenge will test the OSCE as no other action. 
Another new task has been assigned today to the KVM. 
I quote from the press today, which states: 
Honourable senators, read the papers. 
For Kosovo, as of today, no such settlement is in sight.  
The dangers are real, present and apparent. 
Of the 1,125 assigned, Canada has contributed 131 experts. 
It is my understanding that this could be expanded to include an additional 45. 
Included in the Canadian personnel are police, communications and legal specialists.  
Kosovo, however, is the mythic heartland of so-called "Greater Serbia." 
This verification mission is little known and little understood. 
The word "Balkans" comes from the Turkish word for mountains. 
More over, the word "Balkans" has become a miserable metaphor for the 20th Century. 
To Balkanize means to boil away problems to their sizzling, volatile and simple essence. 
I welcome other senators who wish to participate in this inquiry. 
This is the second opportunity the Senate has had to debate Kosovo. 
I agree this is a volatile and dangerous situation. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Your Honour, I seek leave to continue.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
It is my understanding that all of these are volunteers. 
They have full knowledge of the danger and are going to Kosovo as citizen volunteers. 
All of them are volunteers.  
On motion of Senator Roche, debate adjourned.  
Hon. John B. Stewart :
With the deletion of those two paragraphs, I move the motion standing in my name.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Canada and the Nuclear Challenge 
Hon. Douglas Roche , pursuant to notice of March 3, 1999, moved: 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I rise on a point of order. 
That is my first concern.  
That seems to be the principle. 
I am not sure whether that principle applies also to reports. 
I think we need some clarification on this matter.  
As Odgers says, it is, indeed, of considerable significance.  
It is like another piece of literature. 
The models of communication traditionally are by message. 
However, I do wish some thought and reflection be given to that point.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, we are dealing with two issues in this particular motion by Senator Roche. 
Obviously His Honour must rule as to whether this particular motion is in order. 
Then we could deal with it. 
That, of course, would be up to Senator Roche.  
Honourable senators, I wish to thank Senator Kinsella and Senator Carstairs for their comments. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I regret that I must interrupt the honourable senator. 
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
I wish to contribute to the point of order at some point.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Are you suspending the sitting?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
That is fine with me but we can continue with this afterwards.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Senate will now adjourn during pleasure to await the arrival of His Excellency.  
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.  
The House of Commons withdrew.  
The Right Honourable the Deputy Governor General was pleased to retire.  
The sitting of the Senate was resumed.  
Canada and the Nuclear Challenge 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
That is not the problem. 
I am quite sure that is so, except for maybe some oddball. 
That is not really the question at hand. 
The question is the relationship between the two Houses. 
There are ways of doing things.  
I have yet to understand why, in this instance, we were not invited. 
We exist for a reason. 
I have a problem with the wording of his motion. 
This is a place of discussion, a place of debate.  
That is the only point I wanted to make today.  
Hon. John B. Stewart :
It seems to me that the point of order relates to procedure. 
What debars us from so doing? 
Perhaps there are precedents, but I do not remember them.  
This is not a bill for which there is a legislative process. 
That is a substantive point.  
To my knowledge, there is no good reason why we cannot.  
Honourable senators, I am encouraged by the comments of Senators Kinsella, Carstairs, Corbin and Stewart. 
I will take it right off the Order Paper.  
I do not want to impose my views on anyone. 
The Government of Canada is seized of this issue. 
Honourable senators, I am in a dilemma, which I will express this way. 
I will instantly follow your ruling. 
However, I do not have the wording of that amendment written down. 
In the next paragraph, the active verb is that we "support" this report. 
These are the words contained in the motion.  
I wish to underscore that.  
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Honourable senators, I read briefly and quickly the report of the other standing committee. 
I think we met the day before. 
I have taken both cognizance of it and have read it cursorily. 
I stand to be corrected. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
I opposed it with you.  
Senator Prud'homme adds his name in support.  
I would like to be enamoured by the report. 
It was not unanimous.  
Based on the evidence I heard yesterday, I am not convinced. 
Based on my cursory reading of the report, I remain unconvinced. 
I do not know where we go from here.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, we are getting into the substance of the question. 
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
I think that as long as a report is filed, its source does not matter.  
The honourable senator might want to file the report and it could then be debated. 
When a report is filed, it can be debated. 
I rise on a matter of clarification, but one which I consider fundamental. 
It has never arrived before us in a proper way for our consideration. 
That is the fundamental argument being made here this afternoon. 
We all wish it were before us formally.  
Senator Stewart has said that this is not a bill. 
Reports, invitations and messages of various kinds are communicated. 
Nothing prevents us from doing that. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, we could debate this issue ad nauseam . 
Senator Kinsella raised a point of order. 
I will sum up my thinking on the matter. 
I would dearly love to have this debate.  
The distinguished chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee has made a very wise suggestion.  
I am aware of Senator Roche's motivation. 
That should be satisfactory to Senator Corbin, who has some good points. 
After all, I am certain Senator Roche will agree with that. 
On this point I agree with Senator Corbin. 
We must address the question of Senator Kinsella.  
I wish to first express my gratitude to Senator Stewart. 
What he has offered us is a sound way out.  
I am willing to do that, period. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
That is my first point.  
The minority is protected by the rules. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Do I understand, Honourable Senator Kinsella, that you are not withdrawing your point of order?  
I should like to have a determination by the Speaker. 
The matter is sufficiently important. 
Based upon what I have understood from my colleagues opposite, several concur with this stance.  
Honourable senators, Senator Kinsella has raised a very good point. 
I call on my honourable friend and colleague to accept. 
I do not know if Senator Kinsella would be happy with that.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
He has raised a point of order, and you need to rule on it. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Leave having been given to revert to Notices of Government Motions: 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, March 16, 1999, at 2 p.m.
