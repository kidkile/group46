The Hon. the Speaker :
When shall this report be taken into consideration? 
Legal and Constitutional Affairs 
Notice of Motion to Authorize Committee to Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Tuesday next, December 9, 1997, I will move: 
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Tuesday next, December 9, 1997, I will move: 
2. the mechanisms of implementing such new structural relationships and; 
That the committee present its report no later than November 30, 1999. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, certainly not to my knowledge.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I am not aware that a second tender will be called. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
So much for how long is "soon."  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I understand that a lot of background work has already been done.  
The remaining six will be checked between now and December 18.  
Honourable senators, I have a final supplementary question. 
Honourable senators, I am not an expert on these things. 
One would have to rely upon the advice that one receives from those responsible. 
The government had done that, and now they have backed away from it.  
Recent Remarks of Prime Minister-Government Position 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Jean-Claude Rivest :
That is my question. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Is it legal to separate by popular vote?  
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
Did I hear that correctly?  
Community Services for Offenders-Eligibility of Non-Violent Criminals-Request for Clarification 
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I shall seek that answer. 
Honourable senators, my supplementary question concerns technological crime. 
For example, credit card fraud costs $80 million annually. 
There are other types of non-violent crimes, such as hate crimes. 
I cannot see them helping at community centres. 
I would not want to attempt to answer today because any answer would be inadequate. 
However, I shall seek further information from the minister responsible.  
Hon. Jean-Maurice Simard :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
Their decision confirmed the approval of the National Energy Board. 
They will be in court tomorrow. 
We know that this project is not supported by everyone in New Brunswick.  
Are these rumours true? 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I do not know about any postponement. 
Both parties will be seeking a stay. 
We will await the outcome of that hearing.  
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
What is your question, Senator Buchanan?  
I will come to it momentarily.  
What is the question?  
That is to say, they could have filed their proposal much earlier than they did?  
Honourable senators, I wish to thank the honourable senator for his comment.  
Hon. Jean-Maurice Simard :
Honourable senators, I have a supplementary question. 
Will he consider it?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
It has made a ruling on the proposal formally before it.  
Senator Buchanan is quite right in the chronology of events as he outlined them. 
In other words, tune in tomorrow!  
Canada-United States Relations 
Hon. Norman K. Atkins :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Clearly, this government has lost control of the situation. 
This situation puts Canadians at risk.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Many of those bonds have been posted by church groups. 
Appropriation Bill No. 2, 1997-98 
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.  
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.  
Canada Pension Plan Investment Board Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
It consists of three pillars. 
In 1966, there were eight working-age people in Canada for every retired person. 
That is almost one-third longer than when the CPP began. 
Today, there are about 3.7 million Canadian seniors. 
Clearly, such an increase is not acceptable. 
The government listens, it discusses, and then it proposes action. 
I shall comment on each of those three points in turn.  
The third pillar involves changes to benefits and their administration. 
No one group has been singled out or forced to shoulder a hardship.  
In fact, CPP contributions are not taxes at all. 
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
Honourable senators, I have a question for Senator Kirby. 
Were they consulted in any way, shape or form? 
They used a 1-800 number.  
In his second question the honourable senator asked who was consulted. 
I was not part of the consultation process in 1996. 
However, I would be happy to obtain a list of the meetings and the witnesses. 
I do know it was an extensive consultation process. 
It was a detailed, national, consensus-seeking exercise. 
I shall be happy to try to obtain them.  
Who will bear the brunt of these pensions? 
I am concerned when the government says there is balance. 
There is no balance. 
This is a sizeable increase in donations to our pension plan.  
My next question relates to the fund management committee. 
Honourable senators, there were two separate questions.  
Therefore, we both have some responsibility for dealing with it. 
I would be happy to undertake a discussion of that issue with the government. 
However, I have no difficulty with the nature of the question.  
They will bear the brunt of it. 
Someone has to pay it. 
If they are the ones working, they will be the ones paying it.  
In fact, that problem is here today. 
It is a problem caused by governments of both parties. 
I happen to agree with the senator. 
I am totally sympathetic to that argument.  
Frankly, the problem should have been dealt with years ago.  
I will be happy to check on that. 
I would be happy to confirm that.  
Your understanding is that the preferential rate continues for three years. 
I believe I am right, but I may not be. 
I will check on it, and get back to you.  
Hon. Norman K. Atkins :
Honourable senators, my honourable friend referred to an actuarial analysis over a 50-year period. 
Does he seriously have confidence in that analysis? 
How confident is my honourable friend that these numbers will reflect reality?  
Therefore, I have more confidence in it than the forecast made in 1966. 
Do I think it is 100 per cent fool-proof? 
There is no question about that. 
Those people are already living, so the forecast becomes easier. 
On motion of Senator Tkachuk, debate adjourned.  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Motion in Amendment-Debate Continued 
Senator Cools made an amendment, and the amendment was ruled in order. 
I wish to speak against this amendment.  
The identity of this individual must be known. 
These circumstances are defined as follows: 
But neither did it reject this potential exception.  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Senator Beaudoin is not speaking to the question before us.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable Senators Cools, I am sorry, but the Honourable Senator Beaudoin has the floor.  
Yes, but I have risen on a point of order. 
I have been listening to Senator Beaudoin. 
If I am wrong, I will be happy to be told that I am wrong. 
The question which is before us is the reasoned amendment. 
Honourable senators, the amendment was deemed admissible. 
This bill must be reviewed in committee.  
Basically, we all know you are a lawyer. 
You should know that simple declarations and conclusions are insufficient. 
What we need is your reasoning.  
Parliament loses no power. 
It can introduce Bill C-16. 
It could have introduced another bill, but it put that one forward. 
Your amendment suggests that the entire matter be stayed for six months. 
Whether you like it or not, it is an excellent system.  
Honourable senators, could I pose a question? 
Senator Beaudoin has told us "it is so clear and obvious." 
Perhaps he could tell us why it is so clear and obvious.  
It is section 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982. 
The Constitution is the supreme law of the land. 
It has been that way for centuries. 
The Constitution includes the division of powers and the Charter of Rights. 
You may like it or dislike it, but it is there.  
Your thesis is that the Supreme Court is dictating to Parliament what to do. 
This is totally wrong. 
They are not doing that. 
On the contrary, the Supreme Court says to Parliament, "Go ahead, legislate. 
We give you six months, or seven months." 
In what way is the court invading our powers? 
They are invading nothing.  
Honourable senators, may I ask a question of Senator Beaudoin? 
The Constitution includes the Charter of Rights. 
Who may declare a statute invalid? 
The Supreme Court of Canada.  
I may lecture for a few hours, but I cannot change that. 
It is a beautiful system. 
The Supreme Court is the final interpreter of the Constitution. 
This does not mean that we are not supreme in our sphere. 
We are, subject to the Charter; subject to the division of powers.  
They have the right to do that. 
We live in a constitutional democracy.  
It is obvious that we will never agree.  
I am not seeking - 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I rise on a point of order. 
The powers of the Supreme Court of Canada have no constitutional existence.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Senator Cools, what is your point of order?  
Read them and see.  
Read section 41 of the Constitution Act, 1982. 
The Supreme Court is there.  
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
Does he intend to continue that speech now? 
Of course, if I may. 
This Parliament, in its sphere, is supreme.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I am sorry, but the allotted time has expired.  
Could I be allowed one additional minute?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Is this balance reasonable?  
In the matter of the exigent circumstances, the majority has specifically refused to decide. 
Here too, we may deduce that the question remains open. 
I consider this restriction reasonable and justified. 
On motion of Senator Phillips, debate adjourned.  
Income Tax Conventions Implementation Act, 1997 
In the past, Canada has negotiated tax treaties with more than 70 countries. 
Preventing double taxation helps facilitate investment. 
In essence, that is why this legislation is important.  
Thus paying taxes twice is avoided.  
This change will be retroactive to January 1, 1996.  
I will outline these concerns for you. 
This issue has raised concern. 
However, apparently they would incur this same increase if they were American citizens. 
Once again, this issue will be considered in committee tomorrow.  
Honourable senators, Canada is an is outward looking country. 
As it is, taxes are already far too high in this country. 
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Hon. Therese Lavoie-Roux :
Let me say from the outset that it was not a partisan issue. 
The bill before us is complex. 
As mentioned, such a change has been considered for many years. 
Very few steps have been taken since 1976 to implement the new system. 
Ethnic and religious pluralism has become evident, especially in large urban centres. 
I realized that some fundamental principles were at stake.  
There are approximately 23 such schools in Quebec that receive substantial funding from the government. 
They were given half a school. 
What, therefore, was the rush?  
The burden of proof, however, lies with those requesting the amendment.  
There was a genuine consensus with a few exceptions.  
Mr. Ryan said his proposal was feasible then. 
Things are complicated, but that report does not reflect Mr. Ryan's proposal.  
I spoke to Mr. Ryan about this. 
He said his proposal was highly feasible. 
Perhaps some of you received a letter from their president, Patrick Daly. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted to continue, honourable senators?  
Thank you for your understanding.  
Thank you, Your Honour. 
This is quite a complex issue.  
The consensus was clearly to proceed with linguistic boards. 
The question we cannot answer is, at what price? 
What about English education? 
Of course, in the resolution they presented, they indicated that they would assure English education. 
Only time will bring answers to these questions.  
I said, "Oh, good. 
What are you intending to laicize next?" 
They said, "The Constitution, because it starts with a reference to God."  
The very wording of the resolution passed by the Quebec National Assembly acknowledges this. 
As a matter of fact, the staff now is doing a good job of it. 
Consider the sign law, and how difficult they are being about that. 
Evidently, the two governments were focusing clearly on the political stakes. 
What about the protection of minorities? 
Are these only minor issues? 
This report must faithfully reflect what we have heard. 
Frankly, I do not know where those people were!  
I did not say that there were none for or none against. 
I do not want to reopen the debate. 
They were asking for comments on the report of the committee.  
I am not saying that the entire report is wrong. 
I was stuck with correcting the report. 
I did not have time to write a minority report.  
The decision on this vote remains a very difficult one. 
Hon. John B. Stewart :
Honourable senators, I should like to ask the honourable senator a question.  
If I can answer it, certainly.  
Honourable senators, I am no constitutionalist. 
This section also gave protection to religion and, by ricochet, to languages. 
That is the way I interpret the section.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted? 
It is not within the rules.  
Quebec had a majority of Catholics, and that is still the case. 
Catholic and Protestant denominational rights are protected. 
This was the idea of Cartier, Macdonald and Galt, in particular. 
Section 93 refers only to denominational rights, not linguistic rights. 
Some groups exercised that right. 
It is a very complex situation.  
The situation has changed to a certain extent, but denominational rights are still present. 
There are two theses. 
The thesis of the honourable senator is clear-cut. 
There is no doubt about that. 
Because they have other plans.  
No. Catholic denominational rights are protected entirely in Montreal and Quebec City. 
It is quite different.  
The system may vary from one province to another. 
I know that New Brunswick has a different system.  
The Supreme Court used that term. 
That is the only section in the Constitution of that nature. 
My honourable friend talks about the situation outside Quebec City and Montreal. 
He says that the situation there was mixed. 
It is true that Quebec has a Catholic majority. 
I know what the honourable senator means:
I think that was the reason.  
The clergy was very strong at that time. 
Historically, it is well founded that the clergy was in favour of Confederation. 
That is exactly their reasoning.  
People ask why it was necessary to protect a majority against a majority. 
In some provinces, there were no such denominational rights. 
In Quebec and Ontario, denominational rights existed. 
For 130 years, this has been the way in Quebec. 
This seems to be very imaginative constitutional interpretation, Senator Beaudoin.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Do not forget, Senator Stewart, that I will vote for the resolution.  
I have a question.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, obviously the Senate is the master of its own rules. 
Honourable senators, this is proof that this debate is very complex. 
We could then explore the issue more thoroughly than we have.  
Honourable senators, I have a question. 
Do we have time?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
What is the honourable senator's opinion?  
That is a good question.  
This question was raised on a couple of occasions by some English-speaking people. 
You are right, honourable senator. 
And, as I mentioned earlier, the anglophone community is shrinking.  
We know that English rights will be plundered in this debate.  
I could not convince Minister Dion to give us an extra two weeks. 
It is a bit difficult.  
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Honourable senators, the senator raised an issue of the evidence with respect to the committee. 
I was a member of that committee. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is it agreed?  
We then asked questions about it, and so on.  
The honourable senator has indicated to the Senate that they were opposed. 
Please explain the difference.  
Honourable senators, I did not say they approved. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I regret that I must interrupt at this point.  
Honourable senators, I have a final comment.  
Hon. Orville H. Phillips :
Because there was consent.  
They should be treated in the same way.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Leave was not requested in the case of the Honourable Senator Cools. 
The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate that the following communication had been received: 
Secretary to the Governor General 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Bill to Amend-Report of CommitteeAdopted 
The bill was reported with one amendment. 
Senator Watt raised a number of important issues related to aboriginal people.

Business of the Senate 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, we are getting very close to the time of Royal Assent. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is that agreed, honourable senators?  
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.  
May it please Your Honour: 
To which bill I humbly request Your Honour's assent.  
The House of Commons withdrew.  
The Honourable the Deputy Governor General was pleased to retire.  
The sitting of the Senate was resumed.  
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
