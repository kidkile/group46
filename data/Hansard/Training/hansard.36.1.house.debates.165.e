The House met at 10 a.m. 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Gar Knutson (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
HONG KONG VETERAN PRISONER COMPENSATION ACT 
This bill is to set right a gross wrong that occurred many years ago. 
It is long overdue. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
It concerns the family. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin-Middlesex-London, Lib.):
Mr. Gar Knutson (Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister):
Mr. Speaker, I suggest that all questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, it is always a pleasure to rise in this place.  
It is dated December 2: 
These texts are also available in French.  
I think that everyone in this place would agree.  
You quite properly appealed to members at that time to respect this House. 
This is where they should be made''.  
It is very similar. 
This is a ministerial announcement. 
The place for this to have been made is here in this Chamber. 
I would suggest there is not a member here who would disagree with that. 
Are we not members of this place? 
Do we not deserve that respect? 
This is an abrogation of ministerial responsibility. 
The public works minister seems to think this place is a museum. 
He calls this place a heritage asset. 
Surely that cannot be the case. 
I am appealing to you on this matter. 
This is not the first time this has happened. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
He asked that such an advisory board be established. 
That advisory board was suggested many years before. 
We are not dealing with a $100 million expenditure. 
Not all of that money has been spent, but the projects have been approved.  
However, the minister should have made the announcement here in this House. 
In fact, you expressed yourself to that effect and I commend you for doing that.  
There was a similar case with the Canadian Wheat Board. 
I raise these issues because there is a pattern developing.  
That is the issue that I wish to address.  
The sole source contracts that were addressed by the auditor general is another issue. 
I think we are getting away from the question of privilege. 
He should have said that in this House. 
That is my point.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
I would reinforce that general point.  
Frankly sometimes we do not seem to know ourselves. 
We should not have had to find out about this by reading the papers.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Standing Order 33(1) states: 
In addition, we have before us today the following proposition raised by a Reform MP. 
That is exactly what he did.  
There are approximately 200 pages to the auditor general's report.  
I hope that you wait, Mr. Speaker, until tomorrow to render a decision. 
That is what I submit to Your Honour. 
I want to hear information on this question of privilege specifically. 
I do not want members to get into a debate. 
The hon. government House leader will probably summarize for us quite soon.  
Mr. Speaker, let me summarize. 
It undermined everyone here and no one is raising anything about that matter today. 
I will hear one final intervention on the question of privilege.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I just have a couple of comments. 
There is nothing inappropriate about bringing it forward now. 
Who is looking after it on behalf of members of parliament? 
Perhaps there should be an oversight committee of parliamentarians.  
It is not just one incident in and of itself. 
It is kind of like language in question period. 
It is a concern because of a trend, not just the one isolated incident.  
A case was brought up by the hon. member before. 
CANADA CUSTOMS AND REVENUE AGENCY 
BILL C-43-TIME ALLOCATION MOTION 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.) moved: 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
Having an independent ombudsman would be the direction to go on this issue.  
This is something businesses and farmers have been asking for for years. 
The way the agency will be set up kind of throws up a red flag. 
It will have a board comprised of 15 directors. 
The chair and two directors will be selected by the federal government. 
So often that is the case.  
An independent ombudsman is a must. 
It has also led to people serving jail sentences that should never have been imposed.  
The people who signed the contract with him had not fulfilled their commitment. 
They had cancelled some of the building project. 
But the stress and fear in this businessman were unbelievable. 
He appealed and won that case. 
This is not the democracy Canadians expect from the government. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am at a bit of a loss to comprehend the member's request. 
Perhaps the hon. member could explain the circumstances.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
The government prefers to impose a gag order.  
What will the outcome be? 
It is an affront to our democratic principles. 
This is the situation we are facing. 
That is why it is imposing closure.  
We pointed all this out. 
Two years later, it is obvious we were right. 
The bill before us is ill-drafted. 
If it were an airplane, it would never get off the ground. 
This is a serious matter.  
There is an old principle ``No taxation without representation''. 
I will go one step further. 
In Quebec, we have our own department of revenue. 
My question to the government is this:
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
However, none of them has yet made any kind of formal commitment. 
Let us hope we can get them on board.  
I believe we can do better than this. 
This is true of people whether they be small business owners, corporations or individual taxpayers. 
Financial accountability is very important to all Canadians.  
This is one of our basic principles. 
Why would we need a taxpayer bill of rights? 
If there were mistakes found there would be no penalties charged.  
So I requested Revenue Canada audit 4 years of my taxes. 
They found one error and charged $700.00.  
It seems that even Revenue Canada can make errors.  
I then received a phone call from a lady from Revenue Canada. 
I phoned Revenue Canada in Victoria to complain. 
I was really angry after that. 
I was told they would look into the situation. 
I then sat waiting.  
Shawnigan Lake, B.C. 
However, I am sure they do.  
I am thankful and hopeful that not every tax situation is like this one. 
However, even one case is one too many.  
In order to be effective, the taxpayer bill of rights must include several key points.  
Legal double talk only confuses the situation. 
Taxpayers need to know what any collected information will be used for.  
All disputed claimants need the right to appeal first administratively and then, if necessary, legally.  
That is a long list but I believe they are all necessary. 
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
There are four reasons for this.  
I will list them, then comment on each.  
Third, I believe it is an anti-union measure. 
Why do I call this an abdication of the political power? 
I heard the Reform Party member mention one such problem earlier. 
I also said the minister was powerless. 
Why, then, should we keep the minister? 
I also feel this initiative is an anti-union measure. 
They would then be subject to whatever new rules the agency felt like imposing.  
By wishing to simplify things, they will create duplication. 
They end up with their hands in the pockets of individuals, provinces and municipalities. 
We are told that this is certainly not the case. 
We are told ``It is to modernize the Canadian public service''. 
``Modernize'' is synonymous with ``privatize'' in the mouths of the Liberals. 
It is becoming a bit annoying.  
I will give an example. 
The Canada Post Corporation used to report to the government. 
So this means possible amalgamation. 
The government still talks of mail or equipment delivery.  
Is the government perhaps contemplating an amalgamation involving this agency? 
That is not a very good thing for Canadian justice.  
I would also like to speak briefly to clauses 15, 22 and 25. 
Of course, these 15 persons will be appointed by the governor in council. 
Who will the government appoint? 
The former solicitor general may want to look into this. 
We shall see; the future will tell.  
What does this mean?  
This is not clear. 
We have to be able to read between the lines.  
I am afraid so. 
They started by privatizing postal services; this was done a long time ago. 
Now they are talking about establishing a tax collection agency.  
My message to the rest of Canada is this:
Is Canada being put up for sale piece by piece? 
This is the conclusion I leave my friends from the rest of Canada to ponder.  
Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne-Blainville, BQ):
So, we are going back to the middle ages in this area. 
This is clearly a step backwards.  
Seven people decided the future of Dorval and Mirabel airports. 
It too is almost completely autonomous. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
This bill will lead to more such cases. 
The government says it must collect a lot of money. 
They may end up more vulnerable to political interference. 
Sometimes too, a person has to be willing to understand. 
There is, perhaps, something missing here.  
Quebeckers want to see it collecting as much of their taxes as possible. 
This bill was dormant for a long time. 
There is no rush. 
We do not have a national or international crisis. 
We have a bill that is sadly in need of improvement. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
This Liberal bill is not new. 
The answer, as you will agree, is no.  
The answer is no.  
All of them cautioned us about two things. 
The first one is the infamous pay equity issue. 
I believe there is cause for concern.  
It is important to take note of that concern.  
The Liberal government is consistent. 
The answer is obvious. 
Canadians and Quebeckers cannot trust such an institution. 
In the end, who will be accountable? 
These are questions we have.  
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, things are getting off to a bad start for Bill C-43. 
The government party is muzzling and gagging the opposition. 
There are so many good Liberals.  
Unfortunately for them but fortunately for us, the Liberals may not always be in power. 
This was a social consensus among all taxpayers.  
This sort of thing could happen. 
The government claims to be serious and concerned about ensuring social and civil peace. 
I doubt it very much.  
That is what this government is scrapping. 
That was the word the government used in relation to the GST. 
They were supposed to scrap it, but scrap the GST they did not. 
It seems to be working very well.  
It does not seem so; it is a fact.  
It is indeed working very well. 
It is a sort of collection agency. 
This came out in court recently. 
That is the kind of ethics these agencies have. 
And the next government will not be a Bloc Quebecois government. 
That much is sure, because this is not our goal.  
Perhaps then they will be the ones who will pay for it. 
This is a short-sighted policy. 
They are placing their fates in the hands of agencies. 
Yet there are political and social risks to this approach. 
The social risks need to be looked at. 
This is getting to be a concern. 
People make contributions to the Liberal party in exchange for political appointments.  
This is what we call double dipping.  
People get treated very well when they are friends of the Liberal Party.  
Like Ouellet at Canada Post.  
They were abused, and lost all sense of dignity. 
They were treated like animals. 
That is much too expensive.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
Did the people in Canada and in Quebec ask for such an agency? 
To ask the question is to answer it.  
Who will ensure that taxpayers' rights are protected? 
Who will ensure that personal information remains confidential?  
Therefore I ask where it is expected that there will be savings. 
30. (1) The Agency has authority over all matters relating to: 
( a ) general administrative policy in the Agency; 
And this is where the section becomes interesting: 
Clause 54 tells us even more. 
The anti-union nature of this bill is quite obvious.  
This government has proven that it prefers strong-arm tactics to crush employees' collective demands.  
Perhaps no job will be lost. 
This takes the cake.  
Mr. Maurice Godin (Chateauguay, BQ):
It would avoid its obligation to protect taxpayers against abuses of power. 
Here is what is to be found at section 30(1) of the bill: 
This agency is more open to patronage and abuse of power.  
The answer is no.  
So where is the support? 
The business world should be the first to be interested in this agency. 
He will reply that the agency is calling the shots. 
And democracy will suffer.  
It is an idea in search of a rationale that has yet to be found. 
What does the taxation employees' union think of it? 
It has ten arguments against this idea. 
Seventh, the agency will bring about new hidden taxes. 
Eighth, it will bring new costs. 
Ninth, the agency is already wasting money even if it does not yet exist. 
Tenth, the agency will be more bureaucratic than Revenue Canada.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Taxes are not being collected properly. 
I am thinking specifically of the privatization at Goose Bay. 
It is absolutely perverse when we think about it.  
About 5,000 employees of Revenue Canada work in Transcona and in Winnipeg. 
They have good reason to be apprehensive. 
Nobody really knows what this is going to end up looking like. 
Will it look like the Canada Post Corporation? 
Will it be a stand alone agency like Canada Post? 
I do not think so, although that comparison has been made. 
Where will the industrial relations be when all of the dust settles? 
Can anybody answer that? 
What is going to happen to their terms and conditions of employment? 
Are they still bargaining with the same employer? 
The term Trojan horse has been used. 
I have heard the term mega taxman. 
This is what we are saying. 
When we get that kind of independence, there is room for abuse. 
This is an absolute myth.  
This atmosphere of contempt has been allowed to flourish across the country. 
Abuse is heaped on them. 
Many of them now realize they have gone too far. 
That is what is happening to our military. 
We are buying into an unknown commodity for one thing. 
They are vehemently opposed to this.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Protest has been widespread. 
What is this government doing? 
Because it is annoyed with the opposition parties for expressing their disagreement.  
I said this agency will be a business. 
Who will it serve, the public? 
What will the directors' mission be?  
Clause 42(1) says: 
( a ) act honestly and in good faith- 
-with a view to the best interests of the Agency- 
We can say that. 
There are countries where things are done differently.  
Trust is absolutely vital in exercising this civic duty.  
The government also has the duty to build that trust. 
I hope they will be able to keep it.  
Will they be serving the people's interests? 
It does not make sense. 
It is unthinkable, but the government is doing it anyway. 
Let us just look at the personal information aspect. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
There are questions that need to be asked on behalf of the Canadian people. 
What is the imperative for having this bill in the first place? 
Those questions have not been answered. 
That should concern every Canadian and every member of this House.  
We have heard from those who work at Revenue Canada. 
We have also heard from the professional sector and even from the auditor general. 
From this we can see that there are problems.  
We have raised this continually in the House. 
I really believe that their concerns should not be taken lightly. 
In fact, we should be listening very closely to the issues that have been raised.  
What are the issues? 
First, there is the issue of privatization. 
The auditor general continues in his conclusions and recommendations to state: 
I think this is a very serious issue that has been raised. 
However, it should concern us when we see this information coming from the auditor general.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
There is a reason for that. 
Why would the provinces want to kick up a fuss about this? 
It is not a surprise at all.  
It has been kicked around, dragged around in every one of our caucuses. 
I believe there is a reason for that as well.  
The point I make is that we have a lot of taxes. 
Mr. Sekora, nice to see you. 
We have those taxes simply because- 
Mr. Speaker, I was just seeing if you were paying attention. 
Thank you for correcting me in that instance. 
It is about more accountability. 
This sky is falling mentality that we are hearing is nonsense.  
The minister of revenue will continue to have control over that.  
The Bloc has put 188 motions to the bill. 
There happen to be 188 clauses in the bill. 
There are no suggestions for positive change coming from the opposition. 
It is just trying to stall. 
We do not even collect its taxes.  
Therefore we should not need to put in time allocation.  
Members talk about time allocation as if it is some kind of terrible thing. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
It is very important that he do that.  
Mr. John O'Reilly (Haliburton-Victoria-Brock, Lib.):
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
It is a season of peace, happiness and joy. 
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
The sixth new member is Doug Kirk of Peterborough. 
Doug has devoted untold hours of time and energy to our Y. 
Volunteers are the glue that holds communities together. 
Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam, Lib.):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville, Lib.):
This year is no exception.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the crisis in agriculture is the focus of much attention by politicians. 
The government must pay attention to this offer. 
Do they own their own grain? 
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
Anselma House took 950 crisis calls this year. 
Its 20 beds are always full. 
It has been forced to refer almost 600 women and children to other facilities.  
For women with disabilities violence can be frighteningly frequent. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Will we ever know? 
Does it really matter?  
Here are the questions. 
The public complaints commission is shut down for at least six months. 
In fact the commission was never designed to probe political accountability.  
Unlike the Prime Minister, Canadians do not want scapegoats. 
They want political accountability.  
INTERNATIONAL DAY OF DISABLED PERSONS 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
For them, as for the rest of us, access is independence. 
I would like to make particular mention of the Office des personnes handicapees du Quebec. 
``Independence through access-everyone stands to gain''. 
I certainly believe it.  
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
Canadians have learned a lesson from this tragedy. 
The hon. member for Yukon has the floor.  
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
It is time for action. 
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
In the gallery are three people who are shadowing members of parliament:
Nancy Villeneuve, Kathy Bainville and Tammy Culhan. 
We welcome them to the House of Commons.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
FIRE AT HOTEL-DIEU HOSPITAL IN ROBERVAL 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
In severe cases it is spelling financial ruin and bankruptcy.  
The Government of Canada is permitting Canada Post to steal from its franchises. 
Instead of the entrepreneurs- 
The hon. member for West Nova.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
At the heart of that dispute is the question of pay equity. 
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
It was down 3.1% from the year before. 
Now is the time to be generous. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
What does the minister do? 
He raises payroll taxes. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the OECD report is a very good report. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, that is simply not the case. 
Those are the facts.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
They are substantially lower than in the United States.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
It fires the independent actuary of the plan.  
Is that the government's idea of listening to independent advice? 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Let us get back to the real agenda of the Reform Party. 
Finally the hon. member has admitted it. 
What he wants to do is destroy the Canada pension plan. 
He objects to a sharing of risk.  
What he is looking for is pensions for the rich and nothing for the poor. 
That has always been their agenda.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
There is no doubt about that.  
I ask the hon. member to be very judicious in his choice of words.  
Mr. Speaker, Scrooge has nothing on the finance minister. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Let us put it against what Reformers would do. 
The hon. member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
He is dreaming in technicolour. 
He can take no credit for that.  
He still does not understand so I will ask him very clearly. 
When is this message going to get through? 
When is he going to give Canadians the tax break they deserve?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
They would take $3.5 billion out of the health transfer. 
They would take $920 million out of funding for aboriginal Canadians.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Is this not what happened. 
Can the Prime Minister deny it?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the members of this House are entitled to make representations. 
No ministerial representations were made to the Toronto committee. 
It was a competition.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
They should not be used for political purposes.  
The right hon. Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
He is trying to show once again what a poor martyr he is.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I am not trying to make political capital out of this issue. 
The hon. member for Roberval has the floor.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there was also a cabinet minister from Alberta. 
That is not my fault. 
But what can I- 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
Mr. Speaker, a decision was made. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
Bloc Quebecois members say they did not support the candidacy of Quebec City. 
The hon. leader of the New Democratic Party has the floor.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
They need help now. 
How can the minister not understand the urgency? 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member needs to listen to what I continue to say.  
I explained the situation to my cabinet colleagues. 
I stand by that statement.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have been listening to what the agriculture minister said.  
The minister seemed engaged in seeking solutions to the farm crisis. 
These farmers are desperate. 
Many of them will go under before spring.  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Prince Edward-Hastings, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
First of all, highways are a provincial jurisdiction. 
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I am just quoting what the former federal minister said. 
It is his condition. 
It is his policy. 
He broke the agreement himself. 
He broke the agreement on behalf of his consortium and I do not understand.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Those are the words of the auditor general. 
There is no wrongdoing.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Why is the government continuing to put this off? 
Why will it not be today to help our Canadian farmers right now? 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
We are working very hard, as I said. 
We realize the seriousness of the situation. 
If there is a program we will announce it as quickly as we possibly can.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Now it is down to if there is a program.  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Again, I thank members of the Reform Party for their support to Canadian farmers.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
The hon. leader of the Bloc Quebecois.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
But I will ask my question of the minister responsible for regional development in Quebec. 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Six days after he refused to fudge the numbers he was fired.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
There are ongoing dialogues.  
That is what happened in this particular case. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the preamble to that question is simply untrue.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
I would ask the hon. minister not to name the member.  
I hope we will have the time- 
The hon. member for Fraser Valley.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
That is why we have an independent chief actuary to give us the numbers. 
Six days later he was out of a job.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have already answered that question. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
He says that is too bad. 
Why keep Canadians in suspense? 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The hon. member for Mississauga West has the floor.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
But we know it is not enough. 
Their proposal is based on five clear principles. 
To live without violence is a right, not a privilege. 
Violence is not a private matter, it is a criminal matter.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
This government has more positions than the Kama Sutra .  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I would like to have a motion for details, Mr. Speaker. 
I am no expert in the matter.  
I respectfully suggest that the hon. member switch books.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will emphasize the positions.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are negotiating with the provinces at this time. 
We are making some progress.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Why this shortcoming for my province and western Canada? 
Is it because we do not elect Liberals in the west?  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
This is something that has to be addressed at some point in time. 
That accounts for some of the differences. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, these funding agreements actually came into place and they were terminated. 
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Why is the minister using different numbers? 
Can he not count?  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, unfortunately the hon. member can only deal with imagination. 
I have to deal with reality. 
That is what we are doing.  
The auditor general said that we need an advisory committee. 
I announced yesterday that there would be an advisory committee.  
I believe the member today tabled his own report. 
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, what the hon. member just said is not true.  
I gave all the explanations to the committee and to the hon. member. 
Everything that has been approved so far is included in the report.  
I cannot include projects that have not been approved. 
PUBLIC SERVICE OF CANADA 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, unfortunately the existing classification system is outdated and needs to be replaced. 
We just had an agreement with our unions to renovate it. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Agriculture. 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is a federal government program. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
The vast majority of Canadians agree. 
The health community is united on this position.  
When will it bring in a bill?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Within years it will ban all sponsorships and promotion.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
Is there something wrong with this picture? 
The present minister says no, it is a good deal. 
Who is the minister protecting, the taxpayers or his friend, Doug Young?  
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
On this the international day of disabled persons, two years have elapsed. 
When are we going to see further action on these recommendations?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Is the job done? 
No. Is there more to do? 
That brings to a close our question period for today.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
The Chair will know that it is all very important.  
I understand that this is changing only one or two words. 
We would following this deal with Bill C-35 respecting imports. 
I indicated that there were also discussions on Bill C-59. 
Hopefully we can accomplish all this business on Monday.  
On Tuesday, we will consider the third reading of Bill C-43.  
Next Wednesday and Thursday the House will hold the annual pre-budget debate.  
I will now hear a question of privilege. 
Everything is in order and I am ready to listen.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
According to Maingot, in chapter 12, page 229: 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
I have too much respect for this institution.  
I too want these leaks to stop.  
I am not so sure about that. 
I am simply saying that I do not know.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question of privilege will address two issues. 
Other statements in the paper are: 
In its prebudget report to be tabled tomorrow, the committee calls on the... government to- 
Journalists are now publicly bragging about obtaining leaked reports. 
In contrast let us consider the authority of the courts. 
Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):
I do commend that to members. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, here we are once again. 
I probably have a clear idea of what you are going to say. 
We talked about it this morning and we will be dealing with the issue. 
I am not sure what the outcome of that will be.  
Once it starts, where does it stop?  
This is continuing consistently and it is getting worse. 
I am going to have a long talk with our critics. 
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the justice committee experienced the same kind of situation.  
The chairs of the committees perhaps should take this seriously. 
I did not have a name to present in conjunction with that complaint. 
I must admit that I am becoming less patient by the day. 
This is the second time this week that the same issue has been raised. 
I would like to make a suggestion, which is more than a suggestion really.  
I would like some kind of recommendation to come forth to the House.  
Collectively members of parliament have this power.  
One hon. member brought up a very strong point. 
I put that as a question, only as a question. 
I want this to be done as soon as possible.  
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Pursuant to order made yesterday, the House will now proceed to Statements by Ministers.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Ensuring public safety is at the heart of this government's mandate.  
Organized crime is a serious and growing concern. 
We are building on their advice and expertise.  
No one jurisdiction can effectively act alone. 
Organized crime has no borders; it does not respect them. 
At the international level we have been working very actively with our partners. 
The federal government is taking action. 
Our next move will be to help take the profit out of organized crime. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
There is overwhelming evidence that organized crime is increasing at an alarming rate. 
The danger imposed by modern day organized crime is a serious and destructive force. 
It imperils the security of our citizens and our nation. 
Canada cannot afford the continuing lip service the government is providing to the problem. 
I presume the minister also congratulates CSIS on its work. 
In summary, no turf wars.  
The minister has said that crime respects no borders. 
I urge the government to get on with the job. 
It seems that sometimes with the government more is said than done.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
To me, the ministerial statement by the solicitor general is nothing but lip service. 
The solicitor general is really just a front. 
The true solicitor general is the Prime Minister and his staff.  
Money laundering seems to be the new priority of this government. 
It has the support of a number of representatives of the police.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Madam Speaker, it is always a pleasure to follow the hon. member for Charlesbourg. 
He is, like myself, an islander. 
That is as nice as I will be.  
It will be tough going because there is very little foundation to build upon.  
Indeed, all we have heard is another statement of what they hope to do.  
It includes contraband, economic crime, fraud, migrant trafficking and motor vehicle theft. 
These types of activities require urgent action.  
We have seen the training centre in Regina suffer from funding cuts. 
I welcome the statement of the solicitor general. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
The present minister is the third consecutive minister to make the promise.  
Let me refresh the memory of the current solicitor general.  
He too promised anti-money laundering legislation.  
That is not a partisan comment on my part. 
That is the conclusion of the U.S. State Department.  
They have identified 18 international crime syndicates operating at this time.  
Simply recognizing the problem is not good enough. 
Calling it serious is not good enough.  
Those allegations came from the commissioner of the RCMP and the auditor general. 
These areas are all in decline.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Secretary to the Governor General 
CANADA CUSTOMS AND REVENUE AGENCY ACT 
Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):
Why establish a customs and revenue agency? 
We also know that international operations are liable to weaken the tax base. 
He also states as follows: 
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Why do we keep wanting to debate it? 
It says ``We want to continue, we want to continue, we want to continue''. 
There is perhaps something a bit twisted there. 
We may well ask. 
Consultation has become a government catch phrase. 
True, they did consult. 
But did they listen during these consultations? 
Did they listen to those they consulted?  
The government, through the minister, says the provinces agree. 
There was a program with that very title. 
This is how the federal government seems to be behaving. 
The government is increasingly dumping its responsibilities. 
Could it be that it is becoming lazy? 
Is this the idea of a party in office?  
The minister would reply ``It is not our responsibility. 
This is an independent agency for which the government is no longer responsible. 
We will ask questions, but it is no longer my responsibility''.  
We now know where we stand in Quebec, in this respect. 
Stop the juggernaut of tax collection. 
Let us work together on changes that will bring harmony''. 
Hold everything and listen to us''.  
Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):
According to this independent report, Revenue Canada is well regarded among Canadians.  
The agency is about creating options and opportunities for the provinces. 
Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):
Quebec is no exception. 
Just think of the large banks' CEOs, for example. 
This is hardly reassuring.  
But it is on the wrong track with the establishment of this agency. 
Modernization and privatization are not synonymous. 
I just do not understand. 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is a perfect example of this. 
Where would the distinct society be? 
Where would our distinct character be? 
There is the historical aspect I just mentioned. 
These results did not appear as if by magic. 
This is no longer possible. 
This is a private agency.  
They will directly serve clients, eventually causing massive layoffs. 
Take the ADM, Mirabel-Dorval. 
As parliamentarians, whom can we hold accountable? 
How is public interest served in all this? 
The government is losing control. 
This is very serious. 
This is very neo-liberal. 
This is very undemocratic. 
states, and I quote: 
Every director of the Agency, exercising their powers and performing their duties and functions, must 
It is immoral to write such things. 
When one is paid by the state, one should act in the public interest. 
It is our first responsibility. 
We act on behalf of the state, not even on behalf of the government.  
Members know how things work. 
I cannot understand that the Canadian elites have not done so. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I wish to dedicate my speech to the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
I believe she needs encouragement to do so. 
Let's not get carried away here. 
We were in opposition too. 
Is this not democratic? 
Is that not honourable? 
Is this not an issue the government should raise?  
I have a challenge to put to our ministers present. 
I would like the Minister of Canadian Heritage to stop writing and listen. 
I challenge her to rise. 
Does her friend Mike Harris support a bill like this?  
He is certainly no friend of mine.  
That is the best thing that could happen to it. 
Quebec alone lost $7 billion. 
Is this the kind of federalism the Minister of Canadian Heritage wants to see? 
In their respective areas of jurisdiction, each level of government was supposed to be sovereign. 
That was the first characteristic.  
The problem is that there is nobody in cabinet to defend Quebec's interests. 
That is the sad part about it. 
We fought hard to have our own tax system in Quebec. 
So we will not let it happen. 
I am not finished yet.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I want to give him the opportunity to correct this- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am sorry, but the debate must resume.  
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
Even the business community is against the creation of the agency.  
Third, the CCRA does not greatly impress small business owners. 
If the provinces have separate revenues, they should collect them themselves.  
He even thought at the time that such action was illegal. 
Unfortunately, we should not count too much on the members opposite in that regard. 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
This is what this agency is all about.  
But where did the idea to establish this agency come from? 
``Responsibility'' is one such word. 
But ``accountability'' has sunk even further in the popularity polls. 
There is a major political abdication here. 
But it was not serious, no one was accountable, it was the agency's fault.  
This situation went on for months. 
We raised the issue in the House several times. 
Why create an agency? 
Clause 50 deals with public service staff relations. 
I object to that completely.  
It is a major concern. 
Three quarters of that information was not provided by you, but obtained through your SIN.  
I would not like to end up in such a situation. 
Is the House ready for the question?  
The question is on Motion No. 1. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen.  
The recorded division on Motion No. 1 stands deferred. 
Perron (Riviere-des-Mille-Iles, BQ) moved: 
That Bill C-43 be amended by deleting Clause 2. 
``(a) that Parliament authorizes the Minister, the'' 
Perron (Riviere-des-Mille-Iles, BQ) moved: 
That Bill C-43 be amended by deleting Clause 5. 
Perron (Riviere-des-Mille-Iles, BQ) moved: 
That Bill C-43 be amended by deleting Clause 6. 
``to the Minister by Parliament.''  
``(2) The Minister is responsible for all aspects of the'' 
Perron (Riviere-des-Mille-Iles, BQ) moved: 
That Bill C-43 be amended by deleting Clause 188.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP) moved: 
Our time is very limited and we cannot discuss the bill in length.  
If this is the case, what would be the cost? 
Public service union members were opposed to it. 
This new vehicle will not work.  
This person will be appointed by the governor in council. 
He or she will hold office for a term of five years.  
How much will the commissioner be paid? 
What will the annual salary be? 
The agency will simply be an added layer of bureaucracy. 
We simply do not understand.  
By creating this new agency, they are only shuffling the money around. 
That is why I am so vigorously opposed to this agency. 
We simply do not understand why it is being established. 
What is its purpose? 
Why does the government want to create this agency? 
So why set up another one?  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
While we have been sitting here I wrote my newspaper column. 
I noticed one of the members over there gave a hearty laugh. 
I am not going to spend as much time on those.  
I am going on the assumption that this independent agency will happen. 
We have seen this over and over. 
The government will arrange for this vote to pass. 
This government has already, with its majority, voted for closure. 
That is what I am trying to do now. 
One of the problems with this agency is the question of accountability. 
There have been a couple. 
The Prime Minister said he believes in ministerial responsibility.  
We insist that should be done. 
They would vote in favour of it.  
I would simply urge them to do the right thing for taxpayers. 
I suppose basically everyone n the country is affected by this legislation. 
Our tax system is predicated on voluntary compliance. 
If that is missing, the system falls apart.  
They did not have representatives representing them in parliament.  
It is a fait accompli. 
It is mandatory for us. 
Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):
This will be accomplished in a number of ways. 
Another benefit of the legislation is that it will improve the management of the agency. 
The board of management will help to bring a client oriented focus to agency activities. 
This improved management will also mean significant improvements for employees. 
Employee representatives will be able to bargain directly with the employer. 
This will result in more responsive and simplified staffing and classification systems. 
This will also incorporate access to independent third party review.  
All of this means better service.  
This is what is expected of good government. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
That is very reasonable. 
We are a federation. 
We tend to work together as a federation. 
We know, Madam Speaker, that your province will not sign on. 
Quebec will collect its own taxes. 
The member who just spoke is from Ontario. 
It is a brand new agency.  
This is a new agency in this country. 
A good number of people are very unhappy with this bill:
I see in the House the member from Abitibi. 
He would certainly agree with my motion. 
He is a great federalist. 
It is a very reasonable motion.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):

All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):

The next question is on Motion No. 205. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.

And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):

Madam Speaker, I just want to float something here. 
We have some 200-plus motions to do this way. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member is seeking unanimous consent to expedite the process. 
Is there unanimous consent?  
Perron (Riviere-des-Mille-Iles, BQ) moved:

SALARIES FOR STAY AT HOME MOTHERS AND FATHERS 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.) moved: 
The notice was related to the new Canadian child tax benefit.  
She is not the only one in this situation. 
Here is another quote from her letter: 
It says that this new benefit ``... 
includes the basic benefit plus a new supplement. 
Of course, we chose to have many children. 
And we live adequately on one salary. 
After all, our five children will be taxpayers one day. 
Very few families want to have more than one or two children. 
It is the social conditions that are the cause of poverty. 
This is why we are pleased to share our thoughts with you. 
Here are some examples. 
Mr. Germain's family loses $280 per month. 
We keep asking ourselves.  
Such situations exist in my riding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would ask therefore for unanimous consent.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
This group is stay at home parents.  
This continues to cause further economic strife in many families today. 
A third consideration is to make the spousal exemption equal to the personal exemption. 
At this time only 16% of families use commercial daycare. 
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to speak to Motion No. M-486.  
The current Income Tax Act is discriminatory, plain and simple. 
I will illustrate with the example of two families living side by side. 
Because this government discriminates against families.  
The Reform Party has a long history of representing the family. 
Family taxation should be simple, flexible and efficient.  
We recognize the most important caregiver for a child is its parent. 
Because of the oppressive taxes levied by this government. 
I cannot imagine anything more heartbreaking than not being able to raise your own children.  
The people have spoken. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
We have also reviewed the tax legislation as regards income tax. 
Those are several initiatives that come under provincial jurisdiction.  
How can he not be concerned by pay equity, for instance?  
Everyone knows an appeal is now before the Federal Court. 
It is very important that we be able to improve the employment insurance system. 
The qualifying conditions for access to maternity leave have been changed. 
There is something missing in the hon. member's arguments. 
It is a free choice.  
We are very much aware that she has made another career choice. 
We are pleased to have her with us.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:
We would miss her.  
That is not what women are asking for. 
That is not what the feminist organizations are asking for. 
And I believe this must be taken into consideration.  
I come from a family of five children. 
I have a twin brother, an older brother, a sister and a younger brother. 
I am profoundly convinced of that.  
The provinces are $42 billion short. 
Family policy ought to be developed at the provincial level. 
Because of its connection with education and child care. 
In this respect, I call on the Minister of Canadian Heritage.  
What did that book say? 
That the government would create 150,000 new child care spaces. 
There was something about a national child care network. 
The Minister of Canadian Heritage has not forgotten that, has she?  
First, funds should have gone to the provinces. 
I am convinced that all provincial governments want their own family policies. 
It does not always fit the traditional concept of family. 
We often talk about blended families. 
The traditional, nuclear family is no longer the norm.  
It is a free choice.  
A message was delivered by the Usher of the Black Rod as follows: 
Accordingly, the Speaker with the House went up to the Senate chamber.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
SALARIES FOR STAY AT HOME MOTHERS AND FATHERS 
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Like most industrialized countries, Canada is at a crossroads. 
This brings us to today's motion. 
The Norwegian government answered that question with a resounding no. 
That is a thorny issue, if ever there was one. 
However, this is the view held by the national forum on health. 
What about those who fall between the cracks? 
Another solution must therefore be found. 
We could give a Keynesian answer to that question:
When circumstances change, my position has to change as well.  
I will leave this up to those who are qualified to do that.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Last month we debated his previous motion on this issue.  
This debate should also focus on the crucial consideration of the needs of children. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
If it is her wish to do so, she may conclude her remarks.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
I guess we should relax easy knowing that the family is protected. 
Different parents for different reasons make different choices. 
All our lives we lived on one income. 
All those years we paid a penalty for that choice. 
I remember teaching night classes. 
I taught at a technical institute. 
One of the pleasures of that job was to teach night courses. 
They were new when I was a young man giving instruction at the technical institute. 
I worked Tuesdays and Thursdays. 
That is something I strongly believe in. 
I would be so appreciative. 
We are promoting the idea. 
That is one idea I really wish they would steal. 
I think it is so critically important.  
Sometimes I did not get to see my family as much as I wanted. 
I strongly urge the government to consider that. 
We just disagree in the detail of how it should be done.  
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
I honestly believe all contributions are important. 
I would like to pick up on a few points. 
Any contribution to the discussions is welcomed. 
Pay equity is a much talked about issue in the public service. 
It is a fundamental right. 
That is my position. 
We must find a way to help families. 
I have listened to all the members who took part in this debate. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
There was an attempt to clean up the pit. 
In 1970 the land was transferred to the commissioner of Yukon. 
The Yukon River runs almost directly through the area.  
Yukon has hundreds of contaminated sites. 
This is just one of them. 
These letters were acknowledged but never answered. 
More recently the Whitehorse mayor has asked for the clean-up.  
There is also an abandoned DEW line site in Yukon as well. 
It is very critical. 
The northern environment is vulnerable. 
It has been over 50 years. 
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
The land has been under the control of the Government of Yukon since 1965-66.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
This solution was proposed to the minister.  
So I am asking the government to review this process. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. parliamentary secretary.  
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 7.03 p.m.)
