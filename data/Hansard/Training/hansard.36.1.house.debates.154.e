EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 154 
Wednesday, November 18, 1998 
The House met at 2 p.m. 
Members sang the national anthem ] 
Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there certainly are times when perseverance pays off. 
She started taking Betaseron in July 1996. 
This drug produced a substantial improvement in her condition. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
I would caution all members in their statements.  
Mr. John Godfrey (Don Valley West, Lib.):
But National Child Day does something else. 
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
They are here representing all Canadian holocaust survivors.  
Members rose and applauded ] 
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Eglinton-Lawrence, Lib.):
Their lives in Canada read like a model of good citizenship. 
Like all other Canadians, I thank them.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN QUEBEC 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
MARGUERITE-ROSE PESANT-BEDARD 
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN QUEBEC 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
Not a word on that. 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Stephanie Mainil, who lives in Saskatchewan, is No. 8-8948. 
Her father is 8-8938. 
If this happened in Mexico everyone would suspect intimidation and tampering. 
Now we hear that the minister is going to appoint the scrutineers for this election. 
In a democracy it is the candidates who appoint the scrutineers. 
ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN QUEBEC 
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
The problem is that the people of Quebec do not want this referendum. 
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, Canada's economy is falling behind. 
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Ironically, it was a Toronto paper that brought the doomsayers back into line.  
I too am confident.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
We can begin today in this- 
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
The government has made it clear that the era of cuts is over.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, no one believes these Liberal stock answers any more. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
That is the real source of the problem that Harris and his crew are having.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We know what they mean. 
They want American style health insurance. 
They want American style health care. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, talk about mixing up numbers. 
I am sure he knows that.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
It was the Liberal government that introduced the Canada Health Act. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
The member for Macleod spent seven years in medical school. 
I have a question, Mr. Speaker. 
If you were a sick person, to which of these two members would you go?  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
It is both illegal and immoral.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
That is what the auditor general said.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, there are always limits. 
I would like him to answer the following question:
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have just answered. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Things are fine in Canada.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
We raised those issues with the ministers of the Malaysian government. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
My supplementary question is for the solicitor general. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have filed an affidavit.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The Canadian standard of living has also increased substantially under this government. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the minister is wrong.  
He used to call the GST a regressive tax. 
In fact, he has used the GST to help pay off his deficit. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
They set up a deficit reduction plan.  
What we are doing is what his government set up. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Let us see if it has proof behind those convictions. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
The hon. member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
I ask the minister once again. 
While Canadians dawdle, people die. 
People want hospital beds. 
They want surgery when they need it. 
They do not want more rhetoric from this government. 
They want action, not more words.  
Colleagues, be sure to always address your questions through the Chair.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
This is the party- 
The hon. member for Trois-Rivieres.  
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I cannot believe the Minister of Health. 
What is his number? 
How much for health care?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
It is nice to see him taking a little credit for that.  
The minister has a stage right now. 
He claims it is his number one priority.  
If it really is his number one priority, what is his number? 
How much will he kick back into health care?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Health has already answered. 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.  
This is not an intrusion into provincial jurisdictions. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
I explained the situation to them. 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
I have a question for the revenue minister. 
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Canadians have been saying that the federal government and provincial governments should be working together. 
Canadians want us to reduce overlap and duplication. 
They want us to get rid of the red tape. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
They are a figment of his imagination. 
The provinces in fact are going in the other direction. 
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the two highways in question are part of a national road network. 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the President of the Treasury Board.  
However, the government wants to reduce the uncertainty. 
I am grateful for their suggestions. 
The hon. member for Lethbridge.  
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
The vast majority of Canadians tell us that they are concerned about this issue. 
They want action and they will take action. 
We are providing them with the tools to do so. 
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, nothing was achieved in Kyoto or in Argentina.  
Developing countries will not buy into it.  
Once again I ask the question. 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
The developing nations are onside. 
This is important for the security not only of Canada but the world.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We have committed $100 million to reduce smoking in this country. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
That is something we all agree with, but that is not the issue. 
The member well knows there are procedural and constitutional issues with respect to that bill.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I hope that does include testifying.  
A blanket denial from the solicitor general will not cut it with Canadians. 
They want truth and accountability. 
The member for Palliser- 
Be very judicious in the choice of words. 
Go directly to the question, please.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Fanshawe, Lib.):
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Scientists are supposed to be independent. 
They are supposed to be protectors of the health of Canadians.  
These same scientists have testified about intimidation tactics in the department. 
An internal investigation has been promised. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Even in the last year and a half look at what has happened. 
We have cut back on the reductions in the food labs. 
We have appointed an arm's length science advisory board. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
The fact is that Mr. Pinochet is at present in Great Britain. 
The matter is being considered by the House of Lords legal committee. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
How many jobs would be lost? 
Would any work be contracted out and if so, which jobs?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
We will continue with those discussions and bring about that very positive outcome.  
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the minister of immigration. 
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
I thank my hon. friend for the question.

Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
TOBACCO INDUSTRY RESPONSIBILITY ACT 
I am pleased to be the sponsor of this bill in the House of Commons.  
(Motion agreed to and bill read the first time) 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order concerning this issue. 
I have information that the messenger will be here shortly. 
With your indulgence that is the way we will proceed. 
We will hold everything in abeyance until after we have had royal assent.  
Mr. Speaker, could we continue with Routine Proceedings.  
I am prepared to do that but I want to put it to the House.  
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
CHILD CUSTODY AND ACCESS 
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
The petitioners call upon parliament to ban the use of MMT.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have the honour to present two petitions today. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
A message was delivered by the Usher of the Black Rod as follows: 
Accordingly, the Speaker with the House went up to the Senate chamber.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. Earle):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I move that all questions stand.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
I have three questions. 
Time has gone by and I have had no response.  
Some of that information should be forthcoming from these questions. 
I would like to know when I will get them answered.  
Mr. Speaker, I have noted questions Nos. 119, 132 and 138. 
It has been a very busy and productive week. 
I will look into the whereabouts of those questions.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
It continues to refuse to adhere to the regulations.  
I will continue to do everything I can.  
I will continue to do my very best to obtain these responses.  
Is it agreed that all questions be allowed to stand?  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order concerning Bill S-13.  
There are two principles that come into play in this case. 
The second principle is stated at Bourinot's page 430 which reads as follows: 
This principle is embodied in our own rules governing tax bills. 
I say this for the following reasons. 
But it goes on: 
This is not the case today.  
That is the pith and substance of the bill.  
As a matter of fact, it is the direct opposite.  
This bill required a ways and means resolution.  
There is an obvious parallel with Bill S-13. 
They probably will be, anyway.  
I believe the objectives of this bill are highly desirable. 
The policies proposed by the bill are creative and innovative. 
We will have quite a few interventions on this. 
This is how I would propose to attack this particular problem. 
This is how I am going to proceed. 
Then I am going to hear from a spokesperson for the Reform Party. 
The hon. member for St. Paul's.  
Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
There is some overlap between those concerns. 
This is purely to set up the foundation. 
First I want to talk about levy criteria. 
In British practice as followed here in Canada, a levy is in order procedurally. 
The levy must be imposed on the industry. 
It must serve an industry purpose. 
The funds from the levy never form any part of government revenues. 
As I have said, I have some legitimate questions of how credible we can be.... 
Clause 3 deals with the purpose which is that of the industry.  
Six explicit industry purposes are listed in Bill S-13. 
Clause 3(1) gives the purpose of the act: 
Clause 3(1)(c) addresses the lack of credibility: 
Clause 3(1)(e) talks about pre-empting further restrictions: 
Clause 3(1)(f) deals with co-ordination: 
Clause 31 is about sponsors: 
-a sponsor of the Foundation may use the name of the Foundation- 
Clause 32(1) is about independence: 
The bill is also beneficial to the industry in a number of less specific ways. 
It is likely to help improve its negative public image. 
It is evidence of the industry's efforts to combat youth smoking.  
The levy purpose need not be exclusive for the industry.  
Broader purposes are served by Bill S-13 as well.  
They include the Industry Training Act of 1964. 
One of my favourite ones is the Betting Levy Act of 1961. 
The charge was considered to have an industry benefit. 
That also did not require a ways and means motion.  
Those are the first two points. 
The third point is the whole issue of a levy versus a tax.  
The funds generated from the levy never form part of government revenue. 
The specific clauses of the bill make this clear. 
Any surplus funds after wind-up of the foundation are returned to the tobacco companies.  
They have also provided written opinions to that effect. 
What is required is that the levy must serve an industry purpose.  
We believe that certain dogs, cats and cows also benefited.  
I believe that the Speaker should consider this option.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Health groups throughout this country are supportive of this bill.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
I recommend them to you, Mr. Speaker. 
Erskine May's 21st edition, at page 716, is clear when it states: 
In doubtful cases, the Speaker will be guided largely by circumstances.  
The powers of the Senate are not the only procedural issue at stake here. 
We believe that the government cannot have it both ways. 
I recommend that position to you, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
That is an important admission.  
Your Honour is treading into an unchartered area. 
Let us look at this closely. 
The proceeds are not to be used by the government. 
It is specifically directed in the bill that they not be used for that purpose.  
The levy can be used for other purposes. 
I quote from page 763 of Erskine May: 
There was no royal recommendation required in the instance of the wheat bill. 
The House at that time did not treat this levy as a tax. 
It is a strong precedent that I urge Your Honour to examine closely.  
Clearly it would be here. 
Third, it was ``levied by a public body''. 
This is not the case here. 
Fourth, it was ``intended for a public purpose''. 
Here the body is non-governmental. 
There was no doubt or grey area in those precedents.  
This is tantamount to the government posing a pre-emptive strike. 
Therefore I would urge Your Honour not to intervene in this matter. 
The hon. government House leader referred to the summary of the bill in his remarks. 
The government House leader used words like praiseworthy and commendable. 
Yet the government is trying to kill this bill. 
He is saying ``Wash me but don't make me wet''.  
Those were the words that he used.  
The government could and should assume responsibility for the carriage of this bill. 
This is what the government should be prepared to do.  
Those are my remarks with respect to this point of order. 
Mr. Speaker, make the government politically responsible. 
Let us put children ahead of political preference on this point.  
Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk-Brant, Lib.):
Bourinot on page 491 of his fourth edition reminds us that: 
The same wording continues to this day. 
That is on pages 779-80. 
Such a regime is one that requires the use of financial procedures.  
The purpose is a public purpose. 
That is its pith and substance. 
It is a public purpose. 
In fact, the new title of the bill endorses the public purpose. 
That can be found on page 777 of May.  
This is not the case for Bill S-13. 
Accordingly this bill should not remain on the Order Paper.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Bill S-13 attempts to deal with it. 
Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):
As hon. members well know, parliament evolved out of the Westminster model of parliamentary government. 
We have a responsible cabinet. 
We have a representative parliament.  
A responsible and representative parliament performs very important functions. 
Parliamentarians deliberate, investigate and legislate items that come under their purview. 
We use our collective judgment to decide what work gets done 
We have investigated many issues that relate to smoking. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I want to expand on some of the comments made by my colleagues.  
Obviously the other place is involved in this issue. 
Obviously the House of Commons now is captivated by this issue. 
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
I will focus on two very specific points. 
The second point concerns the criteria associated with the levy.  
The first one is that the levy is imposed on the industry. 
The second one is to serve an industry purpose. 
Mr. Speaker, yours is the role of judge. 
As you said earlier, you want our opinion. 
Other opinions, including legal ones, have been or will be submitted to you, no doubt. 
You yourself will also seek other opinions, I am sure.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I will go through it as quickly as I can. 
I want to step through here for the Canadian public. 
The fee had a specific use. 
That is articulated very clearly in the bill. 
This would be a proper way to do it. 
We are talking about 40,000 deaths per year in Canada because of smoking. 
We have to do everything in our power to address that issue.  
Canadian practice provides a precedent based on British cases. 
Obviously that has to be part of your consideration.  
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
We agree with that. 
We all agree with that. 
A ways and means motion must be introduced by a minister of the crown. 
A tax bill can originate only in the House of Commons. 
A levy is a very different thing. 
A levy is imposed to serve a particular beneficial industry purpose. 
The funds from the levy never form part of the revenues of the government. 
The bill is very clear. 
I refer to a the ruling by the Speaker of the Senate: 
I have two things to do here. 
This is evident from part II of the bill. 
It is also clear that the levy is imposed upon the tobacco industry alone.  
Clause 3 states categorically that the purpose of the bill is: 
Then he goes on to compare it with Erskine May: 
The first criterion is that the levy must be for industry purposes. 
I refer to section 35. 
There is no difference at all. 
What is the difference between this and Bill C-32? 
There is none at all.  
They are not the same thing.  
Here the aim is clear. 
That is the case with this bill.  
Mr. Greenspon concludes that in his mind it is definitely a levy.  
My colleagues, I would say, fully support the principle of this bill. 
I think it is very important that they did. 
I appreciate that they did. 
It will be your ruling, Mr. Speaker. 
I think this goes beyond the scope of what the Speaker should do.  
There are still four members on the list who wish to speak. 
At 5.30 p.m. we are supposed to go to Private Members' Business. 
That is an order of the House.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
The intent of this bill is not to fill the pockets of the taxman.  
I think that gives the Speaker some latitude when considering this. 
I ask you to take that into consideration.  
It is time that we did something for our kids. 
Mrs. Judi Longfield (Whitby-Ajax, Lib.):
The bill states that it is proposing a levy, not a tax. 
The bill states that these funds will not flow into the consolidated revenue fund. 
You are being asked to provide both a legal and a constitutional decision.  
Mr. Speaker, you have a bill with stated intentions. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
I have consulted with the Table. 
I appeal to members to consider seriously this option.  
The House can give that consent now. Members can give that consent. 
I want to appeal to members of the House. 
Therefore, I seek that consent.  
I want to understand, so I will put this to the member. 
That is what he wants the consent of the House to do. 
That is in order.  
Does the hon. member have the consent of the House to put the motion?  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will try to give you some constructive suggestions.  
I point out in the legislation that under definitions it says ``Levy means the levy''. 
The legislation defines levy by the same word. 
It is a levy for industry purposes.  
Finally, if we look at Larousse , we will find that ``prelevement'' is translated as ``impot''.  
The key word is the fact that money is being raised from people compulsorily. 
They are often viewed in legislation as individuals and they are regarded as such.  
``sponsor of the Foundation'' means a person who pays a levy.  
This has been a very interesting afternoon. 
I would imagine that this will be a far-reaching decision.  
I will take into consideration the very valuable information that you have given me today. 
The bill arises out of community response. 
That is certainly not the case.  
After a while in that kind of role one understands how they think. 
In many circumstances they know exactly what they are doing. 
Their actions are quite calculated. 
Many know how to beat the system. 
Every province seems to have a different way of dealing with trespassers. 
In British Columbia trespassing laws are rather weak. 
Something has to be done with this most serious issue. 
Section 41(1) clearly states: 
It is amazing how attitudes change the following morning. 
Often the issue is the timing. 
I will give a hypothetical situation. 
In other words, the teenager would be given a ticket.  
He will not leave so the police are called. 
They arrive and legally remove him from the property. 
In the current situation no such warning could be given.  
However I do not plan to give up on this issue.  
I was lucky at one point to have that happen.  
It really did not matter where the bill came from. 
It was the matter that we got the job done. 
Every member of the House knows the Criminal Code has loopholes. 
Canadians do not expect the Criminal Code to be perfect. 
I pointed out a loophole in section 41 of the Criminal Code. 
There is a concern in my community. 
My constituents asked me to help to throw water on this little fire.  
The people's agenda is not reflected here. 
It is sadly just the agenda of old tired ways.  
It is not complicated, not difficult. 
I have outlined a community need. 
May this House find the same sense of courage to act.  
Essentially, it would criminalize a second trespass.  
It is important to begin with a clear understanding of what trespass means. 
There is no need for any damage to be caused to the property. 
The civil remedies combined with provincial legislation cover most situations.  
The commission found this inadvisable. 
It basically seeks to make a second trespass a criminal offence.  
In these cases, there is serious harm or potential for harm caused by the trespasser. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
It would be an effective deterrent.  
This is a crime whose victims, more often than not, are women. 
Regrettably, the effectiveness of this legislation has since proven to be less than stellar.  
Several indicators illustrate this point.  
Some members may be asking why is this a problem. 
We need more than a codified definition of criminal harassment. 
Specifically, we need to do more to get tough on stalkers and protect innocent Canadians. 
This bill goes a long way to accomplish that end.  
This is a laudable aim. 
I urge all hon. members to support this legislation. 
Again I commend the hon. member who moved this motion.  
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I would like to summarize what we have heard today.  
In these situations it is contemplated that the warnings are given. 
Therefore it positively supports community peace.  
So the availability in those circumstances is often difficult. 
Then there is the ongoing viability. 
One of the other circumstances is public school grounds. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
ASIA PACIFIC ECONOMIC COOPERATION SUMMIT 
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
The member for Fredericton was indiscreet by talking about confidential information in a public place. 
It is immaterial what were his exact words used in that conversation. 
It does not matter who heard the conversation. 
I have not changed my mind. 
He should do the honourable thing and resign.  
Police officers work in difficult circumstances.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.13 p.m.)
