The Late Laurence Decore 
The Late Delia Grey 
Hon. Thelma J. Chalifoux :
Reviewing Canada's Foreign Policy 
Fifth Anniversary of Report of Special Joint Committee 
Hon. Jean-Robert Gauthier :
This was the first serious review of this aspect. 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
There was not even the consolation of inevitability to relieve the horror.  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is leave granted, honorable senators?  
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Canada-Europe Parliamentary Association 
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Wednesday next, November 24, 1999, I will move: 
That the Committee report no later than June 29, 2001.  
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Wednesday next, November 24, 1999, I will move:

Honourable senators, I give notice that on Wednesday next, November 24, 1999, I will move:

2. the mechanisms of implementing such new structural relationships; and, 
Privileges, Standing Rules and Orders 
Committee Authorized to Meet During Sittings of the Senate-Subject Matter of Meetings 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I received an agenda today. 
Plight of the Homeless-Government Policy 
Hon. Erminie J. Cohen :
Honourable senators, my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
That was last spring. 
Winter will soon be upon us. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I thank the honourable senator for that question. 
The determination of those resources will proceed as part of the normal budget process.  
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I do not know that it precluded those other directions. 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, my question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I certainly undertake to do that.  
Government Policy on Raising Interest Rates 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
In so doing, we must commend Governor Thiessen. 
I think he has done a remarkable job in seeking the appropriate balance. 
I leave that to the Governor of the Bank of Canada. 
I think he is doing a remarkable job.  
Quebec-Possible Conditions on Referendum-Government Position 
Hon. Jean-Claude Rivest :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
In fact, clarity formed an extremely important part of its decision.  
Separation is not an issue for any one province. 
It is an issue in which we and other parliamentarians need to be involved. 
The exact mechanics of those principles are a matter of ongoing discussion. 
What is the minister's opinion?  
Honourable senators, perhaps on both issues, clarity is important.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I am now hearing something new. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
When I say "the Government of Canada", I also include the Senate in that description. 
1994 White Paper-Government Policy 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, my question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
The leader can consult his colleague to his left if he thinks I am joking.  
I quote from pages 46 and 47 of that document: 
The end of this decade is five weeks away. 
The white paper was published about five years ago. 
Where does Canada stand on the question of helicopter replacement? 
Has the policy been changed? 
Is that not the position of the Government of Canada?  
It remains a top priority for the Minister of Defence. 
Replacement of Sea King Helicopter Fleet 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, some time ago the statement-of-requirement stage was completed. 
We have now heard that the statement of requirements is at hand. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, the 30-minute period for questions is now over. 
Is there leave to continue, honourable senators?  
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Honourable senators, my question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Winter will soon arrive in Kosovo as it will here. 
We have spent hundreds of millions of dollars helping to destroy the superstructure in Kosovo. 
Starvation, cold and lack of electricity are endangering many people. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
In fact, the full amount of the assistance recently announced totals approximately $180 million.  
We will follow the situation on an ongoing basis.  
However, I will certainly raise it with the minister.  
Pages Exchange Program with the House of Commons 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Her name is Cynara Corbin. 
Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Wilbert J. Keon :
Provinces have comparable legislation. 
In this respect, the bill is long overdue.  
First, patients believe that their health information will be kept confidential. 
It was not developed with the health system in mind. 
Honourable senators, let me be specific. 
The issue of what constitutes commercial activity is not clearly defined. 
There seems to be an assumption that this automatically excludes health records. 
Second, Bill C-6 fails to protect health information. 
On motion of Senator Kinsella, debate adjourned.  
Income Tax Conventions Implementation Bill, 1999 
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
In a communique dated as recently as October 20, Human Rights Watch: 
This is no way to achieve democracy.  
In another release the same day, Human Rights Watch said: 
The Government of Uzbekistan is assaulting religious freedom from all sides. 
The expulsion of Muslim students is yet another aspect of this campaign.  
Total trade was $18 million in 1998. 
There is no major Canadian investment in the country. 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
May I ask a question? 
We have had a number of these bills before. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
I think we are out of order here, honourable senators.  
Hon. P. Derek Lewis (The Hon. the Acting Speaker) :
Honourable senators, before we get to that point, we should pass second reading.  
I think we should hear from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.  
I will make it simple and move adjournment of the debate.  
Therefore, we can clear the way for Senator Kinsella's motion to adjourn the debate.  
On motion of Senator Kinsella, debate adjourned.  
Speech from the Throne 
Motion for Address in Reply-Debate Continued 
4th day of resuming debate ) 
They have all been a bit vague. 
They tend to be long on rhetoric and short on details. 
The youth of today are the leaders of tomorrow. 
They need the basic necessities of life.  
I know whom we have hurt. 
We have hurt children. 
Honourable senators, there are only 168 hours in a week.  
Children need their parents in all of their years. 
All of these, honourable senators, are very positive initiatives. 
For the moment, however, let us concentrate on the extended parental leave for parents. 
It is not only the mothers who will access this leave. 
This is a marvellous opportunity for fathers to access this leave as well. 
Does that really surprise us? 
This may be their first or second experience at school. 
That is why a national children's agenda is so very important. 
They both share a common message. 
Let us also not forget programs like Katimavik. 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
I am sorry to interrupt the honourable senator but her time has expired.  
May I have leave to continue, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
They are the youngsters who do not know what they want to do. 
That is what we need to encourage in this country.  
Youth transfers to adult court have neither increased nor decreased.  
In Norway, they have done away with children's jails altogether.  
The convention addresses the rights of children and youth under the age of 18. 
It also recognizes the important role of the family in raising children. 
Children are unique individuals. 
They are moving in the right direction. 
As a good teacher, I will be keeping my report card on this matter.  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Somehow, I was not surprised. 
Visible minorities really have never been a priority for this government. 
We are not the focus of great media interest, as are aboriginals. 
Instead, we appear to be simply just there:
We are a heterogeneous collection of individuals from every part of the globe. 
In the next few years, these numbers are set to rise to even greater levels. 
If this happens, they will then represent 20 per cent of our Canadian population.  
Honourable senators, look around you. 
Visible minorities make up 11 per cent of our population. 
How many visible minority university presidents do you know? 
The Public Service of Canada is a prime example. 
The situation is even more disgraceful the higher up the ladder you go. 
That is hard to believe.  
However, it is not a question of time; it is a question of attitude. 
Quite frankly, given their record to date, I do not think they do.  
The same situation prevails in our own backyard. 
If you are like me, that minute might stretch out to be two or three. 
I mention these two institutions as examples but there are many others. 
Visible minorities are being denied equitable employment opportunities. 
The same thing is happening in the area of race relations. 
Canadians like to maintain the fiction that they live in a kinder, gentler nation. 
We have no race riots here. 
Assassins do not gun down minority community leaders. 
Everyone gets along and there is space for all.  
The only problem with that is that it is not true. 
She was kicked, beaten, and drowned. 
Because she was a visible minority. 
Newspapers and television largely ignore the issue. 
Because the majority of Canadians are not interested. 
Honourable senators, visible minorities are not seeking a free ride. 
They are not asking for things others are denied. 
Surely we have progressed far enough over the last few decades to make this possible. 
Then again, perhaps I am being too optimistic.  
I replied that it was not really a question of choice. 
Honourable senators, I do have reservations. 
The glass employment ceiling is still here. 
So, no, I do not think much has changed. 
The answer to these questions does not lie in legislation - that much is obvious. 
We have all of this legislation and more, yet prejudice and racism persist. 
People have to learn about one another. 
They have to overcome their fears of one another. 
To do this, they need information. 
Information is the key to breaking down suspicion and destroying stereotypes. 
It brings community together; it promotes better understanding. 
However, information on its own will not solve everything. 
There must be commitment. 
Here, we come to the crux of the issue. 
I believe it is part of the federal government's responsibility to foster this commitment. 
It sets the example for others to follow. 
However, this is not happening.  
They are pretending that it does not exist. 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is leave granted for him to continue?  
Their problems are not worthy of attention. 
That is what Nobel Laureate John Polyani calls "the commercialization of science." 
Farmers have produced near record crops this year. 
Canada does not subsidize those agricultural producers.  
Now it says it cannot pay its portion of the top-up. 
To quote Morris Dorasch in Agri-Week : 
I would like to reiterate one point that was made during the emergency debate. 
The people on the land need cash in their hands before Christmas. 
That is the simple truth of it. 
There is no shortage of money, the Finance Minister has told us. 
The real shortage then is one of political will. 
The European Union's super budget is the one that covers farm subsidies.  
Perhaps it is time for farmers to put out their own tough message. 
I want to read from it: 
But under WTO rules small farmers are disappearing. 
And every mile the food travels causes environmental havoc . 
it requires far more packaging, putting added pressure on forests. 
It also requires new infrastructure...Anyway, 
Therefore, if we do not protect the family farm, we are losing a valuable resource. 
And the family farm, of course, is no longer small. 
In Canada, it could be 10,000 or 20,000 hectares.  
Some 30 months later, not one centre has been established.  
Even more important is the matter of child care. 
What would be the return on this investment? 
However, those are the brutal facts.  
Allow me to cite an example. 
However, it is not too late - we can still go ahead.  
The effect of pesticide exposure on children is not measured. 
Only the effect on adult males is considered.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
I am sorry to interrupt the honourable senator, but her speaking time has expired.  
Might I have leave to finish my remarks, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Regulatory authority was transferred to the Minister of Health. 
Five years later, no legislation has been introduced. 
Environment Canada's logical role was eliminated.  
The next issue I would like to address briefly is climate change. 
What I want to say is very simple. 
In 1960, it was less than $10 billion per year. 
Now, it is more than $70 billion. 
I practiced law in Abitibi. 
Ordinary employees are paid in Canadian dollars. 
Their employers, who export more to the United States, travel. 
I know that I am going to be told: "You come from Abitibi. 
The government seems barely perturbed. 
I am all in favour of Canadian tourists visiting their own country first. 
In order to create jobs, the government would have to reduce taxes. 
In a way, the government is spreading a half-truth. 
These cyclical lows in the value of our dollar cost us huge amounts of money.  
The dollar's weakness creates one of the most harmful elements of instability.  
The renowned economist described such a devaluation as stupidity. 
Such blockage does not create unanimity. 
Not being an economist, I do not want to recommend anything. 
However, I know that the dollar's ups and the downs creates instantaneous gain. 
I cannot think of the former without feeling sympathy for the latter. 
The loonie's sudden and pronounced fluctuations have a negative psychological effect. 
I have another point. 
Canadian ownership titles are fast disappearing. 
I bet it will be in Canada. 
Canada is enjoying enviable prosperity, but it is playing a dangerous game. 
Honestly, we have not yet reached that point. 
Only through such action will Canada be able to hang on to its reputation. 
All of us wish to pass on to our children a country in full prosperity. 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, Senator Cools has yielded the floor, and I wish to speak. 
In closing the debate on this motion, I should like to refer you to - 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
They provide as follows: 
Citation 875 specifically indicates that this is acceptable. 
The British practice also supports the acceptability of my motion. 
The reason for the acceptability of this practice is obvious. 
We are wasting their time and the taxpayers' money. 
The references can be found on pages 203 and 204, paragraphs 681 to 685. 
The authorities also discuss the types of instructions that are inadmissible. 
Paragraph 687 on page 204 of Beauchesne provides that: 
All committees have the power to call witnesses and to take evidence. 
Logic and efficiency justify its continued use.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Social Affairs, Science and Technology 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs , pursuant to notice of November 18, 1999, moved: 
2. Developments in Canada respecting the issues dealt with in the report; 
3. Developments in foreign jurisdictions respecting the issues dealt with in the report; and 
That the Committee submit its final report no later than June 6, 2000.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, would the Honourable Senator Carstairs entertain a question for clarification?  
Honourable senators, I certainly concur in Senator Carstairs' observations on this matter. 
On motion of Senator Kinsella, debate adjourned.  
Committee Authorized to Study State of Domestic and International Financial System 
Hon. Leo E. Kolber , pursuant to notice of November 18, 1999, moved: 
That the Committee submit its final report no later than December 31, 2000.  
The Senate adjourned until Wednesday, November 24, 1999, at 1:30 p.m.
