GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
I will go on to specific details within the report. 
That is one of the key problems.  
Another problem with DFO is it is very stagnant. 
It is one of the changes that has to happen.  
Why are they continuously ignored? 
They are continuously ignored because they do not have a voice in Ottawa. 
What is the government's response? 
A complete whitewash of this report.  
It is an absolute whitewash. 
Just get up and move.  
You may have to move.''  
They have worked it for hundreds and hundreds of years.  
It is the first time it has ever had to do that.  
Not one tiny little shrimp went to the town of Mulgrave. 
It is like a Klondike with the shrimp up there. 
Mulgrave got absolutely nothing.  
The same applies to the town of Canso with respect to turbot. 
In this report we talk about adjacency. 
These boats were catching tuna within a rock's throw of the dock in Canso. 
The result is that these people have to go on EI.  
They go right to social assistance. 
What is this government's response? 
What is going to happen then? 
These people even came up to Ottawa to speak to him. 
What was his answer? 
``I can't speak to these people''. 
He is the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. 
He receives one phone call and he is there. 
The fact is, this government, in its slippery backhanded way, has privatized the fishery. 
There was a gentleman from the great town of Sambro, near Halifax. 
He was 48 years old and had a grade five education. 
My choice was very simple. 
People who can earn $30,000 a year are extremely proud people. 
They are proud of who they are. 
This government wants to shut down their communities.  
This government does not have the courtesy to meet with these people. 
These people, to put it in ocean terms, are the salt of the earth. 
It is an absolute disgrace. 
I ask the Liberals to go to the east coast to meet with these people. 
I ask them to read it for themselves. 
They do not want the damn TAGS program. 
They do not want the useless EI programs. 
They do not want social welfare. 
They just want to work. 
These people have been working the resource for hundreds of years. 
All they want to do is work.  
There were nine Liberal members who voted for concurrence in the report at committee. 
They agreed to it. 
It is a unanimous report. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
He has three minutes and 56 seconds.  
Their own minister will not even go down to meet with these people. 
These people are now the responsibility of the provinces. 
What will the provinces do? 
They will download that responsibility to the municipalities. 
The municipalities will not be able to bear the burden. 
We have the result of the town of Canso. 
That is an absolute disgrace.  
I do not know how these Liberal people can sleep at night. 
These people are devastated and all he wants to do is help them.  
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
He stated that before the media, along with other members of the committee. 
I would like his comments on that. 
What was the response? 
That chairman was able to bring five political parties together. 
Regarding the structure at DFO it absolutely has to change. 
It has to start working with the people who work the resource. 
We should do that right away.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I listened attentively to my colleague. 
Essentially we are dealing with Liberal provincial administrations in the four Atlantic provinces. 
What does the government have against the premier of Nova Scotia? 
Mr. Gerard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):
I also want to congratulate him for caring about the groundfish fishery.  
The report was unanimously approved and signed by all committee members. 
We worked with diligence to produce that document. 
Mr. Speaker, I give praise to the nine Liberals who were on the previous committee. 
They worked very hard. 
It was a lot of fun to be part of that historical moment. 
The co-operation and communication among all of us were fantastic.  
We offer them hope and encouragement to go on with their lives.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
All sorts of problems are being experienced. 
We know how important salmon is to western Canada. 
Solutions must be found that are tailored to the situation over there. 
For many years now, a blanket approach has been taken. 
I think the federal government has to approach this problem from a very different angle. 
It has already received some very important messages from Canadian parliamentarians. 
It is high time it listened. 
This would also give local authorities improved control.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
However I have a question for him.  
Mr. Speaker, the present situation is rather desperate.  
I think we have had proof already. 
Nowadays, we no longer even dare refer to that objective.  
The communities are up against a brick wall, with no future in sight. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Before I entered politics I said that I would not allow politics to change me. 
It is very discouraging. 
I have talked to many people individually. 
We saw it happen with the APEC situation. 
The part not covered is the north shore.  
This report was unanimous on the whole situation. 
The committee did a thorough investigation.  
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
Very few salmon came up the river. 
This basic choice underlies a number of government policies. 
The first experiments in this regard were carried out in the Gaspe peninsula. 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I too would like to comment on this issue. 
I thank the member for moving concurrence. 
This matter goes a lot deeper than that.  
The government had a very, very significant problem with this.  
The government had to make extremely radical changes. 
The government had to remove the chairman of the committee. 
The government has made the committee ineffective. 
It has completely stripped the committee. 
This was the government's solution. 
It saw no other way around this. 
The government could not stop the committee from writing this report.  
They had an opportunity in committee to vote against this report. 
The issue goes even further than that. 
The government silenced the opposition members. 
We need to change how this whole system operates.  
Every member on the committee talked about that. 
They recognize what needs to be changed. 
They recognize that we have to move control from Ottawa out to the regions. 
Again the record speaks for itself.  
It goes on to this House. 
It makes this House ineffective. 
The Senate is ineffective. 
This is recognized by all Canadians. 
We hear over and over again that there needs to be change.  
It is the same thing in this House. 
They have to take their marching orders. 
The east coast report is written. 
What was the minister's response? 
The minister scoffed at it. 
He looked at this report and tossed it in the trash. 
The minister was not going to listen to this.  
First of all we had better fire the chairman. 
The chairman would appear to be part of the problem''. 
It clearly is not working. 
We have to look at that. 
What did the minister do? 
He tossed it in the trash. 
He threw it away.  
I want to go back to how ineffective the government is. 
He is the one who has control. 
He is the one who fired the chairman of the fisheries committee. 
That was stated by the member in the media.  
People across the country are listening to the committee. 
The media is listening to it. 
The media is reporting it. 
It is a clear demonstration of how this federation has to be reformed. 
They all followed behind like a bunch of sheep. 
Why did they go to the committee in the first place? 
Why were they even there?  
What the government is doing is inexcusable. 
I conclude by saying that this leads to a much bigger issue. 
The issue is that we have to reform this federation. 
We have to reform how the government works. 
There has to be change. 
This is a clear example of that.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have been listening to this debate for some time. 
Earlier this morning I listened to the member for Sackville-Eastern Shore. 
We have listened in terms of the consultation process. 
We heard from fishermen in earnest and we made very tough recommendations.  
They do not want to hear the facts. 
That is what we are getting from members opposite.  
He talked about the people who signed the report. 
There is a renewal strategy in place. 
Members opposite should recognize that rather than this rant without substance. 
We did strengthen management of a renewal strategy program. 
There is substantial change.  
The minister was recently given a conservation award in New York.  
He gave $6 million to the people who gave him the award.  
The member for Sackville-Eastern Shore is saying that is not correct. 
It was for conserving the fishery.  
He said that I had written a minority report. 
Let us fix the problem. 
They made no substantive changes to the fishery. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Has the junior minister ever seen a foreign observer report? 
I would put it that he never has. 
How do we know they are worth anything?  
He literally bought that award. 
It has nothing to do with conservation.  
The government is concerned about recommendation No. 9 on foreign observer reports. 
Have we ever seen a foreign observer report? 
Has the government ever seen a foreign observer report?  
The fact is that we were denied access to them. 
We put a motion to the committee asking for observer reports. 
The government offered the reports to us in camera. 
We were not given the observer reports. 
The Government of Canada kept them secret. 
It was because they are ineffective. 
They report when they get back to the port of their flag country. 
They are meaningless and the government would not release those reports.  
What did we learn? 
We learned there was no way the government would prosecute them or pursue them.  
That is all on the record.  
You were offered them and you refused them.  
We were offered them in a secret meeting. 
Yes, we were, in camera, which means in secret. 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Second, the NDP had a full opposition day last week. 
I do not, but I consider myself pretty daring and pretty gutsy.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Speaker, I recognize completely that the member withdrew his statement.  
Given the circumstances, I move: 
That the House do now proceed to orders of the day.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Actually the Liberals are quite incorrect. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That is really a question of debate. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That is not a point of order.  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I declare the motion carried.  
CANADA CUSTOMS AND REVENUE AGENCY ACT 
BILL C-43-TIME ALLOCATION MOTION 
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.): moved: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I declare the motion carried.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye:
You are the boss, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The superseding motion was to proceed to Government Orders. 
We will not be doing petitions until tomorrow.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
As with any new government undertaking, the cost aspect must always be considered. 
In both cases, they will be minimal.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
It has investigative tools. 
In short, it will ensure transparency''. 
But that transparency is never there.  
I will mention two cases where there were problems. 
One is the Somalia inquiry. 
The commission will get to the bottom of this''. 
In my opinion, we must oppose the establishment of such an agency.  
Already, this would result in significant savings.  
There is a danger here. 
This is the minister's responsibility, and one he cannot easily slough off.  
This is totally unacceptable. 
If that is the hidden desire of the government, it is totally evil.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I did not hear a member for the Reform Party on your list. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We will take that under advisement.  
Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam, Lib.):
The minister will continue to be the person named to exercise those authorities. 
It can require a further in-depth review at any time.  
Fairness is an essential foundation to the entire revenue administration. 
That compliance rate can be even higher.  
One also knows that complacency is no way to deal with fairness. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
That would be very useful.  
The provinces can buy in. 
I have three or four concerns about that. 
My first concern is that this is supposed to be a federal-provincial agency. 
He is concerned about federal-provincial relations. 
My impression is that the answer would be none. 
Not a single province has bought into this agency- 
We are heading into a Quebec election- 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom: -and we are hearing a lot about federal-provincial co-operation.  
A Liberal across the way says ``So what?'' 
It is no wonder the Prime Minister is stumbling around making all kinds of mistakes. 
He is aiding Mr. Bouchard with some of his comments.  
I am glad that medicare was referred to. 
This case is the opposite of the medicare example. 
There is no need to talk about the new right in this country. 
The alternative is right there. 
The united right in this country is the Liberal Party.  
That is what the Liberal government across the way has done.  
A byelection was held last night. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sorry but the member's time for debate at this time is over.  
Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert, BQ):
Why will they be shaking? 
The Bloc Quebecois totally disagrees with the bill. 
One of the most important prerogatives of modern government is the power to tax. 
Bill C-43 means savings, we are told. 
We have our doubts. 
Will the agency's commissioner have millions of dollars in annual income? 
These are some of the questions we have.  
It is obvious what the government is up to. 
He will be confronted more or less with a fait accompli. 
They will be dictating to the minister what he has to do.  
The government is on the wrong track here. 
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
We cannot continue to live with significant inefficiencies within our administrative structure. 
It collected a sum total of about $153 billion. 
However, the reality is that it undertakes its functions quite effectively.  
In Canada today we have developed a multiplicity of taxes and tax regimes. 
It is small business week. 
One of them is the pure complexity of complying with our taxation system.  
As Canada is an exporting country it causes great inefficiencies as well. 
It makes us less competitive as a nation.  
We talk a lot in this House about the underground economy. 
Quite frankly, people cannot afford the compliance. 
I suggest that one of the reasons is it needs a certain inertia. 
This is done for corporate structures but not on an individual basis. 
We have to catch up with the times. 
I am surprised by that comment. 
The reality is we are leaders, that we are leading in this area of efficiency. 
Of course all the provinces today are part of the medicare system. 
We as politicians quite frankly have not been able to do that. 
Three ministers along with our minister had signed on. 
So we can see how this is starting to evolve. 
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
A brand new revenue agency, that is what Canadians have been clamouring for. 
I think the minister is confused. 
Just to be certain I will spell out why this situation exists. 
My hon. colleague from Kings-Hants has outlined the many shortcomings of this bill. 
The minister has said there is only one taxpayer. 
The provinces will not have greater powers and authority with this new agency.  
Coincidentally there are only three provinces in Canada with Liberal governments. 
Why should they be helpful? 
The new agency is to assume all these responsibilities. 
That is a very big if. 
You still have three minutes in your excellent discourse. 
I know you will want to seek the floor right after question period. 
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):
The IODE has been a part of my community since 1909. 
I thank the women of the IODE for their patriotism and their charity. 
They are the people who have made Canada the best country in the world.  
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-East York, Lib.):
I am referring to the killer known as breast cancer.  
These figures are frightening and they hit close to home.  
As the minister stated, the government's renewed- 
The hon. member for Battlefords-Lloydminster.  
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, there is a growing farm income crisis in the country. 
We have to address the shortcomings in the net income stabilization program.  
CANADIAN NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR THE BLIND 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
My town hall meeting was well attended. 
My learned colleagues on the other side of the House should listen up. 
I can safely state that my riding supports this- 
The hon. member for Mercier.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
But we must do more than just pay tribute to small business owners. 
We must wish them the strength to make it through another year.  
The number of businesses declaring bankruptcy is still far too high. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):
The hon. member for Dartmouth.  
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
The hon. member for London West.  
WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH 
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, October is Women's History Month in Canada.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
That is not even close.  
The sulphur tax is a carbon tax by any other name. 
They have all been deceived again. 
The hon. member for South Shore.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
It is an embarrassment to see the greenery that decorates these halls during Christmas. 
It is inexcusable that this travesty continues. 
I will keep that in mind.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is a debate going on at this time.  
When the budget comes down we will know.  
For the first time in generations we are dealing with a surplus.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We have been reducing them. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That is the Reform Party's policy.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
In three weeks the finance minister is planning to meet with the employment insurance commission. 
He only has until mid November. 
Where is the debate, in this House or just in his head?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We reduced them in 1996. 
That is what we have done.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I welcome this opportunity to question the Prime Minister today. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The leader of the Bloc Quebecois.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
But I think that is something the Prime Minister does not understand.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We, however, have been dealing with one issue at a time.  
For 30 years, Quebec struggled with its school board problem. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
The facts are otherwise. 
Why try to silence the scientists? 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
I encouraged them to attend and to testify before the parliamentary committee.  
They did and they testified in full and answered all the questions.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
My question is very simple. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member talks about spinning. 
Let us bear in mind what the issue is here. 
The issue here is whether those scientists appeared before a committee to testify. 
They answered all the questions fully and I urged them to do so. 
Bear in mind also that what we are talking about here is rBST. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am not prepared to put any lives at risk. 
The chief of the air staff has examined this situation very carefully. 
He is a professional man, a very caring man. 
He knows the circumstances under which this decision had to be made. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Why are the crews being given this option?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Otherwise, why would it be paying interest?  
Why is it paying interest?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That is what we are in the process of doing.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
That is what he seems to be saying.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The issue is what torturous minds develop economic policy for the Reform Party.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I sit in the House of Commons. 
It is my duty to do so and I answer all questions.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
The hon. member for Temiscamingue.  
Mr. Speaker, let me say whom the member should ask to shut up. 
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
At the same time 400,000 Canadians have been taken off the tax rolls. 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Scorn is the weapon of the weak, Mr. Speaker. 
The member for Dauphin-Swan River has the floor.  
THE CANADIAN BROADCASTING CORPORATION 
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister just cannot stand dissent. 
Colleagues, we are taking up a lot of time with my standing and sitting. 
Who is in line to be the next CBC president? 
That is the position of the government.  
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
Why is the Prime Minister trying to control the CBC? 
Whatever happened to freedom of the press?  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
It was to abolish it.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, it is hardly appropriate for the Bloc Quebecois to talk about jealousy. 
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I allege three things.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
It created the Public Complaints Commission. 
It has operated effectively for 10 years. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
This commission was derailed in the spring. 
This commission was derailed in September. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the solicitor general.  
It hits small detachments especially hard.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Under ASD government employees are always sitting ducks and all services are defunct.  
Why is it always Saskatchewan that is devastated? 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
This has happened many times before. 
It is not unusual. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we do not put lives in danger.  
This government did the right thing. 
It cancelled that contract. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
The government continues to risk lives. 
We cannot get them back.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
They will do that and they will do it with safe equipment.  
But we have the tools to do the job.  
Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will tell the member what we did. 
They did exactly that.  
What did they say? 
They made it clear that Health Canada has not approved BST. 
It has been under consideration by Health Canada for nine years. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is also for the Minister of Finance. 
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
The member is quite right. 
We have two major concerns in this area. 
They are very serious concerns for us. 
I thank the member for the question.  
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
CANADA CUSTOMS AND REVENUE AGENCY ACT 
He has three minutes left if he wishes to use them in debate.  
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Ontario is looking to attain greater authority over its tax levers. 
Some of the provinces feel this agency may ultimately lead to less. 
The same thing applies here. 
Quite frankly Canadians are not interested in such a situation occurring. 
We can offload a lot of things but we cannot really offload leadership. 
That is what the government has tried to do.  
It will not help us develop a fairer tax system. 
It will not achieve the goals of a flatter tax system. 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
Ministerial accountability and parliamentary control would remain intact. 
What is the point of this agency? 
In a ten-minute speech, it is difficult to cover all the bases. 
I would like to list the main reasons for rejecting this agency. 
However, reaction to the new agency was mixed, to say the least. 
We do not need to spell it out. 
They know, for they live with it every day.  
The employees of Revenue Canada are concerned and anxious. 
I am not sure this agency will look after the public interest.  
We in Quebec already have our own department of revenue- 
I am sorry to interrupt you, but I thought you were concluding. 
In any case, your time is up. 
Perhaps you could come back for the next round.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
In fact participation in the agency is fully voluntary. 
As you know, Mr. Speaker, there is only one taxpayer. 
In addition, governments would save between $37 million and $62 million in administrative costs. 
This will apply to Quebec as it will to all other provinces.  
It also administers the national child benefit. 
There is ample precedent for this co-ordination and consolidation of services.  
The last criterion demonstrates an important aspect of these agreements. 
The agency is currently undertaking joint studies with some provinces to examine specific possibilities.  
That is important to note and certainly something all Canadians want.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
This is a good example of unnecessary meddling. 
I happen to have the taxation data centre for western Canada in my riding. 
This government is now adding insult to injury. 
I said earlier that I thought this was completely unnecessary. 
The major stakeholders are not buying it. 
Ontario, Quebec and Prince Edward Island are firmly opposed. 
B.C. and Saskatchewan have not endorsed the concept. 
Canadian businesses have major reservations about the proposed agency. 
We do not want to have this kind of system in our country.  
We have seen the downside of privatization in a number of other instances. 
There is an idea. 
This is not many years away. 
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
Hence the need for a new framework.  
The authorities governing confidentiality are clearly set out in legislation. 
They will not be changed by this bill.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
I would like to emphasize a number of elements of particular concern to me. 
He suggested that the public should be reassured about that. 
Who are the agency's clients? 
And just what does recovery mean? 
People pay their taxes voluntarily, because they know the law. 
This is rather serious. 
It is more than a change in culture. 
But what will this bill produce? 
The worst of the private sector will be bureaucracy instead of efficiency.  
It has to do with the size of an enterprise. 
He can delegate them to a commissioner or any other employee.  
Instead of generating confidence, the opposite will be true. 
Much can be said about this. 
From now on, they will be in a completely submissive position. 
There are some really juicy parts to this bill. 
I absolutely must discuss the issue of privacy. 
The right to privacy is a fundamental human right. 
We must not forget that. 
But for that trust to exist, there must be accountability. 
On what grounds will the agency be judged cost-effective? 
How will the public's rights-this has to be addressed-be defended? 
How will these two issues be reconciled? 
This, however, will no longer be the case.  
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
We have an obligation to do that for all people across Canada.  
However there are problems with the legislation we are debating. 
They all voted against closure. 
I will read some quotes. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
This time we are talking about a major piece of legislation-. 
Shame on those Tories across the way.  
This was on November 16, 1992 in the House.  
We are all elected to the House. 
We all have a right to have our voices heard in the House.  
It goes on and on and on.  
I think they should be ashamed of themselves.  
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Do we really want Ottawa involved in our property taxes? 
Do we really want to put this much power into one government agency? 
The elitist and anti-democratic proposal was withdrawn in the face of furious opposition.  
A lot can go very wrong over such a broad expanse of time.  
The agency could jeopardize the public's personal privacy. 
We ended up with a terrible sales tax in New Brunswick with the HST. 
It is important to point that out. 
It came with the harmonization of the taxes. 
I think we have to look at that.  
We know that, with an agency, the service will not improve. 
That has been proven in many areas. 
It is also a reason for cutting more jobs. 
A more probable direction would see the imposition of user fees. 
User fees are something we see more and more of everywhere. 
He was not able to get an answer to that question.  
Perhaps for Parks Canada it would be all right. 
It is a way for government to cut and to bring down salaries. 
It is another word for privatization.  
We must be concerned about these issues. 
This has to stop.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
The federal government seems to be abdicating its primary responsibilities.  
Is there no end to this government's absurdity and irresponsibility?  
Control over this organization was transferred away from the government when Canada Post was established. 
This minister is also the minister responsible for Public Works and Government Services Canada.  
Canada Post rents a number of buildings from Public Works and Government Services Canada. 
In my riding, the tenant is not too happy. 
This post office has been for sale for many years. 
It is an embarrassment to Canada Post.  
Canada Post says ``But, you know, this building is not our property. 
It belongs to Public Works Canada''. 
The minister did say ``to modernize the federal public service''. 
He should come to Disraeli. 
After the building in Disraeli is sold, what will Canada Post do? 
The Prime Minister should get out of his bubble and meet ordinary people. 
There is another point I want to make. 
He is one of the most vulgar and rude members of the Liberal Party.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
The government is unwilling to be flexible.  
Let us say that this agency is a good thing. 
People would say this is a provincial minister who is out to lunch. 
But he is not the only one. 
This is a debate that has occurred over a number of years. 
There are two sides to the debate. 
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
The agency would develop its own staffing program in accordance with certain stated principles. 
Employees would remain public servants during and after the transition.  
Agency employees would still have access to jobs in federal government departments. 
The agency would provide similar access to its jobs for persons in government departments. 
Term employees would continue under the same terms and conditions as before.  
What would life be like for employees in the new agency?  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
By stealth this government abandons this role and responsibility to the private sector.  
Many in Canada have commented on the government's agenda. 
I quote from a paragraph written by Daniel Drache and Meric Gertler: 
No area of government policy has been spared. 
Is that not what we are dealing with? 
Is that not what is really behind it all? 
Is that not why so many Canadians are concerned?  
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
We are here to express our views and that of our constituents. 
My reasons for taking issue with this bill are many. 
Nav Canada is a good example. 
I cannot even question the minister on the future of this tower. 
ADM is in charge of airports. 
The Canadian Wheat Board looks after wheat. 
Where do the interests of private enterprises lie? 
Often with their pockets and their shareholders. 
Very rarely are their interests common ones. 
Very rarely are they the interests of voters and of the public in general. 
There is nothing wrong with the government making money, but it has responsibilities. 
That is my first reason for opposing the bill.  
It is the same throughout Canada.  
What will become of government employees? 
Are you a Liberal? 
We also know the patronage havens of the Liberal Party. 
Earlier, I heard the member for Verdun-Saint-Henri hurl insults at my colleague. 
Quite a few are appointed by the governor in council, actually by cabinet.  
He used to lash out at opposition members because they were telling the truth. 
This is not in keeping with Quebec's history or culture.  
That is what Quebec wants. 
Now, to look at small and medium size businesses. 
But that is not what the problem is. 
It goes further than that. 
Another very significant aspect is the problem of privacy. 
Imagine if this agency controlled all of Canada. 
``Big Brother is watching you''. 
It runs counter to public opinion. 
The public is tired of being watched all the time. 
The agency will serve as a sort of cover. 
Job performance will deteriorate. 
Imagine the power of the commissioner of the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency. 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Whenever I see that happen I have to take a second look. 
I have done that.  
The member argues that the big bad government is bringing down the hammer. 
The member says shame on the Liberals. 
They just might be surprised. 
That is simply not true. 
Let me give an example. 
They are provincial politicians. 
That is not in their interest. 
They want to destroy our federation. 
We understand where they are coming from.  
Why do Bloc members not admit that? 
Revenue Canada has not received a single, unequivocal no from any other province. 
I want to share some quotes. 
Mr. Don Downe, minister of finance for Nova Scotia, said: 
That sure does not sound like no to me. 
That sounds like federal-provincial co-operation. 
The details of this framework make good business sense- 
And I know the NDP does not understand: 
He does not have his head stuck in the sand. 
He has left the door wide open to negotiate with the federal government. 
He is being responsible in this instance. 
Let us go to New Brunswick. 
So far I have not found one on my journey across Canada. 
NDP members would rather fabricate the information. 
It is just not true. 
The hon. Edmond Blanchard, minister of finance for New Brunswick, said: 
I want to reiterate New Brunswick's full support for this initiative.  
Does that sound like a maybe? 
Does that sound like he has some doubts? 
It is pretty clear.  
It cannot get any better than this. 
I quote the minister of finance, Eric Cline, who said: 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
I know it will be short because we will probably run out of time.  
Someone is happy anyway. 
I will address a couple of points. 
However, I have had people tell me of some other priorities related to efficiency. 
One priority that comes immediately to mind is the income tax system. 
It is complicated and long. 
GST can be an acronym for more than just the goods and services tax.  
I have spoken to a number of small business people. 
I do not know whether the government is sucking or blowing. 
It certainly does not know whether it is coming or going. 
We do not know whether the government is coming or going. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
(The House divided on the amendment, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the amendment defeated.  
The next question is on the main motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Is there agreement to proceed in such a fashion?  
Noted and so ordered.  
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
(Bill read the second time and referred to a committee) 
PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTION AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS ACT 
Is there agreement to proceed in such a fashion?  
Mr. Speaker, the members of the Bloc Quebecois support this motion.  
Mr. Speaker, NDP members vote yes to this motion.  
Mr. Speaker, the members of our party vote no on this motion.  
(The House divided on the amendment, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the amendment defeated.  
FOREIGN PUBLISHERS ADVERTISING SERVICES ACT 
Is there agreement to proceed in such a fashion?  
It will be noted, of course, that this question is on the amendment. 
The hon. opposition whip.  
It is a good one.  
Mr. Speaker, the members of the Bloc Quebecois oppose this motion.  
Mr. Speaker, members of the NDP vote no to this motion.  
Mr. Speaker, the members of our party vote no on this motion.  
(The House divided on the amendment, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the amendment defeated.  
ROYAL CANADIAN MINT ACT 
Is there agreement to proceed in such a fashion?  
Mr. Speaker, Reform Party members present vote no to this motion.  
Mr. Speaker, the members of the Bloc Quebecois vote yea on this motion.  
Mr. Speaker, NDP members present tonight vote no to this motion.  
Mr. Speaker, the members of the Progressive Conservative Party vote nay on this motion.  
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
(Bill read the second time and referred to a committee) 
ALLOTED DAY-EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE 
The question is on the amendment.  
(The House divided on the amendment, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the amendment negatived. 
The next question is on the main motion.  
Is there agreement to proceed in such a fashion?  
(The House divided on the motion, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the motion negatived.  
This motion goes right to the heart of equality. 
I believe that is a goal to which we can all subscribe. 
This is just the sort of thing that business and industry do not need. 
This demonstrates how misguided enforced equity really is.  
As a result, it ends up with a lot of regulations and no solutions. 
The firearms registry is a prime example of that. 
Hiring quotas place unnecessary obstacles in the career path of Canadian workers. 
It is exactly the opposite of what the government has intended it to do.  
Canada has skilled and competent workers. 
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
Allow me to express my doubts, because I have a newspaper article here.  
What he used to preach here, he put in practice in Quebec. 
In the red book, the Liberals were very critical of this kind of appointment. 
But who was recently appointed to the Canada Post Corporation? 
There have been others. 
They are thanking the friends of the Liberal Party. 
Mr. Robichaud was elected in Beausejour. 
He sat with us here during the 35th Parliament. 
He did them because he knew that the payoff would be substantial.  
He was never informed of any vacancies. 
This amounts to quite a bit of money. 
It pays to be a Liberal.  
Mr. Tony Ianno (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):
We vigorously support and promote excellence in the workplace. 
This is not a myth.  
Canadians are proud of Canada's linguistic and multicultural diversity. 
We actively promote tolerance and acceptance of differences. 
We have a global reputation as a caring and equitable society. 
The spirit of employment equity further enriches that reputation. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
But unfortunately we do not live in a perfect world.  
The discrimination these people face is real. 
It still occurs today. 
It is not a thing of the past.  
Employment equity does not prevent white males from getting jobs. 
The Conservative Party fails to see how such an act can be discriminatory. 
That is why the Progressive Conservative Party cannot support this motion.  
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia, Lib.):
We should be proud of our leadership in this area.  
This motion would have us turn back the clock, no doubt about it. 
It must not stand in the way of progress.  
I must therefore urge the member for Wetaskiwin to withdraw his motion. 
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP):
Unfortunately, the wording of his motion seems designed to obscure this fact.  
The legislation does not set out hiring quotas. 
There is also nothing in the legislation requiring employers to hire unqualified candidates. 
Unfortunately this has not proven to be the case.  
It is these barriers employment equity seeks to eliminate.  
Finding out about a large number of jobs depends on networking. 
In other words, who you know.  
Across Canada 1.4 million people are unemployed. 
They promised public employees they would receive a fair settlement. 
Five years later public employees are still waiting.  
There is an old saying ``justice delayed is justice denied''. 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Merit and ability should be the only things that matter in the workplace. 
These processes are the human rights commission and the courts of law. 
We should all be given the same opportunity to succeed. 
Allow me to comment briefly on some of my past experiences. 
I have faced discrimination in both of these countries on numerous occasions. 
I could have given up. 
I could have thrown in the towel. 
Because of the very fact that I hate discrimination. 
I hate it whenever anyone's dignity is robbed. 
Everyone should have equal rights.  
I would venture to say yes. 
Is this necessarily a bad thing? 
I would venture to say no because this is their choice. 
Would we force it? 
Would this not create an artificial correction with disastrous consequences? 
Affirmative action programs fail to take these factors into consideration.  
This should be the solution, not affirmative action programs.  
This is a simple statement. 
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their participation in this debate. 
As a matter of fact he even had some examples that he cited for Hansard .  
I agree with that assessment. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
All the cuts are making things miserable in the region.  
You know, tonight, we voted on the business of small weeks. 
I was disappointed to see the Liberals voting against. 
I was also disappointed to see how Liberal members voted. 
This is why we are inviting the minister to come and visit us. 
What is he afraid of? 
Is he afraid of that? 
He ought to come and find out right away for himself what is going on. 
I believe it is important.  
Last week, 40 women employed by fishers lost their employment insurance. 
All of these work for small family businesses and all lost their employment insurance. 
They have to get through the winter. 
Until then, people must not be punished. 
They must not have what they are entitled to taken away from them. 
There is $20 billion in the employment insurance fund. 
Yesterday, that is what the people of Restigouche were asking me. 
Once again I am asking the minister- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I must interrupt the hon. member, for his time is up.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
So far we think the new program is having some success.  
In New Brunswick this initiative has helped to create over 2,300 jobs.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 7.20 p.m.)
