The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
When shall the bill be read the third time? 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
We will then pass it along to you in whatever form that may be''.  
But if no investigation is made how can such presumptions be reasonably made? 
Those 135 investigators are stretched too thinly. 
I urge this government to remedy the situation.  
Reform members will therefore support it as a housekeeping exercise.  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
No one wishes to see any accident happen in the transportation sector. 
In Canada, we have a bicameral system. 
We hope this system can be replaced, but we have our doubts. 
The Senate would no longer exist.  
We know what this means.  
Hon. David M. Collenette:
Evidently, we are hitting a nerve. 
Hon. David M. Collenette:
He is a great Canadian.  
That is a reward.  
As for political rewards, there are sometimes ambiguities. 
His name is Benoit Bouchard. 
He was the Minister of Transport in the Mulroney years. 
Mulroney appointed him Canadian ambassador to Paris. 
That about wraps it up for me. 
Rest up with your friends and families. 
There are always unfortunate accidents. 
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
The NDP opposed the original act for three reasons. 
We support these aspects of the bill. 
The safety board is still underfunded. 
Yet the safety board only employs 135 people to investigate these occurrences. 
This is a threat to public safety. 
This would leave the board with even fewer working hours. 
Bill S-2 would make these submissions secret. 
The Liberals should have used this opportunity to remove this ridiculous provision from the act. 
Instead they are trying to hide it from the Canadian people.  
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
Bill S-2 was introduced in the Senate on September 30, 1997. 
Liberal senators made two amendments to Bill S-2. 
One was a very good one and one was a very poor amendment. 
The second amendment made by a Liberal was not such a good idea. 
The government in this case was asleep at the wheel. 
It should have been better prepared to deal with the bill. 
It has been a long while in the making. 
It has been promised that the government will delete the amendment today. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The question is on the motion for third reading of Bill S-2. 
Pursuant to order made earlier this day, the motion is deemed carried on division.  
Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):
These are indeed special places. 
It includes representatives of the local community as well as of Parks Canada. 
This was one of the raisons d'etre for the establishment of the park. 
We have worked diligently within Canada to ensure that we have protected the calving grounds. 
We have asked that the Americans do this. 
I touched on my second point in my introduction. 
We decide collectively as Canadians to protect certain special places in this country. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on Bill C-38. 
Some of these isotopes will not go away for hundreds of thousands of years. 
I would strongly recommend the government look into that.  
In a nutshell, we have to give endangered species a home. 
We cannot kill them. 
There are many serious threats, from the destruction of our habitat to trafficking. 
There is the issue of lack of support for our conservation staff. 
This is a very sensible and eco-friendly way to preserve and expand the parks.  
It enables people to support themselves.  
Species do not know boundaries. 
They cross over municipal, provincial and national boundaries. 
They need to be protected within that context. 
The trafficking situation is appalling. 
They are not getting the support of the justice system. 
One example is to put a 2% levy on hotels deriving benefits from the parks. 
In this way we would not have to ask the government for more money. 
The money would be there.  
Hunting is actually useful. 
It might sound cold hearted but it is pragmatic and it does work.  
We have a number of opportunities within our midst. 
The power of the federal government is enormous. 
It has to sit down with its provincial counterparts to establish jurisdictional differences. 
Where that has been done on the prairies it has worked very well.  
The world needs a leader in working with other countries in this area.  
This did not involve an encroachment on the park. 
The minister could have taken a leadership role. 
We will now proceed to Statements by Members.  
Mr. Carmen Provenzano (Sault Ste. Marie, Lib.):
Small businesses are the backbone of the Canadian economy. 
The joint CFIB and CLHIA announcement brings this important initiative full circle.  
I congratulate the Minister of Finance for his leadership in this regard. 
The result of this co-operative and innovative effort- 
The hon. member for Calgary Centre.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
Companies such as IBM Canada Ltd. and the Evergreen Foundation are participating in this consortium. 
MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
The R-2000 program is not to blame. 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
CANADIAN CENTRE FOR EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS 
Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
Canadians must have a voice.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Today I extend thanks to all the firefighters in northern Canada for protecting our communities.  
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this has been a successful year for parliament. 
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
The minister needs to check his facts. 
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Accueil Bonneau makes a magnificent contribution to the lives of thousands of disadvantaged Montrealers. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
For fulfilling the election promise to elect a senator, f . 
The Prime Minister makes appointments and makes excuses.  
For fixing the Young Offenders Act, f . 
The assignment is now over one year late.  
For providing hope to victims of crime, f . 
They only talk but nothing has been done.  
In basic accounting, f . 
For cutting government spending, f . 
They cut mostly in transfers to provinces.  
For caring and compassion, f . 
For fixing up the problems in the military, double f . 
For planning to reduce the debt and interest payments, f . 
For attendance in the House, d . 
For respect and deportment, f .  
With ten f s and one d they fail. 
The next class, the Reform class, will pass.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
He blames the victim. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
I want this minister to answer the question. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
It is not my understanding of what he said at all. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
I do not think he is doing that at all.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, maybe the minister ought to read the newspapers today. 
The minister has prejudiced the case. 
He has questioned Private Dickey's testimony in public. 
I want to ask the government what specific plans it has. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
The investigation is not completed.  
He wants to play this out in the headlines. 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
So they can get involved, but we cannot- 
The hon. member for Rimouski-Mitis.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
In a democracy, its not uncommon to have different takes on the same reality. 
Infallibility is to be found in Rome, not in Ottawa.  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
So if they spread untruths, we will clarify things. 
That is what we are saying.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
It is not a propaganda machine. 
Propaganda is part of the mentality of the separatist Bloc members who want- 
The hon. member for Vercheres now has the floor.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, on the contrary, we have great confidence in Jean Charest. 
THE ATLANTIC GROUNDFISH STRATEGY 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  
Many thousands of Canadian families and their communities are facing a form of extinction.  
When will the government appreciate the full gravity of the situation? 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Why is the government abandoning its responsibility for the people on the east coast? 
Mr. Speaker, I assume with that rhetoric there is some emotion. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Speaker, yesterday the share value of Canada's dollar hit record lows.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):

Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
The hon. Minister of Veterans Affairs.  
We are very much aware of the situation. 
We have heard him and members in the House. 
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
This process takes time because we have to consult with the province. 
It has to be right and it has to be done soon.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
The people of British Columbia deserve to know. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let us clarify another thing. 
We have made progress. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Finance. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
There is a simple solution to that problem. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE 
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
He was murdered within months.  
Something is very wrong.  
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Producers are desperate for help.  
The industry is still waiting for an answer from the Minister of Agriculture. 
Hon. Gilbert Normand (Secretary of State (Agriculture and Agri-Food)(Fisheries and Oceans), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her interest in this issue.  
Breeders currently receive $150 for ordinary sheep and $300 for purebred sheep. 
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
The international community has an obligation to act and to act quickly. 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):

I am here to tell you that this is not the case.  
The hon. Minister of Public Works.  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
However, deaths of nine more Mexicans on Wednesday shattered such bland assurances.  
My question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
I thank him for bringing this matter to the attention of the House.  
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Mr. Speaker, a serious situation exists in the marketplace today. 
My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Mr. Speaker, that is an unacceptable answer. 
They can now deduct those initiatives. 
They can demand that these items be compliant and they will do so. 
Thousands of young Canadians are looking for work to complete their education.  
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
HOUSING CONSTRUCTION IN NUNAVIK 
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Indian Affairs.

That terminates question period for today.

This petition has been signed by 224 Canadians.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, this is something of a special occasion.  
Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the Gouvernment in the House of Commons, Lib.):
I am informed as follows: 
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on point of order. 
Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to say that we just did.  
I trust that clarifies that matter.  
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, all parties have been consulted. 
I wish to seek unanimous consent for the following. 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
This region is highlighted by a number of spectacular features. 
Wildlife in this region is mainly comprised of summer migrants. 
Musk ox, wolves and caribou can be found in this region. 
Most candidate sites are identified by Parks Canada.  
The Inuvialuit are to be praised for their conservation efforts. 
The people of Paulatuk have traditionally lived off the land. 
However, my initial decision has not changed for a number of reasons.  
Will this government ever learn to treat people with respect and dignity? 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
The process began with a letter on March 10, 1989.  
Seven years of analysis, consultation and negotiation followed. 
That was the start of the birth of a park.  
Then, after much fanfare, nothing happened. 
Suddenly Tuktut Nogait became an issue again. 
The anomaly proved to be a worthwhile investment within the boundaries.  
It was quite a confusing state of affairs.  
The government was not fulfilling the promise it had made.  
Failure to do so would be a great demise.  
I bring members back to the Tuktut Nogait National Park. 
Why are those proposed regions not included in the bill? 
Employment and training opportunities must be considered.  
Development is a crucial risk for these national parks. 
But ecology means the home of your environment. 
This environment and this land must be respected. 
The national parks are a sacred way of protecting this land for future generations. 
I call upon other parties to take heed. 
It must also deal with the inequity. 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
And, seventh, to preserve the park's ecological integrity.  
The park will be managed jointly with the Inuvialuit community. 
On March 30, the government introduced Bill C-38 at first reading. 
Let us look now at the arguments from both sides.  
The Inuvialuit were prepared to accept the findings of a study on this.  
Canada is also trying to limit mining projects on the American side of the border.  
Here are some of these questions.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be dividing my time with the member for Calgary East.  
Creation of the new park of Tuktut Nogait is a good idea. 
We should have some tundra hills preserved for posterity. 
However, I would hasten to point out that this site certainly is not unique. 
There are hundreds of thousands of square kilometres of virtually identical terrain. 
The boundaries that were arbitrarily developed are not necessarily the ideal ones. 
Nevertheless the government in its wisdom has decided to press on. 
But why not start out correctly from the very beginning? 
There should have been an assessment. 
This should be true of any new park.  
It requires a bit of science and a little thought.  
I have seen them browsing in the shadow of a mine headframe. 
There is not much glory, not much honour, going out and shooting a caribou. 
It is like going out and milking a cow on the farm.  
Anyway, that battle has been won.  
Eventually I think they will get their airstrip back. 
The natural condition of the prairie land is to be grazed by large ungulate. 
They used to be called buffalo. 
We have no buffalo any more. 
They unlawfully impound stray livestock, for example. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
I take exception to the hon. member's statements on a number of occasions. 
I beg the member to reconsider this. 
Sport hunting and sustenance hunting are two different forms of hunting.  
There is no honour in that. 
We no longer have buffalo, as the hon. member said. 
Wascana means piles of bones.  
Member spoke in Cree ] 
There is no honour in that. 
The Reform Party time and time again has tried to be accountable. 
This government has made cutbacks that have had an impact on Parks Canada. 
That is all I said. 
The member was talking about wiping out the buffalo with automatic weapons. 
But that is a sideline.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
We have supported this bill in the past. 
I would say that both sides have good arguments. 
It is important to recognize that national parks are an ecological treasure. 
We are the custodians of this ecological treasure for our future generations. 
It is the Banff National Park at the foot of the Rockies. 
A tremendous amount of traffic goes through that park.  
I have noticed time after time that the user fee keeps rising.  
This is a cause for concern.  
Do we think they do not wish to comply with Canadian laws? 
It is important we recognize this fact.  
But I am talking about general usage.  
I would like to wish a happy summer to all my colleagues in the House. 
Go back to your constituencies and work for your constituents. 
I would like to pass a motion to adjourn the House for the summer.  
That will happen in due course in any event. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
I wish my very best to all hon. members of this House.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
What is the current day rate to enter Banff National Park? 
Mr. Speaker, yes, it is pretty expensive. 
I remember when I was there it used to be $1 per day. 
Now it is $10 per day and $10 per day is pretty expensive. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have two points to make. 
The Reform Party spoke about its support for the ecological integrity of the Arctic region. 
This park is certainly one way of guaranteeing it.  
I look forward to a safe summer.  
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. 
Is the House ready for the question?  
The question is on the motion for third reading of Bill C-38. 
Pursuant to order made earlier this day, the motion is deemed carried on division.
