Financial Statement of Minister of Finance 
EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 69 
Monday, March 9, 1998 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF MINISTER OF FINANCE 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
An overwhelming number of people from Saanich-Gulf Islands responded to the poll.  
This government does not have it yet.  
Now we are going to the downside of the budget. 
That really scares me.  
They are crippling the economy. 
We are one of the highest taxed provinces.  
The government has a priority. 
What have we seen? 
This government is proud of it. 
It is one tax increase after another. 
The other 94% will not see five cents worth of it. 
The government has not addressed any of the real problems at all.  
The other factor the government did not address is the debt. 
We know we need tax relief. 
This government since 1993 has added $75 billion to this debt. 
That does not talk about paying down the debt. 
There is something wrong and this government has to make it a priority.  
There is no money allocated to debt reduction. 
The government has no vision. 
It has no plan. 
This is what disturbs me the most regarding this budget.  
We have heard the word discrimination used in this House. 
If we want to talk about discrimination, here is a budget that is discriminatory. 
These deductions are only available to people if they are working. 
It is an absolute disgrace.  
The Liberals should be ashamed of themselves. 
They can sit over there and hang their heads, which they should. 
When these people apply for a bank loan they are asked what they do. 
They say, for example, ``I am just a housewife''.  
However, there is absolutely nothing in this budget which does that. 
I think this is an absolute disgrace. 
But they do not get that chance. 
We often talk about crime, which is a serious problem. 
I appreciate that not all parents can do that. 
However, they at least should not be discriminated against. 
They should be able to choose. 
They have enough of a challenge living on one income. 
It is the Canadian taxpayer who has balanced the budget. 
I suggest the finance minister was probably clueless about this. 
Six months ago he was telling us that he had a $17 billion deficit. 
That was when the election was called. 
The minister did not know what was going on and that was his best guess.  
I have just been advised that there are 37 sneaky and hidden tax increases. 
This government should be ashamed of itself. 
Hopefully they will take this message back to their caucus and rethink this one.  
I did announce it at the beginning of my speech, just before the break. 
There was some confusion.  
He got the benefit of an extra three minute bonanza. 
Questions and comments on the hon. member's speech. 
The hon. member for Calgary Southeast.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I commend the hon. member for Saanich-Gulf Island for his eloquent remarks.  
I wonder if the hon. member could comment.  
I can give the member a personal experience. 
We are in the 1990s. 
Some families are just not in the financial situation where they can. 
That is the point. 
We could deduct $7,000 off our income for child care expenses. 
My wife was a professional and gave up her career. 
She would some day love to go back to work. 
Right now she believes it is so important for our two children. 
They need her at home right now. 
She is staying at home and gets zero, absolutely zero. 
What is even worse is that she does need time for herself. 
This is only one example. 
This tax unfairness is only one aspect.  
This is one of the most important occupations in the land. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
He increased taxes and taxpayers balanced this budget. 
We want to go now to the next word, which is look. 
Look where the Prime Minister and the finance minister are standing today. 
I say this because we need to address a particular question. 
In fact, we rank number six and number 14. 
We claim that we are one of the preferred countries of the world. 
We say that we want to be competitive. 
We want to compete successfully in the international marketplace. 
It is impossible for us to maintain that position. 
Because Canada is essentially an exporting nation. 
We depend upon other countries to buy our products. 
The time has come to look at this very seriously.  
It has not been put back in one amount. 
This will restore the councils' funding levels to 1994-95. 
Now is that not an interesting twist of logic. 
There is no new money here. 
This is just replacing what they took away. 
What does this do? 
What do they do? 
This is a very serious development that has taken place. 
It is not just research funding that is the problem here. 
There is also the question of taxes and salaries. 
In Canada, that same person earning $50,000 pays $10,647.  
Is it any wonder that they leave?  
We need quality research. 
We need to develop it further. 
Medical research has slipped back. 
The application of new ideas and the development of new technologies is in jeopardy. 
That is not all. 
That is far too high. 
What kind of justice, what kind of fairness is that in this particular country?  
Government should listen to what the people are saying. 
It should reduce the debt and lower taxes.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I want to make a couple of points regarding the debt.  
The debt is certainly declining. 
Yes, we have stopped the deficit. 
We have stopped the rise of the debt. 
This brings me to my comment about this budget. 
Essentially it is an education budget. 
We could talk about restoring funding to the granting councils. 
We have finally done that. 
We are reinvesting in Canadian priorities.  
I draw the hon. member's attention to the article in the Globe and Mail . 
I could pass a copy on for him to read.  
Is that not interesting?  
Are there some good things in the budget? 
Have the Liberals listened? 
Notice he said that they were going to. 
They have not done it. 
They have not demonstrated that in the budget.  
We need such a law. 
We need to get serious about that. 
We do not need new spending.  
We did not hear people ask the government to spend more money. 
They have asked for taxes to be cut and the debt to be reduced. 
The CFIB said it. 
The Canadian Chamber of Commerce said it. 
The Chamber of Commerce in Kelowna said it. 
Ordinary citizens on the street say it. 
Students in the schools say it. 
The official opposition says it. 
The government should listen.  
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
It just does not jibe.  
I do not want to see him sucking and blowing at the same time.  
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism) (Status of Women), Lib.):
This balance will have a profound impact for years to come.  
The budget is not a stand alone budget. 
The budget is providing a solid infrastructure for Canada for years to come. 
That is one of the reasons I see it as a very important budget.  
The budget therefore builds on youth employment as have past budgets. 
We are now at four years and we have eliminated our deficit entirely. 
We did not only do what we said we would do. 
We have even surpassed our own expectations.  
Last year we brought the debt down by $13 billion. 
We have done something that no other government has done in 30 years. 
We can stand it up against anything anyone chooses to say about the budget.  
We have also looked at tax relief.  
This is a very measured budget. 
This is not a one fell swoop budget. 
That is not the Liberal way. 
No business people would ever do that. 
This was recognized in the budget. 
I am extremely proud of the budget. 
We have done something extremely historic and important this time.  
In the budget we looked at low income families. 
That was one place we felt we would start first. 
We needed to help low income families, especially low income families with children. 
This budget commits another $850 million over two years. 
It is about choice. 
Women with children tend to go to school part time. 
This is very important for them. 
They are going to be given money that they will not have to pay back. 
This is about building the human resource potential of this country.  
This again touches very many women who are in this particular class.  
I have already heard from them. 
Tax measures are an important tool. 
Women do better after taxes than before.  
Most of them are women. 
It depends on who you think are your constituents. 
We know that these Canadians run very small micro businesses. 
That is very significant.  
We know that women entrepreneurs earn far less than their male counterparts. 
Everyone has been talking about health care. 
I think I know a little about health care. 
They are the health care providers. 
Important research is being done in my riding. 
The initiative taken by Industry Canada has assisted business innovation in this country. 
This will provide leading edge technology for mapping the whole world. 
Just think of the spin-offs which will come from that kind of loan.  
That provides jobs for Canadians.  
We need to understand that some youths in this country face extraordinary barriers. 
We are trying to address some of these barriers. 
It is not the one size fits all policy. 
This is a remarkable budget. 
I can see there are a lot of questions. 
That should take up the full 10 minutes.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, that does not leave us much time.  
I would point out that Alberta and Saskatchewan have done the same. 
I would also point out that taxpayers are the ones who have balanced the budget. 
The minister has stated that taxes are going down. 
I do not know how the minister can make her assertion. 
How can the minister assert that taxes in fact are going down? 
That is going to affect 83% of taxpayers. 
We are the ones who inherited a $42 billion deficit.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
The minister is responsible for the status of women. 
The $850 million in child tax benefits are far too little. 
The hon. secretary of state.  
Mr. Speaker, first and foremost we probably do not read the same newspapers. 
Second, we talk about children. 
That is not in isolation.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the secretary of state talked quite a bit about the millennium fund.  
So it is a small drop in the bucket.  
That is going to be happening now. 
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
That is a net loss of $6 billion.  
Even the NDP party can figure out that is a net loss. 
Why can the Liberal Party not figure that out?  
It is a way of assisting business to be able to help employ young people. 
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
I am pleased to speak to the budget today. 
Let me start at an obvious point: our children. 
A caring party would see children as the key to Canada's future. 
That is what Canadians want more. 
But these things are not in this government's budget.  
Children grow up fast. 
That is what this budget represents. 
Looked at this way, the millennium fund is sleight of hand funding for students. 
We would put $4 billion back into it.  
This budget offers no benefits for Canada's seniors. 
They are angry and afraid. 
For instance, this great benefit will not even begin to help the poorest seniors. 
So this is the heart of the matter. 
Where in the budget are the dreams of Canadians? 
There are no dreams, only nightmares.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I have a couple of points. 
That is what the Reform Party is talking about. 
At the same time it talks about caring.  
What is wrong with that?  
The member focuses on the millennium scholarship. 
It is a seven point program. 
I would submit that Canadian do support it.  
Madam Speaker, the old Liberal arithmetic is going full force over there.  
It is going to benefit only 6% of the students in this country. 
What about the other 94% who will not be able to take part in it? 
That is the fact.  
Let us also look at the economy. 
They do not get it.  
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
I would appreciate if the hon. member could address this.  
That is a net loss of six billion dollars. 
The government is putting the money back by specifically targeting it for pure political means.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Balanced budgets should be mandatory for every government by legislation.  
Seventy per cent of the deficit was eliminated by the increase in tax revenues. 
A third of each dollar goes to service the debt. 
That newborn baby is assured of one thing, a $20,000 debt. 
The debt and the high tax rate cause the brain drain in Canada.  
Budget day was a martyrdom day for this country. 
The Liberal finance minister has sacrificed the future prosperity of Canadian taxpayers. 
He has made martyrs out of Canadian taxpayers. 
It has not reduced federal spending at all. 
It has not pursued the elimination of waste in the government. 
This shows that the government completely lacks vision and accountability.  
The private sector investment is increasing.  
What a funny quote. 
Why could her ministry not work smarter before the cuts were made?  
This government should not play political football with the future of Canadians.  
I have another example. 
If it is not a cooking of the books what is it? 
They should not follow the laws of the cooks but the laws of the books.  
This is not leadership by example. 
Why does this minister use a surplus to play politics with?  
Canadians cannot be fooled by this shell game.  
Parents get less time to spend with their children.  
When they graduate they have to struggle to get jobs. 
There may be no money left for their pension.  
The system is unfair and the government lacks accountability. 
The government lacks vision. 
Every corner of our lives is mismanaged by big government. 
Whatever we talk about, the government is famous for mismanagement.  
Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Middlesex, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I just listened to a maze of questions that led nowhere. 
The member never got out of the maze. 
I would like to know the basis of the facts he presented. 
It is leading the G-7 in its fiscal responsibilities. 
It is looked up to all around the world. 
I ask the member to give us some facts to support his statements.  
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
That $800 million commitment was made in the last budget. 
The liability occurred in the last budget. 
There was a genuine disagreement with the auditor general. 
Immigrants and refugees from all over the world want to come to this country. 
I ran only for one party and that is the Reform Party. 
I believe in the principles of the Reform Party. 
I ask the member to withdraw the false statement he just made.  
I would like to answer his question. 
The Canada Foundation for Innovation was formed in April 1997. 
The payment was made to the foundation on July 31, 1997. 
The books of the government closed on March 31. 
The $800 million is a commitment, not a liability. 
The government cannot put commitments on the books. 
Liabilities have to be put on the books. 
If the people who run private businesses did that they would be thrown into jail.  
I would also ask him to withdraw- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The time for questions and comments has expired.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I ask the hon. member to withdraw the statement. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Rather it was based on sheer necessity.  
In 1993 we inherited a $42 billion plus debt. 
It has certainly not been easy.  
However it had to be done. 
The budget speaks to two principal objectives in that regard, the first being prosperity. 
If we take away prosperity, equity is no doubt affected. 
The second objective in the budget is equity. 
This is equal opportunity at its best.  
There is also an important feature in the budget in terms of its regional impact. 
This then is the prosperity and equity agenda at work.  
I want to emphasize how important ACOA is to our region. 
To our office, to our ministry, public safety is overarching. 
That is the business of the Ministry of the Solicitor General.  
The result of course will always be a safer, healthier community.  
This is the hallmark of the great Liberal Party.  
Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Quebec East, BQ):
This is not necessarily good news.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for the questions. 
I can answer them relatively easily.  
It is also a matter of fundamental fairness. 
In recent years the Canada student loans program was designed to offer that access. 
It was very important to deal with that. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
I find this astounding.  
This is not an equity budget. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to do just that. 
Access to university has significantly improved. 
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
They achieved a balanced budget. 
Opposition members harangued the government about the deficit. 
Harry Houdini is alive and well and living on the opposition benches. 
The government, however, has to deal with reality.  
I had the opportunity to host a post-budget breakfast in my riding last week. 
A common theme was heard during the discussions. 
The minister has been cautious and prudent in his calculations. 
It represents a true measure of debt burden. 
The budget speaks to youth. 
These are investments in our future. 
Young people must be encouraged to dream and to seek opportunity in Canada.  
The government has listened to the concerns of our youth. 
It shows the government is listening to students. 
It will have a huge impact on students.  
Interest relief extensions will help about 100,000 graduates.  
The opposition has talked about a need for tax relief. 
This government does not just talk tax reductions. 
It has taken clear and firm actions in this area. 
The government is continuing to provide targeted tax relief. 
The impact of the 1998 budget over three years is clear. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
The government has indicated three, three and three in relation to the debt.  
I suggest to the member that these figures are conservative. 
I am confident in the strategy the government has put in place. 
The opposition wanted to know where we stood on it. 
We have placed it front and centre.  
Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Quebec East, BQ):
As we know, education is a provincial matter. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.  
The government is providing needed assistance to students in this country. 
The government is showing leadership. 
Finally they are seeing true leadership in education. 
The government is providing the necessary financial assistance to students. 
That bodes well for students in the future. 
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question and his kind remarks.  
We have the Canadian opportunities strategy. 
It met with representatives from the banks. 
I am not congratulating my friends opposite. 
Let us move on now to my comments on the budget. 
I even held a prebudget meeting in my riding. 
What did the Minister of Finance do? 
He ignored these experts. 
He did absolutely nothing.  
Yes, there was the Millennium Fund, and I would like to talk about that. 
What do we know about it? 
This is a good opportunity for him to advertise his automobiles. 
That is all that we know.  
But still it creates a fund.  
What are the stated and unstated purposes of this fund? 
But students need help now. 
The Liberals must live up to their commitments.  
All of them are federal councils. 
I am speaking on behalf of the people of Quebec. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have just a couple of points of clarification. 
I would caution the hon. member that he should read the numbers again.  
I want to speak directly to the comments made on the millennium fund. 
That is what we have attempted to do with the millennium scholarship fund. 
There is a vast amount of support for this program by the students. 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
I too am pleased to take part in the discussion on this universally criticized budget. 
But where does this surplus come from? 
That is what the zero deficit is all about.  
An annual amount of $6.3 billion is no trifle.  
That is clear and it is in writing''. 
There they go creating new programs. 
The best example of this renewed interference is the creation of millennium scholarships. 
Here we have both overlap and duplication.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Earlier I made a point about what the students of Quebec were saying. 
Over and over again the hon. member made reference to the millennium scholarship fund. 
It is not about creating a bureaucracy. 
It is not about overlap. 
That is the great equalizer. 
We want to ensure that every student has opportunity and access to that information.  
Mr. Speaker, I can understand the secretary of state defending the budget. 
The millennium fund simply duplicates things. 
He cannot deny that. 
This is a waste. 
This is where the unfairness lies.  
Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):
I begin my address today by extending my personal congratulations to the Minister of Finance. 
That is what one might think. 
In 1993 there were fierce storm clouds collecting on the horizon. 
First, we must begin to pay down our massive federal debt. 
Without question we have done just that. 
These I believe are goals that every Canadian can support.  
Time and time again these have been clearly identified as national priority areas.  
Rome was not built in a day. 
Canadians can be proud today. 
Together we have achieved what seemed impossible only four years ago. 
The days of wasteful overspending and foolish megaprojects are gone forever. 
They have been replaced by an era of strategic investment and co-operative partnerships.  
Canadians view many of our social programs as defining national characteristics. 
Indeed this budget does many positive things. 
However its real strength comes from what it does not do. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his remarks.  
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for that question. 
As I said earlier this budget has not addressed every inequity in the country. 
To me, families are the highest priority we have. 
We have begun the process. 
Hopefully we can address this in next year's budget.  
Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Quebec East, BQ):
Mr. Trent points out what many have said about the millennium scholarships. 
We hear that kind of rhetoric in this House. 
We are creating an incentive for them to go on to further education. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk-Brant, Lib.):
Our nation has benefited greatly from its membership in the Commonwealth. 
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
It is this anniversary that I wish to remember today.  
Quebec has seen many changes in the last fifty years. 
It has moved ahead with great speed in all areas. 
It has become a modern, dynamic and outward-looking society. 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
He was deaf, mute, 80 years old and lived alone. 
He was a victim of a ferocious beating that led to his death. 
The alleged assailant has a long record as a young offender.  
We have urged this Liberal government since 1993 to get tough on crime. 
My constituents and I are furious. 
When will the Liberal's defend and protect our citizens? 
Fix the Young Offenders Act. 
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S WEEK 
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
Your sacrifice and contribution are appreciated.  
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, what are the qualifications required to become a Canadian senator?  
First, lose an election or, better yet, lose two elections. 
Do your duty for the Liberals and you will be rewarded. 
Your seat in patronage heaven is assured.  
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, today is Commonwealth Day. 
Canada plays an important role as a member of the Commonwealth.  
Celebrating and observing Commonwealth Day is a strong symbol of this effort. 
Happy Commonwealth Day to all parliamentarians in the Commonwealth.  
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
I sincerely hope that those who committed rape will be arrested. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY 
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the whole world celebrated International Women's Day.  
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
However, there is a world of difference between theory and daily reality. 
Wage equity has yet to be achieved in the public service. 
Women are still afraid at night. 
Their salaries are still lower than those of men. 
They are still, along with their children, the most vulnerable members of our society.  
The last federal budget is an insult to their intelligence. 
They got nothing, absolutely nothing.  
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S WEEK 
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY 
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):
Women's rights are human rights. 
Let us all applaud these women as unsung heroes.  
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Vaughan-King-Aurora, Lib.):
Last Thursday, residents of Vaughan-King-Aurora showed a great deal of confidence. 
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Who is responsible for defiling this beautiful river? 
Look no further than the solicitor-general and MP for Fredericton.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Only seven per cent want senators appointed by the Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I am not against elections for senators. 
I voted for it and he voted against it.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Alberta has been convinced. 
It will have a Senate election this fall.  
What is the Prime Minister's excuse this time? 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Why should we go with a one-third proposition? 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
The Canadian people are asking him to do so''. 
The Prime Minister told Andrew Thompson to resign. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We have a system that was established in 1867. 
We did propose a change to it and he said no.  
I am for the reform of the Senate. 
The hon. member for Edmonton North.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
I will permit the Prime Minister to answer the question.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
What an insult to people who are retired.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Is the minister finally aware of the devastating impact of his reform?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I look forward to it with much anticipation.  
The hon. member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
That was his focus.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
This means fewer people needing EI.  
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the minister can certainly make fine speeches. 
He has been subjecting us to his fine speeches for two years now. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
There was an additional $134 million in the last budget for medical research. 
Money was also given to care givers- 
The hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
He called it a forgone cut.  
Can the Prime Minister explain just what are his government's plans? 
Will there be an investment in home care this year? 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
They said this has to be worked out among ministers. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Instead the recent budget reflects that it has no priority. 
Will the Prime Minister meet with those ministers?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I had the occasion to reply to that question earlier. 
The hon. member will be invited to vote for it. 
It is a fair amount for one budget.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I take it that is a no.  
That is the reality. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The member has a very good premier. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
I asked for an investigation and it was completed. 
Having said that, it must be a very trying time for Mr. Starlight. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
The minister's office broke the law.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I believe I just did.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my supplementary question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
If she is not responsible, who is?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
We are implementing those recommendations as we speak. 
We have taken responsible action.  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
The minister has censored six out of the nine chapters of that report.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is quite the opposite. 
As the hon. member will understand, the issue of the investigation is itself about privacy. 
The hon. member for Drummond.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The meeting was not with ministers but with members of the health community. 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what I said earlier. 
Bill C-28 should be passed in the next few days.  
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Will he accept their evidence? 
Will he act now and fire the top bureaucrats?  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am responding to comments made by the minister, not to anything else. 
Will he act now and accept their evidence? 
It is his comments I am asking about.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the effect of residential schools was devastating for aboriginal people. 
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, yesterday was International Women's Day. 
Yet women continue to be disproportionately impoverished.  
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mrs. Claudette Bradshaw (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Cooperation, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this is the House of Commons of the people of Canada. 
I am concerned about Canadian athletes.  
Mrs. Claudette Bradshaw (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Cooperation, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we just finished the games in Nagano. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Many people are therefore forced onto welfare.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Thus a 20-year period is involved.  
The figure of 200,000 additional recipients is over those 20 years. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
The government has not increased the floor of health care spending. 
It has simply stopped the expenditures.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Agriculture.  
The Government of Quebec is ignoring part time farmers.  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the matter is still under investigation. 
We must bear in mind that lives needed to be saved here. 
The aircraft sent in by the military went in under some very bad weather conditions. 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
We are now talking about what we gave to women in this budget. 
We had a choice, we made a priority. 
This budget did that. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Pay equity is a basic human right that is denied to many Canadian women. 
It is now only a matter of the unions to answer that offer. 
In the circumstances we are in favour of pay equity. 
We will continue to fight for it for the women who deserve it.  
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Mr. Bradstreet still has outstanding bills. 
The Minister of Health has been stalling. 
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
The minister has already acted unilaterally. 
He has shown leadership. 
He has given them very clear indications and parameters. 
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
That should be discussed with the chief prosecutor.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, imagine that Canadians have to leave the country to find work. 
That is not uncommon these days. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
This is not a new procedure. 
What is happening is that it is being extended to other forms of property.  
CANADIAN CENTRE AGAINST SEXUAL ABUSE 
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.  
The hon. Minister of Justice.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
We are negotiating with those groups right now to determine levels of funding.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
I have talked to the minister during the last 10 days. 
She is still holding consultations.  
She has expressed those views publicly and very clearly. 
There are sections in the report which also have some good recommendations. 
The report will be studied by the minister. 
It is a very good omen for this country.  
That would bring to a close our question period for today.  
I will hear that question of privilege now. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
What we do in this House certainly is watched by the nation. 
However, they should do so by way of a substantive motion in this House.  
Mr. Speaker, influencing your rulings through the media is totally wrong. 
Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary authorities are clear and unqualified on this point. 
You, Mr. Speaker, are a member of this House. 
It also states on page 230: 
I also quote from citation 168 at page 49 of Beauchesne's: 
The material that is before you in this article touches upon your high office. 
It is not fair for you yourself to resolve this matter. 
71.3 and 71.4 also provide direction on this point, Mr. Speaker. 
The partisanship should not affect your rulings whatsoever. 
The speakership of the House is not to be brought into these partisan battles. 
Your integrity has been brought into question and compromised by these statements. 
In matters such as this, I suggest it is up to the House to act. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
A little further, you said yourself, and I quote: 
The Speaker himself would have consulted the independent member.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
I have two or three comments. 
I do not think a newspaper article by anyone is going to particularly sway you.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Here is what this is about. 
They have threatened the Chair. 
To threaten the President is to threaten the Chair. 
Such a threat cannot be tolerated.  
That is a threat.  
By destroying the Chair- 
Mr. Michel Gauthier: -they are destroying Parliament and their country.  
I would like to hear what hon. members have to say on this matter. 
I am going to return to the hon. member for Roberval.  
It is totally ridiculous.  
You, Mr. Speaker, have always had the confidence of this House. 
We do not, however, want to destroy the institutions. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
The Prime Minister is subject to it on a daily basis in question period. 
In this case there was no threat. 
I remind you, Mr. Speaker, you are an elected person. 
This is the kind of fair comment that should exist in a democracy.  
Mr. Benoit Serre (Timiskaming-Cochrane, Lib.):
You do not have any respect, saying things like that.  
I will not get up on my high horse, like the member for Roberval. 
I will try to keep my remarks calm and rational.  
The member for Timiskaming-Cochrane.  
The Ottawa Sun has attributed comments to me. 
On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
I am going to hear what the member for Timiskaming-Cochrane has to say. 
Then I will come back to the point of order. 
We are now talking about a point of privilege.  
And he is sexist to boot.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
That is the issue and you are weighing that decision now. 
Another warned that the Speaker would face demands for his resignation.  
Mr. Speaker, those are threats to you. 
People are going to demand your resignation. 
He hasn't made a decision.  
I put a simple question to bring this to an end. 
If it is not a problem, what were those comments intended to produce?  
Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering-Ajax-Uxbridge, Lib.):
They fought for a united country and a united flag.  
There are grave consequences to whatever decision should be made, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
He made a mistake. 
He was in error. 
In the diatribe which he just gave he named me specifically. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise- 
On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on what I think is a very solemn occasion. 
I am here to defend that.  
He is calling for this to be an immediate point of privilege. 
Therefore I think you need to rule against this being an immediate issue.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
They have no respect for the Chair.  
And there are some here now. 
I go to the hon. member for Scarborough-Rouge River.  
Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):
I am fairly sure we will end up with a resolution on that. 
Some of our colleagues have caused this to happen. 
Maybe they have been induced by aggressive journalists to make it happen. 
Mr. Ivan Grose (Oshawa, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, at this point I will make an admission. 
I was the initiator of the demonstration that was put on last Thursday.  
I thought I and my country and this House had been offended. 
It never was supposed to go this far. 
As far as I am concerned, it is a dead issue. 
Colleagues, as I said a little earlier, this is a serious matter. 
I would like the indulgence of the House.  
(The sitting of the House was suspended at 3.40 p.m.) 
The House resumed at 4.10 p.m. 
My colleagues, I thank you for your indulgence. 
It is very important that the House be seized with this matter.  
STANDING COMMITTEE ON PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, in light of your ruling that a prima facie case exists, I move: 
It is unfortunate we have found ourselves in this position. 
That is not the issue or the point I wish to bring to the floor.  
We have members of this House choosing to comment. 
What has happened is very unfortunate. 
It is with regret that we have to go through this. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
If I understand correctly, these are the precise words: 
I do not want to speak for very long. 
I wish we would return to the budget debate. 
We should support the motion now that you have ruled that way. 
That is what you have ruled. 
I hope we will not have a prolonged debate on this issue.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this issue goes to the issue of freedom of speech in Canada. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
These are objective facts can anyone can verify. 
To this end, they used the flag. 
Everyone respects the flag. 
Everyone respects the national anthem. 
I would encourage all hon. members to listen to each other out of courtesy.  
Mr. Speaker, thank you for enforcing my right to speak. 
I am grateful to you for protecting my privileges as a parliamentarian in this House. 
I appreciate this parliamentary protection you are giving me. 
I appreciate the fact that your role allows democracy to have a voice.  
We must make them see reason.  
They would have used any pretence. 
This is no minor incident.  
You have one on either side of the Chair. 
But this is not the issue.  
It is not the flag versus the separatists. 
When will they understand this? 
We have always done so and we need them to respect those rules. 
This is not democracy.  
How can the Reform Party invoke respect for democracy? 
Is this democracy, Canadian style? 
Is this the freedom of speech of this country? 
Come on, this is not the way it works.  
I plead with my colleagues. 
You cannot be asked to enter into a partisan debate. 
Members should understand that. 
We understood that a long time ago in Quebec. 
Perhaps this should be understood in some areas of Canada. 
This is not your problem. 
We have no right to ask you that. 
The exercise of democracy means that the opposition can question the government.  
They should be the ones to want to protect oral question period. 
They are at the centre of oral question period. 
Have they not yet understood that?  
No, they do not understand anything.  
This is not the way Parliament works.  
They had better listen, they might understand better what Quebec is all about.  
This is not the way to go forward. 
But this is the sad truth.  
Are all the champions of the country cheerleaders?  
In conclusion, I will say that we support the motion. 
We want these issues out in the open. 
This is going much further than it should. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Others felt it was inappropriate. 
But that is not what we are talking about here.  
Today is a good example of that.  
Today we are supposed to be debating the budget, Mr. Speaker. 
We are not debating the budget. 
This is not necessarily a question about freedom of speech. 
It is within certain accepted rules. 
We make a point of memorizing those rules. 
We know what is expected of us in the House. 
We are awaiting that decision. 
That is not what is before us at the moment. 
That is the question before us.  
The so-called alleged comments will be addressed. 
That is where it will be dealt with.  
I would urge my colleagues, let us make this a unanimous vote. 
You have asked us to support your decision. 
That is what this vote is all about. 
For goodness sake, colleagues, let us not separate at this point on this critical issue. 
This will then be brought to a satisfactory conclusion.  
If you consider the timing, this is what is critical here. 
In the newspaper article in question none of the members talked about their position. 
They did not try to support their position. 
Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):
We are already here in the House with the Speaker who has our support. 
That is not at issue.  
It involves a number of our colleagues.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have just a few points on this debate.  
That is unfortunate in and of itself. 
We should engage in the debate and the merits of this motion before the House. 
Would it be because we are a flock of sheep?  
I say not, Mr. Speaker. 
Specifically I want to say a couple of things on this matter. 
That was a very serious issue that pro or con needed to be examined. 
What happened in committee? 
That is why I am worried about this motion. 
It is ridiculous in the extreme.  
That is what will happen to this motion too if it gets sent to committee. 
The silly season sets in. 
That is what happens when they do this sort of thing. 
The House leader of the fifth party should know that. 
It is unfortunate that we will have to deal with it. 
We will have to push it through to a vote. 
That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the words ``Ottawa Sun ''.  
We should be on to the business of the budget. 
I will take the amendment under advisement. 
We will have a look at it. 
I will continue with the debate.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
What has happened is quite serious. 
I have looked at the amendment to the motion. 
On that basis I find the amendment out of order.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
My concern is with the motion itself. 
In this instance the criticisms fell into the realm of fair comment. 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a few points. 
I believe that is not accurate at all. 
I do not see this analogy and I will explain why.  
I submit that is not the issue here at all. 
As is your role, Mr. Speaker, you recognized him. 
I respected that and I sat down. 
I was absolutely going to try to influence your vote, without question. 
I believe that is perfectly appropriate in these circumstances.  
This is an issue about your integrity. 
I believe that is why you are sitting in the chair. 
That is why we elected you. 
We are confident that you will make a decision which we will respect.  
I am sure you have received phone calls from the general public. 
They have every right to send information to you.  
I will not do that now. 
I want to, but I have not been able to do it. 
Some members have chosen to do that through the newspaper. 
We deal with it all the time. 
We have to filter through them to know what they mean.  
I will put that on the record. 
The other point of order is a separate issue entirely. 
We must respect your decision. 
We must respect your office. 
I am convinced of that.  
I will not support the motion. 
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
I want to begin by going back to my first year in this city, 1980. 
We travelled from coast to coast and placed special emphasis on western Canada. 
The member responded in what I thought was quite a constructive way. 
My colleague from Scarborough Centre was there and he concurs with this.  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
I am not in bed with the separatists. 
I also believe we should understand. 
On that score, I separate again from the separatists.  
In no way, shape or form in my judgment was she stomping on the flag.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, this afternoon we are talking about a serious matter.  
We are talking about respect for democracy in the House. 
We are talking about your ability to lead the House to conclusions. 
I feel that a country's flag is something sacred. 
There is a time and a place for everything.  
This is totally unacceptable. 
I do not know what your decision will be. 
I will anxiously wait for it, like many of us here. 
The motion, as worded, is in order.  
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join in this debate today. 
That the debate be now adjourned.  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
People have indeed given their lives for our national flag.  
I am proud to introduce this private member's motion.  
I am very pleased to present this bill on behalf of mechanics.  
MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY ACT 
I thank the hon. member for Laval West for her support.

QUESTIONS PASSED AS ORDERS FOR RETURN 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I apologize once again to the member. 
As he says, he has asked on a number of occasions. 
I will continue to press for a reply.  
It is taking some time to reach them all. 
I will continue to do my best to obtain the response.  
FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF MINISTER OF FINANCE 
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
In some real ways, this is the culmination of how I ended up here. 
It was clear to me that we needed a new way to do government. 
One thing that is very noticeable about this budget is that it talks about education. 
I would like to talk about productivity. 
Some people think this is an economic concept. 
For that reason, it is very difficult sometimes to measure productivity. 
Why am I talking about productivity? 
What is it going to mean for our economy? 
Indeed, our illiteracy rate in Canada is mid-term. 
Some of the areas that this budget talked about were registered education savings plan. 
My background has been one of an investment adviser and accountant. 
When I used to practise, these registered educational savings plan we basically shunned. 
There is a partnership arrangement going on between parents, their children and the federal government. 
I think that is a very healthy attitude. 
It is obvious that we are living in a society of continuous learning. 
This is another way to get at the same thing.  
I do not think anything could be more ludicrous. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, the hon. member talks about a sensible budget. 
She tosses garbage cans. 
She has been hit with an income tax bill of $800. 
So there is a catch-22. 
She is not eligible to receive that wonderful deduction. 
Kathy has contributed to the balancing of the budget. 
I am sure this makes her feel really great. 
I hear some yapping over there. 
To some of these people $800 is not a lot of money. 
That is a major commitment from the lower income people of this country.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
She cannot afford to send her child to daycare. 
Therefore she is ineligible for the child care tax credit.  
I would like the member to explain that.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
I will be sharing my time with the member for Acadie-Bathurst.  
The response I got was that this budget is a failure.  
The budget failed those people. 
This budget has also failed aboriginal people who live in the urban environment. 
The first is education. 
Students need help today, not in the year 2000.  
The government did not make that choice. 
That is the kind of leadership we wanted to see from the Liberal government. 
The child tax benefit is another issue. 
I will explain what the reality is. 
This is not an anti-poverty measure. 
What will that help be? 
It will be a measly 80 cents a day. 
That is what we are saying to kids. 
There is not one mention in the budget about a national child care program.  
The Reform Party says that it wants tax cuts. 
The key goal is job creation. 
That should be the government's priority. 
Did the budget speak to a progressive taxation system? 
There was silence on that measure.  
Did it speak to reinvesting that money so that ordinary Canadians could benefit? 
There was not a word about that.  
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, the hon. member talks about the budget being so terrible. 
I represent Guelph which has a university. 
It never spent within its means.  
We have put huge amounts of money into health care and education. 
Eighty per cent of the budget represents a spending in health care and education.  
In my constituency office I have had very positive reviews on the budget. 
The member needs a little dose of reality. 
Those are the facts and that is the reality. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
I understand the difficult social and economic conditions of which she speaks.  
The same thing happened in Ontario. 
Bob Rae raised taxes and unemployment skyrocketed. 
Unemployment has gone down.  
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question and his comment. 
I would be happy to show him what life is like in Vancouver East. 
There was no mention of housing in the budget. 
That is something the B.C. government has done.  
It has also maintained a tuition freeze for three years.  
That is something we should be proud of. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The question is on the following motion:
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
(The House divided on the amendment, which was negatived on the following division:) 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I declare the amendment defeated.  
Many firms deal with three or more managers in as many years. 
The government can make some choices. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
It is also not clear whether a CRA regime would be well suited to Canada. 
I cannot be any clearer than that.  
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
This is an issue which I have been deeply concerned about. 
We are worse off today than we were before. 
At the present time we have no negotiators acting on Canada's behalf. 
He has now left and it is arguable why he left. 
He saw no way out of the dispute without a commitment from this government. 
This is a very serious issue. 
We are not even in discussions. 
We are not in negotiations. 
Four years of nothing and it is going downward.  
This government has to get on with it. 
This is a very important issue. 
Again I ask the parliamentary secretary what his government's plans are. 
Does the government anticipate having this matter resolved prior to the next fishing season?  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I wonder where this member has been for the last while. 
He assesses the current situation and he provides advice on the direction we should go. 
All Canadians share his frustrations on this point.  
Mr. Fortier explains why an agreement was not attainable. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member for Sarnia-Lambton.  
Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):
For Canadians this is a massive project for trade. 
Jobs and trade go hand in hand.  
Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Highways in Canada are under provincial jurisdiction. 
Nevertheless, the federal government has assisted the provinces with highway construction since 1919. 
We must pursue standards harmonizing under the NAFTA. 
There may also be important environmental benefits inherent in this total approach.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 7.06 p.m.)
