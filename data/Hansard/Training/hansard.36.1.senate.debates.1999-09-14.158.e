Tuesday, September 14, 1999 
The Senate met at 9:00 a.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Best Wishes for Recovery 
You may know Sandra Schmirler of Regina. 
Sandra is fighting to recover from a major cancer operation. 
At that time, my entire province of Saskatchewan toasted Sandra and her team-mates.  
The Prairies produce very special people. 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
I trust that all honourable senators have received this notice. 
Business of the Senate 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted for later this day, honourable senators?  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
I wish to thank the minister for having done that.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition):
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I am not aware that there was any prior knowledge, honourable senators. 
In the final analysis, those conditions will ensure the best interests of all Canadians.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I have a question to the Leader of the Government. 
It has to do with tobacco smuggling. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, it is my understanding that the answer to that particular question is ready. 
We are attempting to get that answer signed off as quickly as possible. 
If it is possible to do that today, we will do so. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition):
Is that a correct interpretation of what I heard?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I think that would be accurate, honourable senators. 
However, I am sure the government will examine any and all proposals on their merits.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Conflict in East Timor-Duties of Peacekeeping Force 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, we are awaiting the specific request from the United Nations. 
I anticipate that a vote will be taken on Thursday. 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I think such a debate would be entirely appropriate. 
Some of us who do not live in Ottawa have a long distance to travel. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
I agree totally with Senator Andreychuk that Parliament should give its consent. 
Non-members should follow what the members of both committees decide. 
Will the government entertain that possibility?  
Senator Prud'homme questioned whether or not there will still be East Timorese alive. 
The situation is serious. 
I wish him well. 
We should not hesitate to acknowledge such accomplishments. 
Replacement of Sea King Helicopters- Delays in Awarding of Contract 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I am not aware, honourable senators, of any particular reason. 
Hon. John G. Bryden :
Yet we have our missionaries of democracy wandering around the world. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, Senator Bryden has raised a valid point. 
They are being punished. 
I have witnessed similar situations in other parts of the world as well. 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Honourable senators, I have a supplementary question. 
They delayed in Mozambique. 
Why did they not delay this vote? 
The leader said that it was known there would be some difficulties. 
There is well-documented evidence that forewarned of the present events. 
Canadian representatives were made aware of it, as were members of the United Nations.  
They were obviously hoping they could thwart the dangers. 
Honourable senators, it is a question of judgment. 
History has recorded many errors in human judgment. 
I cite as an example Paraguay. 
In 1991 an independent was elected as mayor of the capital city of Asuncion. 
It is a question of human judgment in choosing the most appropriate window of opportunity. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
He was Reverend Roland de Corneille from Toronto. 
Senator Graham used the word "anticipate." 
It is a very important word. 
We must anticipate what the year 2000 will bring. 
We need only to look to what is going on in Russia now.

Answer to Order Paper Question Delayed 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
I suppose because it is a fisheries issue, it is not all that important.  
Public Service Pension Investment Board Bill 
Motion for Allotment of Time for Debate 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
We have three or four speakers who have amendments. 
That would be our suggestion.  
However, I wish to make it very clear that this is not a precedent. 
The amendments will be accepted within the six-hour time of debate.  
That is a wonderful suggestion. 
Doing so would make things easier for the Table.  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Otherwise, you had better be ready to be delayed.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
We are then entitled to up to six hours of debate. 
Honourable senators, there are a number of issues here.  
That is their choice. 
I have provided them with that option.  
It certainly indicates on the Table that it is Tuesday. 
It indicates in our Order Paper for today that it is a Tuesday. 
However, at no time did I agree that today would be a Friday. 
The motion to sit today clearly rules that it is a Tuesday.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, we are in an irregular mode once again. 
However, I think we need to clarify the situation. 
Is that agreeable, honourable senators?  
and the answer I was given was "yes." 
Therefore, I turned to the rules that apply for Friday. 
I merely asked the question. 
I will be quite happy to take the guidance of the Speaker on this.  
Therefore, we would not see the clock at four o'clock. 
That is a clear rule with respect to the Senate. 
Yes, honourable senators, that is the understanding.  
I thank the honourable senator for that. 
That was my second question. 
However, we are then in a situation of Royal Assent.  
I raise this matter for clarification only.  
I did not know that there was this meeting in Senator Carstairs' office. 
Thus, honourable senators, we will finish up this session not following the book at all. 
He made it up as he went along. 
He did not have any rules. 
There were no rules, then.  
He was a pain for the Conservatives.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
That is a decision that only the Senate can make. 
There would be some complications. 
Unless I am guided otherwise, I must declare that today is Tuesday. 
Therefore, I assume that that is clearly established.  
Senator Kinsella raised the question of timeliness. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is that agreeable to all honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Either language is acceptable. 
Is that clear, honourable senators?  
We have an example right now in our hands.  
Of course, a senator is not required to introduce anything in both languages. 
His duty is to introduce whatever he or she wishes. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
That is a definite situation, that one or the other will prevail.  
You mentioned the case of the privilege motion. 
That is a different case. 
That provision does not appear elsewhere in our rule book. 
Obviously, we try to accommodate all honourable senators. 
Nothing should be circulated unless by agreement. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Therefore, that is a different situation. 
Motions and the moving of motions in this chamber are part of the spoken record. 
I see another senator who is about to explode, too. 
It is not a question of sympathizing or of being patronizing. 
It is a question of what is right. 
What is right is that a senator is able to function only in one language. 
The amendments presented yesterday were very technical. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I agree with that principle.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those honourable senators in favour of the motion please say "yea"?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those honourable senators opposed to the motion please say "nay"?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
In my opinion, the "yeas" have it. 
Motion agreed to, on division.  
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
We all know that legislation can end up in court. 
Honourable senators, a trend appears to be emerging with this government. 
The aboriginal community had not been consulted. 
The government should do the right thing.  
The government, in an arbitrarily and cavalier way has said, "Your opinion does not count." 
Surely, this is not the Canadian way. 
I appeal to the government to reconsider its position.  
The money looked at by this plan will grow quickly to exceed $100 billion. 
The longer the government waits, the greater the consequences of a flawed structure. 
It ignored everyone and everything.  
Is this the way to govern in a democracy? 
Is this the way to be inclusive? 
It must not be allowed to continue without the input of plan members. 
We must also remember that the auditor is not independent. 
At least there is an appearance of difficulty here.  
In this regard, the committee's report is worth noting. 
It states, in part: 
For this reason, the Committee recommends that: 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Therefore, honourable senators, I move: 
( a ) on page 28, by adding after line 7 the following: 
Honourable senators, I have another amendment to which I would like to speak. 
Should they be moved separately, Your Honour?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Certainly, one is not dependent on the other. 
( a ) on page 28, by adding after line 7 the following: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
It is moved by the Honourable Senator Andreychuk and seconded by the Honourable Senator LeBreton: 
( a) on page 28.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Are there any other honourable senators who wish to take part in the debate?  
As many of you know, I am a native of Ottawa. 
Unfortunately, public-service and Ottawa bashing has reached new heights. 
Just as a matter of record, Ottawa is not a public service town. 
But will they get the pensions they have been promised? 
Just ask Dr. Chopra.  
Is there anyone left?  
Those sleazy Tories and their crony friends had to be stopped! 
Talk about broken promises - expensive broken promises!  
Now I am beginning to predict them, a task that really is not so difficult.  
It is the same story as with Bill C-32. 
We have been through all of this before. 
One of the Banking Committee's recommendations concerned the appointment of the auditor. 
Honourable senators, the first responsibility of any auditor is to protect the stakeholders. 
Boards simply cannot hire their own auditor.  
It is to be hoped that the board will hire a reputable auditor. 
( a ) on page 15, by adding after line 9 the following: 
In addition, the audit committee shall"; and 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, in accordance with our understanding, we will now proceed to further speeches. 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
This morning I rise on the main motion, the debate on third reading. 
I do not intend to repeat everything I said last week.  
Last Friday, I asked my colleagues from the government three things. 
I have not yet had any responses to those three questions. 
This seems to me to be a worthwhile question. 
I trust I shall get it before the end of the debate. 
That is the essence of our little debate.  
What we have here is not contract law but a legislative regime. 
It does not strike me as all that complicated. 
No one may unilaterally lay claim to the surplus, not even the federal government. 
Because it is so provided in the plan. 
The parties have agreed on this. 
No other course of action is possible.  
You are going to appropriate something that does not belong to you. 
You do not have the right to do this. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
They believe that something wrong is happening. 
They believe that their future is being endangered. 
The primary purposes of this bill ought to be dealt with at greater depth. 
That opportunity has been denied the Senate. 
Hon. Michael A. Meighen :
For my part, I wish this morning to touch on a few issues of governance. 
I do not think that is what it is in any of our minds.  
I think the minister was being optimistic.  
Why are we having the spin doctoring? 
Why are we having this shell game? 
It is that taxpayer from whom the money is being taken away.  
That is rule number one of effective spin doctoring.  
No outside pension experts were asked for their opinion. 
That is the difference with the bill that is before us today.  
It is quite a different kettle of fish but the same governance structure.  
It should not be brought into law.
