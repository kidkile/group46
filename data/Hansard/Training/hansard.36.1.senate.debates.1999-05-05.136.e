The Late Honourable Douglas S. Harkness, P.C., O.C. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Lieutenant-Colonel Harkness was an example to all of us of a good Canadian. 
Indeed, you could use the word "great." 
He started life in Alberta as a farmer. 
Here too, Colonel Harkness was a great Canadian.  
I always felt proud of my election record, having been elected seven times. 
I came along in 1965. 
In cabinet, he took on John Diefenbaker over the use of nuclear weapons. 
This issue caused his resignation from cabinet, but it was a decision of principle. 
That is a tribute to the way in which Doug Harkness was regarded.  
It has served us extraordinarily well since that time.  
He was a man of such integrity that he stood by his principles. 
That is the kind of man he was. 
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
Honourable senators, I concur with everything that has been said by Senators Forrestall and Hays. 
They have covered Douglas Harkness's character so well.  
In the 1968 election, I was the person who lost on the Liberal side. 
Indeed, he did have much more naval experience than I had!  
Douglas Harkness was an outstanding asset to the community in every way. 
Douglas Harkness resigned on that principle and left the cabinet. 
Douglas Harkness and his wife were outstanding contributors to life in Calgary. 
He lived a life of principle. 
Women of Distinction Awards 1999 
Wanda Kaluzny is the first woman conductor in Canada. 
The Late Bishop Juan Gerardi of Guatemala 
First Anniversary of Assassination 
The Guatemalan government, however, was represented by a few functionaries. 
In my world, people would sing dirges and laments at a graveside.  
It was a picture to remember and an inspiration for me.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable senators, permit me to introduce to you some visitors in our gallery. 
Welcome to Canada, and welcome to the Senate.  
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
The article goes on to quote the minister as saying the following: 
There are a number of proposals on the table. 
I feel that an honourable deal is possible. 
Now it takes two governments to agree to that... 
I think that a deal is doable. 
I think the officials have done some good work. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, Senator Kinsella mentioned "skating." 
I am wondering which avenue the government intends to take.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
My last question is for the Chair of the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications. 
Honourable senators, we do have an agenda in terms of timing. 
We will be hearing witnesses on Thursday.  
The answer to the question is "yes."  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Canadian shipbuilders have offered concrete suggestions to deal with this situation. 
One of their suggestions deals with how our tax system treats leases.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I recall very well the growth of the shipbuilding industry. 
I share the concerns of Senator Oliver in this matter. 
The honourable minister did not deal with that question. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
He also said that we require action and not just more paper declarations.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, our rapid reaction and power projection capabilities are very much on track. 
When will this be done?  
As I said yesterday, I cannot provide an explicit date. 
That is 1,244 days after you said "very soon."  
Strangely, the government is, as usual, being proven wrong.  
Honourable senators, the Honourable Senator Forrestall continually emphasizes the negative. 
How do you know that?  
Honourable senators, we have consigned 800 troops. 
Even more frustrating, how will we get them there? 
What are we doing to solve that problem?  
Do not accuse me of that, Senator Graham.  
That false assumption is being promoted in the press. 
We have been asking that question for months now. 
In the House of Commons, the Prime Minister said: 
Mr. Speaker, we have already started to cut taxes... 
We have reduced the EI contribution from $3.07 to $2.55.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Senator Graham : - we have been able to deliver tax relief to every Canadian taxpayer. 
Would senators opposite like some numbers?  
We could give you some numbers.  
I asked the question.  
Perhaps my honourable colleague would like to ask another one.  
Were they included in the $16.5 billion?  
Honourable senators, I am having difficulty getting answers to this question. 
I am not sure I understand the honourable leader's answer.  
Honourable senators, my understanding is that that is not the case. 
How many have been bracketed upward?  
Did you not reduce the deficit by $47 billion? 
You forgot to mention that.  
Kosovo-Plans for Post-Conflict Initiatives- Government Position 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Are the United Nations and its agencies included?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
It is estimated that it will cost billions of dollars. 
Where will Canada's emphasis lie? 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I would be pleased to do that at the appropriate time. 
Minister Axworthy has since also held meetings with other foreign ministers. 
Fiscal Policy of Government-Statements by Minister- Request for Clarification 
My question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Mr. Marchi, the Minister for International Trade, had something else to say.  
Could the Leader of the Government tell us what the government's fiscal policy is?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I do not understand your answer. 
We spend a lot of money to lead to prosperity. 
Everyone is telling him that that is not what will happen.  
Is this the way the Prime Minister leads the government? 
One morning, one minister says one thing, and then another says the opposite. 
However, outside of cabinet, the government should speak with one voice. 
What does that one voice say about tax policy?  
Inflation and interest rates are low. 
Don't forget that the dollar is going up.  
Senator Lynch-Staunton has just reminded me that the dollar is going up. 
Responsibility for Elimination of Deficit- Government Position 
When will he give credit where credit is due? 
They gave up things that they should have had. 
We paid too much tax. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Yes, I will say that. 
The people of Canada reduced the deficit under a Liberal government.

Hon. Lois M. Wilson :
In this case, the covenant speaks of the right to life itself. 
It can be argued that quite the opposite is true. 
I think it was Pontius Pilate who has been referred to in this regard.  
That, of course, allows the flexibility that many in this chamber have wished for.  
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
I should like to ask the honourable senator a brief question. 
Does she have any brief comments to make about that portion of the amendment?  
I think it has been well explored.  
On motion of Senator Kinsella, debate adjourned.  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-debate continued 
Such a committee was created. 
Beaudoin, Mabel DeWare, Philippe Gigantes, Wilbert Keon and Raymond Perrault. 
Other senators also participated.  
We received thousands of letters and hundreds of briefs. 
We had sittings mostly in Ottawa, but we sat also in Vancouver and Winnipeg.  
I am very proud of this report, made in June of 1995. 
It has been a wonderful experience. 
The report was well received by the press and the media. 
We have gathered much attention. 
That is a good idea. 
Who can oppose such an initiative? 
I wish to say a few words on the division of legislative powers. 
Health, as we know, is primarily under provincial jurisdiction, according to the Constitution. 
This bill is, therefore, useful. 
Amendments to the Criminal Code in that field are long overdue. 
Parliament should intervene in the legislative field. 
Is it not the raison d'etre of Parliament?  
Some people, sometimes, are inclined to leave difficult questions to the courts. 
This is at the very basis of our parliamentary democracy.  
Disconnecting life support has already been before the courts. 
The one case that immediately comes to mind is the 1992 Nancy B. case. 
Therefore, the parameters set out in the legislation seem reasonable.  
The same goes for refusal of treatment. 
On the motion of Senator Carstairs, debate adjourned.  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
Honourable senators need hardly be reminded of this fact. 
In addition, a large proportion of aboriginals reside there. 
Their livelihood and history also centre around the land. 
Consequently, the issues of seasons and time take on a special meaning in Saskatchewan. 
On motion of Senator Carstairs, debate adjourned.  
Alliance of Manufacturers and Exporters Canada- Third Reading

Consequences of European Monetary Union- Budget Report of Committee on Study Adopted

I move the adoption of this report.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :

Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
State of Financial System 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I have taken the time to read the report. 
On motion of Senator Stewart, debate adjourned.  
Recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone 
These risks include breast and prostate cancer in human beings. 
Monsanto is determined to have this drug approved in Canada.  
However, the long-term effects may prove harmful for both farmers and consumers alike.  
The committee meetings have started again. 
I commend the committee for what it is doing. 
I hope they continue delving into the effects of this drug.  
It has also shown the value of the work that we do here. 
I congratulate the committee, and hope that they continue their good work.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
I should like to ask a question of the honourable senator.  
I thank her for her intervention. 
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson :
Most honourable senators are aware of the problem of genetically modified foods. 
We know that the European market has banned genetically modified foods. 
This is an emerging issue and it is becoming a marketing issue. 
It will definitely affect Canadian agricultural exports. 
It has already affected our export of canola.  
I appreciate the honourable senator's comments. 
If the honourable senator would voice her concerns, I would appreciate that.  
Honourable senators, I have one final question for Senator Milne.  
However, in this case, I would agree with the honourable senator.  
The very companies that are producing the seeds are funding the research. 
I agree that this places suspicion on the process.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
