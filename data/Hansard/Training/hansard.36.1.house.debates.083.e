EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 83 
Monday, March 30, 1998 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
It will make our streets safer for everyone. 
It would be wise for us to look at the contents of Bill C-211. 
Bill C-211 gets to the heart of the matter. 
It is a common sense bill. 
But it did not. 
The police worked very closely with the member to put this bill forward. 
Various conditions may be placed on a person on probation. 
As such it should be revamped. 
It seeks to address the prevention of crime. 
If we are to prevent crime we have to look at the origins of crime. 
How do we deal with this? 
There is a two pronged approach. 
My motion deals with that and it is in sync with that. 
They can be taught about proper parenting skills and proper nutrition.  
There are a number of model plans in place. 
Children stayed in school longer. 
The parents have to be involved too. 
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
The decision making process is careful and extensive. 
The first of these is public safety, an issue of paramount importance. 
He talked about what happens in small communities in rural parts of the country. 
That is where I come from as well today.  
This concerns me because I know and I understand the effects in rural Canada. 
That is my concern.  
This law in my own opinion has a purpose that is necessary. 
I am very concerned for public safety. 
I am very concerned for the citizens in my community. 
There may need to be some changes in the wording. 
I also embrace the concept.  
That is why I cannot support the bill at this stage. 
I believe it is flawed.  
I believe it is what we were elected to do. 
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
Things have to be changed.  
The bill does what the parole system fails to do. 
I will put forward a different argument today. 
I will put forward the view of grassroots average Canadians.  
This is what Canadians want from the government. 
Bill C-211 will do two things. 
The system is broken and has to be fixed.  
Machell had in the past made threats on the victim's life. 
Why was this potentially violent criminal given the opportunity to even be out on parole? 
This heinous crime could have been prevented in so many ways. 
The victim should have been notified and she was not.  
There is no reason for this not to go forward.  
Liberals defend the justice system time and time again. 
They pretend it is working just fine the way it is. 
They want the status quo. 
They want a justice system that puts their rights ahead of the criminals. 
Cecilia and Tammy Grono were murdered. 
Two pre-school children now do not have a mother or a grandmother. 
This bill will accomplish that.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
They asked if we could fix it. 
I said ``Yes, we will do that for you. 
We will take this to the House. 
It all seems fairly reasonable''. 
We must never challenge the charter''. 
That is the Liberal mentality that we have here.  
Thus, in this country the prisoners have the right to vote. 
Yes, the charter of rights and freedoms should apply to them. 
After all, we do not want to challenge that. 
So today prisoners have the right to vote. 
I disagree with that.  
We have criminals today distributing obscene material on young people. 
In fact, the legislators of this country are the ones who make the decisions. 
I cannot believe where this government comes from at times. 
I am ashamed at times to listen to the debate from the other side.  
Time and time again we repeat ourselves. 
That is what these kinds of issues are about. 
He said a fellow came into his life who sexually molested his daughter. 
He has to pay another $15,000 on top of that in legal fees. 
I do not think the government sees the consequences of these things.  
Perhaps that is wrong. 
Howie, as a father, said no to this. 
The issue here is that this person was guilty of breaking the law. 
I know there is not much individuality on the other side. 
They were told to vote against it. 
They are afraid of a charter challenge. 
All of this indicates that we have a justice system in decay.  
The member tells me to open my eyes. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
It being 11.45 a.m., the time provided for debate has expired.  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there unanimous consent to proceed as such?  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Unfortunately, it made a mockery of much of the commission's final report.  
For the most part it is a shame. 
They have had an extremely difficult struggle during these past few years.  
In particular, we would like to see the military justice system reflect the following qualities. 
I am talking about the military justice system. 
The government refuses to address any of these qualities in any serious way. 
I would suggest that is at least what most people were led to believe.  
The second recommendation is in regard to the judge advocate general. 
Again this was not done.  
Such a system would also be able to act independently and impartially. 
What changes have been made are superficial at best. 
We will see how much accountability will be registered in those superficial changes. 
Bill C-25 fails these tests.  
That is a concern to us and it should be a concern for the military. 
That is certainly warranted. 
It seems to be very much directed in that fashion and we object to that. 
Complete summary trial reform is the third point. 
How much teeth they will have remains to be seen.  
At least we can look at what is going on in that fashion.  
The amendments have been subject to scrutiny. 
There will be no oversight agency. 
Most of the implementation of the amendments will be over a five-year period. 
The board will be disbanded after two years and to what end? 
What is the value of the board in the first place?  
Many of these amendments are good ideas. 
Both cause me some concern.  
The ombudsman will be a paper tiger. 
It will have no teeth and will likely provide more frustration than good. 
They certainly do not have any influence or power to change anything.  
The bottom line is the Canadian forces need an inspector general. 
America, Germany and Britain have inspectors general. 
The Reform Party has called for one. 
The Somalia commissioners have called for one.  
This situation impacted on the security of this country. 
Yet at CFB Leitrim there were individuals using drugs. 
Where do drugs come from? 
Ultimately from organized crime. 
They were associating with such suppliers. 
I do not think that is acceptable. 
It should not be acceptable in this country. 
The information the military often involves itself in deals with what? 
Who deals with drugs? 
This is exactly what has happened.  
I think these investigations definitely have to be outside the realm of DND. 
Yet this government chooses to ignore the recommendation. 
They do not want independence. 
That should be happening. 
Unfortunately that inquiry was cut short.  
Bill C-25 is an opportunity for this government to correct the wrong. 
It refuses to do it. 
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the question from the member. 
We made very little mention of that amendment to the act in our proposal. 
Do they want the death penalty or not? 
That is a very simple question to ask in the form of a referendum. 
It would be fantastic feedback.  
I am talking from a personal point of view. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Indeed Calgary has been a fine recruiting centre for the Canadian armed forces. 
It is pertinent to Calgarians and to the military.  
The base has been moved. 
Just the raw land itself is worth hundreds of millions of dollars.  
That is not the only city. 
Where will that money go? 
Where will they go? 
It will have to go up for development in some fashion.  
Was it a political move to get rid of the military? 
The infrastructure in Edmonton was a disaster and it still is a disaster. 
There was no excuse to move the Calgary military base to Edmonton. 
There was no advantage whatsoever. 
We have not seen the end of it yet.  
I think it will be worth looking into.  
Hopefully at the next election there will be no seats. 
I am sure members would be pleased to hear that. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
As I have already stated, the death penalty is being taken out.  
I would like the hon. member's response to that.  
Mr. Speaker, we will not be introducing an amendment. 
I do not see any reason they should not be consulted.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
The Esquimalt base is in my riding of Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca. 
Parliament as an institution has not served the military well. 
This cannot be a witch-hunt. 
The Somalia inquiry recommended numerous things. 
This is an enormous waste of opportunity. 
It is also an enormous waste of taxpayers' money.  
It erodes the very essence of any organization.  
Why should they give the best performance? 
Why should they be the best they can become?  
The bill has ignored numerous recommendations. 
There are numerous other things that the military has failed to deal with. 
I told the Minister of National Defence that these rumours were flying around. 
Have we heard anything? 
No, we have not.  
How many jobs will it be? 
Who will have to do this? 
These are important issues.  
I would like to point out the backdrop against which this takes place. 
In fact they are a model of downsizing in the country. 
They have cut where they have needed to cut. 
They streamlined where they needed to streamline. 
They have been held up as a model of downsizing.  
They felt committed to the institution. 
What kind of a situation do we have? 
What kind of a minister do we have? 
The Union of Defence Employees wants a fair shake. 
That is also a concern of these people.  
It could have been a win-win situation. 
However, these people want to have some fairness built into the system. 
Our military men and women should have the same consideration.  
It is not much but it would provide them with some money.  
The raises the military personnel received were an absolute disgrace. 
It is clearly to the soldier's advantage to go away. 
But what does that do to the family? 
When those soldiers are away they worry about their spouses and children. 
There has to be some fairness built in.  
Our military people are not looking to get rich but they are looking for fairness. 
If they are going to put their lives on the line, they want fairness.  
I and my colleague have addressed this issue before. 
Other factors extraneous to merit are taken into consideration.  
Our armed forces demand and deserve a game plan. 
What is their role in the world? 
They do not know. 
They will do it with honour and they will do it well. 
We have to give them direction. 
There is no compromise on that. 
This means the equipment and direction. 
Give our military personnel a game plan. 
Give them the tools to do their job.  
In this era of cutting, efficiency can be put into the military. 
Treasury Board repeatedly meddles in the affairs of the military. 
It is a significant departure from what occurred before. 
The armed forces need our help. 
Their social and economic situation needs improvement. 
The government needs to listen to our critic. 
It needs to work with members across party lines. 
It needs to work for our military.  
We will not accept the subterfuge that has taken place for so long. 
We will not accept that it has not been listened to. 
The government must be held accountable. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
I encourage the hon. member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca to comment on this.  
What is the role of our military? 
There is no clear description of the military's role. 
We do not know why the submarines were rejected. 
We do not even know if they were considered properly.  
First should be the role. 
We cannot do our job without its help. 
In many cases the U.S. military relies on our help.  
There have been criticisms against the leadership in the military. 
As in any organization there are good eggs and bad eggs. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I have one question.  
The hon. Reform member spoke about our friendly relations with the Americans. 
Would he agree that sometimes that relationship gets a little too friendly?  
Most Canadians were unaware that this was happening. 
Madam Speaker, I am not as well versed as the hon. member on that issue.  
We do retain our autonomy. 
That has always been very clear. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I know the member speaks from experience. 
He has had very close liaison with the military bases in his riding. 
But it chose not to do it.  
Morale plays a big role in the military. 
I thank my friend from Calgary Northeast, our defence critic. 
It has raised their rents repeatedly while freezing their pay. 
That is the kind of situation we have.  
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
There were three important recommendations that came out of the Somalia inquiry. 
They continue to be ignored by the government.  
Judge Marin was commissioned to report on the military police. 
The Liberals continuously ignore the role of Parliament with respect to national defence. 
The government has forgotten that deployment decisions of our troops should be taken by Parliament.  
British Columbians are justifiably proud of our military. 
We are going to look to our military. 
Ottawa has let British Columbia down very badly indeed.  
The Liberals have put politics before principle. 
They have put politics before what is good for the nation and good for society. 
The Liberals are no friends of the military. 
We had another helicopter crash last week. 
I wanted to ask a question but unfortunately I already know the answer.  
The Prime Minister's office? 
That is the ultimate slap in the face.  
Under the government the military has lost pay comparability with the public service. 
This is what our Liberal administration told us on Friday. 
This displays Liberal mindset. 
First of all, our military personnel should not be compared with the public service. 
They are not the public service. 
They do not resemble the public service. 
Our personnel should be compared with military personnel on a world scale. 
Why was this allowed to happen? 
I see it right up front. 
The problems all rest with this frontbench. 
As I mentioned, Comox armed forces base is in my riding. 
Moonlighting is rampant and essential for many of the young members. 
This makes no sense. 
They are not doing the same job and there is no comparability. 
They are losing pilots one after the other. 
Instituting a measure that favourably treats pilots is demoralizing for the rest of the personnel. 
Why in heaven's name we got ourself into this. 
There is no vision over there.  
Once again, this is shameful. 
The pay of the military has been frozen since 1991. 
However, a four year phase-in period is totally inappropriate. 
Where is the government's vision? 
People are having to stay in their job classifications or job categories. 
Those are valuable people. 
We want to keep them. 
We also want to compensate them in a way that they deserve. 
That is not happening.  
This government is great at pitting one group against another. 
This is just not the way to operate. 
He has been there for a long time. 
We have to ensure that we carry that tradition in this country. 
It is very important that we do that.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Many workers are losing their jobs. 
I think much of it makes sense, so far. 
I cannot say that it is something I would subscribe to. 
I am with the member in terms of that part of his question.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
My question to the hon. member is:
Maybe the Reform member could answer that for me.  
Madam Speaker, I consider that comment an insult. 
That is the last thing I am doing here. 
This is a Liberal apologist.  
He said that I made jingoistic statements. 
I suggest the member look up jingoistic in the dictionary. 
Somehow he tied that to housing and pay increases.  
I heard that comment, too. 
That is highly inappropriate when we are trying to have a constructive debate. 
That is the ultimate in lip service to a Liberal apologist.  
That points out a fundamental flaw in the way this administration operates. 
Those problems did not originate this year. 
We have people who have to moonlight. 
This has been front page news in Esquimalt, Victoria, Edmonton and other locations. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
It was done under Trudeau and it continues to this day. 
The member talks a lot about morale. 
That is what morale deals with. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
And the division bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Division on this motion stands deferred until tomorrow.  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I did not get any translation at all. 
I do not know if it is working or not.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Was the member referring to Bill C-37?  
Madam Speaker, if we are following the rotation that is fine. 
However, the government proposes to limit it to those judges who have reached age 65.  
These are both common features of other pension plans. 
Terms could be renewed once on renomination.  
The Ontario Court of Appeal is facing significant delays, particularly in civil appeals. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
It has failed to limit the Conditional Release Act. 
My question is simple. 
What about prison guards? 
I spend a lot of time in the prisons. 
It is a dangerous and difficult job. 
The government would simply say it is extremist and does not care. 
Let us not forget big business grants. 
It has several millions of dollars to give to big businesses. 
Maybe they are donors to the Liberal Party. 
I do not know.  
These are the kinds of issues we hoped would be solved when we came here. 
However, what are debating today? 
Judges' salaries and benefits. 
The government is not worried about those million children. 
They have not had a raise for seven or eight years. 
The government does not deal with that. 
It gives them bonuses and makes it look good. 
It goes on and on. 
The caring government of the day, huh.  
Is that not good news? 
It is going to be a patronage heaven by the time they get done.  
A couple more will be recommended by somebody else. 
They clearly know how to talk the talk, but they do not walk the walk. 
Club Chretien with its exclusive membership is already at 124 members. 
This legislation will open the door for more. 
Is that not good news? 
Have a good time taxpayers of Canada. 
What does all does that mean? 
The Liberals are doing it to B.C. 
That is exactly what the Liberals are doing to B.C. 
Let us take a good close look at this. 
He was accused of being drunk and was found guilty. 
The overloaded courts are squarely to blame.  
The other four were killed in the automobile wreck: 
We were normal families. 
Ben Keuben is a house painter; his wife Darlene is a school librarian. 
However, he was given very strict bail conditions. 
On March 19, 20 and 21, 1997 a preliminary hearing was conducted. 
After three days of testimony, the proceedings were adjourned until May 6. 
All deals were refused by the prosecution.  
The victims and even the families of the criminals are not satisfied. 
They want this to come to end but the system carries it on and on.  
It is too bad we cannot do something to get rid of the Liberals. 
They are the cause of the whole mess to start with. 
The sooner that happens the better it will be.  
Some day, and it will be real soon. 
One day the Liberal honeymoon will be over. 
The longer they keep that up, the worse it is going to get. 
Let us look after those million kids who are living in poverty. 
That attitude stinks and it is time to get rid of it.  
It is almost two o'clock and we will now proceed to Statements by Members.  
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
I congratulate Mr. Klaus Woerner, president of ATS, for his vision. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
CANADIAN NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR THE BLIND 
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):
The role of the CNIB is growing ever more crucial.  
Mrs. Claudette Bradshaw (Moncton, Lib.):
CANADIAN NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR THE BLIND 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Congratulations on a job well done.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
The chief and council have mismanaged the band's finances. 
Political instability on the reserve is causing massive problems.  
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
The 1998 budget acknowledged the needs of Canadians with learning disabilities.  
Society needs to continue to address these barriers to this invisible disability. 
Learning disabled children do not have limits on their abilities. 
Simply, they learn in a different way.  
The hon. member for Okanagan-Coquihalla.  
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
Orchardists in British Columbia have been waiting almost a year.  
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Mr. Don Attridge has received the prestigious Adrien Pouliot award. 
Thanks to Mr. Attridge for making Markham proud.  
ASSISTANCE TO ICE STORM VICTIMS 
Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard-La Prairie, Lib.):
I pay tribute to the Government of Canada's part in revitalizing Montreal.  
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
PORT MOODY-COQUITLAM BYELECTION 
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
Some suggest that Reformers go back and join the revamped Conservative Party. 
Others will do anything to convert former Conservatives. 
The leader wants a party with a new name but the same leader.  
The best they can hope for is to be Reformatories. 
The Reformers today are up Beaver Creek without a paddle.  
Today the voters for Port Moody-Coquitlam have a choice. 
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, in the period before 1986 hepatitis C was not even known. 
There are risks and benefits in every medical procedure.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, that is not much comfort for those who were infected before 1986. 
Frankly, they do not really care what it is called.  
The minister is so fond of saying ``We care. 
We have families too and we really understand how you feel''. 
Is this the new Liberal definition of compassion?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Etobicoke Centre, Lib.):
However, we also agreed that we should proceed on a principle. 
The hon. member for Macleod.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
That is categorically false. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
It is clear from the chronology that 1986 was the turning point. 
That was the turning point.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
He said ``Compensate everyone''. 
That was his recommendation.  
As soon as they realized they were wrong, they reversed their stand.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Justice Krever did his job. 
It is a distinction with which I believe the Canadian people will agree.  
TRANSITIONAL JOB CREATION FUND 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
There is one year to go. 
It has been a useful tool in the past. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I am not interested in grandstanding.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
The other provinces also have reservations about the millennium fund.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We had very positive discussions on the millennium fund. 
We will, of course, be having discussions and negotiations. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
With the millennium fund unilateralism did not work. 
Unilateralism will never work. 
It just gives separatists another cause celebre. 
Bilateralism will not work either.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
This is federalism at its best, working together to help young Canadians.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Health is wrong. 
As a consequence, we have 40,000 people left outside the compensation package. 
Will the minister now act unilaterally to compensate these innocent victims?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
This is not a partisan issue. 
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
He is talking about fairness. 
I want those 40,000 victims compensated. 
It is as simple as that. 
He has the constitutional and moral responsibility to do that. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I take a different view of the facts. 
I have explained the principle upon which we proceeded. 
The member is entitled to disagree.  
This is the basis upon which all governments have approached this matter. 
We have identified the principle upon which we have acted. 
All governments are agreed that this is the appropriate approach.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
It is interesting they would take that attitude.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
This is the biggest one month increase in employment since November 1994. 
Those are the kinds of numbers that give Canadians confidence.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
We have seen an increase in personal bankruptcies and in personal debts. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
It specifically targeted welfare. 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEE BOARD 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
His complaint is patronage and incompetence.  
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Its competency is very clear. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
We have to return to merit, he says. 
She was appointed because she was a good Liberal.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
She did not say that there are others better qualified. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
I should point, however, that not a single employee is being laid off. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
The decision is firm, and it is impossible to change it now. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
What is she trying to hide?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
The answers to these questions and the challenges are with us. 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We are moving toward ambulatory care, as Minister Rochon is doing in Quebec. 
Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
It will have the most advanced state of the art communications and translation facilities.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Are we to shut down CSC for a day to find these missing files?  
My question is for the solicitor general. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
In many cases they have been pardoned. 
Sometimes their partners are not aware of their past.  
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member knows that is not true. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, just to reiterate, the government takes this circumstance extremely seriously. 
My colleagues and I are looking at the history associated with this. 
We will act to include the Dene people in our review. 
We are taking a very responsible and focused approach to this.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member is entitled to his view.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
The question for the minister is this. 
If the Minister of Health wants to answer that question, I will permit it. 
The hon. Minister of Health.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
This minister has met with those representatives. 
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the Environment.  
This decision will result in pollution which is seriously damaging.  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Canadians are being denied the right to choose freely. 
This is called tied selling.  
The hon. Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the issue of tied selling has been referred to the committee. 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Energy.  
However, the act is not always complied with on certain sites on the Internet.  
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Industry has spoken on this subject once before. 
He has taken note of the questions brought before this House. 
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the Minister of Finance.  
Why is it more prepared to run the franchise ``Mergers R Us''?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
This question is for the Minister of Justice.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the solicitor general.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
In fact some 12% of our operation is handled outside the public service.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Where is the Red Cross? 
Has it contributed one nickel to this compensation package? 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Let me ask him another question about copyright. 
Why has it taken so long? 
When are appointments going to be made to the board?  
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the government recognizes the importance of the copyright board.  
I should mention that the copyright board has operated, without incident, for many years. 
The appointments will be looked at in the future by the Minister of Industry.  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
CORRECTIONS AND CONDITIONAL RELEASE ACT 
They can then reapply almost immediately.  
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have three petitions to present today. 
Two of them are very similar in form and content. 
They follow several other petitions that I have previously presented on this subject.  
So far the federal government has not offered to contribute its share.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
GOODS AND SERVICES TAX 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I suggest that all questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
The bill also establishes the judicial compensation and benefits commission. 
What about their own appointments?  
The bill is proposing many amendments to the Judges Act. 
To ask the question is to answer it.  
The proposals focussed solely on making this compensation more transparent.  
The same goes for superior court judges.>Paradoxically, 
Some encouragement for those who stay. 
But this is the explanation offered by the Treasury Board president.  
Everyone must do his or her share to help balance the budget. 
The Liberal government must not start squandering the taxpayers' money. 
There is no arm twisting required to appoint a judge. 
Such expenditures are unacceptable. 
This money could pay for a number of hospital beds. 
Judges are not above everyone else. 
Each one of us pays for these judges.  
We all know how federal judges are appointed.  
That is how these things are done. 
I think that, nowadays, neither judges nor the Prime Minister- 
The hon. member for Bourassa on a point of order.  
Mr. Speaker, the member for Bourassa is partly right. 
No Conservative or other government has ever done such a thing.  
It went looking for candidates among the ranks of the Liberal Party. 
I have great respect for the Supreme Court of Canada.  
We made several suggestions. 
That having been said, we will be voting against Bill C-37. 
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Let me start with the few ingredients she got right. 
That needed to be done in the act.  
It is also helpful to have a unified family court. 
To repeat them all over again is a duplication.  
There is some reference in the bill to a commission. 
I believe the bill makes a recommendation that a commission be set up. 
There was an opportunity to go further with this legislation. 
There was an opportunity to open up the way judges are appointed. 
Even with this minute change, it does not go far enough. 
There is a missed opportunity here. 
Young people appear before judges every day. 
Families appear before judges every day. 
There is some relief in sight.  
This was an opportunity to address those concerns. 
It was also an opportunity to look at the crisis in the justice system. 
The provincial government says it does not have the money. 
It has cut back on resources.  
There is a crisis at the grassroots level in Canada's justice system. 
That is the third problem with this piece of legislation.  
That is another thing which is lacking from this piece of legislation. 
It is another area the Minister of Justice might very well have addressed.  
That is not to say that judges are not important. 
This is not the appropriate way to address the system. 
The minister had a golden opportunity. 
That is what we are hearing from our constituents. 
That is what the Minister of Justice is not hearing. 
Those recommendations provided the minister with a way to not necessarily implement the recommendations. 
For those reasons we will not be supporting the legislation. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am sure the hon. member would agree with me. 
I was listening to his speech.  
That does not happen all that often. 
I wonder if the member would agree with that statement?  
He plead guilty to causing four deaths. 
Mr. Speaker, there are actually three questions. 
The judge or the justice has to be free from political considerations. 
The distinction between the judiciary and legislature is well known. 
It is not the job of the judiciary to make popular decisions. 
That is very dangerous. 
They look at the salaries of private lawyers. 
There is a fault in that reasoning.  
They do not make nearly the salaries those in the private sector make. 
The third question is one that I have not heard all the facts on. 
I do not know the facts of the case. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
The new provisions certainly improve that situation. 
Together the two members will appoint a third member as the chair.  
The commission will have to report at regular intervals, which encourages an open process.  
The PC Party of Canada does not have any problem with these proposals. 
We will be raising these points in committee.  
In conclusion, we are encouraged by the provisions contained in Bill C-37. 
We are prepared to support it in principle at second reading.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
If there were four or five, what would be procedure be?  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
They have been waiting an awful long time for pay increases as well.  
Pay equity is something that should be resolved. 
There is no question about that. 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
On the issue of the pay raise I must state how disappointed I am. 
The constables and the corporals did not. 
If he has a problem, then the citizens of my community definitely have a problem. 
They are being lured away by other police departments. 
Chief Superintendent Smith is plagued with almost perpetual vacancies. 
What did the RCMP rank and file receive after five years of waiting? 
Even then they will still be approximately $3,000 behind their Vancouver counterparts.  
This government appears to have its priorities all out of sync. 
I will now move on to the issue of the judicial compensation and benefits commission. 
The Minister of Justice gets to make another political patronage appointment. 
What we need is less patronage.  
What do we get for this money?  
They will be paid fees fixed by the governor in council. 
There will be no parliamentary review or control of these salaries and fees.  
Bill C-2 was passed in March 1996. 
Bill C-42 was passed in June 1996. 
We now have the Judges Act back once again for amendment. 
I hope we do not have other acts of parliament like this. 
No wonder our country has a $600 billion debt. 
One must wonder about the misplaced priorities. 
Maybe we should not be too surprised. 
We have not seen it yet.  
Victims are still waiting.  
But the Liberals are certainly wasting no time in looking after the judges. 
I will now move on to the fourth issue. 
It appears at the first clause of the bill. 
It amends section 2 of the act to include the definition for surviving spouse. 
That is extremely troubling. 
There is that elitism showing through again. 
Certainly most citizens are unfamiliar with the intricacies and the vagaries of the justice system. 
My goodness, I know lawyers who become confused. 
The judge ruled that this could not be viewed as an attempt to kill her. 
With that note, I will end my comments on this legislation.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
I personally have never seen such a thing.  
I have a question for my distinguished colleague in the Reform Party. 
Mr. Speaker, what can I say? 
Of course this would be subject to approval of the House. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
He was exceptionally upset over the whole issue of pay raises. 
Yes, certainly, Mr. Speaker. 
There is a serious morale problem there. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I issue a challenge to the member for Surrey North. 
I wonder if anyone has done a calculation. 
Mr. Speaker, I have to agree. 
I honestly do not know how many more police officers could be hired. 
It is not just the question of salaries for the RCMP. 
I have seen this program demonstrated to be very useful. 
It cuts down the amount of time police spend investigating cases. 
There is a serious potential that it could go under because of lack of resources.  
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to raise another side to this question. 
I have been watching the government cut its expenditures. 
There are some serious problems with policing in rural areas. 
Somebody had better get the idea straight as to where funds will be allotted.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
I say that because I am representing my constituents. 
As they hear what is going on in this parliament, they are very concerned. 
That is of major concern to the people in my riding of Yorkton-Melville.  
The government could have used this opportunity to open up the judicial process. 
There are a couple of positive things in here. 
Liberalized divorce laws should be fixed first.  
As I understand it, judges are already making approximately $140,000 per year. 
That is the key point. 
These people are frontline. 
They put their lives on the line to protect us. 
They need the support of those judges but we need to properly compensate them. 
That should be our first priority.  
That is where our priorities should be.  
How many Canadian workers receive retroactive pay raises as the judges will receive? 
That is going backwards. 
That is not the direction things should be heading in this country.  
Fees for commission members will be fixed by the governor in council. 
Members are deemed to be employed in the public service of Canada. 
This is the third time the Liberals have amended the Judges Act. 
Canadians want violent crime to be curbed. 
They do not want more of these judicial review types of legislation.  
It is time that this government got its priorities straight. 
The people know what is important. 
This bill proves the government does not. 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I would simply like to ask my colleague a question.  
This raises all sorts of questions with the public, perhaps legitimately so. 
This gives the whole proceeding an objective character.  
They have the right to determine who those judges are. 
They should not be patronage appointments. 
They have the right to determine what those people are paid. 
The people of Canada are fair. 
I think I have made my point abundantly clear.  
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
I am concerned about that.  
These two points cause me concern which I add to the debate. 
Mr. Speaker, the member makes an excellent point. 
I can only underline and underscore the importance of that point.  
We need judges who are not political. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
That is the point that needs to be made over and over.  
I worked on that gun registration issue a long time. 
I think this needs to be debated. 
I see the government unfortunately avoiding this debate.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the member broadening the picture. 
I do not agree necessarily that more education is going to be the answer. 
We need to strengthen our families first. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
The independent pay council is of concern to me. 
I am not talking about the gross amount paid. 
It is the times that count. 
As was pointed out, it really is not. 
They take care of their own and to heck with the little guy.  
Once again I agree that judges should get their raise. 
We might see a little independence there.  
I will comment on the surviving spouse situation. 
There are a couple of good things. 
That is a good part of the bill. 
Fairness is really important. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
There is also a backlog in our court system. 
Priorities are all around this government and it fails to recognize them.  
It spent millions and probably billions in the end. 
The government should set its priorities better. 
It should spend the money better. 
Let us get on with making Canada a better place.  
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
My hon. colleague is a former member of the RCMP. 
How is this going to affect them? 
Madam Speaker, I lived through that personally. 
It will recover a little bit now. 
These are the people with the lower salaries I was talking about earlier. 
There are more complaints against the members. 
There is no real change in the government's attitude. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
He is a former RCMP officer. 
In fact they have turned the judicial system to some extent on its head. 
That is not what they were there for in the first place. 
I would also like him to address the issue of accountability.  
They have put forth penalties that seemed completely out of proportion to the offence committed. 
They would go to the door and his boots and hat would be sitting inside. 
His wife would be there and they would see the bathroom door closed. 
The officers knew the suspect was there but could not go inside to arrest him. 
Judges have to be independent. 
They cannot be a law unto themselves. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
This is the third time the Liberal government has changed the Judges Act. 
We hope one day they will get it right. 
They certainly keep flailing away at it.  
This series of amendments does four things. 
First, it increases the salaries of judges. 
Second, it provides a better pension plan for judges. 
Those are the four things this bill provides. 
Some measures Canadians are willing to pay for. 
I will give some detail on each of the four measures. 
That is a nice bonus.  
The second measure concerns making the judges' pension plan more generous. 
The new changes will allow judges to retire much earlier. 
If they equal 80, the judge can retire with a full pension.  
It should be noted that the public service formula is based on 85 years. 
Theirs is a more generous formula by five years than public servants are allowed. 
This is a very generous pension formula for judges.  
It will be a four year appointment.  
The fourth measure is the authority to pay additional judges. 
It is the same with unified family court judges. 
Right now there are 12. The federal government is saying that it would pay 36. 
Canadians, for example, want victims' rights to be protected. 
What does the minister spend time on? 
That is the kind of perverse priority of the government.  
Then we have Canadians saying that they want laws that effectively deter youth crime. 
That is important to them. 
Yet, what does the government spend its time on? 
We would not want to actually bring a lawbreaker too easily to justice.  
Sometimes we wonder why Canadians put up with this nonsense. 
I will talk in a minute about delays in the legal system.  
Canadians are saying enough already.  
What does the minister do? 
My answer is absolutely not. 
What did the minister promise when she took on the job? 
What was her promise? 
I did not hear that.  
Oh really, her top priority. 
All the study had been done.  
The record speaks for itself. 
That is the case of my constituents, Mr. and Mrs. Gilles Deraiche.  
In September 1996 their son was viciously murdered in Ottawa. 
Since that time it took seven months to hold a preliminary hearing. 
Eight months after that a trial date is scheduled.  
This is very painful for them.  
These are the parents of a murdered son. 
In B.C. 40,000 criminals are awaiting trial. 
The priorities of this government are completely wrong. 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I listened attentively to the member's remarks. 
I remember how naive I was in law school. 
We had a visiting judge. 
I asked him afterwards how one became a judge. 
I know that really sounds naive but I was quite curious. 
Surely we can do a lot better than that in this country.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
She brought forth a heart-wrenching example. 
This is a situation that we are faced with across the country. 
The system right now does not provide for that.  
This is very frustrating and very inconvenient.  
That would be one simple way to bring things forward. 
There are a number of recommendations along that line. 
Perhaps I will get to them at another time. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Our judges should be paid fairly. 
No one has problems with that.  
What are the yearly salaries for judges of the Supreme Court of Canada? 
In other words, one group should not get much more than other groups.  
There are enormous opportunities for the government to really deal with this issue. 
They elect their judges, instead of appointing them. 
Competence is ensured through the electoral system. 
It has nothing to do with politics. 
Anyone who gets more than 50% of the vote is declared elected.  
They can read the local newspapers which cover the judges. 
They can call the county bar association. 
Again, they will be evaluated on the basis of merit.  
It does not extend for life.  
I would ask the government to consider the suggestion of an elected judiciary. 
I urge the government to look at the California system. 
The California system also has the ability to review the behaviour of judges.  
Five-year olds do not think that way. 
Where was the accountability? 
It simply did not exist.  
Competence and a continual review process has to be in place. 
We have to ensure that the judiciary is independent of the House. 
We are all accountable in this country.  
Let us look at the incredible costs that exist today in our legal system. 
We have a legal aid system which is costing us billions of dollars. 
To streamline and expedite the system is extremely important. 
Unfortunately I am not a lawyer. 
Sometimes I wish I were. 
However, we have a system which enables individuals to put forth constructive solutions. 
Justice denied is not justice. 
There are ways of doing this. 
Let us look at those ways and ensure these changes are made to the system. 
We have really been given a hard time with this. 
Fortunately for us it is not true.  
We look at justice in two ways. 
We look at it in a balanced way. 
There is also the issue of prevention. 
We can do something about that. 
But it has to start at time zero. 
We have to identify families at risk. 
There are programs that have done that.  
This is how we prevent crime. 
They are too young to be elected.  
Let us introduce one. 
It does not have to be some huge sink hole of money. 
It can be done within existing resources.  
Parents need to know what proper nutrition is. 
These are not just words. 
These are cold, hard scientific facts. 
We can prevent this. 
An aboriginal community off reserve is different from an aboriginal community on reserve. 
They have different needs but they can all be modified to address those needs.  
The cost savings are massive.  
Imagine what we could do with that $2 billion. 
I hope the Minister of Justice takes these suggestions and implements them.  
Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):
Some of his colleagues have not provided me with so many things to listen to. 
The government chose to amend section 745. 
Those were government priorities.  
If he did, it is unfair to use those numbers. 
However, would my colleague like to correct this for the record? 
All salaries are based within the confines of our own country. 
That is not the reality we live in. 
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
In listening to him three points came to my attention. 
I am much more concerned about the election of judges. 
I do agree that many things need to be changed.  
I would like to address a couple of points. 
I looked at all the data in this regard very carefully. 
We feel very strongly. 
We are completely in favour of responsible gun control. 
We have fought very hard for that. 
We wanted to divide the bill into two sections. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
What does Bill C-37 basically boil down to? 
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police have gone five years with a wage freeze. 
Are judges somehow more important? 
It just does not exist for other people. 
It is a shame. 
That has to end.  
I hear rumblings from members opposite who think that should be the case. 
Let us speak to the lack of priorities for a second if we may. 
Surely this is something of high priority and concern. 
Yet we see nothing to deal with the backlog in the courts. 
Yet they are quick to raise the salaries of the judges in this land.  
They would rather abdicate the supremacy of parliament to the judiciary. 
My fifth point is that street gangs are becoming a problem. 
The six reasons I listed are all perfectly justified. 
Now I will speak to the money. 
When the money trail is traced that is usually when these matters get interesting. 
Let us take a look at the lack of priorities in terms of money. 
They are not supposed to be having sex in jail. 
Once again that is a Liberal priority.  
How is this justified? 
Why not hire more police officers?  
Certainly none of these things speak to the priorities.  
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
The news reports from Sierra Leone are very serious. 
There is a crisis brought on by food shortages. 
This situation is extremely volatile. 
Sierra Leone's recent history is a continuing tragedy of enormous proportions. 
I was a participant from the city of Nepean. 
What is Canada's interest in Sierra Leone? 
Canada in relation to Sierra Leone has promised aid. 
The hon. member asked what help we are extending to Dr. Tectonides. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
This deprives the system of all credibility and integrity.  
This totally contradicts what the minister said, and I quote: 
That is not an incentive but a disincentive to work. 
It is encouraging an increase in poverty, rather than a decrease.  
-we are going to look into the matter and make the right decisions.  
We have reached the point where it is urgent to take action. 
Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The motion to adjourn the House is deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.41 p.m.)
