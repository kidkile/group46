Wednesday, November 3, 1999 
The Senate met at 1:30 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
They appealed to us on the basis of the problems they currently face. 
However, the human tragedy that is occurring in the West is very serious. 
I spoke to people last night who are manning the stress phone lines. 
They indicated to me that there have been eight suicides. 
Honourable senators, we are all grown and responsible people in this Senate. 
Honourable senators, there are many areas about which I should like to speak. 
However, I believe the subject of human tragedy is one of the most important. 
We must make an appeal on that basis. 
The economic crisis, as it exists, does not affect only the farm. 
Every machinery dealership is a small factory. 
They recondition tractors and other farm implements. 
The government will have to pay employment insurance to those people. 
I should like to speak about the repercussions of this crisis in the rural municipalities. 
This situation is impacting the entire province of Saskatchewan in many industries.  
We know all the reasons.  
In response to that, the agriculture committee chairman said: 
Honourable senators, this is a very serious situation deserving of debate in this house.  
The Hon. The Speaker :
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
I have no extraordinary comments to make. 
Are you in favour or not?  
Do you have no opinion?  
Is there a crisis or not?  
The farm crisis has been discussed for months. 
Costs are beyond the control of farmers. 
Prices are set in international markets and also beyond their control. 
There are defaults on credit. 
There are fewer purchases of machinery. 
School children are using last year's supplies. 
Almost everyone is pinching, squeezing and suffering.  
They were so grateful for the hearing they received from the Senate. 
They are terribly buffeted and demoralized by forces they cannot control. 
A number of my colleagues were also in attendance. 
We talked about what they were experiencing. 
When I looked into their eyes, I saw fear. 
These are individuals who are at the abyss. 
It involves their survival, and it is now or never. 
As you come from Manitoba, you can appreciate the situation. 
Western alienation, as has been mentioned - 
The Hon. the Speaker :
However, he may proceed if leave is granted.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
However, it was not forthcoming. 
To wait any longer may be too late.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
As has been pointed out, the Speaker must rule on this matter.  
I agree with both paragraphs ( a ) and ( b ) that the case has been made. 
The next paragraph states: 
That does not apply. 
There is then the following paragraph, which states: 
( d ) cannot raise matters which form, in substance, a question of privilege.  
That does not apply. 
On that basis, I believe the case has been made. 
The next paragraph states: 
I regret that, under paragraph ( b ), the case has not effectively been made. 
Honourable senators, I wish to thank His Honour for his decision, which we respect. 
However, this is not a matter we had anticipated. 
We have committees working this afternoon. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
This is an emergency. 
This is not something to be delayed. 
Therefore, we would not agree to delaying consideration of this matter. 
I recognize, honourable senators, that the matter of - 
Honourable senators, I rise on a point of order. 
The Deputy Leader of the Opposition is making a speech. 
I have asked for leave and I have given the reason for asking for leave. 
I think a simple "No" is all that is required if leave is not forthcoming.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, that is not correct. 
Obviously you did not read His Honour's decision of yesterday.  
Honourable senators, it is not quite as simple as that. 
I wish to respond to that issue. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, leave is not granted to change the rules. 
Honourable senators, I wish to draw your attention to rule 60(4). 
In other words, the emergency debate supersedes "Senators' Statements". 
The paragraph states `instead of calling'. 
Committee Authorized to Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
The Hon. the Speaker:
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is that agreed, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Bill to Amend-First Reading 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Availability of French Services for Francophones Outside Quebec-Notice of Inquiry 
Hon. Jean-Maurice Simard :
Appointment of the Honourable Beverley McLachlin As Chief Justice 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I received that news just now and am very pleased to hear it. 
The honourable senator's question could be interpreted in several ways. 
Justice McLachlin has a very distinguished record as a lawyer and a judge. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Do we have instructions on how that will impact on Question Period?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I did not mean to withhold consent. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Some units were listed as viable and others were termed non-viable. 
However, none of them have anything like that for a record.  
I feel that this unit deserves an apology. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, far be it from me to speak for the regiment. 
They should be re-established as a viable unit. 
In fact, they are, perhaps, one of the most viable units in Canada.  
Honourable senators, I thank the honourable senator for the information he has provided. 
Efforts to Increase Employment of Visible Minorities 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Last week, I had the opportunity to attend a conference in Ottawa. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
That has not been achieved to date. 
However, there are some hopeful signs.  
That is a positive though not an entirely satisfactory situation. 
However, there has been some indication that improvement is taking place. 
Efforts to Increase Employment of Visible Minorities in Government 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Will he undertake to do that?  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
It is not one on which I can presently place my hands. 
I will undertake to give that information to the honourable senator.  
Honourable senators, I have never served on that committee. 
The minister refers to the progress that is being made. 
This is a subject I raised yesterday with the minister.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I appreciate the honourable senator raising this issue again today. 
I thank the minister for that answer. 
Hon. James F. Kelleher :
That is a good question. 
A simple answer will do.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I do not know the former incumbent in the position. 
The MMT issue was his, was it not?  
His record would be generally regarded as a distinguished record. 
He voted against free trade, remember?  
I congratulate the government on his appointment.  
Whether this is one of them, I do not know. 
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I am very interested in the honourable senator's comments. 
The honourable senator may wish to suggest some of his own.  
Honourable senators, the leader speaks of the low Canadian dollar and the resource industry. 
There is a litany of problems in this regard. 
It is a total horror story. 
As individuals, our global wealth has been reduced in this country. 
This is eroding our ability to remain competitive as individuals in a global economy.  
Listen, you had the chance. 
I would hope so. 
Some even have to do with the currency.  
Personally, I am not. 
I simply cannot accept that. 
Delayed Answers to Oral Questions 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Nova Scotia- Responsibility for Cleanup of Toxic Waste Sites 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Lowell Murray on October 13, 1999) 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Donald H. Oliver on October 13, 1999) 
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
However, when the leader is present, questions should be addressed to the leader.  
Speech from the Throne 
Motion for Address in Reply-Debate Continued 
We shall remember our past, but not be manacled to it. 
Canada, my friends, is the right place to be.  
Honourable senators, my grandfather was a carpenter in Northern Ontario, in Sudbury. 
Our economy is growing steadily. 
Quite rightly, the strategy to make the vision a reality starts with our children.  
Clearly, the vision is off to a good start. 
It is worth repeating: 
It is the private sector that provides the fuel that drives the economy. 
We have all heard about the so-called brain drain. 
There is before us a vision of Canada. 
Hon. Erminie J. Cohen :
In fact, they are laudable goals. 
However, where is the target date? 
There is a linkage, honourable senators. 
Good economic policy and good social policy go hand in hand. 
You cannot have one without the other.  
The Speech from the Throne contained only half a line on homelessness. 
The Luxtons have set a goal. 
Why is it taking the government so long?  
Thousands of Canadians live in parks, under bridges, on the streets. 
They are the forgotten citizens of our society. 
Mother Teresa cautioned us when she said: 
Sadly, they do not have those opportunities today.  
The Prime Minister has said: 
We must move as quickly as possible from talk to action.  
Those people are not part of the Employment Insurance system. 
Yet 5.2 million Canadians live below the poverty line. 
Unfortunately, what they received were vague promises within a vague time frame.  
The Indian poet Tagore wrote: 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
Consequently, the Court ought to reconsider its decision. 
I will quote a memorable extract from this judgment, if I may: 
Such sentiments conjure up visions of knights in shining armour, brave officers, generous functionaries. 
This is the same man who signed the treaty of 1760.  
Let us consider the extent of the error. 
The order openly infringed article 29 of the Magna Carta. 
It infringed the petition of rights of 1628. 
We are passing a terrible legacy on to coming generations.  
Some will say that I have a grievance against the British Crown. 
Unfortunately, he will not be the last either.  
I invite the judges to consider the implications of their reasoning. 
Over the centuries, the Crown has swept this illegality under the carpet. 
To cancel the order might mean that the action was in fact taken. 
The denial of atrocities has a long history.  
I will read it as I wrote it: 
The Acadians were British subjects and entitled to state protection. 
The 1713 Treaty of Utrecht had ceded Acadia to Britain. 
The passing of time in no way diminishes the gravity of the act.  
The expulsion of the Acadians was a barbaric act of immense proportion. 
It was immoral and criminal ethnic cleansing....  
It may take centuries but justice will always prevail.  
Some may say that I have no sympathy with the problems of aboriginal Canadians. 
I have no ill feelings toward those who were the sole allies of my ancestors.  
A large number of native people also fell victim to Lawrence's intimidation. 
This could have been an opportunity to redress past wrongs. 
They must not think that Parliament is incapable of respecting citizens. 
Many questions have been raised, but few answers have been given. 
The lawyers must be rubbing their hands in glee. 
Lawrence would be proud.  
It would also not reflect the mentality of Acadians, quite the contrary.  
Some may say that the time has come for Acadians to forgive. 
Indeed, this is the right thing to do. 
Those who forget history are condemned to relive it.  
We must break the culture of impunity. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, Senator Comeau's time is up. 
Is leave granted to allow him to carry on?  
Time has not erased Lawrence's evil acts. 
He belongs to a group of monsters that must never be revered. 
His name must never be rehabilitated. 
Otherwise, who would be next? 
Note carefully the date of the petition. 
This inquiry invalidated any prescription statute that might exist. 
Otherwise, Lawrence should be condemned by history, as he deserves to be.  
On motion of Senator Hays, for Senator Finestone, debate adjourned.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Let us consider the reality of our work here. 
Hence, four senators per day would speak. 
Hon. John B. Stewart :
There is a limit of 15 minutes on speeches. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
On motion of Senator Hays, debate adjourned.  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
I will so do.  
By Honourable Senator Oliver, seconded by the Honourable Senator Di Nino 
With leave of the Senate and notwithstanding rule 58(1)( f ), 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, perhaps I could ask a question? 
Exactly what is the honourable senator proposing? 
It is not notice at all. 
Then perhaps I can put my other question? 
When does the honourable senator plan to formally place that notice before us?  
After second reading is granted to the bill.  
I believe we are somewhat confused. 
That would be quite interesting. 
I thank the honourable senator.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
Referred to Committee- Motion in Amendment Adopted 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read a third time?  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it agreed that the motion be amended?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion, as amended?  
Motion as amended agreed to.  
Legal and Constitutional Affairs 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, am I correct in my understanding that this is a debatable motion?  
That evidence has been transcribed. 
That is the principal reason for the request, honourable senators.  
Therefore, this house has never had that subject-matter before it. 
I am having difficulty with that and I am not sure how to proceed.  
Honourable senators, the motion is not an instruction to anyone. 
It is a request to the Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs.  
I am unclear as to precisely what we are speaking to.  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
I am aware that the committee has not yet been formed. 
However, it is my hope that this matter will not be delayed indefinitely. 
I understand that Senator Cools would like to have a written copy of the motion. 
Honourable senators, I would be happy to move the adjournment of the debate. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The question was put on the motion and it was adopted. 
There is ample precedent.  
On motion of Senator Cools, debate adjourned.  
Consequences of European Monetary Union 
Foreign Affairs Committee Authorized to Engage Services 
Hon. John B. Stewart :
Honourable senators, I move: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
In the last session, we expended that amount of money.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the report?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Hon. John B. Stewart :
Honourable senators, I move: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, it is your pleasure to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Shelter Strategy for Aboriginal Peoples 
Honourable Senator Rompkey, P.C. ) 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Consideration of Matter of Urgent Public Importance Pursuant to Rule 60 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, we have reached the end of the Orders of the Day. 
I call on the Honourable Senator Gustafson.  
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
Honourable senators, pursuant to rule 61(1), I move: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. Erminie J. Cohen :
I am compelled to participate. 
I am not a member of the Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry. 
I live in an urban environment. 
The first letter is from Carol Nicholson, and she writes: 
Life on the farm used to be enjoyable but has it ever changed...  
I have been married to my husband, Martin, for 13 years. 
He just wants his children to have the things other children do. 
I have suffered severe depression due to the phone calls and harassment. 
He also complains of being sick so he can be near us. 
Many nights he would be sleeping at the foot of our bed. 
When asked "why" he said I just wanted to see my dad.  
Either one or the other. 
This is terrible for a child to have to go through.  
Who is suffering here??? 
Then you receive harassing phone calls from the bill collectors. 
With the price of grain, who can afford to sell??? 
We are all suffering. 
Is there anyone listening????? 
What is happening to our farm families???? 
Now will my children go to college?????? 
I don't know the answer....  
Help the children who live on farms. 
I want to see my children smile and laugh again, stress free. 
Another excerpt, honourable senators, read as follows: 
We borrowed a cell phone for those calls. 
On October 10 an emergency arose and we needed to call a doctor. 
We could not even call an operator! 
We have been in a family business for 26 years. 
It has been difficult to keep the lights on this last year. 
As always I planted a large garden. 
My 2 freezers are full to the brim with my vegetables and fruit. 
There are some things you can't make. 
Each year we see our community struggle to hold on. 
Each year our tiny community gets smaller and smaller. 
The church can no longer afford building repairs. 
All I see is things deteriorating, shrinking or dying. 
Babies are very rare in my neighbourhood. 
Farmers around here are all in their mid 40's to mid 80's.  
And I ask myself, "Why are we doing this?" 
Are there enough jobs for all of us? 
Will there be enough food produced without us? 
That letter is from Judy.  
We have tried to diversify, but everything requires more money. 
Have you checked how many farmers have committed suicide these last 2 years?  
Please hear our pleas before it's too late!  
Honourable senators, I rest my case.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I appreciate very much the opportunity to discuss and debate this issue. 
That presents a bit of a puzzle in terms of designing a universal solution. 
Nevertheless, steps have been taken to respond.  
That is the proverbial battle for the level playing field. 
That is $900 million, honourable senators. 
Honourable senators, we are also making NISA easier to get. 
As a result, 41,000 more farmers have faster access to more funds. 
That is what it is there for. 
That assistance is provided as an interim payment under AIDA.  
Having said that, I must be forgiven for making a slight diversion in the debate. 
In 1997-98 it was $251 million. 
This is a federal-provincial problem. 
It must be dealt with by both levels of government. 
This problem is too important to the country. 
This challenge is too large. 
I have given some indication of the efforts of the government to date. 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Honourable senators, there is no doubt that there is a farm crisis. 
There is no doubt that that farm crisis has existed for a long time. 
I have no reason to doubt his figures.  
It is affecting teachers and doctors and lawyers and gas station attendants and waitresses. 
A provincial delegation came to Ottawa to ask for help. 
They now understand how deeply rooted this problem is and that it needs immediate fixing. 
They came with the expectation and hope that there would be some federal response. 
What was the federal response? 
"Go home, we will look at the numbers again." 
Senator Cohen has listed some of the letters sent to parliamentarians. 
We are all getting letters of desperation. 
Honourable senators, the problems in Saskatchewan are not just the result of international farming issues. 
We blame all our problems on the international situation. 
Yet, we go back with the same strategy. 
We have done nothing new, creative or different. 
Where is the new creative thinking? 
For example, what are our marketing policies on grain?  
I cannot say that the premiers were always on side. 
This is an immediate crisis.  
While we are attempting to do that, farmers are going under. 
We will be left with corporate farming. 
It is time for the government to come clean. 
Families are under greater pressure than ever before. 
Honourable senators, time has run out. 
The speeches have been made in this and the other chamber. 
Today we do vote counts. 
Saskatchewan and Manitoba will not win on vote counts. 
It does not serve us well to lay the blame on the provinces. 
However, this was not a federal government program alone. 
This was a federal government program in cooperation with the provinces. 
The provinces stood proudly with the federal government and announced this program. 
They said that it would help the farmers in need throughout this country. 
Regrettably, it has not. 
This is not a stand-alone federal government issue. 
What happened in my province? 
It is not a unilateral federal program.  
It is important to examine exactly why AIDA is not working. 
Clearly, the criteria set by all the partners were not the right criteria. 
No, I do not think so. 
Let us examine why the program started to unravel.  
Clearly that was mistake number one. 
We did not do that. 
We did not do that. 
It went to the wrong people, too. 
Where is the rest of the money going?  
Why are these needy farmers not qualifying for these funds? 
How can we make that money accessible to the farmers? 
We must examine prices. 
I am sad to say that the same situation exists in Manitoba. 
Everyone has backed off and decided that we can spend less money here.  
We have not yet dealt adequately with all of those changes. 
Honourable senators, I thank His Honour for allowing this debate. 
I know their comments are sincerely felt. 
In my opinion, there is not sufficient acknowledgement of the urgency of the problem. 
This problem is urgent.  
Why is the problem so urgent? 
They have spent unbelievable sums of money for machinery and inputs. 
Now the banks are ready to foreclose. 
The farmers cannot pay their taxes.  
If we do not want that to happen, we must act swiftly. 
Sometimes a sharp surgical stroke is the best way to do it.  
These very productive Canadians are caught in financial strife. 
It was a refusal to meet their request for additional aid. 
It was the estimate in July.  
They do not know the source of those figures. 
They have everything to do with the global economy and trade.  
The cash outlays alone are running $60 to $80 per acre. 
Subsidies elsewhere are a major problem for our farmers. 
In Manitoba, it is estimated to be $100 million. 
No industrial sector could hope to stay competitive against these odds. 
The international subsidy problem must be resolved. 
In the meantime, our farmers must have more federal government assistance. 
Today, the government could afford to carry our food producers over this hump. 
Honourable senators, I am speaking largely about Western Canada. 
Why should the government help farmers keep their land? 
I am talking about the family farm way of life. 
I am tempted to put it in terms of culture and heritage. 
Sometimes you pay $2.00 or more for a loaf.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I am asking for leave.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
May I have leave to table these letters?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, there is a request by Senator Spivak to table letters. 
Is it your wish that the letters be tabled?  
Further federal assistance is needed now. 
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
It is a difficult problem.  
What is happening in agriculture is a bit of a revolution. 
They were modifying the grains and so on. 
Canada, quite wisely, opted for the idea of income insurance. 
Income insurance is falling down on the Prairies. 
However, it is interesting to see how well it is working in Alberta. 
It has worked quite well. 
There are no excuses for sometimes being a little unsympathetic. 
We cannot keep rewarding you on a commodity basis." 
There has to be some sort of revolution in food production. 
Sometimes we have good first thoughts. 
We have our Agriculture Committee. 
That is not a good enough answer. 
It took place under an NDP government. 
Perhaps that is what solved their deficit problem.  
Certainly, so far as the farmers are concerned, they are one and the same. 
That is not something the present government in Ottawa can say. 
It is a typical Liberal response. 
It is a welfare program. 
We do not fill out forms. 
That is not what we do. 
However, that is what the Liberal government in Canada expects the farmers to do.  
We now have negative figures in Saskatchewan and in Manitoba for farm income. 
What we do not have from the present government is a national agricultural policy. 
That is exactly what a marketing board is. 
It is a monopoly. 
Out in the West, however, we are fending for ourselves. 
We all know what is happening in Europe. 
They are paying up to $8 in some countries for a bushel of wheat. 
European governments are subsidizing this because they cannot sell it for that price. 
They cannot even give it away.  
That is what has happened in Europe.  
The Americans have joined the fray. 
They have decided to take the Europeans on and are now paying subsidies. 
That is not unusual in the West. 
It is not unusual for a farmer anywhere. 
That is what is happening on the Prairies today.  
That is what those countries are doing. 
They are giving away their wheat.  
Canada is an exporting country. 
They must be protected because they know how to farm that land. 
We cannot let them all go broke and leave town. 
Honourable senators, we must allow for a time of transition. 
That is what we must do. 
We cannot ask the Europeans to get rid of subsidies. 
We all know what happens with welfare. 
People become dependent on it and refuse to get off. 
That is what has happened. 
The Americans have decided to do something else. 
I do not wish to see people live only in urban centres. 
A rural place is a place to which you can get away. 
You are alone to some extent. 
The rural areas are different and they are important. 
However, they must be economically viable. 
Rural people are smart. 
Let us give the farmers something that has some hope attached to it. 
That will not help. 
They do not want welfare. 
They never have and they do not want welfare now. 
However, I will tell you one thing:
Mr. Romanow came here. 
They did not treat him well. 
The government did not take their concerns as a high priority. 
He says, "I have $90 billion to spend and I can hardly wait. 
Honourable senators, AIDA is flawed. 
We should get rid of it and come up with something that works. 
This was supposed to work last spring. 
It is now fall. 
The farmers in Saskatchewan must get ready for April pretty soon. 
That is not the way to respond to an emergency.  
We ask that senators opposite have a close look at what their government is doing. 
They are worried about their communities. 
Hon. Herbert O. Sparrow :
There is a saying, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." 
Well, this system is "broke" so let's fix it. 
Nothing is happening except that our farmers are going broke. 
Yes, there was some consultation. 
That did not happen.  
Senator Carstairs said everyone cooperated. 
The provincial governments did not agree. 
The money was to be available in the first part of the year. 
The provincial governments were blamed for not coming on side. 
What was the federal department doing? 
Why would it take the federal government that long to send out an agreement? 
Time is crucial for the agriculture community. 
We can talk about long-term programs. 
It was a month ago or six months ago. 
Let us deal with the crisis. 
Let us get that money into their hands.  
We are talking about additional money. 
Perhaps it will be needed forever. 
Let them go in dignity. 
All those things are happening now. 
We must look at the facts.  
We do not ask how long old-age pensions will be given out. 
Do we want an agricultural industry in this nation? 
We are in the process of giving away our balances there on world trade. 
We will soon be in trouble in those industries as well. 
There is no question about that. 
That is the crucial aspect. 
Then we will be importing food in this nation.  
That is what the European community is doing. 
They insist that they be able to feed themselves. 
We must be able to feed ourselves.  
I wish that Honourable Senator Carstairs was here. 
Why did they not just make up a more simple form? 
Have they never been to Saskatchewan, to a struggling farm? 
How many of our people at that time were on the Internet?  
I could not get a form. 
They photocopied them and made copies available to us. 
We are talking now about something being wrong with the agricultural industry. 
We are getting the message that we should get rid of those inefficient farmers. 
That is one answer, but our farmers are not inefficient. 
I made this statement before and I will make it again. 
There will be nothing left in the rural communities. 
What kind of province, what kind of country, would let that happen? 
Those are the issues we must examine.  
He does not have to go there. 
We have all the people coming here to get the message across. 
That is not enough. 
Surely the message is coming across from every source.  
Today, the Leader of the Government in the Senate kept passing this message on. 
They keep saying, "We will do this and we will do that." 
In the interval, we are in a real problem.  
We talk about the cooperation of the provinces. 
That is a program into which both farmers and the government put money. 
For those people who are going broke the money does not exist. 
It is not there.  
However, they are not the farmers we are worried about. 
We are worried about the 30,000 we will lose. 
I have used that figure now for one year. 
That is why they are not agreeing with it. 
We are told that some changes will be made to it. 
It easy to change that program now. 
We can say, "Throw it out and start again." 
That would be all right, too, except if it takes another year. 
I do not want that at all. 
Let us make the changes and get the money into the hands of people. 
There is $1 billion. 
Get it into the hands of people. 
We will then worry about additional funds as they are required. 
Let us help the farmers who are now in trouble.  
It is an important debate. 
I congratulate the speakers who have entered into the debate. 
Senator Sparrow's intervention was excellent. 
The people are different. 
The closeness to markets are different, and so on. 
One could play with numbers forever in the discussion today. 
I do not intend to do that. 
We have all seen them. 
Everyone in this chamber may say, "Of course there is!" 
It is easy to romanticize about the family farm. 
It is easy to speak in terms of the community feeling. 
They spoke about the feeling it engenders in people. 
She is exactly right in her comparisons. 
I, for one, say, "Yes, there is a very important place for the family farm." 
The family farm is the fibre of this nation. 
Any business person will tell you that that one thing is stability. 
You will always seem to have your hand out because you will never have stability.  
Some of the speakers today spoke in terms of getting into the jurisdictional issue again. 
The Leader of the Government in the Senate said, "The provinces are involved." 
We have heard that so often. 
We are told, "It is their fault." 
That is a cop-out. 
It is everyone's responsibility.  
All the things we heard about today are real and vital. 
They speak to what is happening in our country today. 
People are nibbling at the issue, not dealing with it. 
They do not want to get into a war of numbers. 
That will not solve anything. 
Honourable senators, this is not new. 
This is not something that just happened yesterday. 
While all of this is happening, there are fewer and fewer farmers. 
The problems have been exacerbated, and now we are really in a crisis. 
It may be too late for that.  
Sadly, I do not see that happening. 
I see a passing of the buck and a battle of the numbers. 
If it is important enough to do, then we should do it.  
Why are we not talking about agriculture? 
Honourable senators, it is time for stability. 
The farmers deserve that. 
It is time that the rhetoric stopped. 
It is time that the leadership started. 
It is time to provide a measure of stability to rural Canada.  
This is not a debate about blame. 
I have listened to all of the speakers. 
In particular, I listened with understanding to Senator Gustafson. 
It is not the first time I have listened to Senator Gustafson by any means. 
Our report, "The Way Ahead:
We have listened to the voices. 
These past few months, I have visited all the Western provinces. 
They are in very hard times in terms of income. 
There will be no crop, and they cannot find jobs. 
This was only a part of the delegation. 
Much has been said today about the question of whether anyone cares. 
It is for that reason that we can never give up on our farm community. 
We want to secure it. 
We want to expand the opportunities for our farmers, not for multinational companies. 
I come from a wonderful little city called Lethbridge. 
There were no big buildings and factories. 
That is what gave our country its foundation. 
We forget it at the peril of the unity of our nation. 
People want to have the human connection. 
It will respond and he will respond.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I presume it is your pleasure that I not see the clock.  
Honourable senators, I will not be long. 
I think it was an admirable decision. 
I also wish to thank senators on the both sides of the house. 
Hogs were selling at Torquay, Saskatchewan, for $10 apiece. 
That program did not work at all; therefore, it must be changed.  
I will be very frank. 
Alberta has the money to meet that commitment. 
They could even pay more. 
Alberta farmers will get more, but what happens in Saskatchewan? 
Additionally, there was talk about the provincial government being negligent. 
They balanced their books on the backs of the farmers. 
They took our GRIP payment. 
Anyone who says that would not have some impact is wrong.  
Agriculture is an important industry to Canada. 
My grandfather came to Saskatchewan in 1905. 
They simply do not have the money to pay them.  
When we talk to farmers and the farm groups, what do they say? 
They ask what they should do next. 
The question is how many farmers will be able to seed a crop? 
That is a very disheartening thing.  
That barely paid for the fuel to take the crop off.  
That scenario can be repeated again and again. 
There are farmers who have crops that are frozen. 
They are getting 88 cents for frozen wheat. 
How will they survive?  
I am not even sure they should. 
Those boats were just sent off, and the wheat was automatically purchased by the Russians. 
However, Russia is broke today. 
The Russian government has no money to buy wheat. 
I could name other countries. 
The problem is global. 
This is a major problem. 
No one has been able to figure that out.  
A number of senators presented cost figures. 
Take rye, for example. 
Barley and wheat are other examples. 
Is this important to Canada? 
I say it is important.  
I commend the senators here today. 
Each of us has a job to do. 
We must and we will build a better Canada.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
Have we not suspended the sitting? 
This is a special debate, which does not entail any motion.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
We have asked for leave.  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I believe that we should reflect upon some considerations. 
It is a recommendation.  
Are you denying leave?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The notice of motion is not accepted.  
Therefore, I leave the Chair to return at two o'clock tomorrow.  
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
