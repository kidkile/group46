Nisga'a Final Agreement Bill 
Wednesday, March 29, 2000 
The Standing Senate Committee on Aboriginal Peoples has the honour to present its 
to the Fourth Report of the Standing Senate Committee on Aboriginal Peoples 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Notice of Motion to Establish Special Senate Committee 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
That the Committee have the power to sit during the adjournment of the Senate; 
That the Committee have the power to adjourn from place to place within Canada; 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Two of four Sea King helicopters available participated in that rescue. 
Was that helicopter elsewhere? 
Were there not enough air crew members for all four Sea Kings?  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Surely he would at least agree with that.  
How would the government explain to the people of the world that kind of embarrassment?  
Honourable senators, the minister has missed the point of my question. 
We had four Sea Kings on that task force. 
Does the minister not agree with that common-sense approach?  
They are all very important operational questions. 
I will convey the honourable senator's inquiry to the Minister of National Defence. 
Hon. W. David Angus :
This morning, the front page of The Ottawa Citizen , that well-known journal, indicated: 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I thank the Honourable Senator Angus for raising this topic once again. 
Mr. Desautels gave the audit that was done great credibility. 
He said it was a credible and competent audit. 
The Auditor General said he was satisfied with the credible steps taken by the minister. 
Therefore, he was pleased with the HRDC response.  
Honourable senators, I thank the minister for that comprehensive answer. 
That is the type of audit that was done internally. 
This auditor general is no different. 
He wants to push harder into that area, too. 
That has been a moving goalpost for a number of years.  
The honourable senator asked if we would support an inquiry. 
Agriculture and Agri-Food 
Effect of High Fuel Costs on Farm Community 
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
Everything that is done in agriculture creates an energy cost. 
This is a very serious problem for farmers. 
Would the minister look into the matter and carry that message to cabinet?  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, of course I will carry such a message to cabinet. 
I also offer to honourable senators some news of which you may already be aware. 
By increasing the supply, the hope is that the price will be depressed.  
The farmers do not have the same ability to recover their costs. 
The costs are unbelievable. 
It was a pretty serious situation. 
At that time, the percentages were very high. 
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Appropriation Bill No. 4, 1999-2000 
I wanted to make that point.  
With the permission of honourable senators, I should like to make a correction to Hansard. 
Yesterday's record of my speech contains a slight error. 
That sentence should read, "Earlier today, the Senate adopted that report."  
Having said that, honourable senators, I think the question should now be put.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.  
Appropriation Bill No. 1, 2000-01 
Having said that, honourable senators, I think we can proceed with some dispatch. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.  
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Even less did I ever see myself as a participant in such a debate. 
If yes to both, which predominates? 
This alone makes the bill reprehensible and not worthy of support. 
These initial results have, no doubt, caused much joy in the Langevin Block.  
This is no surprise.  
The slogans are similar and lend themselves to over-interpretation. 
The House of Commons always thinks in majorities. 
In his remarks, he said: 
The Prime Minister ended by saying: 
It is easier to attack than to work together. 
It is easier to shout than to listen. 
It is easier to destroy than to build. 
The shouters, the attackers, the destroyers have had their say. 
Now Canadians want to get on with building Canada.  
Its use today would provoke intense resentment on the part of the provinces. 
Now it is being introduced to allow injustice.  
I fully agree, but Bill C-20 ignores this.  
Then and only then should the question be put.  
The bill also requires the following: 
How naive can one get? 
Has the government ever thought of the chaos that would ensue as a result? 
To ask the question is to answer it.  
The naivete of the bill is found throughout. 
Here is how the Prime Minister explained the bill. 
The amending formulae in the Constitution are tailored to specific cases. 
This then supplants the amending formula in the Canadian Constitution...  
What is the result? 
The March 12, 1998 issue of Le Devoir quotes the Prime Minister as saying: 
Jean Charest believes firmly in Canada and in Quebec. 
In fact, the first attempt at secession was made in Nova Scotia. 
The separation movement there came to a head in 1868. 
Was the petition clear? 
I wish now to quote from Donald Creighton's biography of Sir John A. Macdonald: 
Macdonald refused to discuss such a subject officially. 
He was willing to bargain about these, but about nothing more. 
This is lost to us with Bill C-20. 
Bill C-20 opens the door to secession. 
If for no other reason, it deserves to be rejected on this basis alone.  
Bill C-20 opens the possibility of secession at any time. 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, I wish to ask a question.  
I wonder if the senator addressed that particular question in his research. 
Where does it get the authority? 
Permissible, I assume so; whether it should continue, of course not.  
Honourable senators, I appreciate that answer from Senator Lynch-Staunton. 
I also understand the sensitivity and the delicacy of the matter. 
It has the power to do it because it took that power. 
I have a minor question, and not a question of policy. 
Does the honourable senator have the name of that case?  
If I recall correctly, 1916 was in reference to regulation 17 in Ontario.  
That was in 1912. 
It was a judgment of the judicial committee of the Privy Council.  
It was a decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, I see. 
Her Majesty's governments are one and indivisible.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I have a brief question. 
The views, for the most part, were clear to me. 
Subsequent to that, there was mention of a figure. 
Honourable senators, I would prefer that we not discuss secession here. 
As for the level of two-thirds, that is a question of opinion. 
The question must be specific. 
I thank the honourable senator for that answer. 
That should be the motto of every government and has been, until this one. 
Now we are faced with a bill that is vague, incomplete and contradictory.  
The government should not have brought it in.  
That is quite right; the government should not have introduced it. 
It is a simple as that.  
Honourable senators, this bill makes that option legal. 
The Supreme Court legitimized it. 
Now the government wants Parliament to make it legal. 
I think that is a recipe for disaster.  
Would you go that far?  
This would inevitably lead to a very explosive situation.  
Parliament has a responsibility to speak out categorically against secession. 
It should address the issue only when secession appears inevitable. 
Today, it should say a categorical no. 
We are going to play along with them. 
This is beyond me.  
Honourable Marcel Prud'homme :
I am always afraid of people who talk of impossibility, of indissolubility. 
He was condemned for this, but it was later realized that he was right. 
Indissolubility is of great concern to me. 
I do not even want to ask one. 
This is perhaps the only point on which I might agree with Senator Cools. 
I believe Canada is one and indivisible. 
We already have problems, but we will have more. 
I do not like such a question, but at least it is clear. 
We can have a relatively short debate, a conclusion and an agreement. 
The honourable senator alluded rather quickly to the notion of "two thirds". 
This is an exceptionally high percentage in the Western World. 
It is their democratic right. 
Is this not enough for you? 
Is this what he really said?  
Two-thirds would be the allowable minimum. 
I dare not say it is his. 
They count as if they had voted. 
I ask the honourable senator to reflect on that point.  
We will decide whether to move amendments after discussions.  
If the question is assessed as favourable, then the House will assess the answer. 
If it supports the answer, then it is out of the picture. 
Essentially, the committee will have to look at that question. 
He made that clear. 
To speak just on the Senate alone would have taken me quite a few minutes.  
Senator Kinsella, in particular, will address that particular feature of the bill. 
Hon. Herbert O. Sparrow :
I would prefer that the bill not be before us. 
Honourable senators, I have a question for Senator Lynch-Staunton. 
Let us come in at the end, not start at the beginning.  
On motion of Senator Hays, debate adjourned.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
As honourable senators know, this is a short day. 
It is not government business. 
Accordingly, I ask for leave to bring this item forward now. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
If that is his position, I have no objection.  
My suggestion is an attempt to do just that. 
However, I understand Senator Kinsella. 
If leave is not forthcoming, then we will proceed with the Orders of the Day.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
State of Health Care System 
Indeed, I still do not understand this perception. 
I tabled a letter with the Law Clerk of the Senate. 
That is a public document. 
The letter explicitly tells the Law Clerk that he can make it public. 
We have always attempted to reach a consensus solution. 
I believe that that responds to Senator Lynch-Staunton's question. 
Hon. Wilbert J. Keon :
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
It is too bad that we do not have guidelines on this. 
We have nothing to hide here. 
I thank Senator Lynch-Staunton for those comments. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
