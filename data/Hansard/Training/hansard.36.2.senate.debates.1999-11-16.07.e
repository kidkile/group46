The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1968 
Thirtieth Anniversary of Proclamation 
Who should be saved, the baby or the mother? 
The government was equally adamant that contraception was illegal, as was abortion. 
Faced with the government and the Church, women had no choice.  
This legislation has done many things for many people. 
For women, doors were opened in a radical way. 
It stands out among the most important endeavours of my life.  
Reverend Father Emile Shoufani 
Hon. Pierre De Bane :
The meeting took place on the occasion of Mr. Trudeau's 80th birthday.  
His positive approach to solving problems is striking. 
He is always ready to take the first step to meet others. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Senator De Bane, your three minutes have expired. 
Are you seeking leave to continue?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Honourable senators, Emile Shoufani was born in Nazareth in 1947. 
He serves as a model for others to do the same. 
He decided to become a priest.  
He worked on achieving two goals. 
According to Father Shoufani: 
The revolutionary dynamism that motivated Emile Shoufani 24 years ago has not abated. 
Father Shoufani has declared often: 
These differences create no problems for me. 
Existence for her has always been connected with being on a mission. 
We can see how many tragic conflicts that principle has caused. 
The second option is a lot more difficult. 
Panel on Access to Historical Census Records 
Thirtieth Anniversary of Proclamation 
Hon. Jean-Robert Gauthier :
The provinces are encouraged to be generous toward the language minority. 
Some do so willingly, others must be encouraged.  
Pages Exchange Program with House of Commons 
The Hon. the Speaker :
She comes from Gatineau, Quebec. 
Marie-Claire Raymond is from Penetanguishene, Ontario. 
The Estimates, 1999-2000 
Supplementary Estimates (A) Tabled 
Francophone and Acadian Communities Outside Quebec 
Report Tabled on Deterioration of Services 
Hon. Jean-Maurice Simard :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Do I have it?  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
The Estimates, 1999-2000 
Notice of Motion to Authorize National Finance Committee to Study Supplementary Estimates (A) 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I give notice that tomorrow, Wednesday, November 17, 1999, I will move: 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
That a message be sent to the House of Commons to acquaint that house accordingly.  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I give notice that tomorrow, Wednesday, November 17, 1999, I will move: 
That a message be sent to the House of Commons to acquaint that house accordingly.  
Hon. John B. Stewart :
Honourable senators, I give notice that tomorrow, Wednesday, November 17, 1999, I will move: 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I thank the honourable senator for that question. 
That matter is presently being reviewed by the CSIS administration.  
I thank the honourable minister for that undertaking. 
Parliament established the Security Intelligence Review Committee. 
Hon. Jean-Claude Rivest :
Is there a procedure that seemingly was not followed in this instance?  
Honourable senators, there obviously was a breach of security involved in this incident. 
Honourable senators, obviously there are problems internally. 
Honourable senators, fortunately this particular event seems to be an isolated incident. 
Why a period of two whole weeks? 
I am unaware as to when precisely SIRC would come into the picture.  
Is there a government procedure ensuring the confidentiality of documents? 
If such a procedure exists, are there varying degrees of quality? 
The ITAR situation falls under a different category of issues.  
Possibility of Further Assistance to Protect People Against Violence 
Hon. Herbert O. Sparrow :
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
It seems nothing is allowable for self-protection against these crimes. 
Under the Criminal Code, pepper spray cannot be used by anyone for self-protection. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
However, I understand the concern expressed by the honourable senator.  
Agriculture and Agri-Food 
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Perhaps the honourable senator will know whether there has been any change in that stance.  
I find that response difficult to understand. 
There is no sharing with the provincial governments. 
Those monies are advanced by the federal government. 
The farmers who need the money are not receiving it. 
The poor families that need the money are not getting it. 
That is what I have been told by farmers right across Saskatchewan. 
Honourable senators, I am not trying to dodge the question of the honourable senator. 
I simply cannot answer it today. 
Obviously, that issue lies with the minister. 
If they did not like the program, they could have suggested that it be revamped. 
The Minister of Agriculture is trying to ensure that the program will work more effectively. 
Hon. Herbert O. Sparrow :
The leader has stated that the governments agreed to that. 
However, that is not the truth. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
There was general agreement on that and that message has been communicated clearly. 
I would not suggest for a moment that that is not the case.  
Efficacy of Aid Programs-Survival of Young Farmers 
Honourable senators, my question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
What the farmers are facing is death by a thousand cuts. 
Those being hurt are the young people who want to maintain the family business. 
It is death by a thousand cuts, year after year. 
They slowly sink into bankruptcy.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
How soon will it improve? 
As time goes by, the situation is becoming worse and worse.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I hope that the results will make themselves known rather quickly.  
It would be difficult for me to say when he will make that judgment. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, the time for Question Period has expired. 
However, I saw Senator Gustafson indicating that he would like to ask a question.  
Is that a supplementary question to a previous question?  
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Farm Crisis in Manitoba and Saskatchewan- Request for Visit by Prime Minister 
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I will certainly bring that representation to the Prime Minister.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Those are what I refer to as the good old days.  
I have seen legal opinion on this matter. 
However, I do not know whether I could be very confident of that.  
Replacement of Sea King Helicopter Fleet- Possibility of Leasing-Request for Answer 
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
I am bending the rules, Your Honour, to get my question in.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, to deal with the matter quickly, an answer will be forthcoming.  
Delayed Answers to Oral Questions 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I have delayed answers to four questions. 
West Nova Scotia Regiment- Appointment of Honorary Colonel 
The West Nova Scotia Regiment is among the distinguished Reserve units of Canada. 
This recommendation is currently being reviewed.  
(Response to question raised by Hon. James F. Kelleher on November 3, 1999) 
2. No, APCO has no contract with the Government of Canada.  
(Response to question raised by Hon. Douglas Roche on November 3, 1999) 
Efforts to Increase Employment of Visible Minorities 
(Response to question raised Hon. Donald H. Oliver on November 3, 1999) 
Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
The Hon. the Speaker :
However, you did use up 37 minutes. 
Therefore, you have eight minutes left.  
I shall do my best.  
However, on the general principle, I am unmoved. 
I believe, as a matter of principle, that we should not lightly change that law. 
That is my opinion, honourable senators. 
As in any similar conflict of principles, one must try to strike a balance. 
I have not changed my mind about the bill. 
This includes the health care sector. 
What is commercial activity? 
It is stated in the bill that: 
That is not a very helpful definition. 
Hon. Fernand Robichaud (The Hon. the Acting Speaker) :
Honourable senators, the Honourable Senator Murray's time has expired. 
Is leave granted for the honourable senator to continue?  
I wish to thank honourable senators for their kindness. 
However, I will not take too much more time.  
Whether they are or not, we still have a problem. 
They go on to state: 
That is one view. 
In their view, provincial legislation should prevail. 
They believe that this bill is weak. 
Honourable senators, the committee faces a difficult and complex task. 
Health care is altogether too important. 
None of us want to see that.  
If we try, do we really have the constitutional authority to do such a thing?  
Finally, we must hear from Health Canada on this matter. 
Honourable senators, we have a lot of work to do. 
Let us get on with it but let us not rush it. 
We are not looking down the barrel of prorogation this time. 
We can take the time that is necessary to do it right.  
Honourable senators, I thank you for your indulgence.  
The question is whether this bill fills that two-scale need. 
One scale is the scale of economy and the other the scale of social justice. 
Where do we draw the line?"  
From our research, I know today that there are many complex parts to this issue. 
Much work remains to be done to strengthen our fundamental human rights.  
We must do the same with respect to our commercial activity as well, honourable senators. 
It is quite strong and so far has been effective. 
Commissioner Phillips has handled that mantel very effectively, in my opinion. 
We are to treat each other with a reasonable degree of respect. 
However, we are surprised because our names get sold. 
Each of us is a business, a commodity. 
I would agree that some amendments are needed for greater clarification. 
I should like everyone to please remember that particular phrase.  
This model sets out the obligations of businesses that collect, use and disclose personal information. 
A question was raised by one of the senators about the health service agency. 
Every doctor, dentist and pharmacist should follow those codes of practice. 
One in particular was about changing the definition of personal information. 
Under that interpretation definition it talks about commercial activity. 
What is a commercial activity? 
Honourable senators, may I just finish, with your permission?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
As my grandchildren would say, "It's mine." 
That is something I should hope we will be able to accomplish. 
We heard many complaints about the use of data for research. 
There is no reason we cannot have non-nominative data. 
With such data, research can be done without revealing identities. 
The issue raised in this clause is where all this begins and ends.  
I believe that we will meet the OECD qualifications. 
Most important, I believe that we will protect the personal information of everyone. 
On motion of Senator Oliver, debate adjourned.  
I am sure we all appreciate this initiative of Mr. MacAulay. 
Let me now turn to the elements of Bill S-10. 
These amendments represent important improvements over the current law. 
Indeed, this goes to some of the issues raised in the debate about personal information.  
Another Criminal Code provision is being repealed. 
On motion of Senator Kinsella, for Senator Nolin, debate adjourned.  
Income Tax Conventions Implementation Bill, 1999 
Second Reading-Debate adjourned 
This impact is a large one. 
These problems have already been taken into consideration in the convention in force with Japan.  
Without a tax convention, both countries could claim tax on that income. 
Tax conventions signed by Canada deal with this issue in two ways. 
This is the second objective of these conventions. 
In all other cases, a rate of 15 per cent will apply. 
Discrimination based on a taxpayer's nationality is forbidden. 
Before concluding, I would like to examine the issue of taxpayer migration. 
The objective of these taxation conventions is precisely to avoid double taxation.  
They deserve our thanks. 
On motion of Senator Lynch-Staunton, debate ajourned.  
Speech from the Throne 
Motion for Address in Reply-Debate Continued 
3rd day of resuming debate ) 
Hon. William M. Kelly :
I therefore intend to make the most of it.  
We face the threat of terrorism from renegade states and disaffected groups. 
We need look no further than the former Soviet Union for illustrations of that sort. 
The breakdown of the civil power has given rise to a host of nefarious activities.  
The globalization of economies means that all economies have become increasingly interdependent. 
There will only be one economy and one market. 
There will be no boundaries. 
Capital can flow in or out of a country in an instant. 
Our levels of personal taxation are excessively burdensome. 
We are still heavily dependent on natural resources. 
We must do more to enhance our productivity. 
The commitment in the Speech from the Throne is encouraging. 
However, we have a long way to go.  
We appear to be experiencing particular difficulties in attracting skilled workers and professionals. 
The judge characterized their activities as wicked, cruel and ruthless. 
Therefore, we are doing no one a favour by winking at illegal migration. 
We must also recognize that illegal migration is not just a domestic issue. 
In my opinion, the problem is not with our laws, the problem lies with enforcement. 
Those enforcement problems have been identified time and time again.  
The detention of illegal migrants is obviously a sensitive issue. 
However, those processes need to be speeded up. 
The rulings must be timely. 
While commendable, once again, we must come to grips with how far we must go. 
Again, I look forward with great interest to seeing the details in the next budget.  
At the same time, this has been a century of unprecedented advances. 
The world today would be unrecognizable by someone living in 1899.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham :
The Canadian ethic is a perception renowned and widely shared throughout the international community. 
We began budgeted tax relief even before the budget was balanced. 
However, we know that tax reduction is only part of the equation. 
Canadians do not want big gaps between rich and poor.  
They have reaffirmed that medicare is an anchor of the Canadian identity. 
Honourable senators, a new century is almost upon us. 
They compete in one global economy, in one market. 
They belong to all Canadians.  
We have developed the infrastructure for and nurtured a healthy research environment.  
As the Prime Minister has said: 
It is our children who will take us there. 
However, the challenges facing them are great. 
Their responsibilities are overwhelming. 
Honourable senators, it is they, our children, who must win the future.  
This government has made a commitment to our tiny babies and our little children. 
Our commitment is to the best possible start in life. 
Yes, our children have rights. 
They have a right to hope. 
They have a right to dream. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
These 407 Canadians have been given a great privilege and an awesome responsibility. 
Only 407 individual Canadians serve 30 million Canadians in our Parliament.  
Is the practice of freedom stronger or weaker? 
Will we be leaving Canada a better place after our sojourn here in Parliament?  
Well, honourable senators, some listeners may have been amused. 
Some may have found that to be a quaint or cute proposition. 
I, personally, was not amused. 
The government seems to be avoiding serious political criticism with this strategy. 
The law is the law. 
Parliament must be very cautious when that kind of proposition is brought forward.  
Reference the delay in reopening Parliament this fall. 
The answer is obvious, honourable senators. 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted to continue?  
The hierarchical nature of this government continues through all ranks as well. 
Government also became less willing to divulge information to the House. 
Indeed, the opposite is the case. 
Cabinet has now joined Parliament as an institution being bypassed. 
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
The Speech from the Throne included the grand pronouncement that Ottawa will: 
Specifically, the government said it will work with its partners to: 
w make it easier for Canadians to finance lifelong learning; and 
Honourable senators, these all have the potential to be very worthwhile measures. 
That would be like putting the cart before the horse.  
I remind the government that action in this critical area is needed now. 
He has a wonderful way with words. 
It was not a pleasant overview.  
Indeed, I hope to do so in the near future.  
First, some background is in order.  
In December 1998, the committee tabled its report entitled "For the Sake of the Children". 
Still, we can always keep our fingers crossed. 
Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
My remarks, therefore, will be similar to the ones made at that time.  
The actual arrangements are the responsibility of the Clerk Assistant of the Senate. 
In fact, no other Commonwealth Parliament has maintained the procedure still used in Canada."  
Bill S-7, however, takes these apprehensions into account. 
On motion of Senator Cools, debate adjourned.  
Francophone and Acadian Communities Outside Quebec 
Deterioration of Services- Inquiry-Debate adjourned 
Hon. Jean-Maurice Simard rose pursuant to notice of November 3, 1999: 
It could exceed the allotted time of ten minutes.  
Hon. Jean-Claude Rivest :
Incidentally, I urge all honourable senators to read the report. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
Is this fear not the ultimate paradox? 
However, honourable senators, that is not all. 
We feel that, if we keep quiet, everyone must keep quiet. 
First we pretend to be unaware that they exist. 
We take minority francophones hostages to power.  
They fall into line. 
The most troublesome are isolated, using the principle of "Divide and conquer".  
And I shall applaud; I shall congratulate you:
Of course these initiatives are worth the time and worthy of praise. 
Not even in education is the battle over.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
You will tell me that Heritage Canada gave her funding for that trip. 
You want people to be properly appreciative of that gesture. 
They are a people who refuse to die.  
We can act, however. 
This support is the best-kept secret in the country. 
What do these figures tell us? 
We must complete this forgotten vision.  
Increasingly, Canadians recognize that bilingualism is cost-effective. 
What are we waiting for to realize that the public has left us behind? 
Honourable senators, I do not ask you to turn back the pages of time. 
We are equal to it. 
Our recovery plan is an exciting, positive, and generous social vision.  
I am confident, however, that you will hear me. 
On motion of Senator Kinsella, debate adjourned.  
The Senate adjourned until Wednesday, November 17, 1999, at 1:30 p.m.
