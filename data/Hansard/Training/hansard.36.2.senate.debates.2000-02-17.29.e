The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker pro tempore in the Chair.  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is leave granted, honorable senators?  
Absence of Government Leader 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the Leader of the Government in the Senate is absent today. 
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I wish to thank the Honourable Senator Murray for that question. 
I believe that we will be receiving at least two bills this week.  
We are anticipating some very important legislation. 
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
After further reflection, I changed my mind.  
And yet, we are only on the third day.  
I certainly cannot be accused of deliberately delaying the work of the Senate. 
We must remember particularly that Royal Assent is part of the process. 
As far as I am concerned, all the rest is window dressing. 
It is also the moment when a number of laws come into force. 
This is not part of the process. 
This private bill should have been introduced by the government. 
Because this is a measure which affects the rights and prerogatives of the Crown. 
I believe the proposal falls down on this point. 
What is the aim of this bill exactly? 
Parliamentarians are primarily responsible for the current situation. 
Jeanne Sauve never missed one Royal Assent. 
I know because I served with her. 
Lucien Lamoureux never missed a Royal Assent. 
The parliamentary cohesion that used to exist has disappeared completely. 
His role is not taken seriously. 
Look at what goes on every day in the Senate. 
How many senators are present for Royal Assent? 
Not many years later, church attendance fell off. 
I am opposed to this bill. 
That is all I will say. 
I will not be supporting this bill.  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
I promise to speak to this matter next week.  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Perhaps we could then go to Senator Prud'homme for his intervention.  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
He articulated clearly his position, and I think it is widely supported.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Senator Corbin, are you asking for leave to continue?  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
If that is true, one must wonder why they are being so discouraged.  
Senator Corbin obviously has done some research on the subject matter. 
What has he heard on this subject?  
Honourable senators, what Senator Cools has said is news to me. 
I am not aware of anything along those lines.  
On motion of Senator Prud'homme, debate adjourned.  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
These false allegations are often made with the overt or covert complicity of their lawyers. 
They are a lethal weapon in the business of parental alienation. 
The bland acceptance of such inflammatory material by lawyers is unacceptable. 
He told the committee at page 26:53: 
Justice Blair said, at page 272: 
The report said, at page 20: 
The report added, at page 20: 
The role of lawyers is raised yet again. 
It is the Devil's own work. 
For a parent to be accused falsely of something so terrible is soul-destroying. 
These burdens are emotional, legal, and financial. 
I have applied the highest test. 
I bring to the Senate cases where findings have been made by judges. 
I shall enumerate those 10 judgements that I have already quoted. 
All 10 judgements were adjudicated by judges - some excellent judges. 
His wife falsely accused him of sexually abusing their two daughters. 
The Children's Aid Society believed and supported her. 
Reverend Baxter was exonerated and awarded custody of the girls. 
Her motivation was revenge, pure and simple.  
...she cried child abuse and continues to make the allegation to this date. 
I think it a shame, a tragedy and a crisis.  
The girls are 10 and 12 years old. 
Madam Justice Nash continued, at paragraph 22: 
There was no medical evidence supporting these allegations.  
These judgments often mention the role of the child welfare protection agencies.  
Justice Coultas said at page 4: 
In my March 4th Reasons I recited the history of these earlier allegations. 
Justice Coultas added, at page 5: 
Justice Coultas continued, at page 12: 
On March 19, 1993, Justice Newbury said, at paragraph 95: 
As of last fall, Mr. Christopherson did not know the whereabouts of his children. 
Justice Shabbits stated, at page 11: 
...the very allegation seems improbable in the extreme.  
Justice Shabbits continued in this 1995 judgment, at page 19: 
I have laid before honourable senators almost 50 judicial findings that the allegations were false. 
There is a crisis in civil justice and in the practice at bar. 
Lawyers are both practitioners at the bar and also officers of the court. 
These are ancient and important privileges. 
Section 72(8), described as "Exception: solicitor client privilege," states: 
Honourable senators, Bill S-9 imposes no new standard on lawyers. 
Bill S-9 affirms the standard of the barristers' current code of ethical conduct. 
Bill S-9 elevates that same standard, a largely informal one, to law. 
Bill S-9 codifies these standards as statute and gives them the force of law.  
The Church of Scientology case lasted eleven years and cost countless millions of dollars. 
It hid its knowledge of the falsity of that allegation from the court... 
Honourable senators, I should like to thank you for your indulgence. 
Perhaps there was a fair amount of tedium in my speech. 
One woman, whose case I mentioned, was the subject of false allegations. 
She is one of the women who was accused by her father. 
It was a nasty case of parental alienation. 
That woman has been able to regain access to two of her four children. 
Two of them remain quite hostile and are alienated from her. 
I have held consultations on this question. 
I sincerely believe that the children of this country deserve nothing less. 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Honourable senators, Senator Cools has raised an interesting subject. 
Every day lawyers write all kinds of allegations in their statements of claim. 
There are a couple of questions that I should like to answer first.  
Senator Nolin is a lawyer and knows of the difficulties of which I speak. 
In these instances, accusations are made within statements of defence, here, there, and everywhere. 
I will provide an example. 
This is what is happening. 
Essentially, I am attempting to expose only those individuals. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable Senator Cools, I regret to inform you that your speaking time has expired. 
Are you seeking leave to continue?  
Yes, I am seeking leave to continue.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
I thank honourable senators for their indulgence.  
What we are dealing with here is what may be described as a "criminal intention."  
I encourage honourable senators to review this legislation very closely. 
In the case of, for example, Father Baxter, it took 11 years in the courts. 
However, there is still much to be done.  
Parliament must not ignore this terrible travesty. 
I could cite many cases. 
What I ask of Senator Nolin is judicious consideration and study. 
My question is about the intent. 
That is what the honourable senator's amendment states. 
That is why I am trying to understand the precise intent of her amendment.  
The problem is pernicious. 
One has to look at those hundreds of cases. 
Many grandparents are in that position. 
They simply cannot finance the abiding nature of the litigation.  
I am attempting to address the mischief, as the old masters used to say. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
On motion of Senator Kinsella, debate adjourned.  
Statistics Act National Archives of Canada Act 
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
Section 7.2 would recognize the promise of confidentiality. 
I know some of you here in this chamber share those concerns. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
On motion of Senator LeBreton, debate adjourned.  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Honourable senators, what is the heart of this legislation? 
Empower the minister to turn back the boats.  
This issue is not new to the Senate.  
That salutary compromise was reached in this chamber.  
Let us start with the Constitution. 
We must go further. 
What can we do? 
Human trafficking lies at the source. 
In this way, we can allay part of the problem.  
More energy can be enlisted on this international front. 
These efforts will also reduce part of the problem.  
This, too, can alleviate part of the problem.  
This, too, can ameliorate part of the problem.  
Let the Senate reaffirm the idea of Canada and say no to this legislation. 
She would like to participate in this debate and unfortunately is not here.  
On motion of Senator Grafstein, for Senator Wilson, debate adjourned.  
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, February 22, 2000, at 2 p.m.
