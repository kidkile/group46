The House met at 10 a.m. 
REPORT OF COMMISSIONER OF OFFICIAL LANGUAGES 
CONSUMER PACKAGING AND LABELLING ACT 
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, today is the last day of Kidney month.  
The petitioners point out that dialysis services across the country are inadequate. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1998 
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
The government predicts that this will be the case over the next three fiscal years. 
However, its actions in this have not changed dramatically.  
The official opposition has introduced an amendment to this bill which states: 
He works for parliament, not the government.  
Low income families will qualify for the Canada child tax benefit. 
We have to stop living beyond our means.  
That simply is not true. 
What we oppose is the manner in which this government has established this fund. 
Again this is simply not the case. 
We are all more dependent on our families than we were before. 
It brings out real hostility and resentment. 
The government had a wonderful opportunity this year. 
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Children are our future, so there is no better place for Canadians to invest''.  
Bill C-36 speaks to that investment in our children. 
Others suffer from physical problems such as disease, disability or injury. 
We know the discussion that goes on around our country.  
It increases by $330 for each additional child.  
We hope that in the province of Ontario this will definitely happen.  
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
That increase is equivalent to $5,000 per Canadian family. 
Even the OECD called on the government to eliminate this sneaky tax. 
What it does not contain is real tax relief. 
That is what our national debt load represents. 
Meanwhile the monstrous debt load looms over our heads.  
It is not possible to sweep $600 billion under the carpet. 
According to the budget that is what the Liberals want to do. 
The amendment put forward by my colleague from Medicine Hat addresses this issue. 
Even the finance minister's department states that payroll taxes kill jobs. 
He certainly has changed his tune in the last few years.  
It will kill tens of thousands of jobs. 
Government does not create jobs. 
High taxes most certainly do not create jobs. 
Big government and high taxes kill jobs. 
They are an impediment to economic growth and lower unemployment. 
This amounts to $2,000 per family of four. 
I urge all other members of the House to oppose the bill.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Her grand statements are beginning to sound like science fiction.  
Funding should be doubled or tripled rather than reduced. 
Assimilation is on the rise in all of the francophone communities. 
What great progress for francophones. 
So who will pay the price this time?  
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
All Canadians have been interested in the Hibernia oilfields for many years. 
My wife's family has deep roots in the province of Newfoundland. 
This is also something which all Canadians want to share and rejoice in. 
They had to leave Newfoundland because there was no employment. 
Unemployment levels in Newfoundland are still unacceptable. 
A substantial investment in capital has already occurred in the Hibernia oilfields. 
Most of this money has been spent in Canada. 
Of course that money goes back into the economy of Newfoundland.  
The federal government taxes these people when they make profits. 
This is very positive for increasing the economy of Newfoundland.  
I should mention the recent discovery at Voisey's Bay. 
This is a long term project. 
That is what is so great about this country. 
This means we would exclude the resource sector from the calculations. 
Those people were able to buy into the argument. 
I understand the arguments I have often heard members speak about. 
However the reality is that we must as a country all live with common standards. 
It is a very significant time. 
Clearly somebody is thinking of doing just that. 
As we talk, international oil prices are fluctuating. 
We should know that our investment in Hibernia is really twofold. 
Some of the bigger players are Mobil Oil, Chevron and Petro-Canada. 
We are all going to play by the same rules. 
I am sure most people of Newfoundland believe that.  
In closing, I wish the people in Newfoundland well. 
It marks a new day for the people of Newfoundland.  
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
Yet that is what they are being reduced to doing now. 
Specialist teachers have been hit especially hard. 
There are 117 professors at Dalhousie who have been laid off. 
I think this budget is going nowhere to allay their fears on that score.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
That would be a most unfortunate thing.  
It is about $1 billion coming out of Edmonton alone.  
When I think about it I would be amused if I were not so sad. 
It said you lucky folks, guess what is happening to you in Edmonton. 
That is wonderful and there is increased economic activity in Edmonton. 
It is the taxpayers who are sending out their cheques to Revenue Canada. 
People all across the country want the budget balanced and this budget has done that.  
Frankly, I do not even know how many zeros that is. 
Who is going to pay that debt? 
The government has slashed payments to the provinces by $7.4 billion. 
That is an incredible amount of money. 
That is 16.5% of the reduction of the deficit.  
I think everybody universally feels the same way about that.  
How much help is it going to be? 
It will touch 6% of the students in the country. 
He wants this to be his personal legacy. 
I think that would be a very refreshing thing.  
That is not good arithmetic. 
I am looking at the budgetary numbers in the budget in brief. 
Budgetary revenue is the amount of cash the government is bringing in. 
In fiscal year 1998-99 it will be $151 billion. 
All those zeros would hardly fit on a ledger sheet. 
They would have to be written very small.  
Do we know where that exact amount of money is going? 
It is going to interest payments on the debt. 
There are many tremendous programs, worthwhile programs. 
We see some of them in the bill. 
Should we be thinking about education? 
This is what we talk about, that future generations need to have an education. 
No. Instead it builds a shrine to the Canada millennium scholarship foundation. 
What good does that do other than provide a trophy, a plaque or a statue? 
It does not do a lot of good.  
Let us look at the amount of money going to various projects. 
I do not think so. 
Tuition should be lowered and transfer payments should be put back to the provinces. 
That is what it is all about.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, today is March 31, the end of fiscal year 1997-98. 
Indeed we have reason to be proud as Canadians. 
This strategy takes action on seven fronts. 
Let me touch on another item in the budget concerning allocating the fiscal dividend. 
The 1998 budget, the first in our new mandate, reflects that commitment. 
The formula will be used as a guiding principle for planning purposes. 
Let me go to another topic on tax relief if I may. 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
The auditor general has been most critical of the minister's creative bookkeeping.  
The issue of cooked books is just a symptom of the disease. 
In 1996 there were 1.7 million students. 
It only helps those who are continuing their education.  
It will be limited to a few. 
It will do nothing for those who do not go to our universities.  
They have been forgotten by the budget. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
There does not appear to be a quorum in the House.  
I do not see a quorum. 
And the bells having rung: 
I see a quorum.  
The hon. member for Surrey North has the floor.  
This government is not being overly compassionate or considerate toward youth. 
I will now move on to a couple of areas of concern to my constituents. 
This government promised to spend $30 million on crime prevention. 
It has been having difficulty even maintaining the status quo. 
Many other officers from my community may be forced to move onto greener pastures. 
But where is the federal government with the RCMP? 
With that thought I will end my comments on this bill.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Louis-Hebert.  
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
I just cannot get over it. 
A better name for this strategy would be Canadian government visibility strategy.  
We in the Bloc Quebecois support this view. 
Education is the soul of a people, its very backbone. 
It is the cornerstone of any society.  
We have made a choice as a society.  
But students are no fools. 
How can we compete with rival countries? 
How will we keep our brains? 
How will we interest our young people in post-secondary education? 
This budget provides no reassurance.  
Barely 16 lines in 275 pages are devoted to Canada's rural regions. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
The biggest single spending initiative in this budget is the millennium scholarship fund. 
It is ordinary taxpayers. 
Why does the government or the minister not appoint an auditor themselves? 
Instead it is going to be the board that appoints its own auditor. 
No further direction has been given to the board on this criteria. 
I have not had one constituent ask me to complicate the tax code. 
It complicates the tax code. 
This proposal serves to complicate a tax code that is already far too complicated.  
I met with departmental officials last week. 
This creates a direct incentive to invest in RESPs.  
It will create a crisis down the road.  
Again this is going to create a decrease in the incentive to invest in RRSPs.  
Today the minister's agenda has obviously changed. 
We have established that the minister cannot have it both ways. 
Effectively he is playing one group against another. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
This is the proposed amendment by the official opposition: 
We owe tax relief to the taxpayer. 
This is what should have happened with the $2.5 billion.  
What is the government doing? 
It should be held accountable for it. 
It was all deferred.  
It sure likes to defer things to the future. 
What is so great about it? 
Whose money is that sitting there? 
It is sitting in an account. 
The auditor general has complained about each of these cases. 
What is the government's response to the auditor general's complaints? 
It had the gall to threaten him. 
The auditor general is hired to do a job and what happens? 
The government threatens him for doing it. 
In other words, Liberal habits have become almost institutionalized. 
Taxpayers spend an awful lot of their hard earned money on the federal government. 
There is something unethical about it.  
I guess that is the ultimate agenda. 
He wants to become the leader. 
Is that the plan of the finance minister and the Liberal government? 
I do not think they are acceptable to most Canadians.  
I would like to give the finance minister a bit of strategic advice for free. 
Probably his chances for leadership would be better. 
Everyone would rally behind him in much more substantive way and with good reason. 
Is that not good advice? 
The members across the way do not agree with that. 
Best of all, his popularity would be earned legitimately. 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
Some observers wonder, moreover, what is going to happen after that. 
Is it pure coincidence or skilfully organized provocation? 
But one is stunned by this unbelievable federal intrusion in education.  
And Ms. Gagnon goes on: 
The millennium scholarships will be grafted, God knows how, onto an already existing grant system. 
In Quebec, we have a loans and grants system. 
It is up to the federal government to come to an agreement with these provinces.  
I think this would settle the matter. 
This would improve the grants and loans situation.  
That is what we are asking for.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
The millennium fund will provide a fund in the budget of $2.5 billion. 
It will only help an estimated 7% of students. 
There was a named chair representing a very large corporate interest in Canada. 
This does not bode well for the future of post-secondary education.  
In Ontario a lot of concern has been expressed about ongoing privatization. 
They are very disturbing facts about the millennium fund. 
It was not just Quebec that was left out of the picture. 
It is another indication of unilateral action being taken by the federal government. 
It was a most cynical ploy by the government. 
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
We just do not accept that at all.  
However, it is not as a result of its doings. 
It had an opportunity to do that in this budget, but it did not.  
Everybody would lose and nobody would win. 
We feel that Canadians have not been completely apprised of the debt they have. 
MAD describes their state of mind as well.  
We would like to see that go back to the people.  
We have the highest taxes in the G-7. 
Bracket creep erodes every person's income in this country. 
Nobody wants that, particularly the young people of this country.  
They wanted tax relief, they expected tax relief, but they did not get tax relief. 
They are upset that the debt will not decrease this year. 
What they wanted was real tax relief.  
This is another illustration from the cold war. 
We have a debt bomb in this country. 
They want to pass it on to Canadians.  
I believe that is an accurate description of our government today. 
They do not want to ride this to its obvious conclusion. 
We do not want debt in this country. 
We do not want higher spending. 
We do not want taxes. 
We oppose Bill C-36. 
I oppose it on behalf of my constituents.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
What did the Liberals do when the first surpluses appeared? 
They know that education is an area of exclusive provincial jurisdiction. 
For over 30 years, Quebec has had its own system of loans and scholarships. 
We hope that the Prime Minister will grant Quebec's request.  
We also know that the auditor general is critical of the government's spending practices. 
There is also employment insurance. 
The federal government has accumulated $6 billion in savings in its fund. 
We asked that the eligibility criteria be restored. 
Meanwhile, the unemployed are losing out. 
The government continues to amass the surpluses without paying out a cent more. 
In 2000, the surplus will reach $25 billion. 
The Conseil du patronat was very clear on this point. 
We also introduced anti-deficit legislation. 
It would control government spending. 
We deplore this government's refusal. 
We would have preferred the minister come to an understanding with the Bloc Quebecois. 
A number of people have expressed their disappointment with the Minister of Finance's budget. 
Is there consent that the hon. member withdraw the bill as indicated?  
There is no consent.  
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
I would like everybody to realize one thing. 
This scholarship supposedly is about education. 
I have great difficulty in believing that. 
I do not think this is about education at all. 
That to me goes a long way in saying exactly what this is all about. 
Number one, it was not this government that balanced the budget. 
It is just not so. 
We look at what has happened in the last few years. 
In most cases that is no longer possible. 
Both parents now have to work in order to survive. 
No, it is to survive in this country which we say is so great.  
We have become unpaid slaves to the government in many cases. 
Gradually through the years taxation crept up. 
The government said we have to do this in order to pay for this. 
The government said it was good, it would benefit Canadian society. 
We thought the government was very knowledgeable. 
We bought this and bought this and bought this.  
Now Canadian taxpayers are waking up to one simple fact. 
This government has become a tax addicted parasite on the taxpayers of this country.  
I am sad to say that in Canada this is just about no longer possible. 
The harder someone works, the more they are taxed. 
When someone asks for help from this government, they stand in a line. 
That is the caring, sharing feeling of this lousy government. 
Let us take a look at this for one moment. 
That snow job no longer works in this country. 
I think this budget came a bit early. 
It should really have been introduced on April 1. 
There is no doubt in my mind about that.  
Let us look at what is happening in the EI surplus. 
We have mentioned time and time again what is happening here. 
What does this government do? 
It says it will give back a few pittance to the employer and the employee. 
That is not going to wash too long in this country.  
The people are starting to wake up. 
We have received phone call after phone call into all our offices. 
That is hard to believe. 
In fact, I cannot believe that. 
I think somebody is fudging.  
They must have had their lines cut.  
I was not just checking the wind.  
It is not blowing that good. 
I also have great difficulty with the millennium fund.  
Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):
It seems to be a very Liberal wind after that byelection.  
I wanted to talk a bit about one component of the budget. 
It has to do with tax reduction. 
However, I think what is important is the way tax reduction is to be achieved. 
It is a very important principle. 
That is in addition to the $850 million that was provided in the previous year.  
We saw that very clearly. 
We clearly saw that in the budget.  
That is a particularly important thing.  
We saw the increased funding to the granting councils. 
It is interesting to look at those principles. 
They are important principles. 
They are Liberal principles. 
They are principles the finance minister crafted within the budgetary measures.  
Many were enunciated during the previous campaign.  
This is clear in both parties' platforms.  
The Reform Party had a similar approach. 
That is the type of principle they want to bring to tax reduction.  
It is targeting tax relief to achieve important social goals. 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
The deficit has been fought on the backs of the taxpayers. 
We did this, we did that''. 
Yes, the tax burden imposed on Canadian families is enormous. 
Canadian families work half the year just to pay their tax bill. 
What did Canadians get? 
I will briefly touch on the millennium scholarship foundation. 
The way this was handled in the budget was quite surprising. 
I find it quite unbelievable.  
There is a difference between an expenditure and a future commitment. 
The finance minister lost sight of this fact. 
That is a fact that cannot be lost on Canadians.  
It does not address the concerns of the majority of students in this country.  
Yesterday I had the opportunity to speak to over 60 high school students. 
They asked me how that was possible. 
I used the story of overspending.  
They were shocked that this could happen in our country. 
They asked me how it happened? 
I am sorry to say, but the Liberal government started us along this path.  
We must have this house in order.  
That debt was created over years. 
There has to be a plan to get that debt down. 
This government must take note of that and do something about it. 
It has to be a committed plan.  
They asked me why I wanted to get into politics. 
I was a teacher prior to this. 
That is why I entered politics. 
It is for that reason that I cannot support Bill C-36.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
At first glance, this budget may seem extremely positive. 
Does it not contain very good news for the taxpayers? 
The fact is all this is a smoke and mirrors, a cover up.  
Really, once a Liberal, always a Liberal.  
This is an underhand strategy:
Edifying, is it not? 
When will the Liberals understand that this strategy leads nowhere? 
Nothing could be further from the truth. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
I will speak to this bill as a Canadian.  
That is the way it should work. 
Otherwise the result is double taxation.  
Unfortunately this is what we may see happening to operators of light aircraft. 
That is the way it has always been. 
Double taxation of operators of light aircraft will only make matters worse.  
These countries are now forced to seek foreign pilots to fly commercial aircraft.  
I have noticed a good omen. 
I urge the finance minister to carefully consider NavCan's proposal. 
It was not done by cutting wasteful spending. 
Of this I can assure the House. 
Spending days are back. 
First, the fund is not about post-secondary education. 
It is the same old malarkey, the tax and spend approach. 
It was another political ploy like the one we are getting now. 
I could have gone on for another 20 minutes on the millennium fund.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
An hon. member across the way said ``provincial cuts''. 
And by the way, the Liberals are still in office provincially in New Brunswick. 
Perhaps not for much longer, but they are still there.  
How are they expected to pay off their debts then?  
Here is an example. 
Let me give you an example. 
Therefore, not many people will benefit from these scholarships.  
Again, only 7 students out of 100 will benefit.  
This is why I oppose the government's budget. 
Our young people are not getting government support. 
I met with students who came to my office. 
This is what is really happening in this country.  
They are not happy with the budget of the Liberal government. 
He should come and visit New Brunswick and see the reception he gets. 
It is smoke and mirrors.  
That is what we need.  
Yesterday, I was at the community college in Bathurst. 
How are we going to pay our tuition fees?'' 
They are very concerned.  
I do not support Bill C-36. 
What are we giving our young people? 
They go to university and then they go bankrupt. 
What a great start to life.  
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Why do I say this is a matter of confidence? 
By inflating its deficit, the government claimed it was justified in maintaining its budget restrictions. 
The foundation had no legal existence until April 1997. 
After these two experiences, there is still no remorse forthcoming from the government. 
Would the same be allowed of individuals? 
Would Revenue Canada let him do this?  
No, this would no be allowed.  
Yet, that is what the government is doing.  
That is what it is doing with the millennium scholarships. 
That is what the main goal was.  
This action by the government is despicable.  
It being almost 2 p.m., we will now proceed to Statements by Members.  
MEMBER FOR BEAUHARNOIS-SALABERRY 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
What he said recently to an American audience left no doubt at all: 
Coming from a member of the Bloc, such a statement deserves to be mentioned. 
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Now we find out that national defence is increasing rents to DND personnel. 
This will equal for a master corporal $30 per month. 
The real net increase will be $23 per month. 
That is not enough to buy a case of beer.  
Why is the military increasing rents? 
Why is the government treating our people in uniform in such a shabby way?  
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
By the way, way to go B.C. 
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Humber-St. 
I want to celebrate with the House this very special occasion.  
Our day has come, our year has come and our century has come.  
We will be exceeding the country. 
Our GDP, our standard of living, will be raised in my opinion because of Confederation.  
Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma-Manitoulin, Lib.):
The letter from the leader of the Reform Party states: 
The letter from the Reform leader further states: 
It was the minister who was holding hearings, not the advisory group. 
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
The family is the building block of society.  
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, here are some other inconsistencies.  
Reform members do not know what they are talking about. 
Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-East York, Lib.):
I urge the Reform Party to look to New Zealand first. 
They should start by speaking the truth.  
We are getting pretty close in our statements. 
We had better cut back a bit on the rhetoric.  
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, since 1870 Manitobans have governed themselves in areas of provincial jurisdiction. 
Since Confederation, Manitobans have elected MPs to the House of Commons. 
Even earlier they governed themselves at the municipal level democratically.  
Manitobans are ready and waiting.  
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
This is a great victory for the Liberals in B.C. 
It marks the decline of the Reform Party. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Unfortunately, the post offices that were closed have not been reopened.  
The municipality has taken down the Canadian flag from its municipal building. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. David Iftody (Provencher, Lib.):
We will not let them down.  
GRAND FALLS CURLING CLUB 
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
They also have a secret weapon. 
I congratulate Melissa, Nancy, Brigitte, Bethany and Julie. 
They truly are the best in the world. 
Way to go, Team Canada.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
The residents of Port Moody-Coquitlam have spoken loud and clear. 
They have sent us a member who cares and supports the same things they do. 
They have sent us Lou Sekora, the newest Liberal member of Parliament.  
The leader of the Reform stated last week: 
For once we agree. 
Port Moody-Coquitlam has sent a message to the Reform. 
I say congratulations to Mr. Sekora, our newest Liberal member of Parliament.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
He said ``This government will not walk away from its responsibilities''. 
But he broke that promise. 
The Liberals are now leaving thousands of Canadians to die without help.  
Is that his position?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I directed my question to the Prime Minister for a reason. 
We have heard the lawyer's answer. 
We have heard the accountant's answer. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
He dealt just with the blood system. 
We did that last Friday. 
Governments are taking responsibility and doing the right thing.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the health minister adds insult to injury. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
That is what has been decided collectively by the provincial governments and the federal government. 
I am amazed today. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
The lawyer says ``this is difficult''. 
It is difficult, but it is also deadly.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
There were all stripes of governments involved and they all agreed. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
This money will be invested in a foundation. 
The foundation and the legislation are necessary.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The foundation will hold discussions with each province.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
His first reply is of concern to us. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
This is the issue here.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the health minister. 
I hope today the back doors are locked.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Had they acted, many of those infections would have been prevented.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
He did not speak with them. 
He did not meet with them.  
Does that close the door forever on his talks with these people? 
Is he simply going to keep it slammed? 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
I think he should be ashamed of himself.  
It was not because I thought he would like it. 
This is a minister who accepts his responsibility, who has met with victims.  
The hon. member for Charlotte.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
This is the minister of remote control. 
The fact remains that there are 40,000 uncompensated innocent victims. 
Will the minister act and show true leadership on this issue?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
I have met with several of the people he has referred to. 
I have met with them on more than one occasion. 
That is an appropriate and responsible approach.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
They only ask to be treated fairly. 
They only ask to be treated equally.  
My question is to the Prime Minister. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Those are the people who will be assisted by governments throughout this country.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
It has been a great advisor to the Canadian government and we appreciate its contribution.  
Things are certainly looking up.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we care about children who are living in poverty in this country.  
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
Both of these groups are suffering and dying because of their blood. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
It is a sad history.  
We believe this is good public policy. 
We believe it is the responsible way- 
The hon. member for Nanaimo-Cowichan.  
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
It is a tragedy and we need to help them.  
I have a very simple question. 
Why is this government setting up two tiers of victims in this country?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
We have faith in it.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
The position has been vacant since October 4, 1994. 
Why is the minister not complying with the act and filling the vacant position?  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, up to now it was not necessary. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Basic housing is substandard and the social conditions are heartbreaking. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
I too would like to quote from the report. 
TRAINING FOR YOUNG PEOPLE 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Will the minister tell the House about the progress made in this regard?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
For example, we will offer the Canada millennium scholarships. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
It held hearings yesterday and it is holding hearings today. 
We look forward to its report.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
It is like putting the fox in charge of the chicken coop.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
There was no national ombudsman until this government took office. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Instead it went to the Liberal Party fundraisers.  
However, I saw a minister rising. 
If he wants to answer the question he may.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is a very serious and tragic situation. 
We will continue to do that. 
It should not be confused with the issues the member is putting forward.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is Elections Canada that is telling us about the money. 
I think it is part of us.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, an investigation has been commenced in the province of Alberta. 
We are dealing with the AFN to deal with the broader issues.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
These individuals will suffer greatly along with their families. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
With this in mind, why is the minister refusing to- 
The hon. Minister of Health.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Medical procedures and forms of treatment bear with them an inherent risk. 
That is the difference between the years 1986-90.  
CANADA FOUNDATION FOR INNOVATION 
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.  
We have heard little since that announcement.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
We expect the first announcements to be made by early summer.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the minister for that paid political announcement.  
The same thing is happening here again. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
We are talking about gathering strength.  
The hon. member for Berthier-Montcalm.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Yet it seems to be business as usual in the Department of Health. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We are committed to the safety of the public. 
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
The minister cannot blame this one on the Conservatives being in power. 
He made the announcement.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
I point out that there has been a long trend with respect to this. 
The hon. member for Bramalea-Gore-Malton.  
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton, Lib.):
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
We are currently conducting an evaluation of that program which is one year old. 
We find that 60% to 70% of the interns- 
The hon. member for Calgary Northeast.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
It has a direct impact on the security of Canada.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not know exactly what information the hon. member is looking for. 
I will call on the hon. member for Markham to begin.  
THE LATE DOUGLAS ALKENBRACK 
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to pay tribute to Mr. Alkenbrack.  
His constituents returned him to the House in every election until his retirement in 1979. 
This fact attests to the worth of his work on their behalf.  
He once said ``Each of us is an ombudsman for the people he represents''. 
A true blue Tory, Mr. Alkenbrack also loved his country passionately. 
Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, Lib.):
Douglas served this House and the people of Canada from 1962 to 1979. 
As a rookie MP, the House of Commons can appear intimidating at first glance. 
Almonte Douglas Alkenbrack was not only a colleague but a dear friend. 
May he rest in peace.  
There is a preamble: 
It's great to go down to the Capitol 
Where there's plenty to hear and see 
Of our country's might, as they talk all night 
Of a free democracy.  
And they say it is good to be understood 
In committee or caucus hall 
Or in strong entreat from a Commons seat 
Where governments rule or fall.  
But there's one thing better that I prefer 
And the best that can happen to me 
Is to homeward wend, on the glad week-end 
And return to Napanee.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Doug Alkenbrack was more than a politician. 
I sat in this House with Doug Alkenbrack. 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
His political career began in 1952, when he became a Napanee municipal councillor. 
He went on to serve as mayor from 1957 to 1958.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I knew Doug Alkenbrack fairly well when he was a member of Parliament. 
I remember one of the last days he was in the House. 
As a matter of fact, we expected the government to fall. 
It was before the election of 1979. 
As it happened, I was to have the floor after question period. 
Of course I ceded my place to him.  
BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1998 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
We saw it yesterday. 
The amendment reads as follows: 
I believe that desire may be legitimate.  
This ought not, however, to be done at the expense of efficiency. 
The bill contains some things that are completely unacceptable. 
It is important for those in the rest of Canada to understand this.  
In Quebec, there is already a system of loans and scholarships in place. 
Quebec has developed an incredible expertise in this area. 
I believe it to be a model that is the envy of all of Canada.  
In Canada, education is a provincial jurisdiction. 
It is one of the cornerstones of the Confederation pact of 1867. 
It is therefore important, and it is necessary that a solution be found.  
However, Mr. Shapiro and stakeholders in education have one concern. 
They say that instruction is an integral tool in the development of the individual. 
I think it is important for us to reach an acceptable outcome.  
There was the manpower issue, you will remember. 
We cannot afford to waste money in the education sector''.  
The situation is urgent. 
The federal government must negotiate in good faith. 
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
Another 9% made tax relief their first priority. 
They cannot authorize, at least in theory. 
Let us not forget that.  
That is how it is spelled out in the Constitution. 
That is the theory.  
In fact, Joseph Howe established responsible government sometime earlier in Nova Scotia. 
What is responsible government? 
The House of Commons is not responsible to the cabinet. 
What is the answer? 
How about the grassroots solution?  
Alberta has also enacted tax and expenditure legislation.  
Most of us say it was too little, too late.  
The statutory targets were in effect up to March 31, 1996.  
Maybe it is just selective memory.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
I will take a little different tact from what my peers have done. 
They addressed a number of aspects of the budget and I concur with their comments. 
However, I want to take a little different direction.  
Surely this is where the parliamentary process should be at its best. 
It is the people of Canada and their positions on the issues of the day. 
Are we reflecting their position? 
How will individuals in our ridings be affected by the decisions we make?  
In Canada we pride ourselves on being fair and non-prejudicial. 
Why do we take this position? 
They are our future citizens, our future leaders.  
Allow me to refer to some thorough and respected research done on this very topic. 
In addition, parents prefer family to day care. 
For this reason I brought this matter forward today. 
It is a reasonable position. 
Reform cares about families.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Deputy Secretary Policy Program and Protocol 
BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1998 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
This year, it feels like we are watching the same scenario again. 
It is like the sequel to last year's scenario. 
This is the sort of situation we are currently in. 
Will it pay off the debt with it? 
The Minister of Finance was quite clear in his budget announcements. 
It seems somewhat ridiculous to me.  
But I want to get back to what I wanted to say. 
There is nothing in the bill about that. 
Well, we are used to seeing people change colours overnight. 
It seems to be a real fad lately.  
Where will this money go? 
Who will be responsible for deciding what it should be allocated to? 
There is nothing about that in these budget provisions.  
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
The budget this year has some hopes, dreams and aspirations in it. 
There are several problems and many things wrong with this budget. 
That is why that is such a problem. 
I conducted a survey in my riding. 
This budget fails to address that issue.  
That is like jumping from the frying pan into the fire. 
That is what this government is doing with this budget. 
I will get into that a little later in my remarks today.  
They want a system that will ensure that they can get a decent education. 
The average taxpayer pays over $21,000 in federal taxes. 
Roughly one-third of that goes to paying the interest on the debt.  
The average family income in British Columbia is approximately $58,000 a year. 
That is the lowest in the country.  
Other provinces receive much higher amounts from the federal government. 
For example, 43% of Newfoundland's provincial budget comes from the federal government. 
I will give members an example. 
Fruit growers in my riding have experienced this firsthand. 
Where is the fairness? 
Where is the equality in a system like that?  
That is not good enough from this government and we want to change that.  
I see my time is running out. 
However, I would like to close with the millennium scholarship fund.  
However, this budget fails to do that. 
I would argue that the government has let those people down. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
As the member for Frontenac-Megantic, I cannot go along with this bill. 
These scholarships are an obsession that is making our Prime Minister sick. 
Now it will be the same for a student. 
In reality, this will not mean one cent more for the student. 
That is the sad and unfortunate fact of the matter.  
The finance minister is no model for the government. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
This is not an unqualified person. 
The constituent writes that her husband is employed at a planer mill. 
This works out to almost 31% of the couple's income. 
During the winter of 1996-97 the couple's roof leaked. 
They have just one vehicle.  
During the election I had a rather interesting experience. 
That is not adequate. 
Canadians want to know what the rules are going to be. 
What did this government do? 
It said that it will invent new ways.  
It is not doing that according to the auditor general.  
This is not anything that was fabricated by the Reform Party. 
This came from the Auditor General of Canada.  
He said this as though he should be getting some great credit. 
What has this government boasted of? 
This government has boasted that it has eliminated the deficit. 
It is called honesty in government. 
The government will be successful in passing this budget implementation bill because of its majority. 
The government has brought in time allocation to force this thing through. 
That is the way it visualizes itself. 
It is here forever. 
It will assume the centre of the road. 
Canadians have to wake up. 
We have to call on these people to be accountable. 
Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
We have accomplished that. 
Now Canadians will be the beneficiaries of the sacrifices they have made.  
That is why we announced the Canada millennium scholarship fund. 
I want to ensure hon. colleagues that this will not be the case. 
There is no need for apprehension regarding infringement. 
Now we are expanding assistance even more. 
The secret is to start early and to make regular contributions. 
The maximum annual grant will be $400 per child.  
I congratulate Canadians for their determination to stay the course.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
The duplication and the wasted money were just dripping from the last member's speech. 
I could see it and feel it. 
Those two elements are health and education. 
A message was delivered by the Usher of the Black Rod as follows: 
Accordingly, the Speaker with the House went up to the Senate chamber.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Bill C-5, an act respecting co-operatives-Chapter No. 1.  
BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1998 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
I would like to finish off with the education theme. 
The government seems to want to do it at the end. 
In fact it had promised $75 million toward the debt. 
It doubled that because of the compound effect of paying off the debt.  
I was pleased to speak on a couple of points. 
I hope the government in future budgets will take heed of our words.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I believe you would find consent for the following motion: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
NATURAL RESOURCES AND GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the motion put forward by the hon. parliamentary secretary. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1998 
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
Why not make it retroactive? 
That is where the need is.  
What is the government doing? 
This brought me to thoughts about the years when I grew up. 
They will probably remember some of these things.  
My younger brothers and sister were able to go to university. 
One of my younger brothers loved to raise a calf or two each year. 
That calf put him through university. 
He did not have to go to the bank to borrow money. 
Dad gave my brother the calf at its birth. 
Nobody was denied this opportunity.  
Why is it that it was so easy in those days? 
They had their priorities right. 
It is astounding that things have gone this way.  
I look at the young pages. 
The finances were there. 
People could afford to send their families to university.  
Today that does not hold true. 
I talk to my constituents. 
They have no opportunity to go. 
It is not that easy''. 
That is why I feel for the younger generation.  
Why has this happened? 
How did we get into this mess? 
There is $42 billion blown into the wind. 
I talked about buying a pick-up truck. 
What did it cost me to operate that truck? 
This is what the young people are dealing with.  
Because this could have been avoided.  
You pail fed them. 
We would do that all winter long and they would be used to it. 
They liked the grass. 
He would bang the handle of the pail and they would come running. 
This is what governments have been doing for the past 30 years. 
I do not want to be pessimistic. 
Are they going to somehow change straw into gold? 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
I would like to deal with a number of issues. 
In many cases they find a more lucrative and challenging environment in which to work. 
That is a shame, because those students could stay within our country.  
For example, students should be provided with apprenticeship possibilities. 
It is our role to provide those opportunities to the youth of today.  
I compliment the government on its RESP and child tax benefit plans. 
Why did the government not do that in any meaningful way? 
It has proven to work in country after country after country. 
High taxes kill jobs. 
The question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the amendment, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the amendment lost.  
The next question is on the main motion.  
Is there agreement to proceed in this fashion?  
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
(Bill read the second time and referred to a committee) 
Is there agreement to proceed in this fashion?  
See list under Division No. 120 ] 
I declare the motion carried.  
(Bill read the second time and referred to a committee) 
The question is on the amendment.  
All those to my left in favour of the amendment will please rise.  
(The House divided on the amendment, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the amendment lost.  
The next question is on the main motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I missed getting up. 
I wanted to vote and I would like to place my vote against.  
The hon. member's vote will be recorded.  
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
(The House divided on the motion, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the motion lost.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Bill C-223 does just that. 
I would like to support what he said.  
They do not make enough money to own a house.  
This will not benefit the rich. 
It will not benefit the speculator. 
The bill also provides an economic stimulus to the economy. 
The bill put forth by my friend from Portage-Lisgar is a win, win bill. 
It should not have any opposition. 
Renting is not something that people in lower socio-economic groups want. 
All these things would benefit those people who need it. 
Bill C-233 does just that.  
Arguments against the bill have been that it would likely increase the price of houses. 
The price of houses is a function of supply and demand. 
We have an enormous demand but we do not have the supply. 
There are other issues to deal with. 
I live in a city where housing is very expensive. 
There are a number of cities like that. 
The issue of affordable housing is serious. 
We have to live within our means. 
Bill C-223 would do just that.  
The existing measures for RRSPs are not adequate. 
It would be a fine complement to that measure.  
This would remove the onus from the government and place it on the individual.  
Those moneys could be targeted toward affordable housing. 
This is also a social situation. 
I would ask the government to support it for all individuals. 
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Bill C-223 does not meet this requirement.  
This is a call for a subsidy, a target tax break that benefits a few. 
Fairness is conspicuously absent in this bill. 
We need only reflect on the words of the member for Etobicoke North. 
There are other dynamics at play here and they need to be explored. 
At present there exists great acrimony within Liberal ranks. 
This alternative must be effective in putting money back into the pockets of Canadians. 
More importantly, we need to just do it.  
Let us not miss this opportunity.  
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
However, it is also the cause of a lot of stress and doubt. 
A house is for living, but a home is to cherish.  
One may wonder where I am going with this. 
It is an investment that lasts a lifetime.  
Home ownership helps to foster stable families and stable communities. 
There has been some opposition to the idea proposed in the bill. 
However, I feel this opposition is unwarranted. 
This is simply untrue.  
Very often it is for a lower rate of taxation.  
Currently all U.S. mortgage interest payments are deductible. 
This is something we could all be proud of. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
They think they better keep that money ready in case there is an election. 
Then they can haul out the millennium fund. 
The Liberals will win the election because they will have all this money. 
It is terrible that they hang on to their money to use for political purposes. 
I think that is absolutely necessary.  
Where does that interest go? 
My colleague is setting forth an eminently sensible proposal. 
It just blows me away. 
Why would they do that? 
I urge all members to vote in favour of the bill. 
This is a very important measure. 
Let us not do that this time. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
The bill concerns a tax refund or a tax reduction. 
This will make home ownership more achievable for many. 
My concern has been to do something right in the House to benefit future generations. 
This was a serious oversight on the government's part. 
That is a tremendous amount of money for some young families. 
If hon. members explain the bill to their constituents it would be widely supported. 
I hope that we as a House take that issue seriously.  
I congratulate them for that.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Here are some excerpts. 
They are rather long: 
For these reasons, something must be done to remove it from circulation.  
Did Mr. Gates object to the affidavits being filed by his own department? 
Why is the minister ignoring the advice of her own bureaucrats?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice.  
Not surprisingly, this generated a discrepancy which was the source of our original concerns. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
I rise on the same subject matter. 
That was in July 1997.  
This is a very serious matter if that is in fact what has happened.  
What does methodological difference mean? 
The government suggested that it is going to cost $48 million. 
There are questions that have to be answered by the minister or by the government. 
This question has been discussed many times. 
This is simply not possible. 
LABOUR SPONSORED INVESTMENT FUNDS 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Let me provide a few figures.  
They invested about $400 million in 1996, a record year for them. 
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
That is quite right.  
In other words, this last budget simply restored some of the cuts. 
Others in Canada agree.  
Even the Secretary of State for Research and Development has said the same thing. 
We are a vital trading nation. 
Other industrialized nations have listened and taken action. 
This is not only embarrassing but it places Canada on a very dangerous path. 
We know that Canada simply cannot continue in this way. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The CFI issued a request for proposals on December 9, 1997.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House adjourned at 7.24 p.m.)
