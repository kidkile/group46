The House met at 10 a.m. 
MINISTER RESPONSIBLE FOR CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD 
In that question of privilege the Minister of Natural Resources was named. 
As minister I have to try to build some consensus. 
I suspect that came as no surprise to farmers. 
If the details change, then there will have to be further consultations again. 
This sounds like debate now. 
Hon. Ralph E. Goodale:
I will refer briefly to two remarks made on Tuesday by Reform members. 
In fact I have repeatedly stated the exact opposite. 
The board of directors cannot be in place. 
The points have now been put before me. 
Allegations have been made by one side. 
I now have the minister's statement. 
I have heard both sides. 
I would ask that the minister with- 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
CANADIAN PARKS AGENCY ACT 
FOOD AND DRUGS ACT 
Today these products can be regulated in a very heavy handed fashion.  
This bill has received a fair amount of public support. 
The health committee is currently studying this issue. 
It is quite timely that it should be placed on the docket at this time.  
I am pleased to introduce this bill.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
These six petitions represent 8,461 signatures. 
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
I support that position, although I know I cannot say that.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
I personally support this as well.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Again, I am very pleased to present this petition on their behalf.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
I am proud to represent directly the constituents of Elk Island in their petition. 
I am proud to present this petition on their behalf.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
I urge hon. members to comply with the rules in that regard. 
I think the Chair has been very lenient today.  
Mr. Speaker, I suggest that all questions be allowed to stand.  
Shall all the questions stand?  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
I appreciate that you have risen with regard to the issue on petitions. 
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
In the same way there are many that I personally support.  
The fact is we present them on behalf of our constituents.  
The point is that the rule is there. 
They are not rules.  
An hon. member says they are not rules. 
Not every rule is written as such.  
I urge hon. members to comply with that position. 
I am sure that if the committee presents a report the House will consider it.  
ALLOTTED DAY-GOVERNMENT SPENDING 
I thank them for the enormous amount of work they have done on this subject.  
On the debt problem, this is the essence of it. 
It is a national disgrace and strong leadership is required to correct it.  
We believe that we are supported in this by a majority of the Canadian people.  
Six provinces of Canada have balanced budget laws. 
We do not just tax the rich. 
I often go to universities to speak to the students. 
I do not have time but other members will get into this point. 
Reform has a concrete plan for tax relief. 
We urge the government to adopt these tax relief measures. 
We list nine particular measures in ``Securing our Future''. 
When it comes to financial reforms, timing is everything. 
We say now is the time for debt reduction. 
Now is the time for tax relief. 
Now is not the time for increased federal spending.  
In conclusion I want to say two further things. 
The first one is to the public. 
This is a watershed budget year. 
That is not the case this year. 
It has taken 15 years to balance this federal budget. 
The election of the Tory government in 1984 was largely based on that appeal. 
We know what happened. 
It still took 15 years to do it. 
It needs to be prodded like it has never been prodded before. 
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
I also noted that he used the word weak in varying forms. 
His etymological skills impress me. 
I wonder if that stands for weak, weaker and weakest.  
That is not my terminology. 
The hon. member opposite does strut. 
I do not agree with MacBeth. 
The hon. member is no idiot. 
He is a very clever man. 
The member talked about leadership. 
I could go on and on but I know- 
You have, you have.  
It is so great to get the accolades from the members opposite.  
There were really two questions in his intervention. 
He wants us to give the federal government credit for this balancing of the budget. 
A new attention to debt and tax relief has to be given. 
That was the whole thrust of my talk.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I also have a question for the Leader of the Official Opposition. 
My preamble will be somewhat shorter than the previous one.  
The arguments that the hon. member makes are interesting. 
We argue that high debt is socially irresponsible. 
I appreciate the member's question. 
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
We will be in balance next year. 
Jobs are of critical importance to Canadians today and for the future. 
We will continue to adopt very prudent economic assumptions in budget making. 
We will have a contingency reserve to look after unforeseen circumstances. 
We will continue with our economic forecasting. 
I mention in this regard the Asian crisis. 
Its executive director is another person of great experience in the financial sector, Paul Cantor.  
They are very tangible contributions. 
Let us look at our program. 
What has happened because of our economic performance? 
Where have we cut those taxes? 
We cut taxes for Canadians with disabilities. 
This is the way it should be in Canada. 
We eliminated all payroll taxes for small businesses that took on new employees. 
That was targeted tax relief for a specific purpose.  
We recognize that governments are being forced to cut back their spending. 
We have cut back spending. 
Program spending has been cut by us by $15 billion. 
Those words cannot be more apposite today in our country. 
We have extended the relief period for interest on Canada student loans. 
In May 1997 we established the Canadian Foundation for Innovation. 
We have taken another measure in the last two budgets. 
I cite what we have done with charitable giving to our educational institutions.  
This is the Liberal approach. 
This is our balanced approach for the future.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I compliment the minister on his speech. 
I want to make a couple of comments and then ask him a question.  
First, I think he misuses the Titanic analogy. 
Second, I was amused by his quoting Disraeli. 
He of course is free to quote whoever he likes. 
I encourage him to read and study what was actually said. 
They take a run at you when your fundamentals are not right. 
That brings me to my question. 
He has admitted to the House that our tax levels are excessively high. 
We steered the ship of state around it, and this is why- 
The debt is underneath.  
The hon. member talked about how the international markets have reacted to Canada. 
We are committed to that. 
We are doing it in a balanced fashion. 
That is the difference between us and the Reform Party. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
That is a realistic suggestion.  
To this too the Minister of Finance turns a deaf ear. 
The figures are alarming. 
Who is paying for this new approach? 
It takes all kinds of actions to ensure that the federal government respects provincial jurisdiction.  
Where do the finance minister's real interests lie? 
Finally, it must be truly responsive to the needs of our people.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
I made some notes. 
I find it rather curious.  
I heard the member talk in terms of two visions. 
I find it somewhat at opposite ends of the particular issue.  
I have two questions for the member. 
Mr. Guy St-Julien:
But in the meantime, we want justice. 
That is all we are asking from the other side.  
What we in Quebec want above all is to get what is due to us.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Reformers have been quite specific about what they see as the formula. 
This is very serious in the area of medical research, for example.  
The Reform Party does not seem content with the federal Liberal cuts in government spending. 
I remember when the federal finance minister introduced the budget. 
What do we see instead? 
We see the Reform Party arguing that we should go even further.  
Reform and the Liberals treat Canada like a bad investment. 
``Pull your money out,'' they say, ``the stock is worthless''. 
How about giving them a real job?  
That is a good start. 
Let me just zero in for a minute on the issue of medical research. 
This is a real challenge that we face in this country.  
There can be an argument made that there is no better way. 
This is an argument which in fact has been advanced by the OECD. 
But what do we hear from Reform? 
What did those American political economists say to us? 
Let us resist those continuing advocacies from the Reform Party. 
I appreciate the opportunity to put forward some of these concerns. 
Fundamentally that is a question of priorities.  
That is what budgets are about. 
That is what this debate should be about. 
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Would she have not paid down $16 billion on the debt? 
One has to be focused. 
Let me repeat what I know the member is well aware of.  
The difference is that it would have done so at a lower level of unemployment. 
Now those deficits have to be addressed.  
The member opposite asks a perfectly fair and reasonable question. 
What would the New Democratic Party have done instead? 
Would we have said to heck with the deficit? 
The member talks about us being bankrupt in this country. 
That is where the money is. 
It is not a question of there not being any money. 
Canada is wealthier than it has ever been in its history.  
The questions are what are we doing with that wealth? 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
In practice the NDP actually does something quite different from what it says. 
I wanted to point that out.  
The result has not been that we have eliminated the deficit. 
We have built up a debt of $600 billion. 
If we could create jobs by spending more we would all have three jobs. 
I do not think the hon. member thinks that is socially just. 
Yes, there should be a tax cut. 
Is that the Reform Party's notion of tax fairness?  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Last year the Reform Party wanted to cut spending by $12 billion. 
Now it wants to put a cap on current spending. 
Its policy has changed somewhat on that.  
They are needed now. 
High taxes kill jobs. 
High payroll taxes are one of the most detrimental impediments to job creation in Canada. 
Tax cuts increase domestic consumption''.  
The industry minister should talk more often with the finance minister. 
Nine per cent of our GDP is going toward paying interest. 
It is a question of definition of government and the role of government. 
What things is government doing now that it could do differently or could cease doing? 
What things could government pursue? 
Between 1993 and today the Liberal government cut indiscriminately. 
After having cut indiscriminately it is preparing to spend indiscriminately. 
Let us consider the example of medical research. 
We are making higher education in Canada not less but more expensive. 
The figure has gone from eight students to nine hundred in five years.  
It is a sad legacy of the government.  
We certainly acknowledge that the debt must be reduced. 
The other way is to actually grow the GDP. 
Investing in our young people is a worthy objective. 
Our belief is that Canadians will succeed with a lower debt. 
Canadians will succeed when provided with lower taxation. 
Instead they tackled the debt by dealing with cuts to the provinces. 
We can offload a lot of things to the provinces. 
We need to reduce taxes. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
I congratulate him on his post.  
My friend may mock this but the polls in fact confirm that.  
I think people who remember Brian Mulroney will attest to that.  
I want to ask my friend a question. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of the member for Medicine Hat.  
Brian Mulroney did not dye his hair. 
Brian Mulroney did not have his teeth done. 
Let us give credit where credit is due.  
Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering-Ajax-Uxbridge, Lib.):
The point is that party has really not got it right yet. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
This would give all hon. members a better chance to speak on issues. 
There is no intention to make this a hard and fast rule. 
Just so people know, it might make things more interesting in the House.  
On a point of order, the hon. member for St. Albert.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Certainly there would not be any intention to police. 
It is not a new policy. 
We have tried it from time to time.  
As I think I clearly said, it is purely at the pleasure of the House. 
It is not an intention of the Chair to impose anything. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
It is a pleasure to rise and address this motion. 
I will read the motion again just for people who are watching this debate: 
I think we are talking about an extraordinarily important issue here today. 
I want to talk first about the effect of overspending on social programs. 
I can tell the leader of the NDP that the Reform Party is as well. 
The government in its wisdom cut social programs. 
Who does that hurt the most? 
Dr. Kazimirski was the head of the Canadian Medical Association. 
That is a disgrace. 
The result was a debt of $600 billion. 
I point to the tax load people have to carry in this country. 
We tied second and third in the world. 
Now we are twelfth. 
That meant a tremendous strain on families.  
Now we have interest payments of $47 billion a year. 
Liberals want to spend 50% of the surpluses on new programs. 
Some people say the surpluses might hit $30 billion. 
That is $15 billion a year in new spending? 
But these people are so reckless that they want to spend more.  
We have all received letters from people who say ``I have had it''. 
It is one of the most heart-wrenching letters I have ever read. 
They simply do not have the money. 
For them it was not an option of taking it out of disposable income. 
Like many Canadians, they do not have any disposable income. 
My point is simply that Canadians cannot afford a government which continues to spend. 
Right now the debt is $600 billion. 
We would reduce it over 20 years to about $343 billion. 
The other half of that surplus would be devoted to tax relief. 
We list nine measures in our document. 
The Conservatives introduced them specifically as a measure to reduce the deficit. 
The deficit is now gone. 
The Liberals have a moral obligation to get rid of the 3% and 5% surtaxes. 
Let us remove those surtaxes and help all Canadians.  
I agree with that. 
Let us be more compassionate. 
It is time to help Canadians.  
We have laid down the challenge to my friends across the way. 
This is an hour of decision for them. 
There is a budget coming up. 
It will be the first balanced budget in 27 years. 
Canadians do not want it. 
They have made that extraordinarily clear.  
I lay down the challenge to my friends. 
Please consider seriously what we are suggesting to you today. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That is essentially what we heard from Canadians. 
Let me focus on the tax relief. 
The Reform Party does not fully answer this question in its prebudget document. 
Should we not go for a balanced budget?  
I will give the Reform Party a calculator with batteries.  
I note that my friend finds that quite shocking. 
They have made it extraordinarily clear that they do not want to radically increase spending. 
I think this is where the Liberals have gone off track. 
They made a commitment and now they cannot back out.  
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
In other words Atlantic Canada should be cut loose financially from the rest of Canada.  
There are areas where I would support an increase in spending.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Medicine Hat has about 50 seconds to respond.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Security is one of the most important parts of human existence. 
We want to be secure. 
There are some interesting highlights in the just released Industry Canada report. 
I wish I had time to refer to it in detail but I do not. 
These are only a couple of things from this study. 
He mentioned the terrible problem of regional disparity. 
The household debt is a lot higher in Canada. 
Thirteen leading industrialized countries were compared. 
The results were absolutely shocking.  
We scored a decrease of 0.4% per person. 
Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering-Ajax-Uxbridge, Lib.):
That is an inescapable fact. 
However he said something that was true. 
These are not made up figures. 
Clearly the member was not listening to what I said. 
This is not a fiscal dividend that is being spent. 
It is time the Liberals understood that.  
Some 37% want to pay down the national debt. 
Guess how many want an increase in social spending. 
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
One area would be a better deal on the equalization formula.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
We have proposed that equalization payments should be re-examined. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We must move on to bring down our hobbling public debt as well. 
Most of all deficit financing means higher taxes. 
I am sure the NDP will appreciate this point. 
That is what Canadians want. 
Our fiscal turnaround is not a transitory phenomenon. 
What about that fiscal dividend once the federal books are balanced? 
Then there is the challenge of investing in Canada's future. 
Just this week we debated and voted on this bill. 
Of course the members of the official opposition rejected that measure and voted against it.  
I am convinced that the vast majority of Canadians certainly see it differently. 
They see it as a wise use of part of the coming dividend.  
Going to work should make people's lives better, not worse. 
We are addressing that.  
I do not think so. 
It is an increase which does not threaten our balanced budget.  
They want a strong health care system. 
They value support for education. 
They believe our country should help the disadvantaged. 
I think I have made my point.  
I want to thank the Reform Party. 
That was in October. 
Some members opposite were there, some were not. 
They talk about freezing program spending through to 2001. 
Where does it come from?  
They underestimate the total cost of their package by over $10 billion. 
Where is the $30 billion plus for tax cuts to come from?  
Should we just add it to the deficit and the debt? 
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I listen to this nonsense. 
I listened to it for years before I was elected. 
My wife and I have raised four children and they are now young adults. 
We have twin sons. 
That is what we are hearing. 
Who increased the taxes year after year after year?  
We eventually moved out of that house. 
We were not unlike many of our neighbours. 
We built this country on low taxes. 
What is destroying this country is high taxation. 
That is what is wrong with this country. 
That is what is wrong with this government. 
Who piloted the Titanic into the iceberg? 
Someone who was absolutely asleep at the wheel. 
That is what we have seen for the last 25 years. 
No. It has to be used on the iceberg that the Titanic is headed toward.  
Everyone understands the principles of economics. 
Let us correct it. 
Mr. Speaker, I truly welcome the opportunity to respond. 
This government is not taking the credit. 
It is Canadians who should take the credit.  
Let us get it clear. 
It is not this particular government that is overspending.  
It is quite clear and it has been said over and over again. 
Let me move to some of the other members of that caucus. 
Is that coming from that opposition party? 
That is something we will not do. 
That is not the role of this government. 
They talk about cutting spending. 
As a former mayor of Dauphin I know the importance of it. 
We need the money to leverage other money''. 
That was the member for Dauphin-Swan River.  
But you do not go into debt to do those things.  
And you are exactly right. 
It does not increase the debt that we have in this country. 
This government will take the balanced approach. 
It will reduce the debt in real terms and on a ratio basis. 
That is what this government will do.  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for Lethbridge. 
Finally and hopefully and completely forever we will not see higher interest. 
That by his definition will mean more growth. 
He also said ``Lower deficits mean lower taxes''. 
They are finally saying that we can lower taxes. 
The parliamentary secretary said that they will never spend more than they take in. 
We would have no debt. 
That money would be in the pockets of Canadians for them to spend every year. 
Think about how much higher the economic growth would have been. 
We would be one of the most prosperous nations on earth. 
It would be heaven on earth. 
What is going on here?  
Exhibit 13.16 on page 13-29 refers to provision of dental services. 
That is the type of thing that goes on each and every day. 
As it saves it will look after Canadian taxpayers money. 
It goes on and on. 
It never seems to stop.  
We are $600 billion in debt. 
We have heard people talk about all kinds of scenarios. 
People were losing their jobs. 
There was 25% unemployment.  
It was a Tory prime minister, wasn't it?  
It was a Tory prime minister. 
It was Mr. Borden. 
I hope that does not happen. 
I hope this government sees the light of day. 
We need to have serious, proper management of the affairs of the nation. 
Let us see some real responsibility for once.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
It is not correct.  
The hon. member for Calgary-Nose Hill tabled in the House her views. 
The information provided to this House was incorrect.  
That leaves $2,000 on which only $500 of tax is paid. 
Mr. Speaker, I think the member just pointed out the classic difference. 
This is absolutely ludicrous.  
Why does the government not leave the money with the people? 
That is what it is all about. 
It is not government. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Let me enlighten you, Mr. Speaker. 
I am splitting my time with the member for Lethbridge. 
He is following right after me. 
I would like to start now, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will try to talk fast. 
Perhaps the problems lie with the lack of accountability. 
Foolish spending has left us buried in debt. 
Let us face it. 
The stakes are even higher here. 
How did it manage to eliminate its deficit? 
Thanks to the federal cuts, provinces felt the pinch. 
The Liberals have addressed the deficit by raising Canadians' taxes 37 times. 
All this led to even fewer dollars in the pockets of Canadians. 
We are supposed to thank this government for getting rid of a deficit? 
This is an affront to all Canadians.  
The error of foolish Tory and Grit spending must come to an end immediately. 
Full steam ahead on spending now is a collision course with economic mayhem.  
My colleague, I know you are right into it. 
We will see you after question period.  
Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):
Sri Lanka is a parliamentary democracy and a sister nation to Canada in the Commonwealth. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
It is slower but equally devastating. 
Mr. John Maloney (Erie-Lincoln, Lib.):
The Canadian economy needs their energy and talents. 
They deserve a chance to prove themselves and a chance to acquire work experience.  
Mr. Rejean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):
Today, their family tree includes 20 grandchildren and 33 great-grandchildren.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, February is recognized as African Heritage Month. 
Such is what unity is all about.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
Mr. Fred Burke has done just that. 
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
It would give protection to Canadians from unreasonable laws and actions.  
Canadians are tired of their government using the Senate as its own patronage heaven.  
We owe this to Canadians.  
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma-Manitoulin, Lib.):
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, February is Black History Month in Canada. 
British and Canadian visionaries led the charge toward equality.  
Let me close with a quote from a U.S. slave published in 1851: 
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):
He chose to launch a regrettable partisan attack on the minister.  
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
International Children's Day of Broadcasting. 
To the minister I say yeah, right.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the minister said that she is very concerned about this letter.  
It was really beyond the department and the RCMP. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
They said that they always get such letters. 
As a result the band cut off Stephen's financial support. 
His child was taken away from him until a court intervened.  
Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not know how much more evidence the government needs. 
Bruce Starlight's wife Deanna has a question. 
Could the minister explain this to Deanna Starlight?  
Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I just want to say that- 
You are corrupt and dishonest.  
The member for Skeena has the floor.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I just want to tell the hon. member- 
This is a decision by the band council.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
The learned professor has just stepped out of the classroom, has he not? 
Now he is venturing into burlesque, and I admit it suits him well.  
In other words, international law recognizes facts.  
That would be a very interesting debate.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, it is too perfect. 
In no time at all, they are back to their old form, burlesque.  
Pray, do continue, my good fellow.  
He has nothing to say.  
Mr. Speaker, what can I say to such a question? 
Things are obviously much easier when the people concerned are separated by an ocean.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
I think the minister should look in the mirror.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The task force has been established. 
There will be a parliamentary committee which will consider it. 
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Every time I meet students, I come to the same conclusion. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Conservative leader for his question.  
I also met with representatives of the students' associations yesterday. 
My colleague, the Minister of Finance, also met these representatives yesterday afternoon. 
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Yesterday the Prime Minister compared himself to a bad NHL hockey player. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We began to address this situation in the 1997 budget. 
The 1998 budget might contain some important elements.  
We are investigating several options that will reflect student needs in this country.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Canadians are outraged with this lenient sentence.  
Will the minister take immediate steps to deport these individuals?  
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, first of all we must be perfectly clear. 
If it is a matter of- 
Mr. Speaker, pardon me, I will finish answering.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Landing is a privilege, not a licence to rape.  
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Finance. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
So, I ask the Minister of Finance:
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, Canadians are losing confidence in our immigration process. 
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
I am sorry to interrupt the minister. 
The hon. member for Roberval.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
My question is very brief. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
I thank that is a complete answer.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Considerable doubt still remains. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member is mistaken. 
No, it is not on our shoulders.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
What she is basically saying is boycott the new specialty channels.  
Why will she not stand up for consumers? 
Why is she standing up for the cable companies?  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
ATLANTIC CANADA OPPORTUNITIES AGENCY 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Is this the best they can do?  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the answer is very clear. 
In this bill we are not talking about a Canadian company.  
CAPE BRETON DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION 
Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Natural Resources.  
Will the minister relieve the people of Cape Breton?  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
They were designed to be in place until the budget was balanced. 
The budget was balanced.  
Reformers have long called for the removal of these taxes. 
We are at a balanced budget now. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
The Prime Minister says don't worry, be happy. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
First he is caught off guard by the monster merger announcement. 
Then he tells us his hands are tied by the task force. 
Then today he accuses the NDP of being the bankers' friends.  
Is that not why his hands are tied? 
I would say that question is out of order. 
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, what goes around comes around. 
Small business people, consumers and farmers are getting their next jerk by the banks. 
Is that not why he will not stand up to the big banks? 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
They are the future of this country.  
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
This is no coincidence.  
My question is for the Minister of Finance. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question was about student debt. 
This fund will address only a limited number of students somewhere in the future.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I remind all hon. members that this is the House of Commons, not an outhouse.  
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Revenue.  
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
The public is concerned about this total confusion.  
My question is for the Minister of Transport. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is no confusion as far as I am concerned.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence. 
The hon. Minister of National Defence.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
We are resolved to see that happen.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the finance minister. 
This government's scholarship fund is simply not enough. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that student debt is too high. 
Ms. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
What the heck else is the Canadian government doing to help disaster victims in Quebec? 
I would like an answer in a minute or less.  
The Department of Natural Resources has provided $45 million. 
The minister of defence has done the same thing in Ontario. 
We will continue to do that.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
It is still here. 
It was supposed to be a tax to reduce the deficit.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Then I asked the question subsequent to that.  
This point of order is over.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
There is an understanding to complete debate on that bill tomorrow.  
On Tuesday, February 10 and Friday, February 13 we shall have opposition days.  
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
NATIONAL DEFENCE AND VETERANS AFFAIRS 
ALLOTTED DAY-GOVERNMENT SPENDING 
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
The government's financial record is simply atrocious. 
Again, think of the government as the CEO of our nation. 
In the private sector, its track record would never be tolerated. 
Shareholders would be hollering from the rooftops for a change. 
Canadians need to hold their government to the same degree of competence. 
The responsible thing to do is to change our course of action. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for an excellent speech. 
This has to be changed. 
We have to reduce the debt. 
We have to free up more funds. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the member for his question. 
Student debt has increased substantially in this country. 
There has to be some help.  
These are but some of the places we will look to find this money. 
We hear in this House every day of the mismanagement that happens there. 
There is money there that could be realized. 
We are looking at cutting the employment insurance rates by 21%. 
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Waterloo-Wellington.  
Second, the motion is not supportable for numerous reasons.  
The back of the deficit is broken. 
We are on the verge of a balanced budget. 
No one will stand in the House to say ``I love paying taxes''. 
Many of the people of Thornhill have mortgages. 
It is a young community made up of Vaughan, Markham and Concord. 
There is an older population in Thornhill. 
Many live in condominiums. 
Many people who cannot yet afford homes live in apartments.  
All of them wish for a brighter and better economic future. 
They know that sometimes a crisis will arise. 
We directed them to the appropriate disaster relief agency.  
The people of my riding are sympathetic. 
Is the debt or mortgage affordable?  
We have already seen that occur.  
That is an important part of fiscal prudence. 
It is in their interest to have a strong social safety net. 
It is in their children's interest. 
It is in their grandparents' interest.  
I believe it is supported by the people of Thornhill. 
They know it is in their interest and in their children's interest. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Let me be very clear and very precise. 
That is where the Reform Party will make the relief. 
Why will the Liberal government not do it?  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Her statements are dishonest. 
I challenge her to stand and say that they are not.  
He is absolutely ridiculous. 
What he says is not true. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
I will not attempt to teach the opposition member the fundamentals of economics.  
The fiscal facts speak for themselves.  
We know it is the right thing to do. 
It is the Canadian way.  
I would ask the hon. member this. 
Collectively they help define who Canadians are as a people. 
I ask the hon. member exactly who is it he would leave behind. 
What Canadian is not worthy of these fundamental human rights? 
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
Who is in a better position to distribute the money? 
The provinces, of course. 
What does the government do? 
This is tantamount to buying votes. 
People want to work. 
I have a question for my hon. colleague. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member opposite for the question. 
I think it is very important.  
We did that with remarkable speed in the great context of things. 
I think that is worthy of note. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Some of the basic information in this motion has been refuted by members opposite. 
The information sources, in fact, mostly come from the government itself. 
It is kind of hard to understand why it is doing that. 
It is a little difficult indeed.  
The first is the deficit. 
The second is the chronically high levels of government spending. 
The fourth is the chronically high and increasing tax levels that we have. 
I think the Liberals should receive some credit for that. 
It deserves some credit for that. 
I think that is important.  
What if the Conservatives had been the opposition over these past four years? 
Then we would have had more of the same. 
They are going to spend for this, spend for that. 
They have this program, they have that program. 
What about dealing with Canadians who really need help?  
In fact they are returning to an increased pattern of overspending. 
That is what is coming. 
Clearly the chronic overspending has not been dealt with.  
The third area is the high level of debt, $600 billion. 
That probably does not mean much to a lot of people. 
My wife and I have five children. 
It is a little difficult for me to understand. 
That $45 billion is not available for any social program. 
It only goes to pay the interest on the debt. 
The fourth area is the one which I want to concentrate on. 
I want to put it in personal terms. 
As I mentioned, I have five children. 
My oldest daughter is 20 years old. 
She is taking business management and is in her third year of university. 
I have two sons who have just turned 18. 
They are identical twins. 
My sons are in their first year of engineering at university. 
They have trained for years to gain the ability to earn their way through university.  
They started their own business. 
The work they do amazes me. 
They rebuild combine headers. 
Farmers will understand what that is. 
They carry on this business. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
It did take 15 years. 
The Reform Party should remember that and give credit where credit is due.  
Today in 1998 there are over 900. 
What is the Reform Party's position on student debt? 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
They put in place the free trade agreement. 
Those are pretty good things too. 
It is really hard to figure out.  
Dealing with student debt is important. 
That is how they dealt with it.  
That is the importance we place on this issue. 
Our leader in his first private member's bill dealt with it. 
The member should read the bill.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
They helped to get us into this debt crisis in the first place.  
That is not how we reached this balanced budget.  
Those are the real heroes.  
That is whom the Liberals can thank for their balanced budget. 
They have cut back billions of dollars from health care. 
That is whom the Liberals have to thank.  
Have they forgotten something? 
Have they forgotten that the country is $600 billion in debt? 
I find that absolutely astonishing and unbelievable. 
That is what they are like.  
We will see more of them in the upcoming budget.  
The Liberals want to pursue them. 
The Liberals just do not get it. 
They got us into this mess. 
Now it looks like they want to do it over and over again.  
Have they forgotten the taxation levels? 
They do not consider all these things. 
They think we are out of the woods but we are not. 
Oh, yes, for the Liberals happy times are here again. 
They just cannot wait to be spending.  
It is tax paying Canadians who have to be thanked. 
They are the real heroes.  
Perhaps I could talk about some other little recognized heroes. 
Now that they are just about there they want to take credit for it. 
Our plans say that we should not start spending again. 
The priorities have to be right.  
These are the right priorities. 
That is the right priority.  
Our plan states clear priorities for responsible spending. 
We will be here day after day.  
We have to keep the country on the road to a strong, secure future. 
That is why we call our plan ``Securing Your Future''.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I appreciate being recognized.  
It was one of the best places in the country to live.  
They did not get that. 
They gave away the assets. 
They bankrupted the province in nine years.  
Since 1992 there have been consecutive surplus budgets in Saskatchewan under the NDP.  
What track record does the Reform Party have? 
I want to ask the member one question. 
They talk about eliminating equalization payments. 
He is a Reform member of Parliament and a former mayor of Dauphin, Manitoba. 
I have a question for the member. 
We can disagree with each other. 
We are not led around like little sheep with a noose in our nose. 
We can disagree if we want.  
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
It is a pleasure to respond to this motion. 
From a trade standpoint we have one of the most open economies in the world. 
We have the people, we have the institutions and we have the research excellence.  
However, having such assets is not enough. 
The Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister have repeatedly said this. 
It is a national effort supported by Canadians across this country. 
The results are striking. 
We often talk about what will be done with the surplus. 
We have not relied on rosy forecasts. 
We outperformed the U.S. during this same period. 
But it is not enough to say that we are meeting our financial targets. 
Our government is investing in innovation and knowledge itself. 
We are helping to bring new innovation to market with the Technology Partnerships Canada. 
In closing, let me repeat that we have invested our money wisely. 
The same party said that Canada was part of a third world nation.  
It needs to understand the challenges of tomorrow. 
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
We hear the most interesting things.  
They talk about the fight to bring down the deficit. 
When all is said and done, yes, I agree that the deficit must be eliminated. 
Deficits are a drain on future generations. 
But it is all in how you go about it.  
I have a question for my colleague across the way:
How is it that our economy is doing so well right now? 
The indicators show that we are in a period of full economic growth. 
Businesses have been making record profits for a few years now. 
They wanted to reduce the deficit. 
The provinces are then obliged to make cuts in the social fabric: health, education. 
Right now, there is unprecedented poverty. 
All this leaves a very bitter taste; the champagne has turned to vinegar.  
I put the question to the hon. member opposite:
The federal government cut well over 14% of its own spending. 
That will be resolved shortly I hope.  
That is how we get the economy going again.  
That is what is happening today. 
The member needs to understand that and needs to recognize that.  
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):
This is not so. 
We have certainly had to move carefully to achieve our financial objectives. 
We know that it has meant sacrifices for many. 
That is why our government will be reducing taxes. 
The Minister of Finance let no room for doubt in this regard. 
We will see when the budget is tabled.  
That is why I am looking forward to the next budget. 
Think about it for a minute. 
In fact, the last two budgets did not include any tax increases. 
Did Canadians see our government take all of these measures? 
The fight to put our fiscal house back in order is not over yet. 
These are the few comments I wanted to make concerning the opposition's motion. 
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
They must admit it. 
It all started with Trudeau.  
In fact, I was born in a village called Mattawa. 
It is where the Speaker was born as well. 
A brief anecdote springs to mind. 
So the hon. member is not the first one to make the mistake. 
So, as far as that goes, we are in agreement.  
We are in a surplus situation. 
That answers the first question.  
Now I am going to recognize the member for Fraser Valley. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
The debt will somehow look after itself.  
That being said, what do we do with a surplus. 
In the finance committee's pre-budget report, it was weak in three different areas. 
It is a disease called spendicitis. 
It affects Liberal ministers of finance. 
It affects them somewhere deep inside. 
Something wells up in their throats. 
They seem to think that spending more money is the way. 
They would be saying there is a chicken in every pot. 
Why have there been so many increases from the other side? 
Why has bracket creep been allowed to happen? 
It is a sad situation. 
That is what debt does.  
More than that, taxes and high debt hurt job creation. 
There was a little item in my local newspaper. 
It is a job killing payroll tax.  
Worse than that is what it means for our children. 
I travel around many high schools, especially those in my riding. 
I do not worry about declaring my tips. 
It is a sad thing to see. 
What do you say to them? 
The way to do it is to change the direction of the government.  
What would Reform do? 
We say attack the debt now. 
This is the year. 
We take that road that says ``Let's retire the debt. 
Let us start paying it down. 
Let us give our children some hope for that''. 
That is the kind of hope that people need. 
We will look after more of that ourselves.  
I see there are two members rising. 
We have five minutes. 
I am going to take a minute for each question.  
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I must congratulate the hon. member for Fraser Valley. 
He has a great turn of phrase with the word ``spendicitis''. 
In this current budget we are going to propose we have designated 50%- 
A minute is not a long time, is it. 
The hon. member for Fraser Valley.  
Mr. Speaker, I will try to answer in a minute.  
How has the budget been balanced? 
We have the highest income taxes in the land. 
Tax freedom day now is a full six months into the year. 
We have the highest taxes in the G-7. 
We have to thank the Canadian people for balancing- 
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member talks a lot about lowering taxes. 
I have a short question and a comment for him.  
It will benefit the rich. 
I am not playing politics here.  
Now, here is my question. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the question. 
I take it in the non-partisan way it was offered to me.  
What is the advantage to the wealthy? 
In a sense, the member is right. 
We say let's increase the personal exemption. 
We would eliminate 1.2 million from the tax rolls altogether. 
Let's cut them off. 
Let's not make them pay any taxes. 
They deserve to pay no tax whatsoever. 
Let those people have that money.  
Increase the spousal amount for those that are living together to raise a family. 
That is more for them.  
You have to offer the right kind of tax relief. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
I want to get right to the spending. 
He said the Liberal government has done an excellent job of getting it under control. 
They are the ones who did it. 
They are the ones who deserve the credit.  
The member talked about spending, that everything is under control. 
I have only been here four years. 
That is just one example.  
The one I am really intrigued with cost $116,000. 
Old guys like us must really be appreciative of that kind of committee. 
That is the kind of bragging the government ought to stand up and talk about.  
They do not deserve a pat on the back. 
He had received a raise. 
But guess who was getting more money? 
The taxes would be enough to help them live in their homes.  
I do not see how they can be happy about what is happening.  
Look at the prison guards. 
It means more taxes for the government. 
I wonder if they think about that.  
And how is this for priorities in the prisons? 
If he has an eye problem we supply him with glasses. 
Well good grief, they might even pay for a sex change. 
Let us do that for them. 
One of the inmates said to me ``You know, it is not bad in here. 
But they have nothing to celebrate. 
We have a balanced budget. 
Canadians had better soon see some relief. 
I am not a happy grandpa. 
I really fear for the future of my grandchildren. 
I wonder if anybody over there is listening and hearing what is being said. 
Under this government's policies they are not wrong. 
They are not far from wrong at all. 
Under our plan we want this shared. 
I am willing to share in the debt load. 
I am willing to pay my part. 
I am proud to be part of that. 
At least it is something which we on this side of the House could do.  
I applaud those over there who did and I condemn those who have not. 
I sure hope they pat themselves hard on the back over that one.  
Our generation will never be better off than the past generation''. 
They have no confidence whatsoever that can happen.  
Boy, the provinces have struggled. 
They are on the right track.  
That is the right track.  
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am on the Standing Committee on Finance. 
I hear an incredible mix from members of the Reform Party. 
They talk about the kind of tax measures they would like to see implemented. 
How could you balance the budget given those kinds of spiralling costs? 
Government has to get its priorities straight. 
It has to start considering what is actually taking place out there. 
Look at what we need to do for the people of this land.  
Not the average Joe. 
They have to spend a few hours a day earning an honest living.  
That is the problem. 
I know the hon. member was not referring to the Speaker. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
The shelters are stretched and bursting at the seams.  
Mr. Speaker, once again, just talk about one of the priorities alone. 
If they need it, that is going to happen. 
There is no doubt about it. 
Let us do what we can. 
That is a priority to me. 
Do not tax more to spend on programs. 
That is the whole point.  
These socialists do not believe that Canadians are capable of looking after themselves. 
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
This is absolutely untrue.  
A $600 billion debt. 
That is what they worked so hard to achieve.  
Oh, that is funny.  
That is exactly what we have achieved. 
We have done that.  
Let us look briefly at the achievements. 
In fact, we have exceeded them.  
We exceeded our own target on the timeframe of balancing the budget.  
In fact, we are now internally borrowing the money that we need. 
We are not borrowing internationally. 
I think that is a very good record.  
Let us take a look at interest rates. 
This is not an abstract achievement. 
That is a definite advantage for small business.  
That means lower deficits and lower interest rates.  
It saved our bacon.  
These are all in the private sector. 
Nearly nine out of ten of these jobs are full time.  
There is more good news. 
In other words, it is an upward march. 
Here is the type of evidence that backs up this outlook. 
Do not take my word here. 
Because of that dollar our exports are very competitive. 
Housing starts were up by 16% in 1997. 
Consumer confidence has reached its highest level in eight years.  
These are all very significant achievements but the real issue is what lies ahead. 
That is what we are talking about here today. 
That is absolutely wrong. 
This will not happen. 
It is a permanent feature of a successful society. 
I see five members rising but we have about 30 seconds. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
One poor child is just one too many. 
Poverty is more than just a lack of money. 
I said ``What are you doing?'' 
He said ``I'm hungry''.  
Do you know who they gave the crown to, Mr. Speaker? 
It was a senior citizen who came and cooked for those children. 
She became their nanny and they loved her so much.  
You see, it is so important. 
They have a difficult time to learn. 
It also represents less tax revenue to Canada. 
At the end of the day we all pay the price.  
Let us not forget that children are poor because their parents are poor. 
Now let me tell you what we can do to help.  
Food, as I have stated, clothes and rent cost more. 
To survive parents must make choices. 
They must make difficult choices. 
I must admit that some make the wrong choices.  
That was said by the current prime minister, and he was indeed right. 
Let us give our children a good start. 
I agree with him. 
I am hoping that everyone in this House does.  
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
I acknowledge and am proud that this government is now on sound economic footing. 
On the face of it the motion sounds plausible. 
This government has made and will make improvements to the child tax benefit. 
This is just one of many initiatives that this government has made. 
Canadians asked for strategic reinvestment in programs. 
The government is answering this request slowly and carefully. 
Have we done enough? 
Can we do more? 
Yes, we can and we will. 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to this motion. 
Therefore, their child tax benefit is actually reduced. 
The value of the family cannot be understated. 
The mothers and fathers are raising our next generation, our future Canadians. 
It is a critical institution. 
It is the foundation of our society.  
This is the people clamouring for more rights, the special interest group.  
We have had it for a number of years. 
We do not like to talk about discrimination in Canada. 
We think we are above that. 
Yet we have tolerated it for years when it comes to Canadian families.  
A number of studies have been conducted. 
We are very confident in our numbers. 
We would encourage that approach.  
We have other proposals. 
Without a doubt the Canadian family is part of the foundation of society. 
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
I believe this is a laudable goal. 
It is estimated that the cost would be about $850 million per year. 
This would have a major impact on the government's ability to restore fiscal balance.  
He stated ``We would like to double the funding when we have the means''.  
We believe in a society that is compassionate and cares for the less fortunate. 
The government has demonstrated that it is committed to this important issue. 
The proposed child benefit is a good way to do it.  
Yes, the government recognized the plight of those families that need support. 
The government has chosen to act, to demonstrate its commitment that this is a priority. 
This is a commitment. 
We will see our obligations to the end.  
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
I would first like to congratulate the member for Shefford on her fine initiative. 
Family policy and the fight against poverty are intertwined.  
It is rather surprising to see today that roles have changed. 
At the time, the Liberal Party was sharply opposed to selective measures. 
Might the Liberal party have had a change of heart, perhaps?  
Once again, might the Liberal party have had a change of heart, perhaps?  
Benefits are not increasing, but consumer prices are. 
Fine promises and rhetoric are not enough. 
We want to see concrete action.  
Actions speak louder than words. 
It that the Canada the Liberals want?  
The well-being of children goes beyond partisanship.  
I am going to tell the House. 
Ask them, however, what rising prices mean. 
This is not from me. 
It is taken from the Liberals' action plan.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
There was a projection that child poverty would be eradicated by the year 2000. 
In 1989, one child in eight was considered poor. 
Now the figure is one in four. 
Yet the principle is a simple one. 
First of all, families have the prime responsibility for raising their children. 
They must look after their development. 
They are our front line workers. 
However, as a government, we must give them support. 
We also share in the responsibility. 
Another conclusion, which my colleague mentioned, seems relevant. 
If children are poor, it is because their parents are. 
Naturally, the best solution would be job creation. 
This would be the best way to eliminate child poverty.  
A series of solutions implemented simultaneously might help. 
Inflation is nibbling away at the benefits of people for whom every dollar counts. 
I encourage all members of this House to do so as well.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
We of course are adamant in saying that children are probably universally poor. 
These children are poor because they are dependent on their parents. 
On the other hand in Canada we use varying definitions.  
Sometimes this is valid. 
Indeed we all know of families that are poor. 
We all know of children who are poor. 
We have encountered them. 
We were talking about it the other day. 
But I was really genuinely in a poor family. 
My dad started farming in 1935 in Saskatchewan. 
We raised a few chickens and a few animals and we were able to live.  
We never thought of ourselves as poor. 
The next week it went to another place and so on.  
By today's standards we were living in total abject poverty. 
Yet we never thought of ourselves as poor. 
I used drive around the House with that thing and push on it. 
That would be my horn, beep, beep. 
Those were our toys. 
There may have been a correlation there. 
My parents are now in their mid eighties and doing very well.  
We need to keep the idea of poverty in perspective. 
I really believe we need to help those who have genuine needs. 
None of us were very well off. 
There were about 25 of us. 
I am going to make that connection. 
Talk about shovelling wheat into the truck while the end-gate is open. 
Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
What else did we do? 
What does that mean in practical terms?  
It is a joint federal/provincial initiative. 
The national child benefit has three objectives. 
We have promised that.  
The hon. member opposite understands that. 
He has heard us say this time and time again. 
Selective memory, I suppose. 
You know, when in opposition, we oppose. 
Do you know why I can say that? 
Most certainly there were not many of them. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
We now rely on weather reports from as far away as Winnipeg. 
When will the cuts to weather services be stopped? 
The Environmental Protection Branch is also slated for further cuts. 
Who is the Liberal government trying to protect? 
One must consider the added insult that many Canadians share. 
Who is protecting the environment?  
The Plastimet story reminded every Canadian that accidents can happen. 
The health and safety of Canadians is being compromised.  
In my riding of Churchill River we experienced severe flooding last summer. 
It is hard to keep track. 
The deficit quotas must stop. 
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
The 1996 budget reductions are the result of program review two. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
It is an area of great interest to me and an ongoing concern. 
However, this is not good enough.  
Clearly this needs to be changed. 
This is unacceptable and it has to be changed.  
This is more so as we go into the globalized markets.  
Literacy skills are necessary to enable people to get meaningful employment. 
Will the parliamentary secretary commit to this very worthwhile undertaking?  
Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
I can offer what I think is an equally good answer for him.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
A motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.40 p.m.)
