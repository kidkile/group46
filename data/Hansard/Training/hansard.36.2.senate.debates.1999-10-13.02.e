The Honourable J. Bernard Boudreau, P.C. 
Tributes on Appointment to the Senate 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham :
That is the wonderful privilege of public service. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
This puts me in a quandary. 
Only time will tell.  
YWCA Week Without Violence 
On October 18, parents and children will learn how to avoid violent situations. 
October 19 is the day on which they will concentrate on making our schools safer. 
Wednesday, October 20 will be dedicated to confronting violence against women. 
Honourable senators, I encourage each and every one of you to become involved.  
Industrial Hemp-Obstacles in Exporting to the United States 
The U.S. market accounts for 95 per cent of Kenex's business. 
The shipment was accompanied by documentation verifying its sterilization and THC analysis. 
I hope to hear some good news for Canadian farmers very soon.  
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk:
You will note that this same question of privilege was raised in the last session. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
The delegation is hosted by our colleague the Honourable Senator Marcel Prud'homme, P.C. 
On behalf of all honourable senators, I wish you welcome to the Senate of Canada.  
Hon. Leonce Mercier, Chairman of the Committee of Selection, presented the following report: 
Wednesday, October 13, 1999 
The Committee of Selection has the honour to present its 
STANDING COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATION 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Hon. Leonce Mercier, Chairman of the Committee of Selection, presented the following report: 
Wednesday, October 13, 1999 
The Committee of Selection has the honour to present its 
STANDING COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Medical Decisions Facilitation Bill 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I move: 
That the committee hear, amongst others, the Minister of Transport; 
That the committee submit its final report no later than December 15, 1999. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I believe the Senate has a problem. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
This is only a notice.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I am in your hands, honourable senators. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
That the committee have the power to sit during sittings and adjournments of the Senate; 
That the committee submit its final report no later than November 18, 1999. 
Hon. Jean-Robert Gauthier :
Cape Breton Development Corporation 
I am a real nice guy, and the Honourable Senator Boudreau knows that.  
It is with respect to the Cape Breton Development Corporation, Devco.  
My question is with regard to the situation with the Phalen colliery. 
Otherwise, the mine will close and they will not have their pension rights.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I wish to thank the honourable senator for his question. 
That's right, and you always got the right answer.  
The honourable senator may find it more fun in his present position.  
We have both been familiar with the file for a considerable period of time. 
It is now going through a two-part process. 
Such a transition is never easy.  
With respect to the specific question, I will of course convey the concern. 
Honourable senators, I will not comment on the privatization. 
I have my own sentiments on that issue.  
The bumpy process has already started with Prince colliery. 
One project could be carried out, and it is quite simple.  
The Devco cleanup will cost about $150 million. 
That review is still ongoing. 
I certainly will be conveying your interest and your comments as well as my own.  
Nova Scotia-Responsibility for Cleanup of Toxic Waste Sites 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, I wish as well to extend my congratulations to the new leader. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I believe that request should be put to the Minister of National Defence. 
and "their disgraceful mismanagement of the fisheries issue."  
He went on to say: 
What did the government do to address these serious concerns? 
It dialled 911, Senator Bernie Boudreau. 
Well, let us start with Nova Scotia. 
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Discussions concerning highway infrastructure are currently underway with the Minister of Transport. 
I am encouraged by those comments. 
I certainly will be discussing the matter with the minister.  
Perhaps Mr. McKenna was making a dramatic point. 
Hopefully, we will have Mr. McKenna's support as we work toward our goals.  
With respect to the road in question, I am very familiar with it. 
I have driven it on many occasions. 
The honourable senator has identified one highway which should be addressed. 
Nova Scotia-Cleanup of Sidney Tar Ponds 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I thank the honourable senator for her question. 
I am quite familiar with the tar ponds in Sydney. 
In the past, there have been some attempts at remediation of the tar ponds. 
A great deal of money has been expended with questionable results.  
Those attempts have not gone very well either. 
It is a community-based approach. 
The problem with doing things this way is that it takes time. 
A substantial commitment has been made. 
Honourable senators, community consensus is a wonderful thing. 
It was the company which left the mess.  
Hon. J Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
The government complied with those demands. 
It would never be repeated today.  
We must never allow another such situation to be created.  
I thank him for that very helpful statement.  
Efficacy of Programs for Problems Faced by Farmers 
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
My question is in an area with which he is familiar. 
Nova Scotia farmers have suffered three years of drought. 
The program which the government brought forward has not dealt with this situation. 
Honourable senators, 70 per cent of nothing is nothing. 
Is the Leader of the Government aware of this? 
If so, what will he do about it?  
Farmers are here in Ottawa today, as they have been for the last three days. 
They are facing a crisis situation in Canada. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I thank the minister for that response. 
The problem is that the AIDA program has not been working. 
The farmer who has had three bad years in a row is in big trouble. 
The program will not trigger for him. 
Therein lies a major problem. 
This issue is of national concern. 
This country cannot afford to lose its farmers. 
The problem is so urgent that something must be done immediately.  
Farm groups have been trying to get through to the Prime Minister. 
They threw wheat in his face. 
However, he did come.  
Honourable senators, I would be happy to do that on behalf of Senator Gustafson.  
Leave having been given to revert to Government Notice of Motions: 
Hon. John B. Stewart :
Honourable senators, I give notice that tomorrow, Thursday, October 14, 1999, I shall move: 
Speech from the Throne 
Motion for Address in Reply-Debate Adjourned 
Hon. Richard H. Kroft , seconded by the Honourable Senator Furey, moved: 
MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY: 
These doors are marked "Enter", not "Exit". 
These doors will open to opportunity, not blank walls. 
First, there is the critical matter of geography. 
I live in the centre of Canada. 
That is not just a geographical oddity; it is a significant reality. 
We see the entire world as our natural market. 
Nothing could have better explained us to Canada and to the world.  
Hon. George J. Furey :
We are indeed at the dawn of a new millennium. 
Recent economic statistics tell us a lot about the direction our province is heading. 
There are two concerns in particular on which I wish to comment.  
The first is the problem of out-migration. 
They cannot do this without the right kind of educational support.  
I know those problems, honourable senators, and I know them firsthand. 
On motion of Senator Boudreau, debate adjourned.  
Leave having been given to revert to Government Notices of Motions: 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
My personal interest is simply operating on the principle of having greater surety. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
If I hear no contrary opinion, then I will recognize the Honourable Senator Andreychuk.  
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
For the sake of brevity, I need not reiterate what I have said. 
All the comments I intended to make, I made on September 14. 
I simply wish those to be included in this motion. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
However, I wonder if we might amend the motion a little. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Could we know why they did not strike that committee this morning? 
When can we expect the other committees to be struck?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I regret that I cannot answer that question. 
However, I see the Deputy Leader of the Government standing.  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I am not sure about whether or not the question is in order. 
It would be in order during Question Period, but let me volunteer an answer now. 
Meetings will begin as early as tomorrow on that subject. 
That is the answer, Senator Prud'homme.  
Referred to the Standing Committee on Privileges, Standing Rules and Orders 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Honourable senators, then I will move: 
The Hon. the Speake r:
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is it agreeable that we amend the motion to convey exactly that?  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
It is completely out of order. 
This they did, most promptly. 
They selected the members of two committees. 
I am not out of order with what I have just said. 
In its wisdom, it decided to nominate members for just two committees. 
Senator Hays is right, therefore, but so am I. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I am not going to determine who is right and who wrong. 
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
If His Honour so decides, then I would be prepared to move an appropriate motion.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Referred to Standing Committee on Privileges, Standing Rules and Orders 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I move: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow, Thursday, October 14, 1999, at 9:00 a.m.
