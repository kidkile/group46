EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 126 
Friday, September 25, 1998 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
SPECIAL IMPORT MEASURES ACT 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Two federal government departments and one independent tribunal are directly involved under SIMA. 
Canada has a long history in the use of trade remedies. 
In fact in 1904 Canada introduced the world's first anti-dumping legislation.  
However, the downstream economic interests cannot be ignored.  
Given this, SIMA must represent a balancing act. 
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
Why do I say unfortunate?  
It is certainly within the power of the Canadian government to do so. 
I am not an economist but I am very definitely a free trader. 
That is going to leave Canada open to the same kind of charges. 
Such charges are going to take time to investigate. 
This is a bad deal.  
I want to praise one important aspect in the legislation before us today. 
It is critical for the information to be protected. 
This is no longer the case. 
Is that a fair trade practice? 
I do not think so. 
The tree fruit growers tell me nothing is being done to help them. 
Should they blame the growers in the U.S.A. or should they blame Ottawa? 
I do not have too much doubt as to who they should be blaming.  
Let us take another example of the pinewood nematode. 
Does anybody here even know? 
Have my hon. colleagues seen a piece of legislation that I missed? 
Is the government responsible for setting fiscal policy? 
What is an unfair trade practice? 
Which is an injury to a Canadian business? 
When is a subsidy a subsidy and when is it not a subsidy? 
Is that a subsidy?  
Is that a form of a subsidy?  
I have to wonder about that.  
Canada still has great natural resource riches. 
We still have an educated and willing workforce. 
Is it a subsidy when an American company pays its employees in American dollars? 
Is it a subsidy? 
We train them, they get them.  
You bet it will.  
What will the Canadian International Trade Tribunal do about that problem? 
As an example, I was in a little town out of Lincoln, Oregon. 
I met with a couple of mayors from other communities. 
I have to wonder what is going on here.  
But free trade has to be fair trade.  
We have come to accept it. 
These students know there are no jobs out there for them. 
They want some form of security. 
And the government is not supplying it. 
We can bet on that. 
Students are sick and tired of being over-governed.  
It is with some concern that we will support Bill C-35. 
I will go back to what I said at the very beginning. 
I await that day.  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I note that we are vastly outnumbered by the people in the gallery. 
Perhaps a quorum call would get a few Liberals out of bed.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
We do have a quorum.  
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
This bill is therefore in response to the report. 
This is the intention behind Bill C-35. 
It contains marginal changes, which will nonetheless streamline the system.  
Some of these changes have been included in the report. 
A section on avoidance was also included in the report, at our request. 
The Bloc Quebecois succeeded in having major changes and improvements made. 
Let us go over the arguments put forward by the Canadian Steel Producers Association. 
It rejected that proposal, which is therefore not reflected in the bill.  
We feel that the definition of material harm also poses a problem. 
We want Revenue Canada to continue using the future method. 
Nevertheless, certain conditions were not accepted. 
The Bloc Quebecois will, however, support Bill C-35.  
He still has time to speak, if he so wishes. 
We will give him the floor then.  
The House will now proceed to statements by members.  
WATERLOO SAFE COMMUNITIES PROGRAM 
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
Waterloo was one of the first cities to get involved in the program in 1996. 
We now have 72 businesses that are members. 
He is a true Canadian hero.  
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the clock is quickly running out before the start of the new millennium. 
We can expect more of this.  
This is a ludicrous misconception.  
Time will not wait for any of us.  
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
This constitutes discrimination, abuse and injustice.  
It is now time for us to take action.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Middlesex, Lib.):
AUTUMN IN RENFREW-NIPISSING-PEMBROKE 
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
Our Canadian maple leaf is a symbol that has earned worldwide respect and admiration. 
Come to the valley and enjoy the vista.  
QUEBEC'S JOURNEES DE LA CULTURE 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
These special days will afford them an opportunity to integrate culture into their everyday lives.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the peaceful protesters gathered, charged with a fervent belief in democracy. 
The Prime Minister is concerned about what legacy he will leave Canada. 
Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. 
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
UNIVERSITY OF OTTAWA'S 150TH ANNIVERSARY 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Their message to us was very clear. 
They told us they are suffering at the hands of corruption and financial mismanagement. 
Reform will be their voice.  
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
His name is Jacques Parizeau.  
PRESIDENT OF SOUTH AFRICA 
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
You are a model of courage and tenacity for us all.  
MINISTER OF FISHERIES AND OCEANS 
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
I congratulate the minister for his leadership in conservation.  
1999 MARCH 21 ANTI-RACISM CAMPAIGN 
Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga Centre, Lib.):
The 1999 March 21 campaign is direct and hard hitting. 
The hon. member for Calgary East.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
The vast majority of Albertans want Senate reform and want it now. 
How does the Prime Minister respond to this plea for an elected Senate? 
This is Liberal democracy in action. 
The Prime Minister cannot stop the people's will. 
It is only a matter of time.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Public Complaints Commission has been in existence for some 12 years. 
The student protesters want to see the Public Complaints Commission look into this matter. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
We would have liked to have been, but we were not.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I ask the acting Prime Minister this question. 
The Hon. Deputy Prime Minister.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member talks about the government of the day. 
It was not this government. 
Let us see the commission start its work and get on with its work. 
If after its report is out- 
The hon. member for Langley-Abbotsford.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is another non-answer day in the House of Commons.  
Is that not the reason he was fired?  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Is this is what he is saying? 
Should it be somebody else who- 
The hon. member for Langley-Abbotsford.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we ask the questions here.  
This position is supposed to be politically independent. 
The official opposition and the Government of Ontario asked some questions. 
Is that not really the real reason why this individual was fired? 
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the issue is very simple. 
Any suggestion to the contrary has no foundation in fact''. 
That is the fact.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
This goes to show how open we plan to be with the commission.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, let's get serious. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
That is not correct.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Is he going to be fired?  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
We have had additional tax decreases. 
In the last budget we began the process- 
The hon. member for Brandon-Souris.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for having the secretary of state not have an answer.  
There is absolutely no question about it. 
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
This is a question of choice. 
We have chosen a balanced approach for paying down the debt- 
The hon. member for Wanuskewin.  
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
The truth of the matter is there was major political interference. 
Mr. Dussault objected to this political interference. 
Is this not the real reason why he was fired?  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
We would not interfere with that.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Management style is not the issue. 
The chief actuary is supposed to be independent. 
Finance officials wanted him to compromise that independence.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
At the same time, we decreased employment insurance contributions every year. 
We decreased them over four years, with a freeze the first year. 
Every 10 cents of contribution costs us in revenue more than- 
The hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
That is the same thing we had to do- 
But we had such a nice day yesterday. 
The hon. member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
A little too far. 
I ask the member to put his question right now. 
I asked the member to tone down his language. 
I will permit the secretary of state to answer if he wants. 
If not, I will go on.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I welcome this opportunity and other opportunities to clarify the situation.  
We took 400,000 low income Canadians totally off the income tax rolls. 
The hon. member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
How can they stand up and talk like that?  
My question is for the finance minister. 
Is it for his own political- 
The hon. member for Laval Centre.  
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is really a matter of choice- 
The secretary of state has the floor if he wishes to continue.  
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member is mistaken. 
She is really mistaken.  
The minister is one of the strongest and most respected individuals. 
He enjoys the confidence of all his colleagues and all Canadians.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
It belongs to the workers and employers of this country. 
Why does he not just obey the law?  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I guess it is a question of what one's political priorities are.  
We are prepared to say that a good health system is critical- 
The hon. member for Calgary Southeast.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, is this not interesting. 
The premier of Ontario calls it stealing. 
Every major business group in the country- 
Colleagues, I have appealed to you today. 
The language being used is not parliamentary. 
I would ask, with respect, the hon. member to withdraw the word ``stealing''. 
Would he do that?  
Mr. Speaker, I will withdraw the word.  
The premier of Ontario says that this is misappropriation.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we do follow the law.  
The member mentioned personal income taxes. 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
We all have the courage to ask questions and to answer them. 
I would ask the hon. member to please put her question.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Veterans Affairs.  
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
My question is for the Minister of Environment. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the government has committed itself to assisting the people of Cape Breton.  
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, a memorandum of agreement. 
We have been asking for action on this issue for five years. 
This government has used rhetoric. 
We want a plan and the people of Cape Breton want a plan. 
When will this action take place and in what form will it be?  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is wrong again.  
This government has been involved in this issue for a long time. 
We have been negotiating with the province and the local authorities. 
We want to clean up the site. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We have this surplus situation. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Our priority is to help workers return to the job market. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
The surplus must go to them.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a couple of things to say.  
First, we will follow the law. 
Second, as politicians we are called upon to make difficult choices. 
These are choices all of us are called upon to make. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
The law must be upheld. 
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
I would ask in future that be kept in mind.  
Mr. Bob Speller (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is about time we got this question.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Why does the Bloc Quebecois have a double standard?  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for raising this very important question.  
I can say that every meeting has been very helpful and very useful. 
This is something we continue to pursue. 
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Take the case of Brian Loman. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I will take it under advisement and I will report back on it.  
We have hired people. 
We are training them. 
We are trying to serve Canadians the best we can.  
COMMENTS DURING QUESTION PERIOD 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am here today to table several petitions. 
There were 94 individuals who signed this petition.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
I have two other petitions, Mr. Speaker. 
There were 333 individuals who signed these two petitions.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have another petition dealing with the pedophile registry. 
They consider the sexual abuse of our children or anyone in society to be intolerable. 
They are opposed to any early release of sexual offenders and Pedophiles. 
There were 147 petitioners who signed this petition.  
The last petition I have, Mr. Speaker, also deals with the convicted pedophile.  
There were 149 petitioners who signed this petition.  
SRI CHINMOY PEACE BLOSSOMS PROJECT

Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
SPECIAL IMPORT MEASURES ACT 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Our position is one of opposition to this bill. 
I do not know how many times we have to learn this lesson. 
Go ahead, hit us again. 
We are not against fair trade. 
The Liberals have become totally uncritical. 
They have just become completely uncritical. 
Many Canadians have a right to feel utterly betrayed. 
But not the Liberals.  
Well that just will not wash.  
Those are the words I used in the question. 
Is he that stupid or was he trying to avoid the question?  
The government's trade policy is fundamentally flawed. 
In doing so it has not been reflecting the values of Canadians.  
What is with you guys? 
They love to take advantage of our lack of environmental regulations. 
They like to take advantage of all those things. 
Why do you not get with it?''  
In fact we have been getting with it. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Both the Bloc and the Reform have written dissenting reports.  
It makes sure that we have a good two-way line of communication. 
This is to enhance procedural fairness and transparency. 
It is a very good proposal within Bill C-35.  
The minister indicated that this would be a 10 to 15 day process. 
That is not factual truth. 
That simply gets the complaint to the table. 
But what it does speak of is the fact that we need rules. 
Sometimes people break rules. 
What we need are rules. 
But I will not get into that particular area.  
It would be very nice if everybody followed the rules. 
We need to continue trade negotiations with our partners. 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Participation in international trade has provided many positive benefits for our country. 
However, we must also be vigilant. 
Trade disputes will inevitably occur. 
It is at the preliminary stage where the investigation is most important. 
Careful consideration must be given to all parties involved. 
Clearly the system is not perfect. 
Often we cannot predict all the consequences of a decision.  
Canada is intrinsically tied to the world economy. 
Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre-Rosedale, Lib.):
It is exactly the same problem.  
This government is suggesting we work through proper channels. 
We use our legal remedies. 
That was the position of the Reform Party in that. 
I suggest it should be its position today. 
What does the member think of that?  
There is nothing wrong with that.  
They are our important partners. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
I have mentioned all this because the bill is fairly complex. 
Passage of the proposed amendments will make these tools really effective. 
That is very important.  
The economy of British Columbia is in or near a recession. 
This will cause a problem because the rules and regulations are not laid out clearly. 
The Special Import Measures Act ensures fairness. 
About 90% of jobs in this country are created by small businesses. 
It is a good thing our Canadian firms have the means to lodge complaints.  
As the official opposition, we can support this bill if it is amended. 
We ask for one amendment only. 
It is up to the Liberals. 
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
It strikes me also that this is not an unusual problem.  
We can understand why that is. 
We see this in the trade, as the hon. member talks about.  
We are going day to day and year to year. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the question.  
He is right when he talks about the mess the government has created. 
The government is always focusing on the wrong thing. 
It is a very dynamic field we are talking about.  
These changes were to be brought in, which they have been. 
Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay-Boundary-Okanagan, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak on this today. 
Certain measures obviously have to be put into place. 
If it writes good legislation I will be the first to congratulate it. 
It would still be its legislation. 
The bottom line is to get good legislation.  
That is a glowing example for the government to look at. 
There are a lot of other examples out there.  
I would like to deal with one other aspect of this. 
We also have to look at and balance the other side of this. 
This is dealing with import, the Special Measures Import Act. 
It claims we had subsidized our forest industry. 
We would fight that one and we would win. 
Still the threats kept coming. 
I have gone to the softwood lumber division of foreign affairs. 
It is a big operation with three locations in my riding. 
It affects over 100 people.  
This is not the kind of balance we need. 
We have to start dealing with a little more strength. 
We have to start saying that there is a quid pro quo. 
That is not the way we should be working in this country. 
There should be an open fairness. 
The quote system does not provide that.  
That is very utopian. 
I am tired of that. 
They will say no because they never have in the past.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
I would like to ask him about it.  
This will take weeks and months before it is resolved. 
How does my colleague feel about that?  
Subtlety is a hallmark of Canadians. 
Make it absolutely clear. 
Do this to us and here are the consequences. 
It is consequence of action. 
Whenever something is done there will be a consequence for what is done.  
We talk about it in our own lives. 
Let us start talking about it with the Americans as well. 
Let us say ``Here is what we think is fair. 
We will not get carried away in doing it. 
But make sure they know we are going to do it. 
If we lay that out, do not back down when the time comes. 
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
As a nation we have been facing serious economic difficulties for a long time. 
They say first of all ``Your debt is way too high''. 
Second they say ``Your taxes are way too high''. 
It strikes me that here we are again in a situation. 
Is this just another example of that?  
It was something that they made up as they went along.  
This particular bill is not quite that bad. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We will conclude no later than 1.45 p.m. 
Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk-Brant, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, each of us deals with the problems that affect our own ridings. 
I do think we need to talk and work that out.  
The tough action we need to take needs to be planned out. 
Tough action is necessary for that but not just fast reaction to an individual instant. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I was going to seek clarification on that point. 
I thank the chief government whip.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on Bill C-35. 
This is an important bill. 
I would ask the government to please look into this.  
The first area which I alluded to yesterday was our high taxation rates. 
That is a significant difference. 
Some very interesting work has been done on surtaxes. 
What does that do to the most disadvantaged people in our country? 
This is very significant and something we cannot ignore.  
It also drives Canadian companies to other countries. 
We have had a massive brain drain. 
That is why a lot of companies are holding onto their assets. 
The corporate tax rate is a huge disincentive. 
The government should carefully look at removing those taxes. 
It would benefit the people who are most disadvantaged in our society. 
If companies cannot hire, people will be unemployed. 
We could also create strategic alliances. 
That situation can even occur across borders.  
Examples have been put forth by my colleagues with respect to baby food. 
Those things must be carefully looked at when dealing with international trade issues.  
Is the House ready for the question?  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
I declare the motion carried.  
(Bill read the second time and referred to a committee) 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The House resumed from May 5, 1998 consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
But the Canada student loans program has not been privatized.  
But these arrangements do not by any means constitute privatization. 
Government payments against loan guarantees would increase. 
The repayment schedule would be too long and accumulated interest payments would be too onerous.  
Once again the Government of Canada has already done that. 
Canada study grants, totalling $145 million, will be available in 1998-99.  
They are our future. 
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
We need a balance here.  
Hence the balance and hence both should be contributing.  
This NDP motion does not take seriously enough student responsibility in this. 
I will describe for members the Liberal approach and its effect on students. 
It is a downward spiral and we finally get to the bottom.  
They do nothing to prevent students from falling off the cliff of financial disaster. 
They merely attempt to cushion the impact when they do fall to the bottom. 
I reiterate the example of a student who gets a low paying job. 
Now he is attempting to make payments on his student loan. 
In the meantime he cannot make the payments. 
So he applies for interest relief. 
He jumps through that bureaucratic hoop to qualify. 
If problems persist he might qualify for a reduction in the loan principal. 
At that point they come in with these supposed solutions. 
But the patient at least is not yelling any more, at least for a while. 
In other words, people are the resource. 
People are what counts here. 
They are the most valuable resource we have.  
I think that should make my colleague from the NDP happy. 
It has been a privilege to speak with respect to this motion. 
BILL C-3-NOTICE OF TIME ALLOCATION 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
This goes right to the heart of the Quebec-Canada debate.  
As I said, this goes right to the heart of the Canada-Quebec dichotomy. 
It is efficient, inexpensive, fair and equitable.  
Finally, it always boils down to the same issue. 
That is what is called Quebec sovereignty.  
Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Middlesex, Lib.):
I will address her points individually.  
The first point is proposed changes to the Canada student loans program. 
The hon. member says the government should reverse the privatization of Canada student loans.  
That is hardly a radical concept.  
The result was a significant cost to the government.  
New arrangements were introduced in 1995. 
Under these new arrangements lenders assume responsibility for servicing and collecting the loans.  
This is a much more favourable arrangement for Canadian taxpayers.  
The hon. member may ask how the system is an improvement. 
Surely that is not what the hon. member wants.  
The government has signed contracts with lenders. 
For example, eligibility for interest relief is based on income. 
Where was the hon. member during the budget speech debate? 
Grants will average $3,000 a year.  
That is some record. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
The changes were designed to improve the way the plan operated, not to privatize it.  
This resulted in significant extra costs for the federal government under the original program design. 
The lenders and Ontario did not come to an agreement.  
The motion proposes the implementation of a federal student grant program. 
It could not be unilaterally imposed by the federal government. 
Thus we cannot support the motion for a number of reasons. 
First, the system has not been privatized as the motion implies. 
It is for these reasons that I ask that we oppose the motion.  
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
We want the government to listen to what they are saying. 
We must keep a close eye on the Liberal government. 
A number of surveys were carried out in 1997. 
The implications of this are staggering.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I am glad to join the debate on the motion.  
These are startling figures.  
The facts have changed. 
Our caucus is calling for free tuition. 
They simply could not get the wherewithal to go to school.  
They have increased by 700% since 1989. 
It is easy to see why. 
Over the last 10 years tuition fees have climbed by 240%. 
It is completely 180 degrees opposite from what most Canadians would embrace. 
Maybe we could say that the first degree would be free of charge to students. 
I would like to point to the example of the country of Ireland, my homeland. 
There is a real lesson to be learned there. 
I am a journeyman carpenter myself. 
I like to think of apprenticeship as legitimate post-secondary education. 
We know that the institutions are in crisis through lack of funding. 
They passed on that crisis to students. 
It is students who are now in a crisis. 
They need a remedy and they need some support. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. Morrison):
(The House adjourned at 2.45 p.m.)
