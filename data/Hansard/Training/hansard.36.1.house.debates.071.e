Members sang the national anthem ] 
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S WEEK 
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
The theme for this year's celebration is:
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
The first one was to demand lower taxes. 
They expect the national debt to be paid off.  
Third, the people of central Alberta demand an elected Senate. 
Finally, the people of the Red Deer constituency are proud Canadians. 
CANADA-FRANCE INTERPARLIAMENTARY ASSOCIATION 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
Nine of our parliamentarians from both Houses attended this meeting.  
The hon. member for Jonquiere. 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Liberals saw the light. 
Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre-Rosedale, Lib.):
INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH ASSISTANCE PROGRAM 
Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
The hon. member for Kelowna.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Mr. Fitzpatrick is a very successful businessman. 
He has been a friend of the Prime Minister for many years. 
They are golfing buddies. 
They are political buddies. 
The Prime Minister comes to Kelowna and stays at his friend's house.  
Mr. Fitzpatrick was not elected. 
Enough of such patronage.  
Mr. Ian Murray (Lanark-Carleton, Lib.):
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
Since then, it has ridden roughshod over the principles of 1848. 
It seeks to deny the very existence of the Quebec people. 
For this reason, we shall not be participating today in this commemoration of 1848.  
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
We also stabilized funding for the networks of centres of excellence.  
In the budget just a few weeks ago we increased funding to the granting councils. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, today marks the 150th anniversary of responsible government in Canada. 
Who were Robert Baldwin and Louis Lafontaine? 
No, they were the leaders of the Reform Parties of Upper and Lower Canada.  
Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard-La Prairie, Lib.):
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Canadians do not believe they are getting straight answers.  
So far Dr. Kos and his fellow citizens have come up empty handed.  
They do not have any answers.  
This kind of stonewalling is not an isolated occurrence. 
It is occurring in other jurisdictions as well.  
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
I have received almost 1,000 letters from people from the affected area. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Now the auditor general has confirmed those suspicions. 
What is the government trying to hide?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That is what we have done in this particular case.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):
The auditor general says the Prime Minister is breaking the government's own accounting rules. 
This is the third time he has said it. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this explanation does not wash with the auditor general. 
He says the government is guilty of ``serious breaches'' of accounting rules. 
Is that not the real reason?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
That is a fact. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
What does the Reform Party have against transparency?  
The fact is that accounting principles evolve. 
We are with the private sector. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
The surplus belongs to them. 
They want tax relief.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, finally the truth comes out. 
They are against 100,000 Canadian students getting $3,000 a year. 
That is what they are against. 
They are against recognizing that jobs come from education. 
That is what they are against. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Right now, the criteria are consistent with Treasury Board requirements. 
She should know, because it says so in her own documents.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
The meeting just ended yesterday. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
That is exactly what the government is committed to do.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
A lengthy and costly court case is not in any party's interest.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We remain committed to just that process.  
I have been working toward that result. 
The hon. member for Saint John.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
This is exactly what the victims are saying. 
Where is the leadership on the other side? 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, picture this. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Ms. Olafson has been betrayed. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
We have nothing to hide. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
That is what we had to do.  
How does she explain that?  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
In the matter of Bruce Starlight- 
The hon. member for Skeena. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
We are taking action against the seven recommendations that he made. 
Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.  
In Saskatchewan, for example, 43% of their funding was cut. 
Preparations are under way for renewal of these agreements with the francophone communities outside Quebec. 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):
Or does she only have energy for flags?  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the problems in Kosovo have been escalating daily. 
The minister's answer to that is that we should impose some sanctions. 
We know that sanctions will not work in the short term.  
Does this minister not have any other ideas that will stop the killings in Kosovo?  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am always glad to share information with the hon. member. 
Already we have had some responses.  
President Milosevic has offered to meet with groups of Albanians in Kosovo. 
We are taking very tough and very direct action.  
The hon. member for Red Deer.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we have been there since 1991. 
Sanctions are just not going to be enough.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we made those exact points.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
The Hon. Minister of Health.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Natural Resources.  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
He raped and murdered that little girl.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Why has she dragged her feet so long on this issue?  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
He has failed to produce one single audit to substantiate this claim.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the research behind the statement before the question is wrong. 
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Cash for silence in Halifax.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I want to correct the health minister. 
In 1991 the government did act unilaterally to compensate the HIV victims. 
He is wrong on that.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
If we can do that I shall be very happy. 
That is my objective.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
That will remain our priority. 
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.  
Today marks an important milestone in the history of Canada. 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question.  
It was indeed a very important point. 
The capital of the united province, or Province of Canada, was Montreal in 1848. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
My question is for the justice minister. 
My question to the minister is simple. 
What is taking so long?  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
I am going to take the time required to consult the people most concerned.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health.  
There are 50,000 people living with HIV or AIDS in Canada. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Last week in Vancouver I met several persons concerned by this issue. 
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development Canada.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I know she presented her case at that time. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
I am so disappointed in this Liberal government''.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
That has been our objective.  
We could have acted by ourselves but we chose not to. 
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
Between 1991 and 1995 there were 502 work related fatalities on the farm. 
Of those, 10% were children.  
Hon. Gilbert Normand (Secretary of State (Agriculture and Agri-Food)(Fisheries and Oceans), Lib.):
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
He has also said he is in favour of an elected Senate.  
This year Albertans will be electing representatives to fill the Senate vacancies. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Otherwise there will be 6 senators from Alberta and 30 from the maritimes forever. 
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the minister responsible for regional development.  
If so, let them give the go-ahead as quickly as possible.  
Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.):
It helps regions take advantage of the era of globalization.  
We will, however, be following developments closely.  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
Is there unanimous consent?  
There is not consent.  
Laurier was our first French speaking prime minister. 
CONSTITUTION ACT, 1997 (REPRESENTATION) 
The bill is seconded by my colleague, the hon. member for Victoria-Haliburton.  
Obviously redistribution would still occur but within that cap. 
Clearly that is not an acceptable number of MPs. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Reginald Belair (Timmins-James Bay, Lib.):
Mr. Reginald Belair (Timmins-James Bay, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions to present today.  
The first petition deals with public nudity.  
Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton, Lib.):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS COMPENSATION FUND 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. Nunziata):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. Nunziata):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. Nunziata):
That is not an appropriate point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. Nunziata):
When shall the bill be read the third time? 
Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
For too long Ottawa has been making decisions for Whitehorse and for Yukoners. 
For several years now, Yukon has drawn certain advantages from the transfer of responsibilities. 
Natural resources lie at the very heart of the Yukon economy. 
Canada will, however, maintain jurisdiction over offshore areas.  
The bill has also the support of the industry. 
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
The bill goes part way toward achieving its objectives but unfortunately not all the way.  
Why then would the government withhold that same negotiating power from the Yukon government? 
This provision also hinders future oil and gas exploration development. 
However, there are concerns regarding the sharing of resource revenues with the federal government. 
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
If the House will permit me, I want to digress a little to begin with. 
I promised myself that I would respond to that allegation the next time I spoke. 
We are, of course, talking about control of oil and gas resources. 
These are new legislative powers that are being given to the Yukon. 
In fact, it is 5,000 kilometres from here. 
However, the wildlife roaming the continent does not necessarily respect borders. 
It must be remembered that natives attach great importance to this. 
To the east are the Northwest Territories. 
These are all Northwest Territories regions located in the Mackenzie Valley. 
I have been to British Columbia several times. 
There were also disadvantages. 
Everyone knows about the Klondike gold rush. 
At the time, their landscape was totally changed, along with the lives of these people. 
Their hunting and fishing traditions were greatly affected. 
I met the people of these 14 aboriginal nations in Dawson City. 
I also met them in Whitehorse. 
These are not rich people. 
Let me remind the House of the social contract we had at the time. 
We will take care of you''. 
People often question this social contract. 
Nowadays, it is important to keep on reminding people of that. 
It is part of the social contract we negotiated at the time. 
I want to give you an overview of the progress in negotiations. 
I highlighted the negotiations carried out so far. 
Several communities have signed a deal. 
I think it is important to give the House an update.  
That is not long ago. 
It is the last community that got such an agreement.  
Negotiations with the Dena council of Ross River are at a preliminary stage. 
This is in a mineral rich part of southern Yukon. 
That may be the reason why negotiations are taking a little longer.  
Agreements have been signed on a number of claims. 
So we are getting near a final agreement in this case as well.  
Therefore, we can assume that a final agreement will be reached in the coming months.  
This particular community wants out. 
We still have not reached final agreements with these groups. 
I felt it was important to give a progress report.  
We are rather opposed to centralization. 
Why are we not opposed to this bill? 
We like to see the devolution of powers to the regions and the provinces.  
The political scene in the Yukon has also changed. 
This issue has been partly settled. 
So the bill contains a provision that deals with our concerns.  
That is one clause. 
We in committee fulfilled our mandate. 
We asked for adjustments and these adjustments were made. 
Public officials came and explained the impact of the clauses to our satisfaction. 
And, when consulted, aboriginal people said they too were satisfied.  
In conclusion, as my colleagues mentioned, who supports this bill? 
I spoke at length about this.  
Everyone should benefit from the small bill before the House today. 
Consultations seem to show that will be the case.  
I would like to reassure them. 
I will say a few words in Gwitch'in. 
I will give you the translation. 
For now, I will not speak of the meaning. 
I will speak in Gwitch'in, and after I will tell you what it means. 
Rest assured, I will say nothing nasty. 
Everybody will be happy.  
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
It is the 100th anniversary of the creation of Yukon, which was in 1898. 
Yukon was originally designated as a postal region. 
After the gold rush we were worthy enough to become a territory.  
This legislation does what it ought to do. 
It puts power where it belongs, with the people of Yukon.  
Although it is very close, it is not done yet.  
The composition of our territory is reflected in the government. 
All of the 14 do not belong but most of them do. 
They are a very integral part of everyday life. 
They are represented in all our levels of government. 
That will make the people of Yukon far more responsible for their own well-being.  
In effect this will end a century of colonialism in Yukon.  
As I said, in 1898 a separate territory was created. 
It had a commissioner who was all powerful. 
Again, this was a huge change because the commissioner was always appointed.  
Devolution is an issue of fundamental importance for Yukon people. 
It is an essential part of aboriginal self-determination.  
Devolution opens new opportunities of economic development for Yukoners. 
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
I wonder if the member would respond to those two issues.  
This agreement was arrived at by the parties involved. 
On having the power taken away, again that is part of being a territory. 
All first nations groups should know that they can negotiate without pressure their agreements. 
It will not have the jurisdiction or the power of other provinces. 
Madam Speaker, when Yukon becomes a province all of this would be renegotiated. 
It cannot be forced on anybody. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
I feel it represents a step in the right direction. 
I will speak in more detail on this matter later.  
This is explicitly removed from the development in Bill C-8.  
It will be imperative for the federal government to honour this commitment to the Inuvialuit.  
This is a bill the Progressive Conservatives started and we continue to support it. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
Therefore Bill C-8 is important for the economic future of the Yukon Territory.  
The Reform Party supports them in this effort.  
That seems somewhat counterproductive. 
How anxious would they be to make an investment there? 
They want guarantees of stability when they make investments.  
On that note I would like to reiterate the Reform Party's commitment to equality. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
MACKENZIE VALLEY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ACT 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
When shall the bill be read the third time? 
Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Resource industries also made a big contribution to the proposed bill. 
It simply will not work.  
Clearly the time to act is now.  
It is based on existing regulations, with which industry is familiar.  
A state of the art framework that is second to none in the world. 
They are words of pride, hope and confidence.  
It deserves the same level of support from this House.  
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
It was a mighty train wreck. 
The investigator asked him what he had thought about. 
Therefore it really is not all that it seems to be.  
We were not really asking for a great deal. 
Could it be any more simple and could it be any more bureaucratic?  
This is a democracy. 
Everyone here knows what I am referring to. 
A supreme example of patronage in this country is the Senate.  
We just saw that happen.  
Who gets there and what has been the result? 
It must be quite something. 
Why do we allow it to go on? 
That is what I would like to know. 
Will the members the minister appoints to the board fit into specific categories of people? 
It seems they would either have to be natives or government officials.  
What about the other residents of the Mackenzie Valley? 
Will they not have a say? 
We are not opposed to the goals of this legislation. 
We do need to protect the environment. 
It is just that this is such an awkward way to try to achieve it. 
It was not a land and water management act. 
That is why there is such a concern.  
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
That bill concerned comprehensive land claims. 
Today we have a bill that arises out of those agreements. 
Let me say a few words about how the boards will operate. 
I think that my colleague from Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot totally agrees. 
It must involve funding, because money is really important. 
Both regions are part of the District of Mackenzie. 
That is an expression of trust in the first nations. 
There will be certain problems in the bill. 
There is a problem I can describe right away. 
That is where the problem lies. 
This is a rather odd approach, which we oppose.  
Unfortunately, the government majority did not support us. 
I just wanted to describe the dynamics of the problem.  
I will now deal with the issue of boards. 
Earlier, I mentioned the Land Use Planning Board. 
I will now talk about the Land and Water Board. 
It will consist of 17 members. 
Here is the problem. 
I mentioned earlier the huge environmental problems experienced by the Yukon Territory. 
The same is true for the Northwest Territories. 
These are all things that were disrupted. 
That should not be its mandate''.  
Earlier, I mentioned devastated landscapes. 
Periodic, independent environmental assessments will be done and made public. 
This board was created under the present legislation. 
It is a major system in the Northwest Territories. 
Everybody talks about the Mackenzie Valley. 
What are the geographical borders of this area? 
The Northwest Territories are no different. 
They also have a very rich native culture. 
Natives were undoubtedly the first inhabitants of that area. 
These peoples have been living there since time immemorial. 
It is important not to ignore them in our discussions.  
There are four regions:
Quebec is in a much better position than the rest of Canada in this regard. 
Quebeckers are very proud of their record with regard to aboriginal nations. 
I will now get back to my description of the Mackenzie. 
To the east is Nunavut, which I talked about earlier. 
All these towns are former trading posts. 
Back then, oil was not what it has become today. 
People used snowshoes and canoes.  
The fur trade was the reason people went up there. 
All these towns developed because of the fur trade. 
This is a history rich region. 
That is not so long ago.  
At the mouth of two rivers, there was probably an abundance of fish and game. 
In 1919 Imperial Oil made a very big oil strike in this oil-rich area. 
The city, with its economy centred on oil, is gaining in importance.  
Norman Wells is located on the Canol pipeline. 
In the end, they did not benefit from this wealth.  
In our opinion, the land belongs to us. 
It must be staked out, and it belongs to us.  
The native philosophy is quite different. 
For them, it was quite normal to share the territory. 
We also have very little information about their culture. 
Anthropologists have not examined these issues very much. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my allotted time I would like to speak to three basic points or principles.  
But there is one slight shift. 
It is not a radical idea. 
Yet this bill affects only specialty channels. 
These channels are simply diversionary entertainment. 
They are of no consequence to anyone, cultural or otherwise.  
Once again the consumer is forced to pay. 
Eight months later the cable industry is back to its old tricks.  
It is evident the CRTC has no policy on this. 
What does the CRTC do in this instance? 
This is clearly ridiculous. 
We have set up this body to protect Canadians.  
Clearly she is out of touch. 
They are the victims in this case.  
The time is now. 
I would therefore seek the unanimous consent of this House for the following motion. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
I would like to read the news release: 
MPs urged to support negative option bill.  
Negative reaction marketing has developed with the introduction of new specialty channels. 
The news release goes on.  
The Canadian public should really understand this.  
I said that this was a learning experience and it truly was. 
All sorts of things took place between the first and second reading stages. 
Therefore the heritage minister was faced with a problem. 
She started some arm twisting. 
My office followed the procedure. 
She thereby had an excuse not to come to the House. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
I do not think that is proper.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Why is it a necessary piece of legislation? 
There is a monopoly for cable. 
It is opening up, but it is opening up very slowly. 
We do not live in a perfect world. 
I have already described that the cable companies do not have true competition. 
I just do not understand what is going on here. 
Why do we have a government- 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
I would ask that you call him to order, please, Madam Speaker. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Madam Speaker, as Shakespeare said, she doth protest too much.  
Madam Speaker, on a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I remind all members to please act accordingly.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
In Quebec, the situation was different. 
These services would therefore no longer make money for cable companies and would rapidly disappear.  
Unfortunately, current technology does not yet allow cable companies to provide that option. 
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
It is only to be expected that consumers would respond in this way.  
I think, on the whole, Canadian consumers have lined up in favour of the legislation. 
They are in favour of protecting consumers and putting consumers first.  
We heard the Bloc Quebecois speak today against the interests of Canadian consumers. 
I think that is fairly clear.  
There is not unanimous consent.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in favour of Bill C-288. 
Unfortunately, this bill is not a votable item.  
That does not sound like a very good deal for the consumer. 
I reiterate my support for this bill. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues to protect the rights of consumers.  
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
When broadcasting started only radio existed. 
Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):
It is now amended and is here, yet the member refuses to recognize that. 
She denies that that occurred.  
I was called to do several interviews on this topic. 
Is this the new life of the Bloc?  
Canadians are tired of this arbitrary treatment. 
This includes the consumers associations in that province.  
That being noted, I would like to move another motion in conclusion. 
I seek unanimous consent to move the following motion: 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that you seek unanimous consent on that point.  
Does the hon. member have unanimous consent to propose this motion to the House?  
There is no consent.  
The time provided for the consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
The order is dropped from the order paper.  
Is it agreed that we call it 6.30 p.m.?  
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
He must and he should and I hope he will act.  
It is worse than that. 
The contract is not completed yet. 
It does not expire until the end of March. 
The highway is not finished. 
It is not complicated. 
The province agreed to put $16.2 million into this highway. 
It has not put in one red cent.  
Why is New Brunswick being forced to take this treatment?  
Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
The overall agreement is for 50 years.  
I am sorry to advise the parliamentary secretary that his time has expired.  
SABLE ISLAND NATURAL GAS 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
This is one way to develop our region and create jobs there. 
People want to work. 
If we had the natural gas pipeline, it would create further opportunities for us. 
We must see it this way. 
Once again, the northern part of the province will not have the opportunity to grow.  
And that is one way to invest. 
The same goes for other areas, like western New Brunswick. 
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member. 
The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Resources.  
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
I think that was the tone and tenor of the question.  
I wonder if the member opposite participated in the discussions at that time. 
I think that actually there was a certain absence of the member at that session. 
I appreciate his raising the comments in the House this evening. 
The hon. member for Halifax West.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
There must be sincere commitment evidenced by concrete positive action.  
These two issues are fundamental to the concept of self-government.  
Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
This was confirmed in the report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples. 
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
They now stand at $5.90, or 40 cents more. 
This is of great concern.  
And yet, as elected representatives, we will not have a say.  
Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
There has never been any government that has reduced premiums every year for four years.  
I will give another statistic. 
We will make sure there is a surplus- 
(The House adjourned at 6.48 p.m.)
