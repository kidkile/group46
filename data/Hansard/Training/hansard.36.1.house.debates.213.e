GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Eglinton-Lawrence, Lib.):
CANADA FOOD SAFETY AND INSPECTION ACT 
Now is the time to act.  
AWARDING OF THE ORGAN DONATION MEDAL ACT 
As a parliament and as a society we can take steps to change this.  
This bill would help those people.  
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Svend J. Robinson:
Moving concurrence in that report today is timely. 
We are literally on the eve of the 50th anniversary of NATO's founding. 
There will be a major NATO summit meeting in Washington, D.C. tomorrow.  
However, that is a debate for another occasion.  
To this day we do not know what the government's position is.  
There again the government has failed to respond positively. 
I urge the government to respond positively to that request.  
Just what are NATO's objectives in these air strikes?  
Initially we were told that it was military targets. 
We know now that the bombing has expanded far beyond that. 
What does Canada have to say about that? 
What about the refugees within Kosovo? 
In the meantime what does Canada have to say? 
Where is Canada's leadership? 
There is silence here as well.  
Indeed the Russian special envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin, is in Belgrade now. 
It must be a UN led peacekeeping force. 
Canada cannot simply blindly continue to follow. 
We have an opportunity tomorrow at the NATO summit to show leadership. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
A lot of questions were raised. 
So much of it seemed to me to deal with an idyllic world. 
I would like the member to address that.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The first part of the question is relevant.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson:
It is not a particularly revolutionary concept.  
Some of us on the committee wanted to go further. 
That is absolutely unbelievable. 
That is the position of the Reform Party. 
That is the position of the member. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Surely that is something this parliament should have had an opportunity to address itself to. 
Are we a banana republic run by order in council and executive committee? 
Yet here in Canada we just read about it in the Gazette .  
The same thing is happening with respect to a number of issues on this. 
We have never had that kind of debate.  
What about the question of MOX? 
There is a lot to be debated here. 
I would hope that the government will seize this opportunity. 
We do not get to vote. 
We could vote on concurrence in this committee report. 
This reminds me of of what we did at APEC. 
It might, but we do not know yet. 
Mr. Gerard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):
He has a lot of experience in the House of Commons.  
If that is the case, it is a bit worrisome.  
Are civilians going to be called on to meet NATO's standards?  
In closing, I want to ask the member a question. 
They are all on the team. 
In this case, are we going to seek a diplomatic solution? 
We know that Canada cannot be the captain. 
We know who the captain is. 
Mr. Gar Knutson (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am happy to join the debate. 
That the House do now proceed to orders of the day.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I declare the motion carried.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I do not think that will be necessary.  
PUBLIC SECTOR PENSION INVESTMENT BOARD 
These amendments are critical to the survival of these plans as we know them.  
Not only will these benefits be fully guaranteed and maintained, they will even be improved.  
The government does not think so. 
At present, contributions are used only to purchase government savings bonds. 
This should be of the utmost interest to our employees. 
Bill C-78 is part of an overall plan. 
The applicable criteria will be the same as for common-law spouses.  
These provisions would also apply to members' pensions. 
The value of past service for pension purposes will be totally protected. 
Canada Post could set up an independent investment office to oversee investments. 
These plans have not been privatized, nor will they be.  
The time to act is long overdue. 
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
I listened to the minister's comments with some interest. 
I will talk about that a bit later.  
In the balance of priorities it falls short. 
Would the advice they offer be accepted or rejected? 
What influence would they really have? 
Is this mere window dressing?  
This is again on the plus side. 
The convoluted wording and the ambiguity in the bill in this respect is unacceptable. 
There has also been a significant amount of press coverage on this issue. 
I recently read Paul Polango's book, The Last Guardians:
It is estimated that the surplus for this pension plan hovers at about $30 billion. 
The money should be theirs, they say. 
They are calling what the Liberal government is doing legalized robbery. 
The unions are supportive of their members paying their fair share of pension contributions. 
These changes will bring it more in line with other pension plans. 
These are all described in considerable detail in the bill.  
I am hoping that I am being a bit cynical. 
The auditor of the funds could be removed at any time by the board. 
The bylaws are to be made public and are available at the board office. 
Why is the government so afraid of public scrutiny? 
What is being hidden?  
What is intended to be kept from public scrutiny? 
This secrecy is very disturbing. 
This does not ensure us that the board members are totally accountable. 
The Reform Party of Canada is opposing the bill. 
Such secrecy is not acceptable.  
These are changes that I believe need to be made.  
I would, therefore, like to move a motion at this time. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the amendment is in order.  
Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert, BQ):
I am asking the ministers to listen carefully. 
The letter to which I am referring begins like this: 
The government wants to plunder my pension fund.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Madam Speaker, I will continue quoting from the letter nonetheless: 
I have always been proud to work in the public service.  
Personally, I think this pride has definitely taken a beating recently. 
What does the writer conclude?  
We are still the victims of political ambition.  
The Minister of Finance wants to become Prime Minister.  
The writer then says the following about the Minister of Finance: 
He wants to make a name for himself as the one who lowered the debt.  
The government should listen to this message. 
We cannot do otherwise than to agree with this. 
The author of this letter adds: 
I wonder: is this prophetic? 
Tell these arrogant characters to keep their hands off my pension fund.  
I will repeat this message, so that everyone will understand it clearly: 
Tell these arrogant characters to keep their hands off my pension fund.  
Should everything in this bill be pitched? 
No. It even contains some good ideas and some good initiatives.  
There will be an independent fund with real money in it.  
Let us see who the other members of the committee are. 
These surpluses are estimated at more than $30 billion. 
But the government is wrong. 
The minister responsible for the public service is wrong. 
This is absolutely not true.  
Now, these employees are being relieved of their fund.  
The government should be careful, because it is sending two negative messages to society. 
First, it is telling the public that it does not believe in fairness. 
it could use its employees' pension fund. 
A company might wish to eliminate a recent deficit. 
It could dip into its employees' pension fund. 
The new fund would thus have start-up capital. 
The pension fund will be hard put to keep up. 
Transferring the current surplus would seem appropriate to fill this role. 
And, most importantly, stop governing autocratically''.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
They do not stay at home and grumble. 
They get on their feet, come out and vote at voting time. 
Today seniors organizations are on the hill. 
I did not finish the list. 
They should think twice.  
But the talks were not going that badly. 
Progress was being made. 
Obviously the representatives of the pensioners were pleased about that.  
The representatives of the pensioners were quite yielding in their arguments. 
They are deferred wages. 
It is our money, speaking on behalf of working people.  
The representatives of the employees at the table were willing to move on that. 
I have heard figures. 
That is where the impasse arose with the $30 billion. 
There was no hint of increasing benefits to the retirees.  
There are more women in that beneficiary group than there are men. 
Bill C-78 is a history of failures. 
Les Barnes, a former PIPS leader, wrote a letter to the editor. 
The government did not want it to be dealt with at the bargaining table. 
Okay, it was a deal. 
It was an arrangement, a pact, a contract. 
The minister made a very good and revealing speech. 
You are darn right it is part of an overall plan. 
It is a plan all right.  
My mom is one of those senior citizen women. 
The government will be stealing pencils from blind men's cups. 
Those were some very good high interest years. 
Really, it is an abrogation. 
The recognition of same sex couples we applaud fully. 
It has been rolled in there to make it very difficult. 
The problem lies in the attitude of senior officials and the minister himself. 
Plain and simple, we are that diametrically opposed. 
That is what the whole purpose of a pension plan is. 
He puts it very well in one simple paragraph: 
Really, there is very little downside risk.  
In a gambling hall that would be a very safe bet to undertake.  
That is really the issue. 
That is what is going to fire up the country. 
It is only just beginning. 
This is day one of what will prove to be a very long debate. 
We are talking about a huge amount of money. 
We should put some of the facts on the record. 
We should think about how we arrived at such huge surpluses. 
The government did some very obvious things which led to very predictable consequences. 
The government froze people's wages for seven years. 
It is kind of a double whammy, and even more so for women. 
There has also been a lower than expected rate of inflation. 
Most people go into the public sector for a couple of reasons. 
They are willing to accept lower wages because they trade it off for job security. 
The sword of Damocles is hanging over their heads every minute. 
Job security is out the window. 
Let us face it, everybody is afraid for their jobs.  
Public servants are still plugging along. 
They are falling way behind the private sector. 
Not only do they not have job security, what are they making? 
A carpenter makes eight bucks an hour less than an outside carpenter. 
That is not bull. 
That was the difference.  
Nine thousand dollars a year for 20 years of service. 
That is not a pretty good pension plan.  
It is no wonder there is poor morale in the public sector. 
The government is pushing people too far. 
I raised the gender issue once before. 
This is very much a gender issue. 
In the public sector there are a lot of clerical-type jobs.  
We think it is ours. 
Obviously the minister thinks the opposite. 
Let us look at why we would argue that it is ours.  
Clearly that contemplates that it is the employees' money. 
It clearly uses the pension plan as part of the wage package. 
Consider CUPE Local 1000 v Ontario Hydro. 
It is there on the books and people should be looking at it.  
That is some of the more obvious jurisprudence. 
It is part of the wage package. 
It is deferred wages for the employees' use and their use only.  
Does the hon. member think it should be shared risk? 
There can be no other consideration than to maximize the profits of the investment.  
There could be any number of purposes. 
The shared risk or responsibility dialogue was taking place at the same time. 
Premiums will go up. 
In the near future we will not see deficits, but rather humongous surpluses.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened with great intent to the member opposite. 
He knows, or he should know full well, that these pensions are guaranteed.  
They can mobilize well and they can vote. 
That is what I was pointing out. 
That is their fiduciary responsibility.  
Frankly, the ethical investment funds are doing very well.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
This continues and in fact has been expedited by the government. 
It is a common characteristic of every initiative undertaken by members of the government. 
We are given lots of responsibility in many ways but really no authority. 
It is a temptation the Liberals welcome. 
As I mentioned, the government has an insatiable appetite for money. 
It has a questionable approach to financial and bookkeeping practices. 
The question is one of what is right, what is correct, from an ethical perspective. 
That is clearly fair.  
There are some improved benefits. 
I would suggest that with the government arm's length relationships have very short arms.  
That is a very significant concern to Canadians. 
This is the perfect time for the government to take this step. 
It can be phased in over a period of time.  
I have some concerns about that.  
They were not designed to provide slush funds for governing parties. 
We are not arguing with its legal ability to do this. 
We are arguing with the ethics of doing it. 
We look forward to debating this issue over the next few weeks. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
That, again, was during the tenure of the member's party. 
We have that guarantee for them in place.  
I thought I heard him say that. 
What does he have against investments in Canada? 
I would be interested in his comments.  
I guess the member did not hear what I was saying. 
Wealth is a relative thing.  
At that time, that represented 9% of GDP. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
The debate is all about who owns the money. 
Whose $30 million is it? 
That is a lot of money.  
Exactly where does the member stand on who gets the money? 
Does it all belong to the unions? 
Is there a split somewhere? 
What is his view on this?  
There was a small improvement in benefits in this legislation. 
The correct answer frankly is some combination of what he has suggested. 
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
But what does integrated mean?  
To this point I have discussed only employee contribution rates. 
More recently that distribution has shifted rather dramatically. 
Now they will have to pay for them like the rest of us.  
Fortunately the CPP rate is scheduled to stabilize in the year 2004. 
Will they rise in 2004 after being frozen for four years? 
Possibly, but not necessarily.  
The employer would continue to assume the larger share.  
However, any necessary increases would be gradual. 
The member is about halfway through. 
He still has some time and we will return to him right after question period. 
We will now go to Statements by Members.  
Mr. Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough-Agincourt, Lib.):
They believe that only through diplomatic effort can true peace be achieved.  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
This is less than the accommodation allowance granted members of parliament. 
Why is this person paying any income tax at all? 
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):
ALZHEIMER SOCIETY OF CANADA 
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Eglinton-Lawrence, Lib.):
Over 300,000 Canadians suffer from Alzheimer's and related dementia. 
There will be unprecedented demands for health services in Canada as a result.  
I encourage all colleagues to meet with them.  
Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, today, April 22, is Earth Day. 
It is a day to remind us that we are stewards of this beautiful planet.  
The environment significantly affects our quality of life. 
We need a biodiversity of species to help the earth, itself, sustain life.  
Rural Canadians know the value of a healthy, natural environment. 
By example, let us teach our children to value and respect it.  
Mr. Speaker, the media will never again beat up on Reform. 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
A century ago, North America was in the throes of industrial expansion. 
Concerns about the environment were pretty much an unknown concept at that time. 
The new millennium is fast approaching. 
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
The Bloc Quebecois recognizes the Armenian genocide, as does the Quebec National Assembly. 
Today, with the Armenians of Quebec, of Canada, and of the entire world- 
The hon. member for Beaches-East York.  
NATIONAL ORGAN DONOR WEEK 
Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-East York, Lib.):
The statistics clearly demonstrate the need for such improvements. 
MEMBER FOR YORK SOUTH-WESTON 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
And the year 2000 is approaching rapidly. 
They are getting restless. 
The separatist movement is a thing of the past. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
All pension surpluses are the sole property of the employee. 
They are deferred wages to be used for nothing else than improving benefits. 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
WOMEN IN THE WORKFORCE 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the message is clear. 
Women are gaining ground in the workforce. 
The main reason for this change is that women are becoming better educated. 
More than ever, education is a prerequisite for success in the workplace.  
While the glass ceiling is still there, it is more permeable than ever. 
It is not unusual to see women in executive roles. 
Today, over 700,000 businesses are owned by women.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia, Lib.):
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, today marks the 84th anniversary of the Armenian genocide.  
We must always guard against the forces that yield such evil.  
Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne-Blainville, BQ):
Such is the intolerance of this holier-than-thou member.  
I was born in Belgium. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Yet the government does not seem to have a specific plan. 
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
This started when the first six CF-18s were deployed into Aviano last June.  
We are in the throes of putting together the figures of other costs. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Canada is on the verge of going into a ground war. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
I have indicated quite clearly what the costs are to this point in time. 
Those are our costs.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Our fighters have flown well over 100 sorties into that region. 
Obviously supplies are getting rather thin.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have the equipment that is necessary to do the job. 
I was just in Aviano. 
I have seen our equipment and our planes there.  
Our Canadian forces personnel are doing a terrific job. 
They have the supplies that are necessary. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
For years we have urged that additional funds be devoted to those forces. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, they do have the tools that are needed to do the job.  
We have made no decision. 
NATO has made no decision with respect to ground troops. 
We are sticking to the course on the air campaign. 
We are staying with that course. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Now we are at war. 
In fact we have been at war for a month now. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
At this point, we are all on the same wavelength. 
That is why we are continuing with the air strikes. 
We intend to keep on. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there will be 19 government leaders with responsibilities to fulfil.  
There has been a debate in this House. 
The House of Commons supports the government's position. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
My position is very clear.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, in 1991, the Prime Minister was asking for moral authority.  
Now, he seems to find it easy to do without such moral authority. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The hon. member for Burnaby-Douglas.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question for the Prime Minister is on tomorrow's NATO summit. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We have worked on that and it is not possible. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have a supplementary question for the Prime Minister. 
Please, my colleagues, be very judicious in your choice of words.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
They said we were doing the right thing 10 days ago.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
My question is for the Minister of National Defence. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
We also increased the allowances for foreign duty. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
I want to wish the Prime Minister a very happy anniversary. 
The Right Hon. Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We had a deficit of $42 billion and it went to zero. 
We have created 1.6 million new jobs since we formed the government. 
Never have Canadians felt so good about their government than they do today. 
I know why the hon. member on the other side is so desperate.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, there is that Liberal arrogance again. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The hon. member for Louis-Hebert.  
CANADIAN ADAPTATION AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT FUND 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
The $240 million envelope and the objective remain unchanged. 
How can the minister justify this loss for Quebec? 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
The Conseil's management is the best in the country.  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
He keeps changing his story. 
Every two weeks it is one way or the other. 
What does the hon. member want us to do? 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Campbell, a Liberal, has said that the NDP have ``dropped the guillotine on democracy''.  
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I have every hope that this will be of use to all here.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
She should, therefore, reread the article.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, here we go again.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, to make the situation clear- 
That is a lie.  
I heard the hon. member for Langley-Abbotsford use the word ``lie''. 
I would ask him to withdraw it, please.  
Mr. Speaker, I believe that to be a lie.  
We will settle it at the end of question period. 
The hon. member for South Surrey-White Rock-Langley.  
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
We will have a debate on it, as we promised.  
We will do it when the time comes and it will be done.  
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Transport. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
It has a process for deciding whether navigational equipment is needed. 
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
My question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
We have had serious negotiations going on over the last three or four months. 
In fact we have had previous discussions.  
We think it will have an impact on both industries. 
I think that is the proper response.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
This is just one example of over 1,500 companies that are affected. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
There are some new regulations being applied to govern the nature of those trades. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
We want to know from the Prime Minister what he is taking to the huddle. 
We want to know that he is in the huddle. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the position of the government is very clear. 
When Milosevic accepts these conditions, that will stop the bombing. 
Our position is very clear. 
We have to be effective as well. 
If we cannot use bombing it is better to stop. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
What is the Canadian position?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I said that last week and I repeat it today. 
I believe the Russians are to be involved. 
They know my position. 
I will make the point again. 
We have to do what is needed- 
The hon. member for Fundy-Royal.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
The material is currently stored at temporary sites at Canada's 22 nuclear reactor stations. 
My question is for the Minister of Natural Resources. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
The study itself has already cost Canadians $1.5 million.  
Is this really a spending priority of the Canadian people?  
Mr. Speaker, we are now on to number 20.  
It is covered within the financial arrangements provided to AECL. 
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is directed to the Secretary of State for Parks.  
Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
That culture is also part of our exports.  
We have completed seven meetings. 
There is one next week. 
We will continue to defend- 
The hon. member for Mercier.  
ACCESS TO INFORMATION ACT 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Justice. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, on the contrary. 
This government is extremely concerned about these files. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
They delivered a report today with constructive recommendations. 
I will be responding to the report later this year.  
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
The hon. Minister of Transport.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
His name is Robbie Thompson and he needs a new heart.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We must do better. 
We will look at all the recommendations. 
We will bring forward the best, most effective- 
That would bring to a conclusion our question period today.  
After we have reflected on it for a little while we might reconsider.  
Hopefully he will not say no, he will not withdraw.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
I thank the hon. House leader of the opposition and the matter is closed.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We would ask that this document be tabled.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
I will gladly table the resume of Reform quotes that we have.  
That was the first part. 
We will have that document tabled.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
I need to know how we can end these kinds of untruthful or wrong impressions- 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
On Friday we will call the expositions bill, Bill C-64. 
This is the business of the House until Thursday of next week. 
THE LATE FRANK MCGEE 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. McGee represented York-Scarborough, which in 1957 was an area of tremendous growth. 
I believe this riding is now comprised of seven seats.  
In speaking to the bill Mr. McGee had this to say: 
Mr. McGee was a vigilant and hardworking member of the House. 
Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):
In 1963 he was made a minister without portfolio.  
I pay tribute to this exceptional figure in Canadian political and public life. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
By morning the seat count was 108 to 108. 
Both his grandfathers were members of parliament, something very unique:
Talk about a political pedigree. 
Frank McGee was a determined, enlightened and effective member of parliament.  
In the 1962 general election Frank won again. 
He ran again in 1965 but lost. 
In the course of political life four votes can change the course of history.  
Frank McGee is spoken of with warmth in these precincts. 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
In the fifties Mr. McGee settled in Toronto. 
He worked for a while at Sears as a purchasing manager.  
Later on, he worked in public relations. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
That fact is a lasting tribute to the work of Mr. Frank McGee.  
A public document, in other words a government document, that is quoted must be tabled. 
The document in question from which the Prime Minister quoted is not a public document. 
In fact, it is an internal document, not a government document.  
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
We took that assurance for what it was worth. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, here is the difficulty the official opposition gets into in this House. 
The country buys it. 
I think the government has an obligation to table all documents. 
I want to see them. 
We are not going to stop until we get them.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
It will not create a precedent because I will be doing so with unanimous consent. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. House leader has asked for unanimous consent. 
You said earlier that you would review the blues.  
We did it anyway.  
That is not the original document. 
That is your set of interpretations that you just entered, is it not?  
PUBLIC SECTOR PENSION INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
We also have the example of the balanced Liberal approach to taxation. 
The issue of Bill C-78 is public sector pension funds. 
The paper value of the pension plan is $126 billion. 
The current obligations are $96 billion. 
The people who are potentially on the hook in this whole exercise are the taxpayers. 
This government wants to scoop the $30 billion to make its books look better. 
It is Liberal optics. 
The government should leave the surplus where it is. 
The government wants to seize the $30 billion surplus. 
It wants to rob Peter to pay Paul. 
The surplus belongs to and is meant to benefit current and future retirees. 
That is a double-edged sword. 
It is not a low risk enterprise like government bonds.  
I want to talk more about the way the government is dealing with people. 
That is whom we are talking about. 
I am talking about the RCMP.  
We have one-third of the country's RCMP officers in the British Columbia jurisdiction. 
This is going contrary to the wishes of Canadians.  
Talk about a morale destroyer.  
One of the other sectors involved here is the armed forces. 
We have had great debate about that today. 
It requires a separate budget. 
We still went through that whole exercise.  
Those kinds of negotiations have a track record of success. 
I call that bad faith negotiations.  
Will this never end? 
This is the Liberal agenda, or is it the Liberal leadership agenda? 
Is this optics for the finance minister? 
Let us talk about that $10 billion, that nibbling around the edges. 
The civil servants have a valid argument. 
In some cases that is more like an eight year pay freeze. 
That was not what was predicated by the plan.  
On top of all that, now their public service pension plan is under attack.  
The surplus in the plan should be left alone. 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Madam Speaker, Bill C-78 is a technical bill.  
That is my first point.  
I would like to make an aside. 
This is what the advisory committee recommended in December 1996.  
And yet, that is possible. 
Do unions enjoy equal representation on that board? 
Are they fully represented? 
No, and this is very unfortunate. 
That is what it claims.  
This is particularly true in the case of the chairperson.  
One thing, among others, that struck me is how the investing will be done. 
The board's objects are defined as follows: 
The government is giving itself 15 years. 
What does ``undue'' mean? 
In this current period, this provision bothers me quite a bit. 
We are a long way from where we were before.  
It reduced benefits and the length of their payment.  
I trust that is clear. 
Saying that one is doing one thing, while doing another. 
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
She speaks of workers with the voice of experience.  
That is a lot of money.  
This is money taken from the pockets of these people. 
In the spring, we are three or four weeks short''.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I would ask the hon. member to choose his words carefully. 
Madam Speaker, I closed my speech with a similar comparison. 
Instead, the government is taking this money and using it. 
It said basically the following: 
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
I am talking about the private sector of course.  
In the private sector, it is even worse. 
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau-Mirabel, BQ):
Madam Speaker, the older workers' situation is often a dramatic one.  
There is also the plight of older workers who have been laid off.  
The problem of older workers will be raised more and more, and will become acute.  
Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga Centre, Lib.):
What the bill says is clear and fairly straightforward. 
These are the main features.  
Why is this all being done? 
Canada Post operates under the Canada Labour Code. 
Under the code all terms and conditions of employment are subject to collective bargaining. 
Second, it makes pensions bargainable.  
However this is an exceptional case.  
They are very strong guarantees.  
I wholeheartedly agree with this legislation. 
It is giving power to the people and responsibility to the government.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
That is how it has been able to balance the budget.  
Why is the government trying to put its hands in the cookie jar?  
It never goes back in history to when the government was topping up the deficits.  
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Madam Speaker, I have great respect for the hon. member. 
In her speech she was talking about the pensions of Canada Post employees.  
Why should we be tampering with their pensions? 
I would like the hon. member to comment on that.  
We are here to deal with the pension plan.  
I believe it is a very fair proposal, particularly for Canada Post.  
To whom will the board be accountable? 
Who will ensure that the board will operate in a fair manner?  
Some have appointed members who are well respected members of the community.  
Whenever a board is appointed its position has to remain neutral and fair. 
It has to listen to labour, to management, to the government and to the employees.  
I think they are very limited. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I always agree with my hon. colleague from Hamilton. 
I will bow to his wisdom on this one and let his remarks stand.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
Finally, what will the money the government is going to recover be used for?  
Madam Speaker, again I would like to reiterate my position. 
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
The good is that there is a dental plan for beneficiaries. 
Because we are thinking of people who are retired, this is a particularly important element. 
It is important to have and would be a very important change. 
It recognizes benefits for same sex couples. 
It would increase the supplementary death benefit. 
There are two really important points. 
Who benefits from these changes? 
It will not be the pensioners because their actual pensions will not increase. 
They will not get any more, but they will not get any less. 
The employees will be paying more.  
However, they will not benefit from the changes in this legislation.  
The flipping of capital will cost millions in brokerage fees. 
It is paramount and must reinforced. 
This is convoluted logic that we cannot accept.  
The pension is part of the wage package. 
Obviously that is not happening here.  
The government is acting unilaterally. 
It does not even want to share in the decisions. 
Instead, the government intends to appoint directors to the board. 
We will do what we think is best ''. 
They have come here and lobbied. 
They are not even doing this for themselves because their pensions will not change. 
They will not get any more out of this. 
It is not for the common good of our country. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
In my riding it is mostly small entrepreneurs, farmers, people who are self-employed. 
They will have contributed to this surplus.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Of course it is defined in clauses 53 and 75.  
Providing benefits for same sex partners is an important step. 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
Who will represent the unions on this committee? 
Where are the workers? 
Where are the former workers?  
Only one person will represent the pensioners. 
If that means jointly with the workers, they should look again.  
Mr. Speaker, the whole appointment process is particularly troubling. 
I do not think it will benefit us in the long run.  
It is my fault I am sure for not explaining it very well. 
That money could be invested more wisely and get a better return. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to take a few minutes to talk about the RCMP. 
I was a former chairman of the Waterloo Regional Police. 
I think that is clear. 
That too is an important area in which personnel will have valued input.  
Bill C-78 does that. 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member opposite for her question. 
It is important that we proceed with Bill C-78. 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:
I would like to hear the hon. member on this point.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
All this is crazy enough, but there is more. 
The new improved model does not even run.  
This is where it starts to get strange. 
Yet other than married, survivor eligibility depends on it.  
What does conjugal mean? 
The Concise Oxford Dictionary , ninth edition, states that conjugate means to unite sexually. 
Maybe it could just be added to the Statistics Canada questions. 
Lord knows, they ask for every other kind of personal information. 
We could compare ourselves with the Swedes. 
We could boost Viagra sales. 
The mind boggles at the possibilities.  
No conjugality assessment is required. 
How do these other relationships gain recognition as conjugal? 
What will the cost be? 
If taxpayers are backstopping the entire plan, should they not be informed?  
If not, why not?  
Are people included or excluded based on private physical intimacy? 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Right now he is all over the map.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion this is not a point of order.  
I do not understand the hon. member's comments.  
The more one thinks about this as I said, the goofier it gets. 
There was one little ray of light. 
Somebody was thinking and there is one thing they did pick up on. 
No survivor benefits will be paid in that situation.  
The eventual screw-ups will be a wonder to behold.  
I can see that you, Madam Speaker, are as awestruck as I am. 
It is in that condition that I will take my seat.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
I would like my colleague to elaborate on that. 
They are just appointed.  
It is wrong and it is part of the lunacy of this bill.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
We have seen the unemployment insurance fund being raided by government. 
It has been spent.  
And we know what someone who commits a theft is called.  
Madam Speaker, I cannot agree more with the intent of the question. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
ISSUE OF CEREMONIAL STATEMENTS OF SERVICE ACT 
This is a bit of an aberration.  
This is a non-partisan and apolitical private member's bill. 
This was a concern for the great majority of them. 
How many people are we talking about? 
Who would issue these certificates? 
The Department of Veteran Affairs, obviously. 
That is how the certificates would be issued.  
In conclusion, Bill C-453 is relatively simple, non-partisan and apolitical. 
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
They may have been given lapel pins but some regard such pins as ostentatious regalia.  
The bill however is flawed. 
First it is out of date. 
Many of these soldiers are no longer in active service.  
I feel this is too broad a stroke to make.  
Under this piece of legislation it indicates that. 
All it would require is the individuals' belief and they would get the recognition. 
They do not even have to be on the conflict side of the ocean.  
Imagine how insignificant its true meaning would be. 
This has helped to formulate my opinion on this. 
I am sure we could think of other examples that are worth asking about.  
Was that a contribution to the war effort? 
Should he receive a certificate on my mother making application? 
With this in mind, I have to decline my support. 
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
They could be foreigners. 
It is a bit like an honorary degree. 
This does not entail any financial commitment. 
I am happy to support this bill. 
This certificate should not be a mere piece of paper. 
It should not be the kind that anyone can get. 
Otherwise, it would not mean anything. 
The specifics could be covered in regulations. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Any time we talk about veterans it is very good.  
We on this side of the House believe that is absolutely shameful.  
This compensation is nothing short of a disgrace. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
They must be recognized for their war service. 
We hope that the government will move forward immediately with compensation. 
I think it is important recognition for all of our veterans.  
I have to say that the government has made another good move just recently. 
Mr. Bob Wood (Nipissing, Lib.):
Therefore, I thank the hon. member for presenting us with such an opportunity today.  
They truly were angels of mercy that no veteran would ever forget.  
Of course, not all monuments are of steel and stone. 
Canadians are also well recognized overseas. 
This memorial, however, does more than commemorate a great event in the past. 
Peace and freedom cannot be long separated. 
Mr. Reginald Belair (Timmins-James Bay, Lib.):
There have been comments both positive and negative. 
Nothing says that in the future I will not bring it back. 
It should be a votable item. 
These people feel extremely important. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
A lot of people from his riding have individually or collectively reminded him of that. 
Recently, I have seen a certain openness on the part of these two people. 
However, the Minister of Industry failed to be as open. 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
The federal government acknowledges the important contribution the marine industry makes to our national economy. 
In fact the estimate for 2005 is 40%.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.18 p.m.)
