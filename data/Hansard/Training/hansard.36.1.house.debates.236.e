Wednesday, June 2, 1999 
The House met at 2 p.m. 
Members sang the national anthem ] 
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):
We do know this: we must act; we can act; we are acting. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
I say to little baby Hannah, welcome. 
We assure you that you are and will be greatly loved. 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Rossana Magnotta is certainly one of those role models. 
It has also been awarded over 800 medals in adjudicated competitions. 
This truly is a Canadian success story. 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
We thank the Telebec and Telebec Mobilite team in Abitibi-Temiscamingue.  
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):
The United Nations has declared 1999 as International Year of Older Persons. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
One such leader who deserves this unity is Nelson Mandela. 
South Africa is now holding its presidential election.  
This House will not be sitting when his successor is sworn in. 
WINDSOR AND ESSEX COUNTY 
Mr. Rick Limoges (Windsor-St. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
I know she and her family will not forget this experience.  
CANADIAN INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCY 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Long live pork barrel politics.  
Mr. Raymond Lavigne (Verdun-Saint-Henri, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this week is road safety week.  
Too many Canadian children are lost to the road, unfortunately, every year. 
Repression will not put an end to all the carelessness on our highways. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
The federal government has advised however that it is not funding this year's camp. 
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
The Liberal government is also helping young people. 
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
It has triggered many initiatives and gestures of solidarity.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
He was not even asked to deliver doughnuts.  
Our CF-18s carry NATO payloads in the skies of Yugoslavia. 
We ought to be involved in the planning.  
How does the government explain Canada's complete absence from this important meeting?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
No decisions were made. 
It was an ad hoc meeting. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this avoids the question.  
President Clinton has just made an announcement based on that meeting. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
It was not a formal meeting. 
There was no decision making made there whatsoever.  
There are lots of bilateral meetings. 
I have them with these same people. 
They have no official status whatsoever. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Prime Minister King met with Mr. Churchill and President Roosevelt. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the premise of these questions is absolutely false.  
When decision making is going on at the NATO council, we are there. 
When decisions are made by the United Nations Security Council, we are there.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
The Prime Minister has battles of his own here. 
The showcase of shame continues to loom over him. 
Why does the Prime Minister think it is okay to abuse his office that way?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the premise of the hon. member's question is totally false.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, in some of these arm's length organizations the arms get pretty short.  
We would like to hear an answer from the Prime Minister to this question. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is no involvement by the Prime Minister.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, as usual, it is all the federal government's fault.  
They are still looking for winning conditions, but these conditions will be their undoing. 
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
These are the real experts. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
I'm still looking into it. 
I'm still waiting to find out''.  
Why can the defence minister not do his job?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
It was not a NATO meeting at all. 
They are strictly for the European Union. 
That is all it was. 
It was not a decision making meeting by any means. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, when is a meeting a meeting? 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am on the job. 
I just had a meeting today with Secretary Cohen. 
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
The auditor general, of course, has his own autonomy and jurisdiction. 
The Prime Minister has acted in a perfectly proper way in this- 
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Mr. Speaker, there is no CIDA grant. 
There is not a shred of evidence. 
It is all innuendo and it is rotten politics.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it seems that whenever- 
There is a little concern over there.  
I would ask the hon. member to go directly to his question.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
The hon. member for Beauharnois-Salaberry.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Canada was excluded from this meeting. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
This was the defence ministers of the European Union getting together as they regularly do. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
They are held by the solicitor of the Prime Minister. 
In other words, he had an interest in the company. 
Mr. Gauthier then bought some land from him. 
How much did he benefit from the sale of that land to Mr. Gauthier?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
It was done by an outside committee.  
They have not proven anything. 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
It is the responsibility of both levels of government. 
Now, that is a good idea.  
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to hear the government line, but- 
The hon. member for Edmonton-Strathcona.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
He has been very clear on that.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
There was no undue pressure. 
We checked things very carefully indeed.  
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
I do want to say one thing. 
We noted that progress had been made in meetings between our officials and our spokespersons. 
Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I am delighted to announce today that the government accepts that recommendation.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, here is what has happened. 
Is this what the Prime Minister calls good, honest government? 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
The basis for the earlier question is wrong. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the regulations specifically preclude rewrites.  
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I think the minister should read her own documents. 
They are now all threatened.  
The minister has a choice to make. 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I would remind the Minister of National Defence of some interesting facts.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
We are not a member of that.  
I am told that General Clark was not there. 
In fact there was no NATO official there.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Could he inform the House a bit?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Last week Mr. Milosevic and his cohorts were indicted as war criminals. 
It showed clearly where the responsibility lies.  
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour, Lib.):
The government is prepared to assist the two parties in any way we can.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Finance. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
It was for the entire communications strategy.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
This is the first official step toward a Sea King replacement.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are working on this project. 
As I have said before, we are developing our procurement strategy. 
This is a very major purchase. 
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Canadians are increasingly concerned about climate change. 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, climate change is a top priority of the government. 
This is clean air day. 
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have a process in place. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
I want to correct that. 
I apologize for any misunderstanding I may have created.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
I wonder if the minister would be willing to table these regulations. 
Did the hon. minister hear what the point of order was? 
It was a request actually.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):

MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY ABORTION REFERENDUM ACT 
PRAIRIE GRAIN ELEVATORS ACT 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
The reason is that they have become mouthpieces- 
Perhaps he can inform me if that is the case.  
That is correct, Mr. Speaker. 
I would like to ask for consent now and make a short speech.  
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have three petitions to present.  
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the third petition is on the defence of marriage. 
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have three petitions today. 
PUBLIC SERVICE PENSION PLAN 
They say that the action is morally flawed.

Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
The petitioners humbly pray and call upon parliament to repeal laws allowing abortion.  
I invite the hon. member to avoid reading. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
They believe the government is shirking its fiduciary responsibility.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have three petitions today from constituents. 
The first petition is with regard to marriage.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
This is signed by petitioners from my constituency.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
However, I do not want to associate myself with the member's previous petition.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
INTERNET CHILD PORNOGRAPHY PREVENTION ACT 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
I therefore request that the hon. member withdraw his motion.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like Motion No. P-39 to be called.  
I think the hon. member has a choice. 
Those are really his options.  
The motion is transferred for debate.  
PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTION AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS ACT 
The motions will be grouped for debate as follows.  
The Chair will remind the House of each pattern at the time of voting.  
Does the House wish to have this whole group of motions read?

Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Unfortunately only Quebec has set them up. 
The other provinces have not done so, primarily because of a lack of resources.  
It is the World Wide Web. 
Therein lies one of the great challenges.  
A lot of information is put out there. 
A lot of information is of a very personal nature. 
One of the most important areas to protect is that of medical records. 
The personal medical records of people are very sensitive. 
That is what we do today. 
It is a very fine line. 
The laws of the country are there to protect the personal information of individuals. 
Penalties will be paid by those who abuse personal information.  
We are in favour of that.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
After much consultation, the bill became law. 
The Quebec legislation has been in place for five years. 
For the public, it will be a terrible mess. 
In the present situation one law applies. 
If the problem is resolved at the first level, it is all well and good. 
If not, the commission reviews the matter and gives a decision. 
This is at no cost to the individual. 
If it is a matter of record, the remedy will follow quickly.  
However, this is not the case under the federal legislation. 
What will the ordinary citizen do? 
This is absurd from a harmonization point of view. 
The testimonies heard on this issue were unanimous. 
It is indeed a power grab. 
That is what we are here for.  
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
We strongly oppose the motions in Group No. 1. 
The motions tabled by the Bloc are unacceptable and must be rejected. 
I will quote some of the witnesses. 
In responding to a question from the member the witness said: 
This bill clearly applies to companies operating under federal jurisdiction. 
It leaves a place for the Quebec legislation within its particular area of responsibility. 
We fully support the bill's underlying principles. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
It has already had a major impact on business transactions in our country.  
Most of those concerns have been addressed. 
At this point let us assume those problems have been dealt with.  
We want to have one Canadian system.  
It expects us to act by this summer. 
This legislation presumably will be passed by the Parliament of Canada before the summer.  
We will oppose the amendments in Group No. 1. 
We are aware that certain European Union deadlines have been imposed. 
We are not interested in being an obstacle to the passage of this bill. 
As a political party we support this legislation. 
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Their representations were extremely helpful with respect to bringing new issues to light.  
I especially salute the work of the member. 
This motion was defeated seven to four by the Liberal majority. 
To their credit the Liberals allowed for some minor tinkering to Bill C-54. 
For example they supported two of the 16 amendments I brought forward. 
They refused to co-operate; they refused to compromise.  
They are not laws and should therefore not be enforced as such.  
These are not just the concerns of allegedly self-interested companies. 
Most of these objections pertain to part 1 of Bill C-54.  
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
This bill is almost global in its scope. 
Normally I would work toward protecting the interests of provincial legislation and provincial responsibilities.  
Reform supports this initiative to protect privacy.  
We believe in free markets. 
In a nutshell that is what the bill comes down.  
I will take a moment to distinguish between those two points.  
The purpose of consent is something the bill addresses. 
The issue of consent needs to be looked at. 
Currently only Quebec has comprehensive privacy protection. 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
The Minister of Industry was bent on showing leadership. 
The bill gives him this power. 
We will come back to this later on. 
I am somewhat surprised and, I should say, disappointed.  
Reformers are not sovereignists, but they often talk about that in their speeches. 
However, in this case they decided to support the Liberal government. 
Of course, we are on the eve of the year 2000. 
Everyone is talking about e-commerce. 
We know abuse occurs, but laws do exist. 
This represents quite a lot of people. 
All this was said by many witnesses and many groups.  
It is difficult for us too. 
We are looking at a real constitutional coup. 
Once again the federal government is interfering in an area of provincial jurisdiction.  
Even federal officials have said so to representatives of foreign countries. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Eduardo is from Mexico. 
Not only that, they found this fellow with two separate identities. 
Having been there I can say that is an understatement.  
I applied to the refugee hearing. 
If this were an isolated case I would not be standing here. 
It is just compounding the issues in delivering legislation.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Thank you for that reminder, Madam Speaker. 
She came into my area and claimed refugee status. 
How can American criminals claim refugee status in Canada?  
I asked for the information on her. 
Is she worth keeping? 
If she is, then tell us. 
If she is not and we want her out, then tell us. 
That happens to be a matter of privacy too. 
We do not know today whether that person lives in this country. 
It does not even tell us whether they stay in Canada.  
The system has many flaws in it and the board does not understand.  
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
This is one of the many fundamental realities of the bill.  
Let us look at the chronology of events.  
What justification can the minister give today for introducing this bill? 
How do we explain Bill C-54? 
How do we explain such an infringement upon these areas of provincial jurisdiction? 
What sense will the people make of all this confusion?  
Here is what the representative of the Alliance of Manufacturers and Exporters of Canada said: 
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
What is the right to privacy? 
Why is it important to have this type of legislation? 
That is why it is very important to legislate in that area.  
Why is the Bloc Quebecois opposed to the federal bill? 
I will give a brief historic overview. 
Nothing has been done.  
I am here, full of goodwill. 
This was done unanimously. 
The government is not listening. 
We already have our own law in Quebec. 
Why is the federal government so obstinately intent on meddling in this?  
I am not very familiar with the legislative framework of the other provinces. 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Nobody was consulted on this bill, and yet it was introduced. 
The Bloc Quebecois is not the only one to say that. 
The Chambre des notaires du Quebec came to tell the committee. 
Incidentally, that organization is not pro-sovereignist, as far as we know. 
The result will be complete havoc.  
In this case, recourse is simple and effective.  
After this, a dissatisfied individual may seek reparation from the federal court.  
This is totally crazy.  
I repeat, the government tabled this bill without consulting the provinces. 
I urge my colleagues in this House to vote against the bill.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Electronic commerce is a whole new and uncharted area. 
I have engaged in electronic commerce. 
It offered a clock. 
It is quite intriguing because literally I do not have to set it. 
It is an intriguing device.  
Something really interesting happened. 
The website of course is American. 
I was quite worried about that. 
There is something else too. 
Well, was I in for a surprise. 
I really love that rate of taxation. 
That is what they have been saying and I presume it is correct. 
I have not had any dealings on the electronic Internet with Quebec firms. 
However, they have this in place and that is great. 
It is within their mandate.  
However, what do we do when we have interprovincial and international transport of goods? 
He wanted to know about me. 
It turned out that he is from California. 
We need to be careful. 
This is what we should be doing. 
We should be co-operating among and between the provinces and the federal government. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
This bill will not apply to government information either. 
In fact, this bill has three major flaws. 
That is why we in the Bloc Quebecois are so concerned. 
The first problem with this legislation is that it is incomplete. 
It does not really protect personal information. 
The second problem with this legislation is that it conflicts directly with Quebec legislation. 
Commerce, among other things, comes under the Civil Code. 
Then they could rest assured of collecting good fees for many years. 
This would save a lot of people a lot of money. 
This bill will create an unbearable situation for Quebec businesses. 
What will be the outcome? 
I said that there are three problems here. 
That is what we are facing with this bill.  
The impact could be enormous. 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.) moved: 
This is a large number of Canadians that need our attention. 
Symptoms overlap in these three conditions.  
The symptoms fluctuate in severity and persist for a prolonged period of time.  
The exact cause of chronic fatigue syndrome is not yet known. 
The disease is more prevalent in women than in men.  
It is also known as fibrositis. 
These are the realities of people affected with multiple chemical sensitivities.  
The problem is that there is no standard. 
The result is that disabled people are treated inequitably.  
These people are sick and in many cases they are being denied benefits. 
At a time when they need support, they are being told no. 
The suffering of these people is real. 
Add to the situation the cost of the treatment. 
In many cases these treatments are not covered by the health care system.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (York Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise in my capacity as a private member on this occasion. 
I know there is a procedure involved. 
I do not know why they would.  
This motion should get the support of all members of the House. 
I should think that all members would want to support this motion.  
This matter requires some serious attention.  
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
It is a very timely and important issue. 
It is not complicated. 
I would like to read part of a letter from Sandra Madray of Winnipeg: 
I hope a positive outcome will come from the motion. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Canadians know that the Liberals will do none of these things. 
The government will not be providing any protection for Canadians who are sick. 
They have already seriously reduced such protections.  
The government makes no moral commitments to Canadians who are sick. 
The member has chosen only a few diseases for his motion. 
Why is the member so selective?  
What about the organ donor transplant system? 
First, we have a waiting list system. 
Third, we have a system which I call the sickness system.  
The Liberals should be ashamed. 
I could go on and on and on.  
About two dozen genetically engineered food products are already on our shelves. 
I hope the Environmental Illness Society is listening very carefully to the debate.  
The Liberal government does not even recognize Canadians suffering from these diseases. 
That is what he has admitted by submitting the motion. 
We on this side of the House also have vision. 
They are not strong enough. 
The Liberal government should be held accountable for not compensating them. 
The government is denying Canadians freedom to choose natural health products. 
I regret that my remarks could not be more positive. 
Why has the government cut that money? 
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, it is critical to support this motion. 
I rise as the member for Yukon in support of the motion. 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
The extent of the suffering caused has been documented. 
Their quality of life is greatly affected.  
They often lose their jobs due to an inability to perform at their full capacity. 
They cannot afford treatment. 
They do not have access to community social service support. 
We have recognized that there is a link between environmental factors and health. 
Finally, I want to talk about the need for treatment. 
In this country we have one centre for the treatment of environmentally-induced illnesses. 
I wish this motion were votable. 
We need to look at some specific things. 
We have the expertise. 
We should be taking care of these issues in our country.  
Finally, I would like to quote a statement from a letter I received this week: 
CFS and FM have seriously affected each of our lives. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
That would be a disaster from the point of view of the debate.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Her name is Margaret Tatlock. 
These are all very difficult circumstances. 
I think it is the one that the member from Ottawa was referring to earlier. 
The waiting list is enormous.  
I have written to ministers of health and to the federal Minister of Health. 
There seems to be a kind of jurisdictional twilight zone. 
That is an outstanding problem. 
We need to get out of the paradigm we are in. 
I hope that will be the outcome of the debate this afternoon.  
Here we are talking about multiple chemical sensitivity. 
The Reform Party members sometime complain that the work of committees is not respected. 
I will have to take that with a grain of salt from here on in. 
I thought they were sincere but not after this week. 
We need a policy of total phase-out of toxins in our environment. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
Mr. Speaker, in fairness to all of my colleagues here, there have been some discussions. 
The hon. member for Wetaskiwin has put a request to the House. 
Does he wish me to put that request to the House?  
Collectively, the House has come to a level of awareness where something needs to happen. 
In that spirit, I move: 
Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House to propose the motion?  
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Recent events have served to prove these words. 
The disease is misplaced government priorities. 
A notice was sent out by the then director, Dr. Lachance, stating: 
The memo went on to list other files. 
There were serious problems with hormones that could cause cancer.  
Canadians do not want to consume pus in their milk. 
In fact the PSSRB dismissed all complaints made by Health Canada employees.  
Some countries have approved it and some have not. 
There is no gag order. 
(The House adjourned at 6:31 p.m.)
