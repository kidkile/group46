Wednesday, March 10, 1999 
The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Human Rights in Tibet 
Fortieth Anniversary of Uprising Against the Occupying Chinese 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
This revolt was brutally crushed. 
Thousands were killed and thousands more maimed. 
An official policy of cultural genocide has been instituted. 
All of this is happening in deafening silence. 
Here in Canada our government says nothing. 
A world away, Tibetans suffer; and wait; and hope.  
The Late Gerhard Herzberg 
Hon. Wilbert J. Keon :
As his colleagues and admirers have noted, he was a giant in his field. 
Honourable senators, Dr. Herzberg worked relentlessly towards progress in science. 
His brilliance, kindness and ingenuity have set the standard for all scientists.  
Electronic Surveillance-Concerns Expressed on Recently Passed Legislation 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
An omnibus bill is a bill of oversight. 
I quote in part: 
The report goes on to say: 
Perhaps we are doing too much, too quickly. 
Honourable senators, expediency is not necessarily the handmaiden of effectiveness.  
Privileges, Standing Rules and Orders 
Ninth Report of Committee Presented 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, I move that the report be taken into consideration at the next sitting.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Honourable senators, they say that patience pays off in the end. 
Otherwise, we could debate the matter today.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I thought you had a question to ask. 
We will hold a debate at the next sitting of the Senate.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
The evidence to the contrary is far too compelling. 
In his letter of June, 1998, he stated: 
Honourable senators, one of two things is happening:
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Yesterday, the Leader of the Government stated: 
Sounds like a Reformer to me.  
Honourable senators, I should like to add a comment to the previous question. 
The Canadian Police Association is aghast at what the government is doing in this regard.  
This time it is with respect to our banks: 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the decisions were made for the wrong reasons. 
If you have that remedy in hand, then you deal with it. 
Honourable senators, the Minister of Finance always takes matters of that kind into consideration. 
Our banks are very small compared to other banks. 
Financial sector reform is a government priority. 
The desire of the government is to maintain an efficient and internationally competitive financial system. 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, Mr. Martin does not have a crystal ball. 
I presume you will ask the Minister of Finance. 
The bond rating service's decision is very clear. 
It was taken because of the Minister of Finance's decision. 
Can Canadians expect other negative decisions?  
Absolutely not, honourable senators. 
As a matter of fact, I am very optimistic, as is the Minister of Finance. 
Legal and Constitutional Affairs 
What is the intention of the committee with regard to this bill?  
I thank the honourable senator for his question. 
Do any of those private members' bills predate December 1997? 
Senator Oliver was quite anxious that his bill come before us. 
We agreed to that and have already started hearings on that bill. 
We are waiting for that.  
Honourable senators, I was not aware that another sponsor is required. 
I am not sure it requires another sponsor.  
I thank Senator Murray for his interest. 
It is on the list, and we will deal with it as soon as possible.  
The Estimates, 1998-99 
That a Message be sent to the House of Commons to acquaint that House accordingly.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. Catherine S. Callbeck :
Her commitment is strong and exemplary for us all. 
These are for the reported cases only. 
Thus far, we have not been successful. 
In the background, a 1-year-old child would always be heard wailing. 
After a particularly bad commotion, they packed up and left, last Friday at midnight. 
No one knows where, they have just gone.  
That is a sad example of a family in crisis. 
We worry for the child's safety and that of either spouse. 
That is why this inquiry is so important. 
There are now five research centres on family violence in this country. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Are you requesting leave to continue?  
I am almost finished.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
At times, the steps forward can seem very small. 
Such lack of significant progress is puzzling and frustrating.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
International Women's Week 
Participation of Women in Legislative Institutions-Inquiry-Debate Adjourned 
Hon. Serge Joyal , having given notice on Thursday, March 4, 1999: 
This is International Women's Week. 
It reads as follows: 
There are a number of possible mechanisms. 
What point are we at on the eve of the millennium? 
But is that enough? 
Honourable senators, this is a myth fed by contented consciences. 
We must stop thinking that each election will deliver a fresh new crop of women. 
Let us begin with Ontario, the province with the highest population. 
We are certainly far from being on an ongoing growth curve. 
What about Canada's Parliament? 
Let us look at the elected House, the House of Commons. 
And what about the Senate? 
The Senate is a house whose members are appointed. 
Let us assume that the Prime Minister appoints women in equal numbers to men. 
Of those who retire during that period, eight are women. 
In 2006, five more of the current members will retire, of which two are women. 
Following this method, we get the following results for subsequent years:
Honourable senators, the conclusion is self-evident. 
"From Rhetoric to Reality:
Women's Political Participation, Accountability and Leadership."  
I could put the question another way. 
The gender culture of each party is at stake.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted for him to continue?  
Hon. John G. Bryden :
I wonder if perhaps Senator Joyal would entertain a question?  
In Canada, we have one Parliament, albeit two Houses. 
I think that would have some interesting implications. 
Has my honourable friend considered that possibility?  
Honourable senators, the honourable senator is suggesting drastic reform to the way appointments are made. 
This is the opportunity the Prime Minister has at hand.  
The numbers float, and we must take that into account. 
We would have to wait until 2013. 
There are limits to the present process of appointment. 
We already have entrenched regional representation. 
Therefore, we can expect more female appointments. 
Without the intervention of God.  
Sometimes he listens to us and sometimes he does not.  
Let us hope for that outcome.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Manitoba is represented in the Senate by three female senators and three male senators.  
On motion of Senator Pepin, debate adjourned.  
Statement of Minister of Finance-Inquiry-Debate Continued 
Leave having been given to revert to Inquiry No. 61: 
Hon. Erminie J. Cohen :
I say welcome aboard and bravo!  
It did nothing to end the need for food banks. 
Food banks were supposed to be a temporary solution provided by concerned volunteers. 
Instead, they have become a growth industry.  
There is nothing there for the poorest of the poor.  
Honourable senators, listen to the words of the Finance minister, who said: 
Let me repeat them once more: 
The cause of death was hypothermia. 
Ms Bluecloud had a substance abuse problem. 
It is five o'clock and homeless men are getting a hot supper. 
What happens if you want to get your clothes cleaned? 
You feel cut off from the world.  
So what is to be done? 
Homelessness has brought inspiring displays of idealism.  
This year, he expects to hand out 30,000 sleeping bags to the homeless.  
But ending homelessness needs more than compassion. 
It requires even more than gestures from federal and provincial politicians...it 
means a change in thinking.  
Finally, Mr. Stein cites Keith Ward, the Peel Housing Commissioner, as saying: 
When people are in poor housing, their health suffers. 
When children are in poor housing, their education suffers. 
What we are creating here is a nightmare.  
The homeless deserved to be a part of the Liberal government's budget. 
But they were scarcely a footnote. 
That's more than a disappointment. 
It's a disgrace.  
The article went on to state: 
The Liberal government has provided neither. 
For that, it should be ashamed.  
The tax system is not doing enough to help. 
Inflation is eating away at the value of this credit. 
So far, so good.  
That exceeds the marginal tax rate on upper-income Canadians. 
Honourable senators, again, this budget does not address some very real fundamental problems.  
We will also look at the effectiveness of current social programs.  
On motion of Senator Carstairs, for Senator Graham, debate adjourned.  
Enlistment into Royal Canadian Navy 
The Black Experience-Inquiry 
Leave having been given to revert to Inquiry No. 62: 
As the white cane indicates, I am a legally blind person. 
Also, on occasion, I suffer from memory loss. 
I thank you for staying around for my speech. 
Let us go back in time a bit. 
Minority persons in Canada include, of course, our First Nations people. 
Our presence in Canada goes back to approximately the 1500s or 1600s. 
We have been here for a long time.  
He was well known and well thought of in Winnipeg. 
Piercey Haynes, along with many others, went to the recruiting station. 
Piercey Haynes did not accept that line of reasoning. 
He was going into the navy. 
That has changed now to some degree.  
He returned armed with a letter from Mr. Macdonald. 
The captain in charge, the same gentleman, refused even to look at the letter. 
He spent four or five years of wartime service in the navy. 
For some reason, he never went to sea. 
We have come a long way. 
I have no animosity. 
Black people and other minority groups are proud to serve their country. 
They demonstrated that in World War II, despite the roadblocks.  
The civilized Negro is vain and imitative. 
It would crowd out a white battalion and it would be difficult to reinforce.  
We see this as our country, too. 
We do not see it as a whites-only country. 
We definitely know it is not for whites only. 
We have come a long way. 
Consequently the officer did not arrest him.  
He got his training in Ontario. 
He got his wings as flying officer and he went overseas. 
There, another problem cropped up. 
None of the white people wanted to fly with him. 
Finally, one man volunteered to serve with him. 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
I am sure that he, along with Senator Stratton, probably knew Piercey Haynes. 
Then my dad subsequently replaced him as premier of Nova Scotia. 
This was a nostalgic afternoon for me while I listened to you, Senator Ruck. 
However, much more important was the message you gave us. 
I want to address the issue of black Canadians. 
It was also, regrettably, located on the Halifax dump.  
In my experience growing up in that city, I rarely met a black person. 
Suzie Biggs was black. 
Suzie provided the mother image for that family.  
Thank you very much. 
Hon. Shirley Maheu (The Hon. the Acting Speaker) :
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
