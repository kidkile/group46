The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Hon. Calvin Woodrow Ruck :
Those two young black men were among the people who wanted to enlist.  
Neither of those two men ever joined the RCMP. 
That is an indication of what was happening back then.  
However, that has changed. 
He has travelled around quite a bit.  
There have been major improvements. 
That is basically where we are. 
Montfort Hospital of Ottawa 
Hon. Jean-Robert Gauthier :
We are in somewhat of a bind here. 
The court therefore struck down the commission's directives.

The Hon. the Speaker :
When shall this report be taken into consideration, honourable senators?  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I give notice that tomorrow, Wednesday, December 1, 1999, I will move: 
That a message be sent to the House of Commons to acquaint that House thereof.  
Canada-Europe Parliamentary Association 
Leave having been given to revert to Tabling of Reports from Inter-Parliamentary Delegations: 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Leave having been given to revert to Notices of Inquiries: 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Shutdown of Inter-Canadian Airlines 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, my question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I should like to reiterate those principles here for honourable senators. 
These remain the policy objectives of the government.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I thank the minister for his reply. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I recognize the concern implicit in the honourable senator's question. 
However, I think his question is more properly directed to the chair of the committee. 
I do not wish to usurp the authority of the committee on that subject.  
Honourable senators, I would have addressed my question to the chair of the committee. 
The order was referred to the committee. 
Honourable senators, I know that the minister is very aware of the situation. 
In fact, he continues to monitor it closely. 
The honourable senator's question is a significant one. 
The minister continues to monitorthe situation. 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
The company itself says that it is working on a survival plan.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
The minister has indicated that he will monitor the situation. 
I am sure he is in touch with the people involved at Inter-Canadian. 
However, service has been seriously disrupted. 
Surely, that is not a permanent solution. 
In the past, this government has helped out Canadian Airlines, financially and otherwise. 
What will it do for an airline that services Atlantic Canada?  
As far as I am aware, that is the case now. 
There are no communities left without alternative service.  
Quebec-Possible Conditions of Referendum-Role of Senate 
Honourable senators, my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, certainly any senator has an opportunity to raise that issue in the Senate. 
Obviously, it is a matter of great concern to all senators. 
Shutdown of Inter-Canadian Airlines-Response by Government 
Honourable senators, my question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
That letter said, in part: 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I cannot comment on the views or actions of the president of this company. 
Their jobs are also on the line.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
That is not the information that I have in my briefing note. 
Check out the northeastern part of New Brunswick as well.  
Possible Delay in Building New War Museum 
Hon. Norman K. Atkins :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the government is seriously considering such support. 
I have provided honourable senators with the most updated information I have. 
Perhaps the minister could confirm that. 
However, I shall certainly raise the honourable senator's concerns with the minister.  
Funding for New War Museum 
Whatever can be the justification for such a policy?  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
There was an expectation that there would be private fundraising as well.  
Hon. Michael A. Meighen :
Private funding would then come in afterwards, not the reverse. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Other sources of revenue within government are being examined. 
Manitoba-Loss of Confidential Data 
This private information is valuable to legitimate businesses and to criminal operations. 
I have two questions for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
An investigation was commenced immediately. 
Transfer of Personal Data-Principle of Consent 
Honourable senators, I certainly appreciate the honourable leader offering an apology. 
That will be most appreciated. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Perhaps I could prevail upon the honourable senator to repeat her concern.  
For example, businesses sell lists without people's consent. 
This is becoming a particular problem. 
It is highlighted by this incident, which I understand was an accident. 
I wish to thank the honourable senator for clarifying the question. 
I understand the point that is being made. 
Manitoba-Loss of Confidential Data- Procedures for Security of Personal Data 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I would not want my honourable colleague to draw that conclusion. 
However, recommendations were made for additional measures and those measures were implemented. 
One can be assured that the measures have been strengthened. 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
At that time, the minister was not able to provide details. 
Is the minister able to provide further details today? 
If not, could he seek details on this matter from the pertinent department? 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I will certainly have discussions on this issue with the Minister of Fisheries.  
He should exert some pressure to resolve this issue.  
Delayed Answers to Oral Questions 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
(Questions on the reviews and notification of SIRC:) 
The SIRC has started a review on its own initiative.  
Let SIRC and the Inspector General get on with their work. 
(Questions regarding the Prime Minister's comments) 
It is important to let them get on with their work.  
(Questions regarding the classification of the document and security procedures:) 
(Questions regarding the CSIS Director) 
Parliamentary Committees are free to invite any witness they deem appropriate.  
(Response to question raised by Hon. Mira Spivak on November 18, 1999) 
Each case is considered on its own merits.  
This also allowed Canada to settle with Ethyl Corporation.  
ORDERS OF THE DAY 
Speech from the Throne 
Motion for Address in Reply-Debate Continued 
5th day of resuming debate ) 
What is our vision? 
Sixty countries have been getting steadily poorer since 1980. 
Government deficits have been reduced on the backs of the poor.  
Social justice in a world of plenty seems farther off than ever. 
We fight wars that should not be fought. 
The major powers maintain nuclear weapons that constantly endanger humanity. 
Governments of the world spend money on excessive militarism at the expense of the poor.  
That should be the lesson we take from the 1990s.  
NATO's excessive arrogance is now reinforcing inequality and distrust. 
The Russians and the Chinese will never accept a NATO-dominated world.  
Already the consequences of the Kosovo War have spread far beyond the human toll. 
The danger of nuclear weapons is growing. 
How will international law be imposed in the years ahead? 
That is the fundamental question Canada faces as we begin the new millennium.  
The potential power of this movement can create the conditions for a culture of peace.  
That is a superficial analysis. 
Human beings are not genetically programmed for war. 
There is no inherent biological component of our nature that produces violence. 
The present pessimism must be lifted by the recognition that war is not inevitable. 
War and mass violence usually result from deliberate political decisions. 
That is the essence of a "culture of peace" approach.  
A peace consciousness does not appear overnight. 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Honourable senators, would Senator Roche entertain a question?  
Senator Roche and I have dealt with this matter in the past. 
Secretary-General Annan has said that that was a failure of the United Nations.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Are you asking permission to continue?  
Yes, I ask permission to continue.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
Thank you, honourable senators.  
Senator Grafstein has given a pretty tough critique of the United Nations. 
I will only give one example. 
That is where we ought to keep our focus.  
On motion of Senator Atkins, debate adjourned.  
Privileges, Standing Rules and Orders 
Second Report of Committee Adopted 
Honourable senators, I move the adoption of this report.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Third Report of Committee-Order Stands 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Indeed, the consideration by a committee of a draft report is one such instance.  
That is a principle under which I operate.  
I would urge the committee to consider all these matters.  
Honourable senators, I recognize the principles to which Senator Kinsella has just spoken. 
The Senate adjourned until Wednesday, December 1, 1999 at 1:30 p.m.
