Wednesday, February 3, 1999 
The Senate met at 1:30 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
The Late Honourable Peter Bosa 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
He took immense pride in serving his adopted country here in the Senate of Canada. 
He loved being a senator, and he served exceptionally well.  
Peter Bosa was a man I admired very much. 
He was a person of dignity and of gentlemanly behaviour. 
I thank him for his counsel, his guidance and his friendship. 
I, too, shall miss him. 
Peter Bosa and I had a habit of wagering on elections. 
The first such wager was for the federal election of November 1965. 
The last such wager was for the federal election of 1997. 
This is not the first crash in the region. 
Until recently, the Gulf Islands were also renowned for their tranquility. 
Many people signed this petition including many pilots. 
State of Snow Crab Fishery 
Although they have been hit hard, they continue to ply their trade under difficult conditions.  
A good number of snow crab die of old age every year. 
Assembly of World Council of Churches 
Hon. Lois M. Wilson :
I am greatly encouraged by the response of citizens across this country. 
Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide 
Ethical Legal Dilemma- Review of Issues by Special Senate Committee 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Others clearly do not.  
It cries out for aid from the chamber of sober second thought.  
Triumph of Nova Scotia Rink at National Mixed Championship 
Hon. Wilfred P. Moore :
I extend our sincere congratulations to Paul Flemming and the members of his championship squad.  
Hon. Norman K. Atkins :
In neither bid was the City of Toronto successful. 
The answer I received from the minister was as follows: 
In today's world, who knows. 
I am sorry, senator. 
I do not think it would apply in this case.  
I followed with a supplementary question: 
Will those be covered?  
They are presently not addressed in this bill. 
It is indeed unfortunate that this new statute does not touch the International Olympic Committee.  
It is time to revamp and reform the whole Olympic committee system. 
He must accept responsibility for what has occurred during his tenure.  
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson :
Tomorrow afternoon the centre will officially open its new home in Fredericton. 
I should like to expand on one additional aspect of the centre's work. 
Interim Report of Special Committee-Confirmation of Tabling-Motion for Consideration 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Canada-China Legislative Association 
First Bilateral Meeting held in Beijing, China- Report of Canadian Delegation Tabled 
I am co-chair of the association.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
I shall look at the precedent.  
State of Financial System 
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Thursday next, February 4, 1999, I will move: 
Cape Breton Development Corporation 
Notice of Motion for Production of Documents Relevant to Proposed Privatization 
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Tuesday next, February 9, 1999, I will move: 
(d) minutes of departmental, interdepartmental and other meetings; 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I thank the honourable senator for his question. 
Honourable senators, I have a supplementary question. 
The concern is that this vaccine may be linked to the Gulf War syndrome.  
My question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate is:
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
The situation in Kosovo is grave. 
We have witnessed a massacre and daily fighting. 
We do not know how the troops will get out. 
The list is endless. 
Under whose command will they be? 
Who will feed them and who will lead them through this operation? 
We do not even know who will for this action. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The honourable senator raises an interesting point. 
I thank the Leader of the Government in the Senate for that response. 
Honourable senators, we could very well do that. 
Honourable Senator Forrestall could initiate the debate through an inquiry.  
They were being pushed back to the sea. 
Let us then put the time frame in perspective.  
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
Honourable senators, my question is also to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Is he not aware of the level of obsolescence of our military equipment? 
Is the Leader of the Government aware of that particular incident?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, yes, I read about that very regrettable incident. 
The story about the 11-year-old boy is very regrettable. 
They do not start up and they do not operate. 
This is not a question of harassment of the minister or of the cabinet. 
This is a question of safety on the West Coast.  
I live on the West Coast and the minister lives on the East Coast. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
That decision will be made by the government, not by officials.  
It could be a more wide-ranging debate.  
I believe that story is misleading on several points. 
Hon. Norman K. Atkins :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Therefore, should the military not reconsider its actions?  
Indeed, we were assured by those responsible that it was safe.  
Cape Breton Development Corporation 
I look back on the coal industry with great nostalgia, as does Senator Graham. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
That plan was examined by the minister and his officials. 
Thus, the government had to make a decision, Senator Buchanan. 
Last Thursday, we met with management and the unions. 
Honourable senators, it was a most difficult time. 
That is exactly what we were doing.  
However, I also understand the word "consultation" does not mean "just a few hours." 
That was just a little over one year ago. 
They sent a memo to that effect. 
There is a lot of concern, honourable senators, about this matter. 
I know that the minister is concerned. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Therefore, could the response be short? 
I cannot accept any further questions.  
With respect to consultation, the Senate itself did great work. 
Senator Buchanan was a part of them, as was Senator Murray.  
Honourable senators, there is a question of safety here. 
There is also a question of timing. 
The timing to take a decision of this nature is never right. 
He is on the record as having said that.  
The plan called for elimination of federal government subsidies to Devco by 1995.  
I remember that very well.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
In addition, $68 million of new economic development money will be spent in Cape Breton. 
Delayed Answer to Oral Questions 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
However, this does not imply a diminishment of search and rescue capabilities.  
We continue to provide search and rescue coverage with the Labrador. 
The first Cormorant will come into service in 2001.  
Carriage By Air Act 
Bill to Amend-Second Reading 
The Montreal Protocol No. 4 deals with cargo exclusively. 
We would like clarification of this position during the discussions in committee.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, if no other senator wishes to intervene, the debate will be considered closed.  
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
All demutualizations would require policyholder approval.  
Let me first deal with the rationale for the new regime. 
A mutual system of governance made sense in that environment. 
In effect, the mutual system of governance now favours a minority of these companies' clients.  
I should like to emphasize that the government is not encouraging companies to demutualize. 
Let me highlight some of the proposed regime's policyholder protection measures. 
Let me say a few words on the post-demutualization period.  
On motion of Senator Lynch-Staunton, debate adjourned.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is there agreement that committees be allowed to sit?  
Child Custody and Access Reform 
Consideration of Report of Committee-Debate Concluded 
Hon. Erminie J. Cohen :
I immediately sensed a difference. 
Unfortunately, that was not always the case on this committee.  
It was very difficult to maintain an objective perspective while listening to heart-wrenching testimony.  
It is always unsettling to be a witness to public pain and controversy. 
That kind of approach, however, does not sell newspapers. 
This made our original commitment extremely difficult to maintain. 
I commend the members of the committee for their discipline and focus. 
It was a struggle. 
However, I feel confident that we did the best that we could do. 
The concept of shared parenting is one of the main cornerstones of this report. 
It made sense to have this shift reflected in the legal terminology. 
This new concept would, it was hoped, benefit the child. 
As a grandmother myself, I could understand their pain and devastation. 
Honourable senators, I have never seen statistics to support this claim. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Volunteerism and the International Year of Older Persons 
Hon. Marian Maloney rose pursuant to notice of December 10, 1998: 
Canada has always enjoyed an active and creative volunteer spirit. 
Too often we take these contributions for granted. 
Have we asked ourselves how much these volunteers save our health care system? 
In many communities, homes are protected by volunteer firefighters. 
Can we quantify the savings? 
In monetary terms, the contribution is immeasurable.  
Volunteer work promotes understanding. 
It is these events that bring Canada together as a family.  
Volunteerism is a critical part of the public good. 
Our government has taken steps to promote the interests of volunteerism in this country. 
Demographics show that the face of the world is changing. 
Very often, this contribution is captured through volunteer work in our communities.  
In that year, I worked with many volunteers. 
The contributions of those who were older were immeasurable. 
No value can be affixed to these very human experiences.  
These are but a few examples. 
There are simpler and equally as important ones. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Motion to Permit Committee of the Whole to Extend Date of Final Report 
Honourable senators, I have one word of explanation. 
There remains only the matter of scheduling and timing. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
