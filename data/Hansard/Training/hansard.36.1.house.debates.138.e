COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 138 
Tuesday, October 20, 1998 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
NUCLEAR AMENDMENT ACT, 1998 
The drunk driver in this case was Christopher Goodstoney. 
I am happy to submit this bill on their behalf.  
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to present three petitions.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
The petitioners point out that the MAI is undemocratic. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
ALLOTTED DAY-APEC INQUIRY 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP): moved: 
We believe that justice demands that they be given this funding. 
Why this unusual request? 
What are their sensitivities? 
Their sensitivities are about democracy. 
They are very sensitive to the whole idea of democracy. 
They are not just sensitive, they are allergic to the whole idea of democracy.  
We cater to them.  
He just does not get it.  
Imagine, this is the argument offered by the Prime Minister. 
This is a pretty low time in Canadian politics. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
I had the opportunity to attend some of the commission hearings. 
There is at the present time a profound imbalance. 
That is profoundly unjust.  
It is not just New Democrats who are making that argument. 
There will not be a level playing field''.  
The allegations and the issues we are dealing with are profoundly serious. 
They were concerned about avoiding embarrassment to those dictators.  
Therein lies the line between a democracy and a police state. 
That is what we saw during the APEC summit.  
We saw banners torn down. 
We saw women, students strip searched. 
Those are police state tactics. 
It was not long ago that we saw those tactics in Chile. 
He has his chance today. 
That is absolutely false. 
The commission has said that it does not have that power.  
More important, it is not just a legal opinion. 
It could not be any clearer than that. 
The federal court itself has said that it does not have any such power.  
This government keeps saying let the commission do its work. 
They deserve to have fair and equitable representation.  
That the motion be amended by adding after the word ``House'' the following: ``strongly'' 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Debate is on the amendment.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Perhaps the member would like to comment on that.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson:
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for those very thoughtful and incisive comments.  
The member is absolutely right. 
I trust that Liberal members will look at this in that light.  
I know many have already done so very generously. 
I join in appealing to Canadians to do that.  
I note once again what this is all about. 
Those signs were torn down. 
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
I played an active role regarding the land mines issue. 
I would really like to know.  
I think Canadians have the right to know that.  
And what are these consequences? 
There is, of course, a fundamental question we must ask ourselves:
Is this in the Canadian public's interest? 
I have no lessons in democracy to learn from anyone. 
I say this in all humility and simplicity. 
This debate is not about defending democracy. 
That is not the issue. 
I cannot help but conclude on a somewhat sad note. 
This does not make any sense. 
I am sorry, but I do not see the logic here.  
In a great majority of cases, the same is true for many political parties. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
I think that is shameful on the part of the government.  
That is how they are undermining the commission's credibility. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Twice the commissioners have asked for counsel to represent the students.  
Mr. Speaker, the question surprises me. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, this is a fundamental question. 
What I believe, Mr. Speaker, is of no importance whatsoever. 
It is the one to decide.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have the privilege of being able to speak to this debate. 
It was a very skilful cross-examination by Mr. Macintosh.  
It fell on Mr. Considine, counsel for the hearing. 
Mr. Considine also said ``I am sorry. 
I do not have time. 
I cannot possibly take a look through these documents to find out what is relevant''.  
The Prime Minister did not like it. 
Mr. Milewski was like a terrier on the Prime Minister's ankle.  
I come back to the question. 
I think that is a question the Canadian public has to take a look at. 
It is clear that this is very high stakes poker for the Prime Minister. 
He is also there aided by two Vancouver lawyers of some repute. 
On the issue of going forward with setting a precedent, the precedent has been set. 
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
They are quasi-judicial tribunals. 
I have appeared before these tribunals. 
Therefore I ask where is the precedent being created?  
I saw what actually happened. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
That is not his role. 
That is the role for counsel for the students.  
I believe he did it- 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
And now what is happening? 
The same thing all over again. 
Then we have the RCMP with its high-priced lawyers as well. 
As a lawyer, I know this. 
This attitude is utterly unacceptable.  
This government is starting to make a habit of doing this. 
When the government tells them to do this or that, they do it. 
They would jump off a bridge if they were told to. 
They have absolutely no independence, they cannot think for themselves.  
The Liberal members voted against that motion. 
So, it would appear that this government is unfortunately allergic to the truth.  
No partisan consideration may be invoked to justify a vote against this motion. 
It is their duty to represent them well. 
They must have a sense of debt toward their electors.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
We are being pulled down to their level of human rights conditions.  
I would be interested in hearing the member expand on that thought.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his remarks.  
We must not forget that they are the future of our society.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I will make my comments and questions short. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
This motion, it is fair to say, is a very worthwhile measure. 
John Diefenbaker described these principles as the heritage of freedom. 
This is not a level playing field. 
Canadians who believe in fairness for all recognize this very basic principle. 
I find it difficult to believe that no one in this Chamber would recognize it. 
They say the government believes this commission will get to the truth.  
The commission has twice requested funding for these students. 
It hears what it wants and it says what it wants. 
The solicitor general has refused this request twice. 
It is very perverse. 
That was the first breach of his oath to office but not his last. 
Did the government support this motion? 
I guess those participants did not include the complainants. 
The government in essence threw down the gauntlet at that point. 
It is completely perverse and indefensible.  
Perhaps this is something that the current solicitor general can understand. 
Yet he has government funded layers there representing his interests.  
However, without those lawyers it is unable to do so. 
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
It is absolutely perverse to suggest otherwise. 
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's comments are on all fours with mine. 
That is why lawyers are often called upon to intervene. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
With respect, what kind of message does that send to our young people? 
Let me read into the record one of the many letters I have received. 
Let us listen to Patrick Monahan who teaches law at Osgoode Hall. 
I am sorry the member for Willowdale is not here. 
He was not using any kind of special hearing device to pick up the conversation. 
It is truly a David and Goliath story that we are witnessing.  
It is a shameful incident in this country. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I commend the hon. member for his comments. 
Mr. Speaker, I think that one of two things should happen. 
It just does not add up.  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened to the member for Palliser attentively. 
He is the Solicitor General of Canada.  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
It is common sense. 
I put that question to the hon. member.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
It is about something very dear to Canadians: justice. 
It is about something as simple as fairness. 
It certainly has not been ignored by others. 
First, there is a clear case of conflict of interest. 
Because of his comments, the solicitor general is in a conflict of interest situation. 
Everyone in the country can see that, except him and the Prime Minister.  
To think otherwise is to be naive.  
He is dead wrong.  
Damaged reputations, of course, are frequently accompanied by a plethora of unhappy consequences. 
The complainants appearing before the Commission are acting as representatives of the public interest. 
They prefer that one party not be unrepresented. 
An equality in representation usually makes for easier and better decision-making.  
I would submit that the APEC affair is no different.  
This House has a moral obligation to see to it that justice is done.  
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
How can anyone have faith with the whole process? 
Mr. Speaker, I welcome the question. 
That is what is so very very serious.  
One is the impeccable impartiality of the solicitor general. 
That goes to the very heart of our justice system.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
He was referring to Lord Acton that power corrupts. 
He then said ``but absence of power corrupts absolutely''. 
It is the duty of the government to seek solutions. 
But there it is, an unholy alliance is there. 
I would simply say to three of the opposition parties, welcome aboard.  
But there it is. 
We have interesting and diverse personalities. 
That is the first point. 
I have maintained that point.  
In fact I do not think they are substantial.  
We believe those objections could be overcome.  
Basically I think the ball is now in the commissioners' court. 
It is for them to make the judgment.  
I was able to attend one day of the commission's hearings in Vancouver. 
Frankly I felt that the commissioners might have interrupted the examination or cross-examination. 
In other words we are saying that funds are available. 
There is a discretion there. 
But I am also worried about fees for lawyers. 
In France at administrative tribunals no one is entitled to a lawyer. 
That makes it simpler and less expensive. 
It is quiet work that gets no headlines. 
It is also in the American bill of rights. 
These are decisions of individual courts in individual concrete cases. 
The case for funding there is very strong. 
I would be very surprised if it does not occur.  
They are entitled to. 
They should also exercise their discretion. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have listened with care to the member for Vancouver Quadra. 
I will put a very specific question to the member. 
He does represent UBC.  
I suggest with respect that the member is misleading this House. 
I am sure it is inadvertent. 
He talked about various legal opinions. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, let us make some corrections. 
I was at the Whistler meeting. 
I spoke to Ron Basford. 
I spoke to the students. 
On the issue of funding, let us face it. 
Do not play politics. 
Do not go after cheap newspaper headlines. 
The hon. member does not.  
What about the federal court.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
It is not a question of who his professor was. 
Maybe the hon. member from across the way thinks he is above all of us.  
So let us get down to the substance. 
Let us cease playing political games. 
I want funding for students. 
She is there for the headlines.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
I did not hear a clear answer on the last question posed.  
Mr. Speaker, the lesson has been lost. 
The issue here is the funding.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we hear chirping that that was a poor answer. 
The answer was bang on. 
I did not think that was appropriate.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
So we have a difference of opinion.  
It is absolutely clear that is exactly what this is. 
To see the the unholy alliance lining up is really quite remarkable.  
Those are his words. 
Today that same member is trying to marginalize the public complaints commission. 
He is trying to suggest that in some obscure way this commission is unfair. 
I would like to examine the billings. 
What is going on here? 
She used the example of the Dubin inquiry. 
Let us talk about that. 
Canadians know what that was. 
The inquiry is named after Chief Justice Dubin. 
He sat in a judicial inquiry role. 
He had people who were accused of breaking the law come before him. 
This is not a judicial inquiry. 
It is really quite remarkable. 
What is the commission? 
The proof that this is a political game and a political football is here. 
The Reform member does not seem to get the point. 
The difference quite clearly is that this is politically staged. 
He is virtually walking out arm and arm with the students. 
He is giving them advice. 
He is encouraging them to leave. 
It is a wonderful photo op. 
Do they think the Canadian people are stupid? 
They can see what is going on. 
It is scandal envy. 
They sees the press and the Republicans.  
The Reform Party gets all its advice and policies from south of the border. 
We all know that. 
Reformers imagine getting the Prime Minister subpoenaed to appear in front of a commission. 
He said: ``It seems there was no other alternative. 
I do not know if Gallagher is right. 
The students have been charged with nothing. 
We are not talking about their legal rights being in jeopardy. 
They used pepper spray. 
I do not know if it is appropriate to use this. 
I am not a commissioner on the complaints commission.  
However, the feeding frenzy that is going on over here is totally laughable. 
Let the commission do its job.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is nice to know that rhetoric has not died. 
Let me get right to the point. 
The commission was set up to examine complaints against the RCMP. 
The commission has an excellent reputation. 
That is what the question is.  
Why does he not admit that?  
They know that this party called to have the charter of rights abolished. 
That is their idea of protecting civil rights. 
The issue is not laughable, they are.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to the member. 
Mr. Speaker, I will give a very direct answer. 
Not one of the students is under any cloud or suspicion of wrongdoing. 
The students do not need legal counsel. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
He has taught English at Lindsay Thurber high school since 1986. 
He was at this event. 
The kind of person he is tells it all. 
He served as a board member of the Alberta multiculturalism commission. 
I think this says it all: 
He quotes the source of that statistic.  
Now we have to look at this whole situation. 
We have to look at how the government has treated this whole affair. 
Even one Liberal spoke in favour of that. 
The hon. member for Vancouver Quadra was removed from committee the next day. 
That is how the government responded to that.  
I think Canadians are now seeing the sort of person he really is. 
He really is that kind of person.  
They are obviously demonstrating that they have none of those features.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
That is just the point.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it was interesting to listen to the debate this morning. 
To an extent they are right. 
The government has used the excuse that it is an informal process. 
I have heard comments that students are not being charged with anything. 
Neither is the RCMP at this time. 
The commission is not mandated to sanction or impose penalties. 
That is not the commission's role.  
Another issue I would like to raise is the question of fairness. 
I have heard from constituents. 
One of them is a colleague of the member for Vancouver Quadra. 
Some of them do not necessarily agree with the students' protest. 
No Canadian feels that in this case it is an equal playing field.  
Even federal Liberal members in British Columbia feel that it is not fair.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Does she see that as a possible option?  
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
The court has made a ruling on that. 
The lawyers are not required. 
The process can function quite well without them. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
What does the hon. member think about this arrogance and the jokes?  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Scarborough East.  
Civilian oversight is a time honoured principle in democratic societies. 
Police officers work in difficult circumstances. 
It is a task we believe police carry out with dignity and with fairness.  
Canadians expect police to do exactly that. 
There are times however when the use of force is drawn into question. 
Civilian oversight mechanisms now exist in almost all jurisdictions in Canada. 
That is important to note.  
The PCC is an independent body and not part of the RCMP. 
The PCC has been in existence for over 10 years. 
I also want to review the mandate of the RCMP PCC. 
It is not a decision making body. 
Each year the PCC receives approximately 1,000 complaints from the public regarding the RCMP.  
The public complaints commission has moved successfully in that direction since its inception.  
One way to help us do that in law enforcement is through civilian oversight. 
Witnesses can be called for example, and reports and other documents can be subpoenaed. 
Policing is everybody's business, everybody in Canada. 
Without effective community relations, police work is hindered. 
Crimes may not be reported and witnesses may not come forward.  
It is very important that communities have confidence in their police forces. 
Police officers are accountable to the communities they serve and rightfully so. 
I believe that we have that independence in the public complaints commission. 
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I have listened with some interest to the hon. member. 
I think the comments he makes about the police in this country are important.  
They have to exercise great care in making difficult judgments. 
Madam Speaker, I happen to believe that we do have a fair process in place. 
I happen to believe that the truth will emerge through this process. 
It seems to me that over time we will see the facts come out.  
They will be able to judge and judge properly. 
The process is one that is intact. 
We will see precisely that happen.  
Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the question.  
As the member points out, it provides a level playing field.  
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today and speak on this issue.  
It was created in 1986. 
With that I agree.  
It is observably impartial. 
It is not adversarial. 
This is not the place to conduct a trial.  
It seems reasonably clear that the commission does not have such authority. 
The PCC is already vested with broad authority. 
The rules of admissibility are waived. 
The commission counsel will take all participants through the evidence. 
If so, the participants will then be given another opportunity to speak.  
I would suggest to hon. members that they reject this motion. 
This is not a motion that is appropriate. 
There will be a full and fair hearing. 
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
There are women involved in the pay equity issue. 
These are all decisions being taken by this Liberal government. 
One would almost think that we have a government that wants to silence Canadians.  
Why were the students were not charged? 
Mr. Speaker, I would hope that particular question would be addressed by the commission itself.  
I want to speak to the issue of the level playing field.  
First, a complainant is just that, a complainant. 
The complainant is not accused of anything. 
Their liberties are not at risk. 
They are then afforded an opportunity to bring forward that complaint to a panel. 
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
It certainly is not a level playing field. 
Madam Speaker, I will speak to that issue. 
On that issue all government members are on the same page with the students. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
I rise in this House today to speak on a motion of utmost importance. 
The motion before us today is simple. 
That time it was their turn to get the prime ministerial pepper treatment.  
From now on, no one can talk of isolated facts. 
These members should rise and vote in favour of the most elementary justice. 
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Then he went back on his word.  
This is a frequent occurrence. 
We have seen it happen throughout the country.  
The government opposite talks a lot. 
It has a hard time answering our questions. 
Yesterday, Canadian students made three requests to the Prime Minister. 
It is important to mention them again. 
First, they are asking that adequate funding be provided to pay for lawyers' fees. 
I think this is a matter of fairness.  
Again, this is a matter of fairness.  
A real apology, as the hon. member says.  
It does not make sense. 
The commissioners are being put in an untenable situation. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I was delighted to hear what my colleague from Rosemont had to say. 
Now we have the figures. 
We will be having a vote on this today. 
Some hon. members have had the courage to take a stand. 
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
But both of them are saying nothing. 
And what will there be to show for it? 
In his defence, he said: 
But there is no complaint against the students. 
Who is doing the attacking, and who is being attacked? 
I quote him again: 
That is the ultimate insult. 
The Prime Minister's attitude is unworthy of a government leader. 
Must he stoop so low and depict protesting students as violent? 
Why raise such spectres? 
These are important questions which we must put to this government. 
I apologized to her on behalf of the police.  
This is a matter of fundamental justice.  
Mr. Carmen Provenzano (Sault Ste. Marie, Lib.):
It is the members opposite who are wearing the mask on this entire issue. 
That is where they wear the mask. 
That also brings its problems. 
So it is they who wear the mask.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for the question. 
These are fundamental principles.  
It sets an important precedent. 
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, it gives me pleasure to enter the debate on this motion.  
It is an unusual debate today. 
When all the smoke has cleared, what is the damage that has been done? 
The damage seems to be some hurt feelings.  
What is the process? 
That, as I understand the complaints procedure, is just that. 
A person can be a complainant and appear before the commissioner. 
There has never been any provision to provide legal fees for complainants.  
The way members are talking in this House, one would think we were all there. 
Everyone seems to have a definition of exactly what happened. 
Just give us more money. 
How long does it go on? 
What precedents are we setting for other similar incidents?  
It being 2 p.m., we will now proceed to Statements by Members.  
CANADIAN MISSION IN CHIAPAS 
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
The move has proven to be very successful. 
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
Together we must continue to do all we can to protect Canada's children.  
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):
I congratulate the ICC for its foresight and political leadership. 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik), Lib.):
But our government's message remains unchanged: caution is the order of the day. 
We must maintain optimal conditions for a lasting economic recovery. 
Fortunately, we are not following the advice of the opposition parties. 
Their idea is to increase the deficit in the years ahead. 
Perhaps they think we will not eventually have to pay the piper.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Telus Mobility provides wireless communication services to Alberta. 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
There was also a diamond connection to last week's biggest surprise. 
THE LATE NORMAND RACICOT 
Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau, Lib.):
People were proud to say ``Normand is a friend of mine''.  
I extend my deepest condolences to his family.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
LESTER B. PEARSON CENTRE 
Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma-Manitoulin, Lib.):
The centre has been instrumental in the development- 
The hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Member spoke in Spanish: ] 
Many were thrown to their deaths from helicopters. 
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the circus is in town. 
The hon. member for Bourassa.  
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
I am sure that the students of Cegep de Maisonneuve- 
The hon. member for Tobique-Mactaquac.  
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Congratulations again to the entire PC caucus from all of us. 
As they prepare for next year's election, we wish them Godspeed.  
WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH 
Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, let us get this straight. 
Then this morning he referred to water cannons.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I am sure the police will make the proper decision.  
I want to know the truth from the commission.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
We were not relying on hearsay. 
We were not relying on the unreliable memory of the solicitor general.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I am very proud of it.  
They did a fantastic job at the G-7 meeting in Halifax. 
The hon. member for Kootenay-Columbia.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Why is he so stubborn? 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I want the commission to look into that. 
It is the opposition that keeps raising these problems.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Why will he not apologize?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I have said many times I have no problem apologizing to anybody. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The RCMP does this very well in all sorts of circumstances. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the commission is examining the incidents. 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
It was intended to be informal. 
I think it is very important. 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the Prime Minister.  
The government said no. 
Earlier this month the commission asked a second time. 
The government said no again. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
This system has existed for 10 years. 
There is no accusation against any student. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
The commission itself says pay. 
The federal court says pay. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
The hon. solicitor general.  
That is what we are here to preserve.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
I spent my entire life fighting crime and criminals. 
The Prime Minister here has been fighting students- 
The hon. member for Calgary Northeast.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The employment insurance system covers 78% of unemployed workers.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
The people who ought to be covered are properly covered.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
He instructed his provincial wing not to run a candidate. 
He called the process supported by 90% of Albertans a joke. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The people in Alberta went to vote yesterday in very few numbers. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this government is laughing at democracy. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have a Senate that is not elected. 
We have a Senate that has been given to us by the Brits. 
It is like the House of Lords. 
And here I am, a French Canadian from Quebec defending a British tradition.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
That is just not true.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We have set up programs for them. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
I would prefer that members not use the word ``theft'' in their questions.  
He is a fund looter.  
The Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Instead he blew two-thirds of the $9 billion surplus. 
He just spent it away.  
Canadians were promised tax relief when the budget was balanced. 
Canadians have had it with the empty promises. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The Reform Party voted against it.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
I think the finance minister owes them big time.  
Canadians need tax relief now. 
When is he going to fulfil his promise? 
When are they going to get real tax relief?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We want to reduce taxes. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We have done that.  
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Trade.  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member from British Columbia for raising the question.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
He is now rising in the House and arguing against his party's policy. 
Is the same thing going to happen to Dick Harris that happened to Jim Hart?  
The hon. member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Canadians are in a net 55% deficit on any wage gain.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
What the Reform Party is recommending is that Canadian property owners and municipalities- 
The hon. member for Acadie-Bathurst.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Why does the minister deny the reality most unemployed Canadians are facing?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The long term unemployed were not covered previously. 
The system never applied to individuals who have never worked.  
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
What he is saying is absolutely wrong.  
The figures quoted in the House today are wrong. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, 78% of the Canadian labour force- 
The hon. Minister for Human Resources Development.  
Those who are not covered by the system- 
Paul Martin has all the money. 
That's the problem.  
That's where the money has gone. 
It's the finance minister who is spending it.  
He should be ashamed.  
Colleagues, I appeal to you. 
When a question is asked, surely courtesy would demand that we listen to the answer. 
I appeal to you, my colleagues, to please contain yourselves.  
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are quite concerned with these forced landings of various aircraft. 
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
On the question of kapton, we are looking at the situation. 
Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member raises a very important issue. 
The hon. member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Since that time nothing has been done.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member is quite wrong in saying that nothing has been done. 
We are also looking at other strategies that we believe will be effective.  
Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):
The people in my riding want to be supplied again with drinking water. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is quite correct, this is a very serious problem. 
We have taken remedial measures.  
ALLOTTED DAY-APEC INQUIRY 
The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the amendment.  
I am in my 11th year of elected office. 
I would even get a camera. 
Unfortunately this is the environment that we live in. 
It surprises me when an issue accelerates the way this one has. 
It is a very serious issue. 
The system acts on their behalf. 
The system will then act to protect the rights of that citizen. 
That is the kind of country that we have.  
We have a serious charge. 
I am not going to prejudge it. 
I do not know, as I was not there. 
I did not witness it. 
I have been on both sides of demonstrations. 
I grew up in an RCMP household. 
I am not going to prejudge this situation.  
It has had 3,000 cases in its history. 
In this country we have always felt that the commission defended our rights.  
What are we creating? 
The solicitor general is not just my colleague, he is a friend. 
I have worked with him for a long time. 
Ed Greenspon wrote an article in the Globe yesterday. 
I know Greenspon and I know his work. 
I think he is a good reporter. 
Is that a problem? 
There is something wrong in this debate.  
The commission has to investigate. 
The students are not being charged with anything. 
If the RCMP have acted improperly, they should be dealt with. 
If they have not, they deserve our support.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Unfortunately there are some facts missing from what he had to say.  
He said he was surprised by the acceleration of this incident. 
He cannot understand why opposition members are concerned about this. 
The truth of the matter is that it is Canadians who are concerned about this. 
They are concerned about the actions that were taken at APEC. 
The Prime Minister is the one who ducks and weaves. 
That is what we are talking about here.  
It is our role and our job to keep this government accountable for its actions. 
We do not apologize for it. 
In fact, we promise the government more of the same.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
We need all the facts on the table. 
They are not funny and they certainly are hurtful for the people involved.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
It is an important motion. 
I think it is a simply worded motion. 
There are not questions of evidence that are not understood by one party. 
That does not happen when there is only legal counsel for one side.  
It is unfair because they do not understand it.  
But this is an extraordinary hearing. 
I am not prejudging it. 
These are extraordinary hearings. 
There are those who say that there are more important issues. 
I come from an area of the country that has huge unemployment problems. 
Justice is the foundation of a civil society. 
Without it there is anarchy.  
The Prime Minister smiles, jokes and says that there are other issues. 
The price of freedom is eternal vigilance. 
The courage to look after our rights is something we have pride in. 
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his comments. 
If there is no legal representation in this area, how will that evidence be pursued? 
How will it be examined? 
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
Without proper legal representation, that trail is left to the students themselves. 
I have very real questions regarding this forum even getting that far. 
This is why I wanted a judicial inquiry into the matter to begin with. 
I dare say few members of this House understand those rules. 
I dare say many of them would not understand the rules.  
I think that is the answer to the hon. member's question.  
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, let us be clear here. 
This is a tremendous waste of our democratic process. 
Why in the name of God should they have legal counsel? 
The RCMP is perfectly capable of providing protection. 
The Prime Minister's office is not an expert in that area.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
The question before the House today is that straightforward and that simple.  
I was in my riding of Vancouver East last week. 
They have stopped listening to what the people of Canada have to say.  
That is why those students were protesting. 
The government has made it clear where it stands.  
I think it was a very sad irony that that sort of situation exists.  
The Prime Minister did not learn from that. 
He went on to a second and a third joke. 
They have had a complete lack of support from the government. 
It brings a great deal of shame on us.  
I remember listening to Mr. Nelson Mandela in the House in September. 
This motion today is very simple and straightforward. 
The question is straightforward. 
We have called for a full judicial inquiry. 
We ask the government members to have the courage to support this motion.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I thank the member for her remarks.  
We know that was certainly the case in many instances. 
Quite the contrary is true. 
Those economies are now in complete shatters. 
There are people who are facing unemployment, hunger and devastation.  
I believe these issues are related. 
They in no way threatened the security of the leaders or the summit itself. 
To state that is simply false.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time.  
We cannot make allegations and at the same time be judge and jury. 
I question the agenda of the party that introduced the motion.  
Then they concluded that it was a fact. 
No limits were mentioned. 
I do not think the member who introduced the motion was very serious about it.  
I will leave it to the judgment of the people.  
We do not have to know the rules of procedures of the commission. 
The commission is a friend of the Canadian citizenry at large.  
I have faith in the commission. 
I have appeared before the UI board. 
I have appeared before the CPP tribunal as a member of parliament. 
I have appeared before the immigration appeal board.  
I did not need the argument of lawyers before me.  
That is the mandate of the RCMP Public Complaints Commission.  
It is not about a criminal proceeding. 
I can assure members that the commission is truly an independent commission.  
I am convinced we will have the truth and we will have justice. 
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
I would like to see the government make it a fair process.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:
I have noted that the RCMP receives on average 1,000 complaints a year. 
How about the citizen who appeared before the UI board? 
How about the citizen who appeared before the veterans board?  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:
The situation here is not as painted by the opposition. 
We will be able to arrive at the truth. 
Did they ask for funding for those 1,000 citizens every year? 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
I stress the words act in the public interest. 
The complainants face no such consequences.  
It is not a court of law. 
I think that has been well demonstrated so far.  
It has an international reputation for dealing with complaints seriously and effectively. 
In this letter I wrote: 
I believe I am right in my decision. 
Let us let them do their work.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I have listened to the solicitor general. 
I want to ask the minister a very important question about the issue of funding. 
Madam Speaker, the federal court has been quite clear on that. 
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Madam Speaker, the Solicitor General has not answered the question. 
Twice now the Solicitor General has refused to pay. 
In this particular case, the complaint is special.  
Twice the commission has asked the Solicitor General to pay for the students. 
The federal court has spoken. 
A slew of lawyers is being paid at huge cost. 
Why is the Solicitor General refusing to help the complainants?  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Because they require independence in order to get the job done.  
The reality is that the commission counsel exists specifically to assist the complainants. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
There is not unanimous consent.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Our problems are not with the commission.  
Figure your own way out of that. 
It is your turn at the bat.'' 
It is as clear as that. 
The commission is important. 
There is fear of creating a precedent. 
The precedent has been set. 
First, provisions of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms are being attacked. 
That is one precedent. 
This has never been done before. 
This process is tainted with political influence. 
It is a matter of credibility.  
The Solicitor General said it. 
This is a quasi-judicial administrative tribunal.  
Salaries paid to inmates are rather low. 
So, these women got some help.  
Nobody objected to that. 
Nobody said ``we are setting a precedent. 
This is very disturbing. 
Go back to the dressing room for a few months. 
We will make a substitution. 
I hope our Liberal colleagues will support the NDP motion. 
The B.C. Liberals also agree that the students should get help. 
Things are being blocked here in Ottawa at the PMO.  
I do not understand. 
I hope they will.  
It is totally disgusting.  
He did not invent the wheel either. 
The Bill of Rights existed under Diefenbaker.  
This is very serious. 
That would be a beginning, but it refuses to do so. 
This makes sure the plaintiffs will be at a total disadvantage.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
In the fall of 1997, the Prime Minister gave orders for repression of the students. 
His repression of the students continues.  
There is something very hollow sounding about the government's arguments. 
Has it forgotten the court challenges program? 
What is it afraid of? 
In my opinion, those involved are afraid of damaging their almighty reputation. 
Already they are calling for the solicitor general's resignation. 
And what about the Prime Minister's reputation?  
The problems it has incurred are directly related to the actions of the Prime Minister. 
They are being bypassed.  
Pepper spray is a banned substance in Canada. 
Plain common sense would tell us that those remarks were inappropriate. 
However, the Prime Minister makes no apologies. 
I conclude he must believe he is above that.  
The students have been victimized in the affirmation of their charter of rights. 
It is sad to watch this hypocrisy before us now. 
They have gone on witch hunts in the Airbus allegations. 
The bullying arrogance of the government has become its greatest curse. 
Canadians are beginning to see the true colours of this government. 
This motion does not ask the government to admit any wrongdoing. 
Let us give the students the funding they need to present their case. 
Let us all use our common sense and do the right thing. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
I have just one simple question for the member.  
I would just like to get the member's opinion about this.  
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
The introductory message from the chair is quite to the point in this regard. 
It is this kind of pragmatic and practical approach that Canadians find reasonable. 
The commission chair writes: 
This is important for my colleagues to hear: 
The public has a high regard for the police. 
The RCMP has given Canadians exemplary police services over the years. 
They are determined to maintain that high standard. 
The public is getting the most exhaustive examination of the issue possible.  
The government cannot edit the report; the commission presents it as its findings.  
It is plain partisan politics, pure and simple. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
The member talked about the RCMP and what a great job they are doing. 
Yes, the RCMP do a wonderful job in this country. 
They would have been handled by the government of the day. 
Mr. Speaker, you heard it yourself. 
It is my colleagues in this party who are standing up now to speak. 
The member's colleagues are undermining our democratic institutions and our democratic process. 
The commission is an independent body and not a court of law. 
It is obvious he is not serving the institution as well as he should be. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it saddens me to hear this level of debate from that member. 
I am fully supportive of the public complaints commission process. 
Canadians have every faith in our democratic institutions. 
They know that anybody who appears before this commission will have a fair hearing. 
They would have been the first ones to stand and attack the government.  
They cannot have it both ways. 
They have to let the police do their work. 
This is a police initiative. 
Let them do their work. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
It was very loud. 
There were hardly any questions of any substance.  
It was a serious problem. 
And we are not past that crisis yet. 
There was not a word in the House on that.  
I am saddened because I remember. 
I will take another step along in this argument. 
This has caused great controversy in this House. 
There was not even any control in his own party.  
That is what it is. 
It is a media game.  
I will give members a classic example. 
Yesterday in this House we debated Bill C-54. 
This is important legislation that deals with the privacy of individuals. 
This is important legislation. 
The Bloc Quebecois responded many times with very compelling arguments.  
Only one Conservative spoke. 
Most of the exchange occurred between the Liberals and the Bloc Quebecois.  
Who cares about good governance in this country? 
People who engage in those tactics should be ashamed.  
But I expected much more from the Reform Party and I am disappointed. 
I think members of the Bloc Quebecois have acquitted themselves quite reasonably in this instance. 
At least they debate real legislation.  
Whatever happened to candour? 
Why can they not speak from their hearts? 
Why do they have to get lawyers?  
Is that what members on the other side want? 
Are they out to benefit lawyers?  
I am very surprised. 
You are following the example of the press. 
You are allowing yourself to be led into controversies that have no substance.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
I would like to know, exactly what does the member think about democracy?  
They died so we could have freedom of speech and freedom of expression. 
In a democratic country we have the right to do this. 
It is true that a commission was set up to deal with this issue. 
Unfortunately, the government had a blabbermouth. 
Now we are getting into a legal process. 
Those members had better recognize that and recognize it now. 
He cannot give me lessons on democracy. 
That does not happen in other countries.  
We talk about the incident. 
I was not there when the incident occurred with the demonstrators. 
That was the era of the protest march. 
We protested all kinds of things. 
We sought that type of response. 
It was a game. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
The member said time was being wasted and he was ashamed. 
I think he is completely confused. 
That was holding up students to ridicule.  
What kind of Prime Minister is this? 
Mr. Speaker, shame on the opposition.  
The member opposite illustrated it perfectly. 
I was very concerned. 
Do not ever mistake that. 
But we Canadians do not prejudge people.  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
The complaints commission is to deal with two or three issues which are very important. 
That leaves it up to the commission counsel. 
That is not good enough.  
The commission must have the capacity to do that.  
Was excessive police force used? 
The commission must have the capacity to do that. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House divided on the amendment, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the amendment lost.  
The next question is on the main motion.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Shall I put the question on the main motion?  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the motion lost.  
Is there agreement to proceed in such a fashion?  
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
(Bill read the second time and referred to a committee) 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
The House resumed from October 9 consideration of the motion.  
(The House divided on the motion, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the motion lost.  
Mr. Speaker, Bloc Quebecois members vote in favour of the motion.  
Mr. Speaker, the New Democrats present vote yes to this motion.  
Mr. Speaker, the Progressive Conservative members present vote yes to this motion.  
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried. 
(Bill read the second time and referred to a committee) 
The question is on the motion. 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
(Bill read the second time and referred to a committee) 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Therefore the problem is obviously much larger today.  
Car theft has become a costly nuisance throughout this country. 
Each province is suffering from this growing problem.  
Sadly, joyriding often leads to tragedy. 
This headline has been seen in every town across Canada. 
All in all, this problem affects every individual in Canada. 
This private member's bill is a perfect example of this theory. 
But he also acknowledged that they need assistance from all levels of government. 
There was never any consecutive sentencing that took place.  
He served 30 days consecutive for each of these vicious crimes. 
I believe a deterrent is one method of preventing crime. 
This would serve as a deterrent. 
We need to send the message that they will be severely punished for stealing vehicles. 
Here is an opportunity. 
Where did I put that thing?  
It is quite an experience. 
The inside had liquor spilled all over. 
All kinds of drug use went on in it. 
They really violated it. 
It was not investigated at any length to determine who had stolen it. 
Consequently many are not solved.  
Two mechanisms are currently in place to deal with such a situation. 
We already have the tools at our disposal to deal with the situation.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
There is a problem, however. 
Motor vehicle theft is indeed a significant problem, we must agree. 
But is Bill C-219 the solution? 
I do not agree.  
Excessive regulating does not solve all the problems. 
With this discretionary power, a judge can impose a sentence that is fair and appropriate.  
We have everything we need in the Code to resolve it.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
I commend the hon. member for Wild Rose. 
The sentence for such an offence would be a term of imprisonment for one year. 
The sentence would be cumulative. 
It would be served consecutively as opposed to concurrently.  
It would bring about greater accountability. 
It would certainly send that message to the criminal element.  
Oftentimes the theft of a motor vehicle is a very personalized type of crime. 
I would therefore hope that there is support for the motion. 
Quite bluntly, police officers are getting the shaft from this Liberal government. 
It is quite the contrary. 
I applaud the member for Wild Rose for taking such an initiative. 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
However, like the member for Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, I am an attorney. 
I will not repeat what they have said. 
We have talked about that already today.  
Punishment is twofold under section 334. 
Our Criminal Code does take into account the seriousness of the offences.  
Does it mean with consent? 
The hon. member mentioned that we have a lot of youth crime. 
Under section 249 the dangerous operation of motor vehicles is dealt with. 
I concur with my colleagues on sentencing. 
The whole area of sentencing must be looked at within the act itself.  
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
We just heard that from the other side.  
What is wrong with that?  
Is this justice in this member's eyes? 
I have to use a vehicle to get to work. 
I need that in order to supply a paycheque in order to feed my family.  
Liberal law is right. 
It absolutely makes no sense at all.  
It was one of the hottest topics in our constituency. 
It was one of the hottest topics. 
It is escalating according to the police reports. 
We are tired of trying it. 
The victims are tired of trying it. 
Many have been victimized more than once. 
We are sick and tired of the soft approach. 
It has been an increase, not a decrease. 
So where is the government taking us? 
The criminals know that because they have nothing to be afraid of.  
So what is there to be afraid of? 
Nothing more is going to happen to them. 
That is just the way our system works. 
He or she is the innocent victim but nothing happens because of it.  
Believe me, it works. 
This is the wrong attitude. 
It has totally gone out the window. 
The bill specifically states ``in the use of crime''. 
It now becomes a lethal weapon. 
It is a very dangerous weapon yet the government does not care.  
The government says our system adequately addresses this. 
That is a joke. 
If it was being addressed, it would not be escalating the way it is. 
The police support this bill.  
It is not serving us. 
Read the papers, see what is going on in this country. 
Talk to people who have had their vehicles stolen. 
Talk to people who get their vehicles back totally gutted out with nothing left. 
They can't fight crime. 
They have to keep their jobs.  
Keep their jobs all right. 
It addresses a crime in this country and the government totally refuses to listen. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
I will repeat that question because it is an important one.  
I was pleased with the minister's answer in June, which went like this: 
The minister went on to say: 
But they are eligible under the new criteria. 
The amendments have been prejudicial to women in this country, including expectant mothers. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am sorry, but the hon. member's time is up.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, the member's underlying question is an important one. 
On Monday the department issued its findings. 
That is what it was originally intended to do. 
We are not hiding behind the report. 
Some unemployed persons were never meant to be covered by EI at all. 
For example, self-employed Canadians have never been eligible. 
They need the tools to help themselves. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The time has run out.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
What was his response? 
He said the member for Palliser had misunderstood him. 
Needless to say, the Solicitor General's response left a lot to be desired.  
On the other hand, I have to say that his response surprised no one. 
He has refused to admit that he discussed confidential matters in public. 
He is incapable of recognizing that his behaviour was completely inappropriate for a minister.  
The debate in the House today shows that very clearly.  
This brings me back to my original question. 
On October 8, I asked the solicitor general to resign. 
Yet he will not resign.  
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
It is not my place to comment publicly on a private conversation.  
However, a decision was made in this House with regard to this issue. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 7.49 p.m.)
