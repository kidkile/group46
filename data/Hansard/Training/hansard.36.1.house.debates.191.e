EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 191 
Monday, March 8, 1999 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I ask unanimous consent of the House for the following order: 
I believe you would find unanimous consent for this motion.  
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
(Motion agreed to and bill referred to a committee) 
Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that we suspend the sitting of the House until noon.  
(The sitting of the House was suspended at 11.07 a.m.) 
The House resumed at 12 p.m. 
FOREIGN PUBLISHERS ADVERTISING SERVICES ACT 
BILL C-55-TIME ALLOCATION MOTION 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.) moved: 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
The debate coming from certain quarters has puzzled me somewhat. 
Today we are debating the 21 amendments proposed by the Reform Party. 
My friend says it is mean. 
I am just describing reality.  
Mr. Speaker, my friend says that this is an inaccurate comment. 
I do not think it is inaccurate at all.  
I stand to be corrected but that is my interpretation.  
That would be good.  
I was sending up a trial balloon. 
I could not believe that anyone would want to delete the heritage department. 
The enthusiasm comes loud and clear and emphasizes the point. 
I thank my Reform Party friends for the firming up of that position. 
It is important that these positions be clarified.  
I am actually dumbfounded. 
I look specifically at the film industry. 
Think of our struggling film industry. 
We are proud of that. 
Nevertheless, it is a continual struggle.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
We are proud to be in line with the public's priorities in this respect.  
As we all know that has been proven to be completely specious.  
Not a single Canadian has said that to me.  
What would that mean? 
This bill is plainly and simply irresponsible. 
The government claims it is necessary. 
That is not an issue.  
I suggest that we need in examining legislation to make reference to first principles. 
I know it is a dirty word. 
Where is the harm in that? 
I simply cannot grasp the rationale for this bill.  
We ought to clearly abide by the rulings of the World Trade Organization. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
He also pointed out the benefits of free trade. 
That is something which I believe Canadians fundamentally support.  
What is free trade about? 
It is about the free exchange of commodities. 
It is also about fair trade. 
They were killing our lakes and rivers. 
The Americans said that they were not so sure the science was conclusive. 
We showed them the science. 
We knew it was the right thing to do. 
Protecting Canadian culture as well is the right thing to do.  
By splitting our vote the Reform Party almost sacrificed the free trade agreement. 
This is an individual who now wants us to unite and come together. 
It was his party's fundamental economic principles that actually attacked- 
Ten years of Brian Mulroney.  
Yes, the member mentions Brian Mulroney. 
We are an exporting nation. 
That is why the Progressive Conservative Party is supporting it.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
I do so on behalf of the residents of my area of Waterloo-Wellington.  
We must have Canadian magazines that are vigorous and viable. 
For 40 years the federal government has supported our domestic magazine publishing industry. 
That cultural policy has been a clear success. 
Eighteen of the top twenty magazines available here are Canadian.  
Such revenues generate more money than subscriptions or newsstand sales combined. 
Canadian magazines simply cannot survive without sufficient advertising revenues.  
That is why Bill C-55 is important. 
That is important to note.  
In other words, they can be let off with a warning.  
The level of fines must be high enough to be an effective deterrent.  
This measure deals only with the supply of advertising services to Canadian advertisers. 
The Canadian market will continue to be one of the most open in the world. 
It is certainly something Canadians want, deserve and expect. 
We need to move expeditiously on it.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
In fact they are breaking our trade agreements. 
Canada is wrong in this case. 
The heritage minister is wrong and the government is wrong. 
The United States would be completely justified in doing that. 
That brings with it some very serious problems.  
We do not know exactly where the Americans would choose to hit. 
I will talk a bit about that in just a couple of minutes.  
The very basic question is who supports the bill or the legislation. 
When we ask that question we realize it is an awfully short list. 
It pretty much boils down to a list of large publishing companies. 
That is who supports the legislation. 
We have a real problem with the legislation. 
I have a big problem with the bill. 
I have a problem with the heritage minister bringing forth the legislation. 
I cannot support it for that reason.  
I want to talk about the people back home. 
I am a farmer and many of the people in my constituency are farmers. 
We also see unfair import restrictions into Asian countries such as Korea and Japan. 
Those too are causing severe harm to our farmers.  
It is the same situation for alfalfa producers. 
That cannot be right. 
That is wrong and it is unfair. 
These unfair trade practices have to end.  
I have more confidence in them than that. 
They have done well and they will continue to do well. 
They do not need this piece of legislation. 
They would have to find a way of working through it.  
They will not help, quite frankly. 
I cannot allow that to happen.  
I will respond to some of the comments from the other side of the House. 
We heard a comment about dictatorship. 
It seems to me that any rolling over is being done by the Reform Party. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The member opposite is straying a long way from the subject. 
They are not underneath a Liberal dictatorship.  
This bill speaks to that. 
It is our heritage. 
It is who we are. 
It is constantly trying to increase its market share across the globe.  
Because of this essential difference, we never play on the same field. 
It is not rolling over.  
Bill C-55 does not violate the NAFTA or our other international trade obligations. 
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
The fact is this is a very profound infringement on the freedoms of Canadian business. 
That is what Bill C-55 is doing. 
That is what this bill is saying.  
It is about dictatorship in the strongest form. 
What happened to democracy? 
What happened to freedom of choice in this country? 
It is a joke.  
Let me give three examples of how the Liberals protect Canadianism.  
People were threatened with criminal fines and sanctions. 
Is that the great protector of Canadianism? 
The Liberals are a little silent now. 
It is a hypocritical position for them to take in the strongest form.  
This one is really the biggest joke of all. 
This Liberal government, these great protectors of Canadian culture and heritage- 
This is about profound intrusion into the rights and freedoms of Canadians. 
That is the mandate of this government. 
It has been since Liberal hero Pierre Trudeau came on the scene. 
Unfortunately he is still obviously having an influence on this government. 
Members of the Liberal government are these great protectors of Canadian democracy. 
They should be called the great intruders.  
You have to go in with a position of strength.  
The minister has just put Canada in a very tenuous position. 
There is not a hope. 
We are going to see retaliation.  
That would be a good place to start. 
It is a sad day in Canada. 
Is that the real reason? 
Maybe it is a personal monetary thing. 
Maybe there is going to be a big payoff. 
It is a joke.  
Is the House ready for the question?  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I was very remiss in my presentation. 
I am afraid that is not a point of order.  
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I think he should clarify that in this crucial debate.  
Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys is absolutely correct. 
They must adhere to certain prescribed standards.  
One provides food for the body and the other for the spirit. 
Unfortunately, they tend to neglect the second aspect all too often.  
We will begin with the hon. member for Malpeque.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
One quarter of the city's 26,000 inhabitants served as volunteers. 
Bravo to all of them for their role in the games' success.  
An award was even named after him.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
It was truly moving to see these young future Olympians in competition. 
We wish them all well.  
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
All of our athletes and our teams performed well.  
They have made us all very proud.  
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
Film is very much a part of our culture. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
In Zimbabwe, President Mugabe has been silencing all opposition. 
Journalists have been jailed and tortured. 
PUVIRNITUQ CO-OP HOTEL 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
Air Inuit has regular weekday flights between Montreal and the community.  
Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Let us all work to protect this legacy throughout the world.  
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, today is Commonwealth Day. 
The rich variety of music is as diverse as the Commonwealth itself. 
Happy Commonwealth Day to all.  
THE LATE JOE DIMAGGIO 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
He has gone to rest. 
May he rest in peace.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
On Thursday the window of opportunity closes for another decade. 
Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert, BQ):
This is definitely an improvement, but we still have a long way to go.  
Compared to Scandinavian countries, this is a disaster.  
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY 
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
That is thirteen billion dollars.  
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY 
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP):
Women are tired of this double standard. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Will they bend to the whip or will they do what is right? 
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
According to her, close to 70% of women are part time workers.  
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Not so long women were not entitled to own property. 
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY 
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Let me read that motion again: 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will tell you what pits families against each other. 
The government has opted in budget after budget to let this discrimination continue. 
I would judge that the question is at best borderline. 
I see the hon. minister is on her feet. 
I will permit her to answer the question if she wants to.  
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
The minister can talk about graphs. 
There is nothing fair about that. 
The lack of understanding is on the government side.  
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
This information does not come out of some ideology or some harebrained philosophy. 
The facts speak for themselves.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
There is nothing confusing about that. 
What is the problem? 
I ask the government what is the problem with that?  
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the problem is simple but not simplistic. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
When is the finance minister going to end it?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
They never have any answers.  
They never have any answers.  
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
Much of this research is critical analyses of the government's policies. 
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have not cut the supply of funding. 
The same amount of money is going into funding. 
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
What she has just said is utterly false.  
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
We have talked about honouring the stay at home choice by ending the discrimination. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, extensive consultations have been done. 
All the attorneys general across the country have been consulted. 
The government will be bringing forward legislation on young offenders very soon.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Public safety is always the number one issue and it will continue to be.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member is wrong. 
We have obligations under that tripartite process to put forward a legal document. 
It is still in the drafting process. 
We do not yet have a legal document.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the member talks about a tripartite agreement. 
This government is bent on insulting the people of British Columbia.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
We are proceeding with due deliberation. 
The hon. member should not try to say something which creates the wrong impression.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
That was very much respected.  
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
Over 100,000 Canadian Chinese will read the World Journal and Ming Pao magazines. 
Why is the minister willing to sacrifice their readers?  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
The member is making certain claims, all of which are completely false. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
This is something the government is planning for this year. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the file is now being reviewed.  
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, today is International Women's Day. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
We cannot wait any longer.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Charles Hubbard (Miramichi, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, older workers often have difficulty finding employment.  
It is funded by our federal and provincial governments.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We are pleased with the program's track record. 
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
The Seaborn report was the culmination of 10 years of investigation on this question.  
The document is there on the Internet and it has been there since December 3.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
Things change over time. 
The cabinet itself has ordered that public consultation be restricted. 
Why does he not want public consultation?  
Mr. Speaker, the allegations in the gentleman's preamble are absolutely and plainly false.  
It is all there in a very public, open and transparent way. 
That is the government's policy. 
The gentleman and CTV News are wrong.  
THE PUBLIC SERVICE OF CANADA 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
It froze their wages for six years. 
These are not gold plated pensions. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
This attitude has no place in the 1990s.  
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
This year, we have added another $300 million.  
That certainly compensates for inflation, and much more.  
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
How does the minister intend to offset the losses thus incurred by Canadian families?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, the member's figures are questionable.  
That compensates more than amply for inflation.  
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of International Trade.  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to start by thanking the hon. member for his interest. 
A new page has been turned in the history of Canada-Palestine relations.  
The Palestinians are planning their future and Canada intends to help them do so. 
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my colleague misunderstands the situation completely. 
These were accountable advances. 
Almost 2,000 people were helped in Manitoba. 
To date 1,700 have come to an agreement with the Government of Canada. 
Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of National Defence. 
What is he waiting for before taking action? 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member made remarks about the textile industry in New Brunswick. 
That is a success.  
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE 
Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):
My question is for the solicitor general.  
The RCMP is our national police force. 
Canadians want to know how we will provide training for our future police recruits.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Before the problem can be fixed the minister must acknowledge that discrimination exists.  
Would he not agree that the discrimination exists, yes or no?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Russell served as the previous chair. 
It is obvious that he would be a choice for the new chairman. 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
In the last parliament, we introduced Bill C-47. 
We will act when we are ready.  
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
This is completely contrary to the panel's recommendation.  
ATLANTIC CANADA OPPORTUNITIES AGENCY 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
We have also saved over $3 million in running the organization. 
I think that is pretty good.  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have several petitions to present. 
All four were committed by residents of the Sumas Correctional Centre. 
It is about time the government took action on this matter.  
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I wish to present two petitions to the House.  
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
I am also tabling the same petition for my colleague, the member for Louis-Hebert.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
I agree with this petition.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, today I have two petitions to present. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert, BQ):
This petition goes along with those presented by my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois.  
Question No. 164- Mr. Jean Dube: 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The Sinclair office's bilingual staff were also invited. 
Of the nine, there is only one HRCC which is fully bilingual. 
This ensures that quality services are offered to all clients. 
This policy is in accordance with official languages regulations. 
In the incident mentioned by Radio Canada, this policy was regrettably not followed.  
Question No. 181- Miss Deborah Grey: 
I ask, Mr. Speaker, that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
FOREIGN PUBLISHERS ADVERTISING SERVICES ACT 
The astute and erudite hon. member for Ottawa-Vanier had seven minutes remaining.  
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
As I was saying, one feeds the body, the other, the mind. 
I would also like to take them up on another mistaken notion. 
It is not that at all. 
It can and has done so over the last 30 years. 
That is the essence of a split-run edition. 
They cover the costs of preparing the edition. 
In most instances that is what has happened. 
It is not a fair or level playing field.  
Therefore there is a great deal of affinity in the market. 
That does not seem to satisfy them. 
They control over 50% of our market. 
They have 80% of our shelf space. 
It is not enough. 
Do not make that mistake. 
And three other parties.  
I conclude with a question. 
It is a very simply question.  
Which foreign publication, which American magazine, is not allowed into this country? 
It is a totally open market. 
We are not restricting any American publication or magazine from coming into the country. 
REQUEST FOR EMERGENCY DEBATE 
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
This is from a paper on international trade. 
I can submit this later on.  
Accordingly it is not permitted.  
FOREIGN PUBLISHERS ADVERTISING SERVICES ACT 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
I have been reading a book recently, 1967 , by Pierre Berton. 
He talks about Canada as it was in 1967 and the government of the day. 
The member for Winnipeg North-St. 
Paul can testify to this. 
That is brand new. 
It is a huge growth area. 
A member just said that we were fearmongering about free trade. 
It is like slanderous and slander when it is the truth.  
We were not wrong about that. 
We were absolutely right.  
Fortunately we intervened recently on the MAI. 
Thank goodness somebody did sound the alarm on that.  
That is exactly what we have heard today from the Reform Party. 
I am not prepared to accept that. 
As a fiercely proud Canadian nationalist, I will never accept that.  
In this example, Bill C-55, that is pretty clear. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would suggest that clearly untrue and slanderous allegations are unparliamentary. 
I ask you to have the member withdraw those remarks.  
It sounds as though it is a matter for debate. 
I think the member has not said any slanderous thing that I have heard.  
She was quite clear that she would not accept the Reform Party amendments. 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Mr. McCabe stated as follows: 
That's why it's so important.  
Magazines are just the beginning. 
In fact, foreign competition dominates the Canadian cultural market. 
Our culture is an integral part of who we are. 
Like Canada, many countries provide direct support for their cultural industries.  
Bill C-55 is entirely consistent with our trade obligations.  
It is a services measure. 
It does not apply to or affect imports of magazines. 
As a services measure, it falls under the GATS. 
No such obligation exists. 
The level of retaliation the U.S. has threatened is equally illegitimate. 
Bill C-55 is completely different from the previous measures.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Free and liberalized are not the same thing at all. 
Liberalized means tampered with and that is exactly what we have.  
For the folks back home I want to describe what is going on today. 
There are 21 clauses in this bill. 
The government already recognizes that it is bad legislation. 
I do not know why it is defending it today. 
I guess it is a face saving measure.  
However, we have a pretty good relationship with the United States in terms of trade.  
Bill C-55 would restrict trade. 
We have already signed an agreement stating that we would not restrict trade. 
It will not stand in terms of a point of law. 
It does not make a lot of sense, does it?  
They are talking about steel. 
Would that not be an interesting scenario? 
I do not want that and neither does our heritage minister. 
That is why I hope she repeals this bill.  
Other commodities which are under threat are textiles, plastics, lumber and wheat. 
I do not know why we would want to do that.  
I wish they would repeal it altogether. 
Fifty per cent of the magazines purchased in Canada are foreign. 
That is another statistic I will throw into the debate. 
It is also a violation of property rights and freedom of contract.  
I could go on to name a few others.  
It allows it only when it serves its own ends. 
It should repeal Bill C-55.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
They do not seem to think that is important.  
As well, the industry employs over 7,000 people.  
Does that sound like an attempt to be constructive? 
Does that sound like they are putting forward alternative suggestions? 
Why would we want to do that?  
Would we tolerate it for any other industry?  
There are mechanisms, solutions and ways of dealing with the situation. 
They cannot simply violate that agreement. 
This bill does not violate the NAFTA. 
I do not know how many times we have to say it.  
They are impressions that when researched are simply not backed up by the facts.  
I can give an example. 
Canadian advertisers are not impacted by the bill. 
There is no negative impact on Reader's Digest . 
Time Magazine is grandfathered by the bill.  
For every action the government takes clearly there is reaction.  
Let us assume that the split-run magazines come in. 
It is very confusing for my constituents who have called. 
I want to refer to a hypothetical scenario. 
How did that happen? 
The list goes on and on.  
Why is it that we see Canadians succeeding? 
It truly is an amazing success story. 
This is frankly no different. 
We are ensuring the protection of this industry with the bill.  
I could certainly continue and address the first group but I have already spoken. 
Is it still within the rules that I can speak?  
No, I am afraid the hon. member can only speak once to a grouping. 
I know he is looking forward to moving to Group No. 2. 
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
Who makes policy in Canada? 
Canadians have elected us to do the job. 
They have asked us to protect Canada's vital interests. 
Bill C-55 is about the survival of our magazine industry. 
The issue is about cultural differences.  
Americans view culture as a commodity. 
Certainly our culture needs support from the entrepreneurial excesses of American capitalists. 
Canadian culture is something that needs to be promoted and enhanced.  
American entertainment has become what the English language has become around the world. 
It has become the mode by which people listen and take American values.  
We are looking at a total annual revenue of over $1 billion.  
Some would argue that the bill would cause a trade war. 
We will and are defending those rights.  
Bill C-55 maintains a Canadian policy that has been in place for three decades. 
It aims to ensure the environment in which our Canadian identity can be maintained. 
This is not a NAFTA issue. 
Comments about trade war are not well founded. 
Early this year the Prime Minister stated: 
It is very important to maintain a Canadian identity. 
We have a good case and we will win it.  
I certainly concur with that view. 
We should not be surprised with the American sabre rattling. 
Again the Americans are reacting, trying to have us back down. 
This type of sabre rattling is what we are hearing.  
Canadians would loose the choice of reading their own stories. 
The bill does not limit competition in the Canadian magazine industry. 
Canadians need to be able to express themselves through their own medium. 
The legislation ensures that Canadians continue to have that freedom.  
We must stand up for our own interests.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
I suggest the more correct term is to protect Canadian values.  
I will give a simple illustration. 
Canadian values are reflected in this type of venue.  
I will give another example. 
In the United States property rights are very much an issue. 
Americans are very conscious of the need to protect property. 
It devastated that community. 
The article had illustrations of the various damage of the tornado. 
He had a small silver plated gun to the head of a looter. 
That would never happen in Canadian society. 
That has made us into an exceptionally tolerant people.  
That is not what we get when we read American publications. 
It is the same in television. 
Bill C-55 tries to do this precise thing.  
I will give the example that is occurring right now. 
This would encourage Canadian content.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
The Liberals invoked closure on this bill. 
It was about a small country that had interminable financial difficulties. 
I really do not think so. 
This whole bill is based on a couple of totally wrong premises. 
We have the same thinking from the heritage department when it comes to Canadian artists. 
They must play Canadian artists. 
They seem to be making it fine. 
I contend it is the same for magazines. 
This is a totally wrong premise.  
It should not be handed over to a government bureaucracy. 
It just does not fly. 
It is a false premise, fuzzy thinking and wrong thinking.  
I am quite convinced this bill is very ill advised. 
Let us make sure they are worth fighting for. 
Does it do it when it comes to our farmers and trade? 
They should think for themselves. 
I know I cannot address them directly.  
I cannot understand this. 
It is absolutely frustrating.  
This is one of the things that brings this parliament into disrepute across the country. 
The people of Canada are not being heard. 
They are not being consulted. 
They are not being informed correctly. 
When it is all added up it is $11.5 billion. 
Yet the Liberals want Canadians to think it is going up another $2 billion. 
That is the type of message the Liberals give. 
That is exactly what is happening with this bill. 
The government is giving out its message. 
The government is deceiving the people of Canada with this misinformation. 
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
I am a passionate interventionist.  
The bill is not being rammed through.  
Passionate interventionism is what I believe in. 
The member talked about tragedies. 
It is starting to lose its separatist foundation in that province.  
I want to quote one of our national treasures. 
``We have lost this game. 
The game is not what it used to be. 
I mean, we've always changed the rules to suit everybody else. 
So the game is not Canadian any more. 
We've lost it. 
Whether we can get it back or not, I don't know. 
We'll have to wait and see''.  
The bottom line is, I believe that. 
I believe they cannot survive on their own.  
When was the last time? 
Better than 50% of the magazines- 
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
Almost 80% of the magazines on the racks in this country are American magazines. 
Is the Reform Party that satisfied with the Americans having 80%? 
Does it want us to roll over and give them 90% or 95%? 
When will it stop? 
The Reform Party is going to want us to erase the 49th parallel next.  
The Americans ship them across the 49th parallel. 
Let us think about that.  
If there was ever a case for government intervention, this is it. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Of course, this will be our last opportunity.  
It was rather interesting to listen to the member for Broadview-Greenwood. 
There never seems to be an end to the list of people.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I do not think that is a point of order. 
I think really it is a point of debate.  
Let us go back to 1956. 
Mr. Speaker, you were but a young lad I am sure. 
How times have changed. 
I think it will hit the golden anniversary of 50 some time this week. 
It is a vitally important bill. 
It involves not only a social principle. 
As I mentioned it is all over but the crying. 
The closure problem did not happen overnight. 
I do not want to point fingers at just one political party. 
This government has done it in five.  
Yet government members say ``Who cares? 
We have 100% of the power. 
We do not have to share it. 
We will just do as we please''. 
This is the 49th time they have taken that tact.  
As they do that strange things happen. 
Imagine chairs being allocated in a fair manner.  
The only other one in the free world is the Canadian Senate. 
It is the only other one that is unelected. 
Over there they are even toying with the idea of electing members. 
What has got into those Brits? 
Have they gone completely over the edge? 
Imagine all this democracy at one time. 
How will they stand it? 
At the very least, the hereditary peers will be gone. 
Now they seem to think it is routine business.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Are we discussing procedure or the Senate? 
I know that he will want to conclude his remarks.  
That is how to do it. 
We do not mind dissenting opinions. 
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
It is not unreasonable to hear what we heard today in debate. 
Bill C-55 is about regulating access to advertising services. 
I want to say to my constituents that this is not a trade war. 
Other opportunities will be presented. 
We need to stand up for our cultural artists. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there unanimous consent?  
Shame on this government. 
It is operating in a very dictatorial manner.  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The member mentioned that he is short of time. 
He is now bringing up the turnout of voters at the ballot boxes. 
Is he debating Bill C-55 at all?  
There were four members who did not.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
These observations are really not points of order.  
My apologies to those four members. 
The average voter sees no point in turning out to cast a ballot.  
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
It was something that really upset me at the time. 
I tried to create a flag day. 
There are 30 million Canadians and there are 300 million Americans. 
Trade negotiation is just that. 
The debate in the United States was about steel and steel importation.  
Quite frankly, the Americans want to do that anyway. 
It has nothing to do with Bill C-55.  
They have 97% of our film industry. 
The debate is about getting the other 3%. 
They talk about democracy. 
The reality is that Ms. Barshefsky does not represent the American people. 
She represents particular special interest groups, called American industry, which want protection. 
It is not just the Canadian steel producers. 
In fact they are the last people on their list. 
Members should look at Bethlehem Steel or the steel operations in Pennsylvania. 
They have not been efficient producers and they are being out competed. 
The Americans are supposed to be the great competitors. 
They believe in free competition. 
Does everybody remember the softwood lumber issue? 
It is the same thing with this issue. 
What happened with softwood lumber? 
Canada ended up with quotas.  
I do not like to use the word protection. 
I do not believe in protectionism myself. 
What I do believe is that Canada has an emerging cultural industry. 
Canadians want to tell their stories to each other. 
That is part of our Canadian heritage.  
That is their thought process. 
It is in their brain power. 
They do not even know what country they are living in. 
They are the tool of American industry.  
It makes me feel very good to support this legislation. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
We all know that and the government knows that. 
It is really sad.  
I want to talk about a couple of them.  
What kind of debate is that? 
I can tell hon. members what is going to happen. 
The government is at the end of the line on this issue. 
That is not the way it is going to be. 
I think it is time to talk turkey. 
We will tell this government that it is not enough.  
It is time to get ready for some serious turkey talk in the House. 
There are other bills. 
They debated it at length. 
There was no such thing as bringing in closure or time allocation. 
That was second reading.  
The government must have given a lot more time on that. 
That is relevant to Bill C-55.  
It is really a sad day when a government pulls this.  
They have a worse record than Brian Mulroney on this by two years. 
I guess absolute power corrupts absolutely.  
It is a sad commentary on what we call a democracy. 
We all want to talk about that here, not just some of us.  
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Without such revenues there would be no original Canadian content. 
Therefore I urge all members to seek speedy passage of this bill. 
When my children were small I searched for Canadian publications and magazines. 
At that time there were not nearly as many as there are today. 
They are here today because there is a demand for them within Canada. 
It is therefore my pleasure to participate in this very important debate.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
The dread filibuster has arrived. 
Who is driving the get away car? 
That is the Liberal definition of democracy.  
We had one member, for example, saying that Reform had diminished hockey. 
Canadians have to be limited in the reading material they get. 
Let us look at what has happened with this split-run business. 
What did the Liberals do next? 
Suddenly there is a switch. 
Now we have to restrict something that may be new or different. 
No siree, we are going to stand up for Canadian culture.  
It is time that we were realistic about some of these things. 
It is time we put a stop to this. 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Nothing new is being added to the debate.  
There is no foreign magazine that will not be allowed in Canada. 
I want to talk about what it means to me to be Canadian. 
I am a believer in competition too. 
It is called predatory pricing. 
We have to stand up against that. 
It is quite simple. 
The Reform Party wants things like recall and referendums. 
Countries have to be able to stand up and protect their individual identity. 
The Reform Party says to let the marketplace decide. 
Look at the history of the country. 
That is the dream my father came to this country for. 
That is the dream I will protect as long as I live.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
The situation Canadians have seen themselves in is certainly the marketplace throughout Canada. 
The bodies of 200 women have been found outside in the desert Juarez. 
This is all part of it. 
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Without them, periodicals would simply not exist. 
With the support of the federal government, the industry has grown.  
These are made possible by the sale of advertising services.  
Advertising revenues are vital, as I will explain. 
Each page of advertising pays for one page of editorial content. 
This is because they can recycle content for the Canadian market. 
Bill C-55 seeks to address this unfair situation.  
We want those views and experiences to be heard.  
The bill will not make it difficult to import foreign periodicals. 
In this regard, our country is one of the most open in the world. 
We believe that these two goals can coexist.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
I would like to take a look for a minute at time allocation statistics. 
These bills are important bill. 
Bill C-36 was the budget implementation bill. 
Bill C-43 was the custom and revenue agency bill. 
That is not much time.  
The total debate time was two hours and 45 minutes.  
We debate the issues. 
That is what it is supposed to be about. 
The bill before us today is an important one. 
What it does say is that we have to be reasonable.  
They will be supported by Canadians. 
The question is on Motion No. 1. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The recorded division on Motion No. 1 stands deferred. 
The recorded division will also apply to Motions Nos. 2 to 21.  
Hon. David Kilgour (for Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.) moved: 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The recorded division on Motion No. 22 stands deferred.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Those were the terms of the motion. 
I am complying in every respect with the terms of the motion. 
The question is on Motion No. 1.  
(The House divided on the Motion No. 1, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare Motion No. 1 defeated. 
I therefore declare Motions Nos. 2 to 21 defeated.  
The next question is on Motion No. 22. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Speaker, Reform Party members present vote no to this motion.  
Mr. Speaker, the members of the Bloc Quebecois are in favour of this motion.  
Mr. Speaker, New Democrats present vote no to this motion.  
Mr. Speaker, with the exception of my colleague from Burin-St. 
Mr. Speaker, I vote no on this motion.  
(The House divided on Motion No. 22, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare Motion No. 22 carried.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.): moved that the bill be concurred.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Speaker, Reform Party members vote no to this motion.  
Mr. Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois members will vote in favour of this motion.  
New Democratic Party will be voting yes, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Speaker, with the exception of my colleague for Burin-St. 
Mr. Speaker, I will vote for this motion.  
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
FIRST NATIONS LAND MANAGEMENT ACT 
The question is on the amendment.  
(The House divided on the amendment, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the amendment defeated.  
The next question is on the main motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the said motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
(Bill read the third time and passed) 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Our argument is that is too long to wait. 
The parliamentary secretary said: 
One court of the land has ruled that one can do it. 
We also know from various studies that pedophiles prey on children. 
There are no one-victim pedophiles. 
In this case we have a government that is prepared to wait. 
I do not think most Canadians want them to wait.  
What has our government done about it? 
I could not agree with the member more. 
Now that they are in government they have changed their minds.  
We have all had the opportunity in the House to raise our concerns. 
This is not a question of pedophiles.  
Attorneys general across the country are still enforcing the law. 
They are indicating their support for pursuing this matter through the courts. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Those are the facts. 
This is not hearsay. 
These are not anonymous quotes, as the member has brought forward.  
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP):
The facts are different.  
Ultimately that is the central issue. 
This government has been unwilling to talk openly about its very obvious agenda.  
A popular call-in show, Talkback , was cited as an obstacle to easing the sale. 
Every angle was covered. 
I have been on the record on this issue many times. 
I promised to stand up for the miners when I was elected. 
I am here once again to demand accountability from this government. 
Some of those discussions have already been held.  
Workers will continue to be eligible for any earned pension benefits.  
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 7.30 p.m.)
