EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 167 
Monday, December 7, 1998 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
This bill is simple. 
It is not rocket science. 
We have already heard government members speak in opposition to this legislation. 
That is most unfortunate, but not really surprising. 
I will point out some of the justification for this proposal. 
According to Statistics Canada, some 178,580 vehicles were stolen in 1996. 
That is $600 million a year for vehicle theft.  
These statistics reveal the nature of the problem of auto theft in Canada. 
Surely these individuals deserve extra attention.  
It is most often quite content with the status quo. 
It only moves on crises. 
Why do we have a proliferation of anti-theft devices for vehicles? 
I have already mentioned anti-threat devices on motor vehicles. 
We know that the vast majority of Canadians are in support of this initiative. 
It only makes sense.  
That is a total of 4,121 stolen vehicles. 
That is about one stolen vehicle for every 80 residents of Surrey.  
About two years ago I was playing in a hockey tournament. 
Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):
I would like to point out the following.  
This is consistent with the sentencing process.  
The court exercises discretion based on the particular facts of the case before it. 
Courts have all the required tools to address this situation at the present time.  
That is a very misleading position for members to bring to the House. 
More study should be done as to the actual facts and statistics. 
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
It is an interesting piece of legislation. 
It says a number of things. 
It is a reality. 
It comes to the attention of the judge in a number of ways. 
First, the prosecutor will bring it to the attention of the judge. 
That in and of itself is another criminal offence.  
Who gets 10 years.  
Again, sentencing is a complicated factor. 
Some people get five, some people get seven. 
I have no great problem with that. 
I do not think that is necessarily a bad thing. 
It would add that one year penalty. 
Therefore I have no problem with the bill. 
Even at that I have no great problem with the bill.  
However, I do have a problem with some of the motivation. 
In fact, they say that is why most of them get caught. 
It is a spur of the moment, poorly thought out action.  
Rehabilitation is what happens to the offender after the commission of the offence. 
I thank the hon. member for introducing the bill. 
It has given us some thoughtful discussion.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Therefore, I commend him for bringing it forward.  
That was experienced in every city across this country. 
There was no deterrent sentencing. 
There needs to be a deterrent. 
Bill C-219 is a step in the right direction.  
Approximately 80% of the vehicles are recovered. 
The other 20% are often used for things other than crime. 
Or they become part of some other country's economy. 
In those containers there may be two or three stolen vehicles. 
It is something that the police cannot get a handle on. 
It is like politicians. 
In my respectful submission, this also applies to judges. 
That is what is happening in our courts.  
Provisions for minimum sentencing must be brought into law. 
In that regard, I believe this bill is suitable.  
One inmate was responsible for killing a police officer. 
Another one was charged and convicted of manslaughter. 
They stole a car to get away from the prison. 
Here are five inmates on the lam. 
What happens to them?  
I think it is time for change.  
The police are charged with a very serious responsibility which is to protect society.  
This is not the John Howard Society.  
Prisoners rights have gone far beyond what they should have gone. 
It is only the politicians that can actually correct this problem. 
I urge members of the House to consider the merits of Bill C-219. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
The sentence for such an offence would be a term of imprisonment for one year. 
It is very much a truth in sentencing provision. 
It would be served consecutively as opposed to concurrently. 
It would bring about greater accountability. 
It would certainly send that message to the criminal element.  
Crimes involving personal property such as stolen vehicles are particularly offensive to the victims. 
If someone commits a crime, he or she should be punished for that crime. 
I would therefore hope that there is support for this bill which is votable.  
Government should pay greater attention to what our police community is saying. 
Quite bluntly, police officers are getting the shaft from the Liberal government. 
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member opposite on his initiative. 
The second section indicates that it will be a mandatory consecutive sentence. 
It is dealt with in section 718 of the Criminal Code: 
(a) to denounce unlawful conduct; 
(b) to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences; 
Subsection (2) goes on to say: 
A court that imposes a sentence shall also take into consideration the following principles: 
If anything it is counterproductive. 
The offence is contemplated to stand with other offences. 
It removes all discretion from judges. 
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
I would like to speak on behalf of victims. 
My company vehicle, filled with stock and equipment, is stolen. 
Not just the stock and equipment, but the vehicle to go with it. 
By the time I caught him, half of the equipment was gone. 
Because we have a legal system that packages everything together.  
APPOINTMENT OF COMMISSIONER OF OFFICIAL LANGUAGES 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.) moved: 
The job of Commissioner of Official Languages is an extremely important one. 
The role of the commissioner is clearly focused on people. 
She is familiar with the situation of official languages right across the country.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
I am really quite impressed. 
I was quite impressed with the way she handled herself through the interview. 
My compliments go across the way. 
We do tend to get the best people for the jobs. 
I do not see that as unrealistic. 
It happens in business every day.  
My compliments to my colleagues in the selection process. 
Although it is a majority government, my compliments to the Liberal government. 
We know it did not have to do this. 
It has gone through this process and it is here to stay. 
That speaks well of everybody.  
Ms. Adam's resume is quite impressive. 
I want to add a couple of things about her education. 
She had a private practice in psychology in Toronto, Sudbury and Cornwall. 
She was at the Cornwall general hospital and it goes on.  
My compliments to everybody who was involved in the process.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
However, Dr. Adam knows both Quebec and Canada. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
The NDP supports appointment.  
This Franco-Ontarian woman has worked in the fields of health and education. 
The role of the Commissioner of Official Languages is very important for linguistic minorities. 
According to the Official Languages Act, the role of the commissioner is to: 
As an Acadian, I am concerned about the rights of language minorities. 
Unfortunately, there is a long way to go yet. 
The NDP supports Dyane Adam.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
SPECIAL IMPORT MEASURES ACT 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
It also clarifies certain provisions in both acts through various technical amendments. 
I want to spend a few moments on the public interest provisions. 
I urge my colleagues to support speedy passage of this legislation.  
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
This bill has been a long time in the making. 
The reason for it will be outlined as I walk through this process today.  
Be that as it may, we are in general support of the bill.  
I want to take a moment to explain what this bill is all about.  
First, a Canadian company must file a complaint with Revenue Canada. 
Once Revenue Canada is satisfied that the complaint is properly documented, it initiates an investigation. 
That process has been changed to the better. 
I think it will help to speed things along.  
A good example of this is in the recent baby food case. 
It is not just exports that create jobs in Canada. 
Imports create jobs as well. 
Therefore, these distributors find it difficult to bid on large contracts. 
This company imports those products. 
Dumping duties often hurt companies such as that.  
We introduced the measure 80 or 90 years ago. 
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
But they were defeated.  
Our Motion No. 1 read as follows: 
A number of witnesses voiced concern during committee proceedings. 
Therefore, it rejected this amendment, which will not be included in the bill.  
Motion No. 2 read as follows: 
That Bill C-35 be amended by deleting Clause 27.  
Motions Nos. 4, 5 and 6 concern the notion of ``material harm''. 
In our opinion, the definition of material harm was also problematical. 
In Motion No. 4, we proposed, and I quote: 
For the purposes of subsection (3.1), 
For the purposes of subsection (3.1), 
``material harm'' has the meaning given to that expression by the regulations.''  
-be amended by adding after line 18 on page 36 the following: 
``(f) defining the expression ``material harm'' for the purpose of section 44;'' 
We wanted Revenue Canada to continue using the future method. 
I will read a passage from this motion: 
In this regard, we referred to the prospective and retroactive methods.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
As has been expressed by others, the main concern is the anti-dumping legislation. 
There is a genuine concern that it will put Canadian producers at a further disadvantage.  
Another aspect of it is the concept of material injury. 
We feel that too is inadequate. 
We expose ourselves to abuse from foreign exporters by our actions.  
Many Canadians have a right to feel utterly betrayed. 
The result is a disaster for our farmers. 
We are now belatedly trying to rectify the damage that has been done.  
Fortunately other governments had better sense. 
Our caucus has been critical of this unthinking pursuit of free trade from the beginning. 
We are not against fair trade. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
We see the bill as a move in the right direction. 
That does not happen all that often.  
We live with whatever those folks negotiate behind closed doors.  
The MAI is a good case in point. 
People were very nervous about the potential of the MAI. 
I would like the member to comment on two things. 
How would he like to see this bill specifically amended to strengthen it? 
I do not have a specific approval process that I would be advancing here today. 
Australia is a good example.  
We certainly need to draw opposition members into the operation more than we do now. 
Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre-Rosedale, Lib.):
This clearly is something of interest to a lot of members. 
I do not understand where the member is coming from on this.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
I would like first to tell a very short story and then ask a question.  
I think I set that out fairly clearly. 
When the Liberals were in opposition they were very firmly opposed to free trade. 
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak to Bill C-35. 
The Progressive Conservative Party is in favour of this bill.  
We are in favour of Bill C-35, about which much has been said. 
I would like to come back to the purpose of this bill. 
After a free trade agreement is negotiated, it continues to evolve. 
Bill C-35 contains a number of changes, especially with respect to antidumping measures. 
This is the main purpose of Bill C-35.  
One thing needs to be understood. 
Like Canada, the United States has a trade deficit. 
We export 1.8 per cent of our GDP. 
Naturally, some things still need to be changed. 
It will be made much more stringent. 
Bill C-35 is a step in the right direction. 
But, naturally, it is not perfect. 
However, we are giving it some teeth. 
I will not go further, for time is slipping by. 
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
I can say that with regard Bill C-35.  
It is in the news. 
I do not think the country could stand that for one moment.  
That also brings forward the definition of dumping or subsidizing. 
What exactly is subsidizing? 
We should be looking at this subject more carefully than we do. 
Subsidization can take many forms. 
I am and always will be basically a free trader. 
However it may be so-called free trade. 
I have no doubt about that.  
It is only reasonable to ask that.  
As long ago as 1904 Canada developed the world's first anti-dumping legislation. 
We have been here before. 
We have gone through the hoops. 
As I said, I am basically in support of Bill C-35. 
It has taken the government two years to get the legislation before the House.  
In conclusion, basically the government has our support.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
It is called Bed-Roc Industries, a medium size company. 
It fought against the American company. 
It went through the International Trade Tribunal. 
How will the changes to be implemented affect business in the agriculture sector?  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
CORRUPTION OF FOREIGN PUBLIC OFFICIALS ACT 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
(Motion agreed to and bill read the first time) 
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
It is an accepted fact that corruption distorts international trade and competition. 
It impedes economic development. 
In developing countries in particular corruption distorts public policy. 
Stability and security are essential preconditions for economic growth. 
Prosperity, sustainable development and employment engender greater security and stability.  
And it would continue to ensure if not enhance Canada's standing at the OECD.  
Some have questioned whether what we are doing is enough. 
I will highlight the key elements in this legislation. 
It calls for significant penalties. 
Corporations also fall within the scope of these offences. 
It requires the parties to consider the imposition of additional civil or administrative sanctions. 
It is important to note the Canadian business community is behind this initiative. 
I ask all hon. members to consider that the war on corruption is well underway. 
There is now no looking back.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
There has been very little planning on this bill. 
It was signed in December of 1997. 
This is the way it handles things. 
This is the way it takes care of business. 
We have seen it in the case of the Somalia report. 
He has told me all about what happened. 
He was standing on the front line, around the pepper spray.  
I point this out because this is how the government manages things, or mismanages things. 
It waits until it has a crisis. 
Obviously there are solutions. 
For instance, Alberta has recently held Senate elections. 
Mr. Brown receive 331,000 votes. 
Mr. Morton received more than 261,000 votes. 
And yet this government, in its wisdom, will not even acknowledge that this happened.  
Our concerns are obvious. 
We would like to have the opportunity to call witnesses. 
We would like to have the opportunity to become informed on this issue. 
It is one of the most important think tanks in the free world. 
However, we have desperately handicapped ourselves because of the lack of management.  
Would it not be great if we had no nuclear weapons? 
But what is the reality of the situation? 
The government seems to have a great deal of problem dealing with reality. 
What is the real situation?  
Our debt is much too high. 
Will that ever be dealt with?  
There is $50 billion in interest.  
There is close to $50 billion in interest. 
Think of what we could do with $50 billion if we had it. 
Close to $50 billion is spent on interest payments. 
That is the kind of mismanagement that the OECD talks about.  
It also talks about the level of taxes in this country. 
Are we going to deny that that is part of an Olympic bid? 
That is not true. 
That is not how the real world works. 
That is not how this government operates.  
Obviously, we oppose corruption. 
We can see how corruption can undermine the very workings of various governments. 
It can destroy developing democracies. 
It can literally cause countries in transition to go backward. 
Corruption distorts public confidence in the whole process. 
It leads to the misallocation of valuable resources.  
It hurts the private sector. 
It distorts the operation of the markets. 
It deprives ordinary citizens of receiving the benefits of the flow of wealth. 
Above all else, it hurts the poor people of the world. 
We could also look at CIDA.  
The hon. member has 28 minutes remaining. 
It being almost 2 p.m. we will proceed to Statements by Members.  
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):
I say congratulations to Hamilton's Opera Ontario. 
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, ``Pay equity is very much in the news these days. 
Monique fought for equity, plain and simple'' 
She also worked with neglected children. 
She fought against discrimination by getting involved in the community. 
It is an honour for us all to say thank you to Monique Sioui.  
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
I was impressed by the huge caseload these folks handle. 
I urge my colleagues to support the national friendship centre movement.  
Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
We must create an environment in which women feel safe. 
Clearly we must focus on preventive measures. 
We cannot allow violence against women to continue. 
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
She is 18 years old and she is from Aldergrove, British Columbia, in my riding. 
Her name is Maria Mach.  
Maria has a deep interest in reading, music and plays the piano. 
She enjoys skiing and ringette. 
She has travelled to Papua, New Guinea, Australia and Europe.  
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
The Reform Party is totally disconnected from reality as far as Quebec is concerned. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
To date, there is no sign of any serious consultation.  
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
Our food costs are among the lowest in industrialized countries. 
The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-food is working toward a solution. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the future premier of the province of New Brunswick is in Ottawa today.  
He wants to build a better New Brunswick, a province with a thriving economy.  
Today I salute the future premier of the province New Brunswick, Bernard Lord.  
BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB OF ONTARIO 
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Was it APEC, taxes or health care? 
Despite the wishes of the Liberal government this issue will not go away. 
Bill C-68 will not ensure public safety. 
It will not produce safer streets. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the solicitor general.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
She tampered with the panel's independence. 
Who directed the actions of this Liberal appointed chairman? 
Who ordered this interference from Ottawa in the role of this particular panel?  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there was no interference from Ottawa. 
This is an independent body that deals with allegations against the RCMP. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
The former solicitor general pre-judged the outcome of the panel. 
That is tampering with the work of the panel. 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Under the law, it has received a complaint, it must deal with the complaint.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, maybe the solicitor general should put the training wheels back on.  
This situation fulfils both of those criteria.  
When are we going to get an independent judicial inquiry from this solicitor general?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
The hon. member knows that. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
It is mortally wounded. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
He keeps telling us it has to do its work.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
That is what it is going to do.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the solicitor general is talking nonsense.  
The Liberal caucus may be buying it, but no one else is. 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
It has a job to do and it must do that job.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
As we know, Mrs. Heafy's appointment was a political one.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, according to my information, Mr. Morin remains a member of the commission. 
Mr. Morin was appointed in the same manner as Mrs. Heafy. 
The whole issue of the commission rests with the courts.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, enough is enough. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, according to my information, Mr. Morin is still a member of the commission.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Any material it wants is available to it.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
How far is the government prepared to go to keep this three ring circus going? 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
That is exactly what would happen if a judicial inquiry were to be set up. 
That person would be appointed by the Prime Minister. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
The solicitor general would not appoint an inquiry. 
The hon. member should prepare himself before he asks these kinds of questions.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, is that not a trite answer. 
I want the hon. member to go directly to his question.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, yes I can give that assurance.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I understand the hon. member read Saturday's paper. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
He said that high taxes are good for productivity.  
A billion dollars higher every year. 
It is raising taxes. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That is why he brought in the technology partnerships program. 
That is why he has supported regional economic development. 
He understands how important increased productivity is to Canadians.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I intend to give it very serious consideration.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, family incomes are down. 
Economic growth is dropping. 
Brain drain is speeding up. 
What is the government's answer? 
According to the industry minister it is higher taxes. 
He said ``high tax levels increase productivity''. 
Perhaps the finance minister could help me here. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Perhaps the hon. member missed the announcement last Friday. 
Four hundred and twenty-five thousand new jobs were created this year alone. 
The vast majority went to young Canadians.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
He was talking about higher productivity and lower taxes.  
Let us look a the results of that. 
Last month job gains came in eight of the ten provinces. 
This is the fifth straight month that the unemployment rate has gone down. 
The unemployment rate in Canada is now at its lowest level since 1990.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the House is about to rise. 
The minister must therefore give a clear answer.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
New and bigger roadblocks.  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, American farmers are far more heavily subsidized than we are. 
Canadian farmers are always taking it right between the pockets. 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT BANK OF CANADA 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
The hon. the parliamentary secretary.  
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
It operates on a fully commercial basis.  
In fact, it returned $6 million in dividends to the taxpayers.  
Mr. Carmen Provenzano (Sault Ste. Marie, Lib.):
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of International Trade.  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
The other blockades have ceased. 
This one, I am assured, will cease as of 4 o'clock. 
Trade was not severely restricted this weekend.  
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
What he is asking is that the blockade should have been bigger and longer. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We try to learn from those reports.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, poor people cannot survive on Liberal lip service any longer. 
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The hon. member for Brandon-Souris.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Maybe he could use a little ammunition. 
Since 1995 there have been 1,053 farm bankruptcies. 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
We take this seriously and we will continue to take it seriously. 
I go by that deadline and we will continue that way.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
The criteria that the minister talks about is money being put into the farmers' pockets. 
Unfortunately cash will not flow until March 1999.  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Conservative Party too for its new-found interest. 
What a pleasant turn of events from the Tory party.  
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
We have had improvements in just about every area. 
CANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACT 
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
We will indeed be looking at this aspect of the legislation.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Minister of Finance.  
How can he justify that when he wants to be prime minister of the country?  
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
The hon. parliamentary secretary still has time if he would like more time to answer.  
Mr. Speaker, I point out that general memberships are a recognized business practice. 
The Business Development Bank has been very proactive in making- 
The hon. member for Tobique-Mactaquac.  
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
I did not say that the auditor general was wrong. 
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
Mr. Speaker, there are two main points to be made. 
First, money loaned in the past is being collected very successfully. 
We are there to help the people locally.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for some time now has repeated these remarks.  
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
We are not there yet.  
The auditor general asked for a long term plan. 
On Tuesday, I announced the creation- 
The hon. member for Acadie-Bathurst.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
The UN committee recommends a reform of employment insurance.  
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
I have notice of a question of privilege from the hon. member for Cumberland-Colchester. 
MEMBER FOR KENORA-RAINY RIVER 
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
I assure the Speaker this action did affect my parliamentary duties.  
With no introduction, he demanded to know what I ``had against Doug Young''. 
I do not know who these friends are. 
I just wanted the confrontation to end.  
He left, warning me to remember what he had said.  
At worst it is a threat against me as a member of parliament.  
There is no place in this House for intimidation or threats. 
I take this as a serious circumstance, I want the hon. member to know. 
I am not going to make a ruling on it today. 
I believe you named the member for Kenora-Rainy River, is that correct? 
I would rather wait until the member was here in the House. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
This is the second time this has happened. 
It is totally unacceptable. 
That is enough said but I would like that corrected, if possible.  
I thank the hon. member for his intervention. 
I will get more information for him. 
I think it had to do with the list they have. 
We will look into it and will get back to the member with an answer.  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member is asking for unanimous consent to table a report from a delegation. 
Does the member have unanimous consent?  
CITIZENSHIP OF CANADA ACT 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, today I have two petitions that I wish to table.  
One petition is from residents of Vernon and Armstrong. 
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
Mr. John O'Reilly (Haliburton-Victoria-Brock, Lib.):
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
I am pleased to submit these petitions.  
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
For these reasons, the people of Frontenac-Megantic are calling for abolition of the Senate.  
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I have two petitions to present today.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, the second petition is from 248 petitioners located all over Saskatchewan. 
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
The first petition is regarding the sale of Candu reactors. 
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, the second petition was prepared by Canadians of Serbian descent.  
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
Both petitions call on parliament to enact Bill C-225.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
These citizens of Canada draw the attention of the House to the following. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
My constituents have been waiting for 271 days. 
The RCMP gave its response to the government 154 days ago. 
Madam Speaker, we have answered well over 70% of the questions. 
The member is right. 
He has asked before. 
The response to his question is being finalized. 
I will continue to work to obtain the answer for him.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I note again Questions Nos. 132 and 138. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Shall the remaining questions stand?  
Mr. Robert D. Nault (Kenora-Rainy River, Lib.):
He is a very honest individual for whom I have a lot of respect.  
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
He tried to intimidate me. 
That just happened now. 
I do not want to get into a debate on this issue. 
The hon. member is here in the House right now. 
On a point of order- 
I will hear a point of order but not on this matter. 
Is it on this matter?  
Mr. Speaker, I think I was part- 
I ask the hon. member to put in his earpiece.  
You didn't hear the whole conversation, Mr. Speaker. 
That is the point I am trying to make.  
If it is on the same point of order I will not listen to it.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
That is the point I want to make.  
The hon. member is naming the member for Kenora-Rainy River. 
I would hope this type of thing would not happen. 
This question of privilege is closed.  
CORRUPTION OF FOREIGN PUBLIC OFFICIALS ACT 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
That is the first point.  
The second is that this came via the Senate. 
The government obviously should manage its affairs much better. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there unanimous consent to proceed to committee of the whole?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
When shall the bill be read the third time? 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
The NDP supports the bill. 
Here we are standing in favour of something being adopted at the OECD. 
We are in favour of rules, rules that prevent the wrong things from happening. 
There is a role for rules. 
There is a role for conventions. 
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Canada's ratification, therefore, would allow the convention to come into effect. 
I will describe the convention. 
From now on, all OECD countries will be subject to the same rules. 
But perhaps we could go further.  
There are now 28 member countries in the OECD. 
I must say I am bitterly disappointed with the Liberals' attitude. 
The Conservatives have spoken of threats. 
That would be one more thing they do not have that the opposition does.  
They have a whip that occasionally tightens the screws. 
It is rather disgraceful.  
We are all for that.  
But again, the government has turned a deaf ear.  
I will conclude on this point, and we will see the government in action.  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Madam Speaker, I would be glad to do that. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there unanimous consent to revert to Tabling of Documents?  
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the support of all members in this regard.  
I present the documents in both official languages.  
CORRUPTION OF FOREIGN PUBLIC OFFICIALS ACT 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
It does not allow us the opportunity to call witnesses. 
Will this handicap us when it comes to dealing in the international marketplace? 
What about those that are not part of the OECD? 
Where will they be when it comes to competition? 
There are so many questions we should ask.  
We often find the government presents a rather naive view of the world. 
We talk about democracy and democratization. 
I will address the bill itself. 
The OECD has made a number of recommendations to Canada. 
We are losing our trained people. 
We have a low dollar. 
We have a pension plan that is going to fail. 
The first is that we have too much debt. 
Our debt to GDP ratio is too high. 
Obviously they are telling the government to fix the debt problem. 
The big thing with this debt is the interest payments. 
The second thing the OECD says is that taxes are too high. 
This country does not know where it is going. 
Corruption does destroy countries. 
But that is not the number one problem in Canada. 
There are several things we should look at. 
There cannot be good government if corruption is allowed to go on. 
Democracy will be destroyed when corruption is allowed to happen.  
Is that really democracy? 
Is that really democracy? 
Deals are made and deals are changed. 
Is that really democracy?  
However, the chairman is gone. 
They cannot look at the politicians. 
Is that really democracy? 
We should not throw too many stones when we live in a glass house.  
I could go back to the Somalia inquiry. 
What a terrible example that set for other countries. 
We just went after a few of the little people at the bottom. 
We did not support our troops. 
We did not support the Canadian way of life. 
I question again what the government is doing.  
We can distort public policy. 
Corruption also causes the misallocation of resources. 
How many examples do people have out there of CIDA projects gone wrong? 
We have already given $120 million. 
Do we know how it is going to be spent?  
The misappropriation of funds that goes on is part of corruption. 
It is all there.  
We could talk about the aboriginal issue. 
That is good one. 
We just had a forensic audit of the Stoneys.  
We, the grassroots, are asking you to straighten this out, to fix it''. 
That is a problem in Canada. 
Why are we not dealing with that problem?  
We can also look at the poor of the world. 
We have to keep asking these questions.  
That is what we are here for, to raise these questions. 
Government members might not like to hear them. 
Those rose-coloured glasses are starting to get a little foggy. 
It is pretty interesting. 
I will refer to a few of the countries that are covered in this study.  
It is pretty difficult for the people even to get along. 
The businesses have to pay protection money in order to stay open.  
The GDP is destroyed. 
Is there any government corruption here?  
We hear all kinds of innuendoes back and forth. 
One minister says one thing, one says another. 
What are the people to think? 
The area I am most familiar with is the foreign affairs area. 
Her only credential is that she had the biggest defeat in election history in Canada.  
Did she know too much about the Somalia inquiry? 
Was that a way to get her out of the country?  
What about our ambassador to the United Nations, Mr. Fowler? 
Why was he hustled out of town? 
Why does that happen? 
Mary Clancy is in Boston. 
Gilles Bernier is in Haiti. 
Roger Simmons is in Seattle. 
These are all appointments. 
Who are these people? 
That is their credential for being there.  
Kim was certainly defeated. 
These appointments conjure up something in our minds.  
Again we have problems.  
The Parliament Buildings were supposed to cost under half a billion dollars. 
Now it is $1.4 billion. 
What do Canadians think about that? 
We have to address these kinds of things.  
We could talk about what people think about the social union. 
Government is cutting funding. 
Again I come back to the fact that there is no plan. 
The government does not know where it is going. 
It has no master plan.  
Does the government know what it is going to do in agriculture? 
Certainly other places in the world are looking at it. 
What is wrong with the people who allowed us get into a situation like that?  
I will talk about the policing problem. 
Why were they at the Rotary Club? 
Because the government has cut their funding. 
They could not use them because of funding cuts. 
What is happening to our system?  
Talk to a young person and ask them about investment in the pension plan. 
I did a little survey last January. 
It was very interesting. 
I think the House might be interested in this survey. 
They own the pension plan themselves. 
How about employment insurance? 
It is also collecting $500 per business per worker. 
People ask ``What is happening down there? 
That is what they care about.  
The Liberals should be ashamed of themselves for bringing it in this way. 
They should be ashamed of bringing it in through the Senate. 
Basically as we look at it, we are against corruption. 
This is a real motherhood issue. 
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Once again, the credibility of the Reform Party is at stake. 
That is the sort of question I am asking:
Bill S-21 is a step in the right direction. 
It is an international agreement. 
Discrediting parliament means discrediting those who sit there. 
The Reform Party has already done that. 
It is not serious, but care must be taken. 
I know the Speaker wants to apply the standing orders to the letter. 
In the end, one has to be credible.  
I am really disappointed about that. 
Still, as I said, I think this is a step in the right direction. 
I think we should go much further than that. 
However, with Bill S-21, Canada meets its international obligations. 
That is a step in the right direction. 
So Bill S-21 is speeding through. 
But will that happen? 
Bribery used to be a way of life. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
He asks if we do have a democracy. 
As difficult as it is, our system of democracy works.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
He apparently agrees with Mr. Churchill.  
No one would applaud more than I would.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with my hon. colleague from Peace River.  
I will tell a few stories in the time I have today. 
They can try to guess who I am quoting. 
I will drop a little hint. 
This person is currently the Liberal leader of Canada.  
It must be a Senate that is elected, effective and equitable''. 
This was taken from the Hansard of September 24, 1991. 
First I will talk about the foreign component.  
Until recently we had foreigners who helped serve the House. 
I remember a gentleman down the way by the name of Andrew Thompson. 
I will touch on a few things in this regard. 
He is not the only one.  
There are 17 senators who miss more days than they actually attend. 
They are supposed to be docked $120 for every day missed. 
Some honour system, indeed.  
Let us now talk more specifically about just the word corruption, this bribery. 
I do not have to look very far. 
I can look into the other place and see Michel Cogger. 
That conviction has brought the Canadian Senate into further disrepute. 
Senator Cogger should be the one who submits his resignation. 
Otherwise he brings further disrepute over time to that institution.  
I had a debate this weekend in Montreal. 
He was one of the senators who has a 100% attendance record. 
I was told something that I found interesting.  
I could go on. 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
The memorandum of understanding was signed December 17, 1997.  
I cannot understand why that would be.  
The government had almost a full year to introduce this as a bill. 
It did not do it. 
It dropped the ball. 
I assume they are pretty busy.  
All of a sudden there is a panic these last few days. 
They do not need to. 
They are appointed until their 75th year.  
I agree with the concept. 
We had a very good committee report. 
It distorts international competitive conditions''.  
That is what they were telling us at committee. 
I agree with that.  
It is a move in the right direction and we should move forward with it. 
There was no consultation.  
We are not allowed to do that. 
What about the consultation process? 
They want to be involved in something of the magnitude of the MAI. 
Apparently the government does not recognize that as an important process.  
Parliamentary committees did not really count for much. 
We wanted that process of having witnesses. 
We did not have that opportunity.  
There is a problem. 
Only 29 OECD countries have. 
Are they not going to adhere to the same code as the rest of us? 
It seems it does. 
It is a step in the right direction. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Bill S-9 had to do with financial administration. 
As the parliamentary secretary said, it is a more efficient process. 
I suggest there is not.  
That does not happen in the other place. 
I would welcome that.  
The United States Senate was not always elected either. 
It did not happened until 1910. 
It was a very strange request at the time. 
Others thought it would not work. 
It has the legitimacy needed.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
CANADA CUSTOMS AND REVENUE AGENCY ACT 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The question is on Motion No. 1. 
(The House divided on Motion No. 1, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare Motion No. 1 defeated. 
The next question is on Motion No. 2.

Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.

We skipped one motion. 
The question is on Motion No. 103. 
My clerks tell me we did not do it. 
Therefore we will do it.  
We are dealing with Motion No. 103.  
Is there agreement to proceed in such a fashion?  
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral:
Mr. Speaker, Bloc Quebecois members vote no.

Mr. Speaker, members of the NDP this evening vote yes on this motion.  
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
The first recommendation in ``Moving Forward'' is: 
That is less than four months away.  
What about ADATs, air defence anti-tank systems? 
What about any plans to mothball frigates? 
It also has the obligation to minimize waste in the military. 
This is a challenge I expect the government to meet.  
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
The committee supported this position in our report.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am sorry, but the time is up.  
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
He did not once answer why he would not cut EI premiums.  
Employers and employees are co-financing the employment insurance fund. 
The government should learn a lesson from this. 
Instead, the Minister of Finance has other liberal ideas. 
One, he is using the surplus to balance his books. 
Two, he is using the rest to pay for new programs. 
The government over-collects for other purposes. 
It is a tax on jobs and it is also against the rules.  
Taxpayers paid into the fund and therefore the money belongs to them. 
But that is what payroll taxes are. 
They have grown dramatically over time. 
The minister knows the law. 
His parliamentary secretary knows the law. 
Why do they insist on breaking the law?  
I will ask the question again. 
When will the premiums reflect the cost? 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, the hon. member asked me to delete the rhetoric from my response. 
I do not have any rhetoric at all.  
As that statement indicates, it is very clearly false. 
They do not meet with the commissioners at any time to discuss the actual rate.  
We will continue to do that in balance. 
We know that there are Canadian priorities. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
As the House will recognize, that was more than a month ago. 
But I am very saddened to say that still the government is waffling. 
My question was quite simple. 
The question of how much was answered the day I posed the question. 
It was some $6 billion.  
It did it because there was short term gain for some very long term pain. 
We are recognizing that today. 
If he wants to talk about policy- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am afraid I must interrupt the hon. member.  
The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food.  
Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Producers have told us that they did not want an ad hoc program. 
No one will know what we are doing or how we are doing it. 
We will take our time. 
Therefore we are competing for- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am afraid I must interrupt the parliamentary secretary.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
We fully agree with that statement. 
And that is unacceptable to me.  
Money continues to be diverted from its intended purpose.  
That is why the concept of misappropriation of funds remains valid.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Forgive me, but I must interrupt the hon. parliamentary secretary.  
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.16 p.m.)
