Business Development Bank of Canada 
Request for Answers to Order Paper Questions 
The answers should not be difficult to obtain. 
Surely, this is not too much to ask.

A copy of the relevant Minutes of Proceedings ( Meeting No. 1) is tabled.  
ROSE-MARIE LOSIER-COOL Joint Chair 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Tuesday next, November 4, 1997, I will move: 
Amendment to the Constitution of Canada 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Tuesday next, November 4, 1997, I will move: 
That the Committee have the power to sit during sittings and adjournments of the Senate; 
That the Committee have the power to hear witnesses via video conferencing; 
That the Committee present its final report no later than December 5, 1997; 
Hon. Orville H. Phillips :
Honourable senators, my question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, absolutely not.  
Hon. Orville H. Phillips :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The honourable senator alleges that there was a crash. 
That is why we had such a fast rebound.  
Energy, the Environment and Natural Resources 
There are 54 questions in all.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The answers will be brought forward as expeditiously as possible. 
His questions have been taken very seriously.  
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
The minister said yesterday, and I quote: 
The Investment Board will operate truly at arm's length from governments.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I do not believe that that board has been set up yet. 
It was to be independent of the government. 
That would obviously eliminate the Deputy Minister of Finance. 
If I am wrong on that, I will bring back a further answer.  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, my question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
I have a supplementaryquestion. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the answer is an absolute no. 
CPP contributions, as I have explained, go into a separate fund. 
Hon. Duncan J. Jessiman :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Duncan J. Jessiman :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
That is a gargantuan question involving very large figures. 
I would need to consult further to bring my honourable friend the appropriate answer. 
Honourable senators, my question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
I have been made aware of the name of the Manitoba representative.  
The money has nowhere else to go but into the market. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Is that currently or later?  
I will get you the figures.  
What will happen with the Canadian equity market? 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I am able to answer very much in the affirmative, honourable senators. 
This is a very serious matter. 
Fisheries officers are enforcing the regulations that are in place; illegal traps are being seized. 
I shall certainly bring the honourable senator's concerns to the attention of the minister.  
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Sergeant Feigenwald is leaving the service of the RCMP. 
This is his own decision, over which the RCMP has no control.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I certainly shall. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I am sure that the agreement itself will be transparent and open. 
Honourable senators, I do not quite understand the answer. 
Honourable senators, I have one final comment, if I may. 
This is an agreement which will have just about as much impact as the NAFTA. 
Delayed Answers to Oral Questions 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I have three delayed answers to questions:
(Response to questions raised by Hon. Mabel M. DeWare on October 2, 1997) 
Nine out of ten single senior women will see their benefits increase. 
These illegal activities are not readily apparent, they do not occur in plain view. 
To date, more than 500 Customs inspectors, investigators and intelligence analysts have been trained.  
It is still legal to sell or use CFCs in Canada. 
The exchange of information is excellent at national as well as regional levels. 
Good relations have also been established with U.S. Customs.  
(Response to question raised by Hon. Donald H. Oliver on October 22, 1997) 
Canadian Human Rights Act 
Bill to Amend-Second Reading 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I shall continue my contribution to the debate from the previous day.  
All we have is a copy of the bill. 
I think this practice will enhance our work.  
That is a very important principle and one which I embrace.  
There are three acts that are being amended. 
The first is the Criminal Code. 
There are, however, some issues of detail that need to be underscored. 
It relates to the matter of special programs. 
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Speech from the Throne 
Motion for Address in Reply-Debate Continued 
7th day of resuming debate ). 
Hon. Raymond J. Perrault :
The issue has become a blame game as far as British Columbia is concerned.  
It is a national crisis, and it is becoming a global crisis. 
They suggested some adverse factors that may be affecting the fisheries. 
There is pollution and overfishing in some circumstances. 
There is also the use of drift nets. 
Carbon dioxide emissions could be playing a role, directly or indirectly. 
It was a bitter session. 
The world's scientists produced a frightening report without any disagreement.  
The publicity campaign was aborted, due, presumably, to budget economies. 
Unfortunately, not all of the targets are being met. 
Let no one dissuade you otherwise.  
Honourable senators, charges have been made in this chamber. 
A very positive record has been established by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans.  
That is not an insignificant amount.  
A similar amount will be forthcoming from the federal government for 1998-99. 
This is also in addition to payment of regular EI benefits.  
Comparisons have been made. 
That is the oldest and most discredited name game of all. 
That is different from the West Coast situation. 
That is real hardship. 
Let us recognize it for what it is.  
We achieve more by working together cooperatively than we do by hurling insults. 
That is no way to achieve an agreement. 
I know Dr. David Strangway. 
The Strangway-Rucklehouse report is scheduled for release at the end of this year. 
Is that supposed to achieve anything? 
Nothing is achieved by doing things like that.  
We are a vulnerable people as far as agreements with the United States are concerned. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable Senator Perrault, I regret to interrupt you but your time has elapsed. 
Are you requesting leave?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I thank you for permitting me to finish these remarks.  
First, there is much more to be gained through cooperation than by confrontation. 
That must be the message.  
We better start doing something about it.  
However, he said one thing which startled me. 
Possibly the honourable senator could give further explanation.  
Was the environment formally on the agenda as part of that meeting? 
Were there scientists present? 
How did that conclusion come about? 
Is there any way we could find out a little more about it?  
Honourable senators, the year was 1970. 
The debate then got into the whole idea about the environment.  
I give the honourable senator that commitment.  
On motion of Senator Carstairs, debate adjourned.
