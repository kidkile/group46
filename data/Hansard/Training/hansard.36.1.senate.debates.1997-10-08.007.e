Debates of the Senate (Hansard) 
Wednesday, October 8, 1997 
The Senate met at 2 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
All Canadians owe them a great debt of gratitude. 
As a Manitoban, of course, I say a special "thank you" to all of them.  
Honourable senators, I present to you the volunteers of the Saguenay and Manitoba floods. 
Flooding in Manitoba and Quebec 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs ( Deputy Leader of the Government ) :
However, the reaction of the people was identical. 
We had to dike. 
We had a dike that protected 27 homes. 
We were fine because our dike was fairly substantial. 
By the way, three other senators in this chamber were also affected by that flood.  
I wish to pay particular thanks to the Canadian Armed Forces. 
I was there manning a dike patrol. 
You did a remarkable thing. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I know many other senators would like to speak. 
Senator Lavoie-Roux, this will have to be very short. 
Hon. Therese Lavoie-Roux :
I had an opportunity to visit the region last August. 
I went as far as Ferland and Boileau, as far as Lac Ha! 
These events were a tremendous upheaval for local people, both personally and collectively. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Thank you very much. 
We now release you to go to the House of Commons.  
Promised Retraining Funds for British Columbia Fishers-Clarification of Figures 
There are many watershed management jobs. 
Those jobs exist for the workforce when the training funds are available.  
The Entrepreneur of the Year program continues to grow.  
Awards will be presented to seven of these fine individuals.  
The Honourable Frank J. McKenna 
Tribute on Retirement as Premier of New Brunswick 
Hon. Louis J. Robichaud :
Under difficult circumstances, he assumed the premiership of the province in 1987. 
However, he preferred to keep his promise and withdraw from public office. 
He was the main architect of the Calgary formula.  
He killed Meech Lake!  
He built many more things than he killed. 
He added that we will be able to golf together more often in the future.  
Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
It is now apparent that Milestone Radio never had a chance. 
Yes, honourable senators, the fix was in. 
As Peter Goddard of The Toronto Star noted: 
However, that is not all, honourable senators. 
It did so this past spring with its existing stations. 
There was no real need to steal the 99.1 frequency.  
Now we hear that the CBC is offering a compromise. 
Supposedly the CBC is offering 93.5 to Milestone Radio. 
Importance of Bridges to National Unity 
Hon. Raymond J. Perrault :
This wonderful, historic area of Canada should be visited by every Canadian. 
It serves to inspire a greater appreciation of Confederation and national unity.  
It was a great experience. 
In a sense, it would help to complete Confederation.  
That is utter, irresponsible, headline-grabbing nonsense. 
Inevitably, from time to time, we have differences with Ottawa - all regions do. 
Most of the time this process constitutes a healthy tension.  
Let us keep it that way. 
Business of the Senate 
Time Limitation of Senators' Statements 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Estimates, 1997-98 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Then this matter will be dealt with at the next sitting.  
Notice of Motion to Refer Vote 25 to the Standing Joint Committee on Official Languages 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
That a Message be sent to the House of Commons to acquaint that House accordingly.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Then we will deal with this matter as well at the next sitting.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
That a Message be sent to the House of Commons to acquaint that House accordingly.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
The Hon. the Speaker :
This matter will be considered at the next sitting.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
The Hon. the Speaker :
This matter will be considered at the next sitting.  
Bill to Amend-First Reading 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs , (Deputy Leader of the Government):
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
However, the government has taken few steps to encourage this vital industry.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I fully endorse what has been said by the Honourable Senator Forrestall. 
This will be very welcome news at home.  
Status of Partnership on Social Programs with Government of Ontario 
Hon. Norman K. Atkins :
My question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I have a supplementary question. 
What will the new elements of the partnership be? 
Will they be made unilaterally?  
Hon. Richard J. Doyle :
On February 13, 1997, the Leader of the Government in the Senate told us: 
Of course, the Krever report did not come down in April. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The record will show that he indeed has expressed concern on a number of occasions.  
I would presume so, but I would have to confirm that for my honourable friend.  
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government. 
The strategy, which was aimed at restructuring, has not met its objectives in the least. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
We are hopeful that a report will be made before the year is out.  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
That decision has been appealed to the cabinet.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Allegations by Ambassador of Corruption in Mexico-Government Position 
Hon. Edward M. Lawson :
I do not know on what basis he would make such outrageous allegations.  
I suppose one might consider that corruption.  
I suppose one might think that that is corruption.  
Fourteen policemen arrived for the meeting driving stolen cars. 
One might think that that is corruption.  
My all-time favourite is Raoul, the brother of the former president. 
He worked as a public servant and was paid about 70,000 pesos a year. 
This man was a good public servant who had kind of a bent towards savings. 
I suppose some might consider that to be somewhat corrupt.  
The former president came to hide here in Canada. 
He does not dare go back to Mexico because he might be assassinated. 
I think there are some who might consider that as some type of corruption.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
He made the request. 
Canada-Mexico relations have not been affected. 
With respect to any disciplinary measures, I leave that to the appropriate officials.  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, I am glad that the prime ministers have spoken to each other. 
My question is about another prime minister.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Again, as we read in yesterday's Ottawa Citizen , suddenly - 
There have been inquiries about that matter since last May. 
Honourable senators, I have a somewhat curious matter to bring to your attention.  
Why was this story missed? 
The Globe and Mail is Canada's national newspaper. 
It goes out across the country. 
Why was this story not reprinted in "Quorum?"  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, that is an interesting question, the answer to which I do not know. 
I say that because I do not even know who puts "Quorum" together.  
The honourable senator has prompted a point of interest. 
I will be happy to find out for my colleague. 
Honourable senators, I understood that that was part of the agreement. 
I do not know what else I can say. 
It was part of the agreement.  
This money is not being paid to Brian Mulroney. 
It is being used to cover his legal costs, et cetera. 
Not one nickel of it goes to former prime minister Brian Mulroney. 
There were a lot of players in this game:
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the RCMP is writing the cheque. 
You can draw your own conclusions.  
Has the commissioner resigned? 
Has anyone been fired? 
However, I will take your word for it and I will draw my own conclusion. 
It is hard for a Liberal to say things like that.  
My understanding is that there is an ongoing internal investigation in the RCMP. 
Presumably the findings of that investigation will be made known at the appropriate time.  
Business of the Senate 
Extension of Question Period 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, the time for Question Period is over.  
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
I would ask for leave to extend the time, Your Honour.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted to extend Question Period?  
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
Is that the way it goes?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the answer to the last question is in the affirmative. 
I understand that there is an investigation ongoing at the present time.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
This, to me, is quite a dangerous precedent. 
I was glad to be joined today by an independent member. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I thank Senator Prud'homme for raising the point of order. 
He has made a valid point. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Senators making interventions during this time - 
meaning at the time for Senators' Statements 
- shall be limited to speaking once for no more than three minutes; 
...however, a Senator may seek leave to extend his or her remarks.  
Honourable senators, that is a very important part of that rule. 
That is provided for in rule 22(7). 
I refer honourable senators to rule 22(8), because that section provides that: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
That is the reason I made my comments. 
Speech from the Throne 
Motion for Adoption of Address in Reply-Debate Continued 
3rd day of resuming debate ) 
Our ancestors sought peace, prosperity, and, above all, freedom.  
This is as it should be. 
If you plan for 10 years, plant a tree. 
If for a hundred years, educate the people."  
Let us now turn our thoughts to older Canadians. 
With your support, honourable senators, I trust we shall succeed.  
Hon. M. Lorne Bonnell :
Say it is not true!  
Our government also established the Canada Foundation for Innovation. 
The Prime Minister said: 
One of these areas is knowledge and learning... 
I can assure you, honourable senators, that this is a very vocal constituency.  
To quote from the report of our subcommittee: 
...helping to ensure the continuing excellence of post-secondary institutions must become a priority.  
I believe that there will be too many.  
That is the policy problem with linking need and merit. 
Today, however, I should like to adopt a more economic perspective.  
Social capital is a relatively new phrase to me, but I like it. 
Social capital is not the same as human capital. 
For some time, we have recognized the value of human capital. 
This is particularly true of the promised investment in children. 
On motion of Senator Kinsella, debate adjourned.  
That the Committee make its final report no later than November 7, 1997; 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
...to try to convince them...  
Referring to the dissenters, he adds: 
...to convince them that it is well founded...  
Even the Bloc Quebecois is not opposed.  
The amendment was passed bilaterally.  
Section 93 contains two parts.  
What is before us is the amendment regarding denominational guarantees. 
I agree that section 43 applies. 
But the amendment can be bilateral, trilateral or multilateral. 
Let us look at the wording of section 43: 
a ) aux changements du trace des frontieres interprovinciales; 
The French is not as clear as the English. 
Section 93(2) of the Constitution Act 1867 reads as follows: 
Some people say that Quebec and Ontario are interlaced in that wording. 
Thus we may conclude that a bilateral amendment is possible.  
That appears to me to be very clear.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
As usual, his knowledge of the Constitution aids - 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, may I interrupt? 
I am making a speech.  
That was not indicated to us. 
That is the essence of the particular motion before us. 
We did hold those public hearings. 
We met in that period of time for 14 meetings spread over nine days. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
May I ask the deputy leader for clarification and comment on her remarks? 
I am interested to hear that - 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is the honourable senator asking a question?  
Yes, a question of Senator Carstairs. 
We would not get a definitive statement. 
The agenda of the committee was set by the Senate. 
The hearings were determined by the Senate. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senator, is this a question?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
You have spoken on the motion, honourable senator.  
Senator Lynch-Staunton, in fact, asked several questions. 
If is therefore up to us to determine whether or not we accept that date.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
We are not dealing with a municipal by-law that can be changed at whim. 
The institutions available in our system are three. 
The second one is the institution of the legislature which, honourable senators, includes this house. 
We saw the use of referenda in Newfoundland, not once but twice. 
I know there are various schools of thought on that. 
However, we must listen to the people. 
I think that is wrong for the following reasons.  
Of course, I am looking at article 93 of the Constitution. 
I am sympathetic to the resolution as it appears at face value. 
If the committee is formed, it will have perhaps part of next week. 
The committee is to be composed of approximately 16 members of Parliament and seven senators. 
That brings you back to the end of this month.  
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Perhaps Senator Kinsella can assist me. 
I certainly have not come to any particular premature view. 
There appears to be an inconsistency.  
Honourable senators, Senator Grafstein has provided us with a good opportunity to clarify. 
The question is how does section 43 of the Constitution apply. 
Are we sure this is the right one? 
That is the point to be made there.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I see Senator Beaudoin wishes to speak.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I know that the government may do that and some people may suggest that. 
Obviously, this chamber is a legislative chamber. 
However, we have that power. 
Senator Lynch-Staunton referred to that possibility. 
If that is not possible, I will bring their concerns to senators' ears myself.  
The Government of Quebec has given us assurances. 
Its representatives in the House of Commons, the Bloc Quebecois, have also given us assurances. 
Finally, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs has given his stamp of approval to the amendment. 
However, I encourage members of the committee not to rely on these assurances. 
The committee must make the determination of fact for itself. 
Let us briefly examine these assurances.  
We are told, however, that there is a consensus in the province. 
I quote Mr. Dion: 
The committee must confirm the existence of this support independently. 
However, that is not the issue before us, honourable senators. 
The resolution does not involve linguistic school boards. 
The resolution is removing constitutional protections. 
That is a completely different issue.  
The Estates General gave its support to the establishment of linguistic school boards. 
This is the type of confusion that the committee must work to clarify.  
I have one last point to make on the issue of consensus. 
Bloc MP Real Menard, during his House of Commons speech, stated as follows: 
The Quebec National Assembly adopted the resolution unanimously... 
I will mention the Coalition pour la confessionalite scolaire, for instance. 
This coalition regroups approximately 18 organizations and groups. 
They tell us not to worry, that minorities will be protected. 
I will comment briefly on both these assurances.  
Section 41 of this statute states: 
Honourable senators, they have a point. 
In this speech, the Premier of Quebec stated the following: 
Unfortunately, the respect for English-speaking Quebecers stops at the gate of rhetoric. 
The individuals who sit on these boards actually manage services on the ground. 
They know the level of services that are needed in the region. 
The federal government enters the health care game at this point. 
I cannot understand anything becoming "too bilingual."  
Do honourable senators see how easily a right can be frustrated? 
This is not a good sign. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I regret to interrupt the honourable senator, but her 15 minutes has expired. 
Is leave granted for Senator Wood to continue?  
There is only the word of the provincial legislature. 
Is that word strong enough to replace constitutional guarantees? 
In my opinion, honourable senators, it is not.  
Premier Bouchard, in his Centaur Theatre speech stated: 
Honourable senators, promises and good will only go so far. 
Honourable senators, I concur with the comments made by Mr. Tabachnick. 
They can also be applied to our situation. 
What kind of precedent are we creating? 
Are we using the proper amending formula? 
That is why, honourable senators, I move: 
That the motion be amended by deleting 
a ) paragraph 10 thereof and substituting the following: 
"That the Committee make its final report no later than December 31, 1997,", and 
b ) paragraph 12 thereof and substituting the following: 
I ask honourable senators for their support of this amendment.  
On motion of Senator Cools, debate adjourned.  
Hon. J. Michael Forestall rose pursuant to notice of October 1, 1997: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Your Honour, I cannot hear a word.  
How many jobs were lost when this program was cancelled? 
How many small contractors closed up their shops? 
How much money was lost in terms of the tax base? 
It is plain and simple negligence and complete irresponsibility.  
I think it is a conservative estimate. 
Let us add this to the cost associated with maintaining the Sea King fleet. 
with maintaining the Sea King fleet for another 10 years. 
Let me tell you that is not an easy job. 
Not one helicopter - not one new, safe, dependable, reliable machine.  
Let us take that out, and look at what the cost would have been then." 
Did they do that? 
No. How much money has this government saved in replacing the Sea King? 
What has the government done for the navy? 
Precious little except give them one of the finest warships in the world half undressed. 
It does not have a helicopter. 
It is like playing pool with a wet noodle or the like.  
If I did, it would probably push the total cost to well over $5 billion. 
So much for arithmetic. 
Are there any here who do not remember that? 
Damn the torpedoes and full steam astern:
That is this government's motto when it comes to National Defence. 
We have known we were going to buy the machine. 
It is the only safe piece of equipment out there to buy. 
That is what we need. 
You have to be able to do that in the night and in inclement weather. 
We wanted to buy the EH-101 because it was safe. 
Now even the Liberals acknowledge that. 
Because there is no better alternative.  
The Cormorant is the most operationally effective option. 
That is the EH-101. 
The Eurocopter NH-90 is still under development.  
Not next April or two years from now, but right now. 
The helicopters are key to our new ships' operational effectiveness. 
Honourable senators, this situation could occur. 
Why do we not bite the bullet and muster up our fortitude? 
Muster your fortitude and stand up. 
Announce that you will buy the EH-101, and get on with it, please.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Motion to Reinstate Special Subcommittee, as Amended, Adopted 
Hon. M. Lorne Bonnell , pursuant to notice of October 2, 1997, moved: 
a ) the national, regional, provincial and local goals of the Canadian post-secondary education system; 
c ) the roles of the federal, provincial and territorial governments; 
The amendment concerns the section which begins: 
That the Special Committee comprise seven members 
I should like to amend that section to read: 
That amendment to that section of the motion should be added with unanimous consent.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is there unanimous consent to the amendment to the original motion as requested?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Senate adjourned until Thursday, October 9, 1997, at 2 p.m.
