EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 161 
Friday, November 27, 1998 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
COMPREHENSIVE NUCLEAR TEST-BAN TREATY IMPLEMENTATION ACT 
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
The Senate has amended the text of this amendment as follows: 
We fully support the Senate amendment. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
The House will actually be voting on the following motion: 
We, the official opposition, offer our general support to the amendment. 
This seems like a reasonable amendment on a very critical issue. 
It is a step in the right direction and a step forward. 
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
It is an essential tool for attaining complete nuclear disarmament. 
Already the treaty has reaped positive results. 
That said, we cannot claim victory yet. 
The nuclear threat still hangs over us. 
It is a matter of getting our priorities in order.  
Every day, 34,000 children die from malnutrition and disease. 
Every year, 17 million people die of infectious and parasitic diseases.  
The Bloc Quebecois wants to acknowledge the work done by the minister on this issue.  
We in the Bloc Quebecois want Canada to go even further. 
The Bloc Quebecois is acutely aware of the challenge nuclear disarmament represents. 
This is our duty to future generations. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Once passed, this legislation will allow Canada to ratify the treaty.  
I want to take a minute to talk about Canada's record. 
This government has paid only lip service to this problem. 
But the government never learns. 
We also know the government cares more about money than it does about world security. 
The minister asked that we have full House support for the committee report. 
My party will be forthright. 
Nuclear weapons are not land mines. 
We are in favour of stopping proliferation. 
We are in favour of arms control. 
The world has been, is currently and will be a dangerous place. 
This minister talks about 50 years ago. 
Maybe he should talk about 50 years from now. 
To delude ourselves that it will is very dangerous. 
To delude ourselves that they are not is also very dangerous.  
Is the House ready for the question?  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
INCOME TAX CONVENTIONS IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1998 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt this motion?  
When shall the bill be read the third time? 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Currently Canada has tax treaties in force with 64 countries. 
Tax treaties address the problem of double taxation in one of two ways. 
Measures that reduce double taxation also serve the purpose of preventing tax evasion. 
In this regard Bill S-16 is no exception. 
For the reasons I have indicated, I urge hon. members to support this bill.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
It is certainly a good housekeeping bill. 
It solidifies and gives legislative approval to some very necessary provisions. 
This is very relevant to the bill. 
The Liberals have very few members to spare. 
This allowed us to pass things that are good for the people. 
Private Members' Business is a very important part of representational democracy.  
On the other hand are the S bills which originate in the Senate.  
They are ready to have people in this House who will represent them.  
Let me get back to the S bills, which originate in the Senate. 
Who are the senators? 
Some look at them as being hockey players. 
The only problem is they do not really have to answer to anybody. 
They do not have to listen to people in their ridings. 
What can possibly be wrong with that?  
Ask any Canadian what he or she would rather have. 
The Prime Minister said ``We will have an elected Senate''. 
I will appoint the one that you select. 
Every Canadian can see through that ruse. 
That is a way of trying to legitimize it. 
Every once in a while there is one. 
But it is a phony process and it needs to be stopped. 
Democracy is not served by it.  
The purpose of the Senate should be to balance powers. 
Power only works properly in a democracy if there is a proper balance. 
Checks and balances we call them. 
I said the Reform policy is that I will represent them. 
It is just the opposite in my party. 
What was the response of the then prime minister? 
That is not democracy.  
That is why we need an elected Senate. 
That is long overdue. 
That is what is disgusting. 
Under the current legislation he does not have the right to appoint senators. 
They work together in this regard.  
Maybe they will be observed. 
They will be around. 
As I said before it cannot be ruled irrelevant. 
It is very relevant.  
It does two things. 
That is called double taxation. 
This is a fine bill. 
Instead it was brought in from the other place.  
I used to teach mathematics. 
I did a few calculations. 
I think I can do that.  
Let us say I earn $2.77. 
I end up with another 40% taken off. 
Finally I buy $1 worth of gasoline. 
That is added to the price. 
The GST is computed on that amount including the tax.  
The government says that it has not increased taxes. 
At least that is what it said at the time. 
When the GST is added to the 1.5 cents, it is 1.605 cents. 
It all ties together. 
Let me give another example. 
It is double taxation.  
Mr. Speaker, you will notice how relevant I am. 
I know all hon. members will look forward to that.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
It reads in part: 
That is over 300 abortions each and every day. 
CANADIAN MERCHANT NAVY VETERANS 
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
Stonewalling on terminology is disgraceful. 
A motion in committee asked the minister to address these four concerns. 
Not one, two or three of them but all four. 
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
That is what I call an investment in our future.  
UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE RIGHTS OF THE CHILD 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Today, however, I have great news. 
Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):
To know our future we must know our past. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, last week was Drug Awareness Week.  
I hope it has learned something.  
The bogus refugees sell drugs to our children. 
The RCMP is losing the war against drugs. 
They have no funds. 
Our RCMP needs help. 
Stop making Canada a haven for drug dealers. 
Clean up the drug problem. 
Just say no to drug cartels. 
Mr. John Maloney (Erie-Lincoln, Lib.):
In Canada one woman is killed every six and one half days by a gun. 
Four out of every five victims of spousal homicide are women.  
All too often violence against women goes unpunished. 
All too often it is tolerated in silence by its victims.  
This is not enough. 
Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):
1998 has been a difficult fiscal year for our primary producers. 
This nation was founded upon the institution of the family farm. 
It is a very sad reality.  
Unfortunately, the choices available are limited. 
SEMAINE QUEBECOISE DES 4-H 
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
There will be teaching workshops for groups of students.  
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
They accused the Canadian Wheat Board of illegally dumping Canadian grain. 
They accused Canadian farmers of being subsidized by the Canadian Wheat Board. 
What did the responsible minister say? 
It is time to worry. 
The Americans were dead serious then and they are dead serious now. 
They are demanding country of origin labelling on our agriculture products. 
They are demanding a moratorium on all grain and livestock imports.  
These are not election stunts. 
These border closings are making a bad, critical situation worse for our Canadian farmers. 
ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN QUEBEC 
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):
This coming November 30, it is Quebeckers' chance to speak up. 
I am confident that they will choose Canada.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, Canadian banks have a golden opportunity. 
They can prove their commitment to the Canadian people by helping farmers in Canada.  
Canadians have be vigilant in their opposition to the mergers and have clearly said no.  
They must reconcile their profitability with the responsibility which comes with their charters.  
FEDERATION DES AGRICULTRICES DU QUEBEC 
Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne-Blainville, BQ):
The women who received these awards were:
Our sincere congratulations to all these women for their initiative and their competency.  
ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN QUEBEC 
Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau, Lib.):
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
This year Newfoundland received $274 million in these transfers. 
By the year 2002 the amount will have dropped to $245 million.  
As of November there have been 429 cardiac surgeries done in Newfoundland. 
When those means keep decreasing it is possible that some people may not live. 
Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
Total funding for these projects will be $4.8 million.  
STANDING COMMITTEE ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
What happened to accountability? 
What happened to tradition in the House? 
It raises a question. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
CANADA-CHINA LEGISLATIVE ASSOCIATION 
Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
They lose their home, their income and their hope.  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are treating it like the disaster it is. 
I agree with the member very sincerely. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, that is just not good enough. 
Farmers have been brought to their knees by this government. 
They are pleading and begging the ministers of finance and agriculture to do something. 
Will they announce disaster relief for these farmers today?  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is very refreshing. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
It is the government's fault.  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
The safety net advisory committee has been giving us advice. 
It gave us some very critical and important advice last week. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Our officials are discussing these issues. 
Next week is the next round for discussions. 
We have already brought to their attention that once is enough. 
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
It is clearly a desperate situation. 
John and Roger are right there in the gallery- 
The Speaker alone is permitted to do that. 
I would ask the hon. member to put his question forthwith.  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
I told him we were working as hard as we possibly can. 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the premiers launched this initiative in December 1997. 
Winning conditions for Lucien Bouchard are losing conditions for Quebeckers.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, we have the deepest respect for the Constitution. 
We help ensure Canadians have access to education.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
They all signed the same agreement in Saskatoon.  
Its reasons for doing so are fairly obvious. 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I do not know where the member got his information.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
I have explained the necessity and the urgency of that to my cabinet colleagues.  
That is what we are trying to do.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, farmers cannot wait. 
They need help and they need help now. 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Yet the government is unwilling to do anything in spite of these studies. 
How many pork producers need to go bankrupt before it decides to intervene?  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
There will simply be none of them left to make use of this technology.  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
That is another reason why our producers are very efficient. 
PUBLIC WORKS AND GOVERNMENT SERVICES 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
His assistant deputy minister, Mr. Williams, is quoted as saying there were. 
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
We are taking it seriously.  
We suspended its security clearance and we called in the RCMP.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, other countries have spies to get their secret information. 
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is stretching his imagination a little bit.  
How much clearer can I be?  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Immigration.  
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Of course, the individual in question must apply in the first place.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
PUBLIC WORKS AND GOVERNMENT SERVICES 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
This has been open. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Their military or industrial concerns? 
Who in China is reading our confidential NATO documents?  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
We received a preliminary report of the investigation. 
I want to make sure they get it right. 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I would still like the minister to elaborate.  
According to the article in the National Post , two people are on the short list:
Jean-Jacques Blais and Jean-Pierre Kingsley.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
I told her that the allegations were false. 
And now there is even a witness.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Atlantic Canada will be especially hard hit. 
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
The member should wait for that announcement.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, that is very interesting. 
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, December 1 is next Tuesday. 
I hope the member will wait until Tuesday before drawing any conclusions.  
We will make sure that they continue giving good service. 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. 
Is he prepared to take that course of action?  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. 
What has the minister done with these recommendations?  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
It will be another two years before a new Cormorant helicopter comes into service. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
It was put out. 
No one was injured. 
Damage to the aircraft was minimal.  
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
When will the minister do the right thing and lease new helicopters? 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
We definitely keep a very high level of maintenance. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
The UN asked Canada some very tough questions.  
These are questions we in the NDP have been asking for years.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The hon. member for Winnipeg Centre.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Some of the UN's observations were very specific. 
Will it expand coverage to EI so more people are covered? 
Will it broaden the social transfer through the CHST?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
That is an extraordinary achievement.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
The RCMP has intervened and has made a full inquiry.  
The government made available to the RCMP all the information we had. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, there are still a lot of unanswered questions. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is absolutely nothing new here. 
I asked for the investigation on behalf of the government. 
My department provided all the information about these allegations to the RCMP. 
The RCMP conducted a full and thorough investigation into the matter. 
One person was charged and convicted. 
As far as I know the matter has been dealt with.  
Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
These have caused Canadians much inconvenience and many problems.  
Hon. Claudette Bradshaw (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
CANADIAN MERCHANT NAVY VETERANS 
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
In fact he said the opposite.  
My question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
When is the minister going to announce the contribution decrease for 1999? 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I thank him for his confidence in expecting a decrease.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
It is not just a disaster. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Mr. Speaker, there is another problem with the fishery. 
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
In terms of the coast guard, safety is our number one priority. 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the report is a very important one. 
We have heard the Minister of Health speak about a report card. 
The Prime Minister has spoken about it as well. 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the National Parole Board is out of control. 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
When it reviews each case that is the primary concern. 
There has been a very small number of- 
Public safety is the major issue. 
It is an arm's length body of government that acts within itself.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the government has to provide leadership in our time of crisis.  
Farmers need help now. 
The federal government must take responsibility.  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
The minister must be consistent.  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
I think we can deal with this matter. 
The minister has indicated that he was quoting from a newspaper. 
He has given the source of the quote. 
Therefore, I think the matter is closed.

My bill is in the interest of all Canadians and our youth in particular. 
It is my hope that this House will support it.

Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the third petition is in respect of the Young Offenders Act. 
These petitioners ask for changes in regard to the Young Offenders Act. 
I think three petitions would be enough for today.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I also have a petition that I would like to table.  
These petitioners are largely residents of my riding of Winnipeg Centre. 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
REQUEST FOR EMERGENCY DEBATE 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Producers are selling at a loss. 
He has explained the general principles of the debate, if it were to take place.  
INCOME TAX CONVENTIONS IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1998 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is a great opportunity for me to continue my debate. 
I was talking about the fact that we have double taxation in Canada. 
It is long overdue. 
It is time we start recognizing there is a global economy. 
We need to not only trade with other countries but compete with them. 
This does a couple of things. 
Why can we not have that same principle enacted in Canada? 
The Minister of Finance will say we have decreased taxes. 
I commend him for it. 
Why should I withhold a compliment for the Minister of Finance? 
Collectively we are paying more taxes than ever.  
We take the GST, the HST. 
We take the excise tax and the income tax. 
We take the UIC tax. 
It is a function that governments in Canada have assumed. 
That is why I became a Reformer. 
The principle is sound and it is supported by the majority of Canadians. 
I am deeply committed to that.  
But what do we have in this country? 
I gave two illustrations before I was interrupted. 
The second was property tax.  
I have sometimes thought that might be a limitation.  
Many of us get up early. 
I worked at NATE, the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology. 
It is worse now than it has ever been. 
The example I was using was property tax. 
I remember several years back when I did a calculation. 
There is an agreement here that we should avoid double taxation. 
The same thing is true for pension funds and other earnings. 
This is a very good agreement.  
However, I wish we could apply that principle of avoiding double taxation. 
This is an urgent need.  
It is correct in principle and I support the bill. 
Meanwhile the principle we are dealing with here is very important. 
We need to start applying it to Canadians who earn money in Canada. 
Let us stop taxing them to death.  
Here we have a government making a policy. 
I am speaking about the government's policies on agriculture. 
It is absolutely crazy the way it does this.  
The other factor of course is taxation. 
They are saying taxes on taxes on taxes. 
Why is that deduction not tax deductible?'' 
We could compete with the best of them.  
The crops in western Canada were generally not that bad this year. 
He figured I would take them. 
I used my mate's income to subsidize the farm.  
That was 15 years ago but those policies are still in place. 
Let us get the country up and strong like it should be.  
Canada is a safe country. 
We have an excellent industry of tourism. 
We have a vigorous population. 
No one can live at this longitude and not be vigorous. 
Winter comes every year. 
We are good, hardworking and dedicated.  
That is what the light was there for. 
I think of the family farm where I grew up. 
The government had better start getting it right. 
We will have a good debate Monday on this.  
When people get on a roll they see things clearly. 
I hope it spends this weekend studying. 
You can go home and study''. 
The bill will probably come to conclusion and pass today. 
It has some good principles on taxation. 
I hope the members go home and study it tomorrow. 
Let them fix it. 
Let them serve Canadians like they say they are serving them. 
I have always come back to it.  
I am referring here to Bill C-28. 
On the other hand, we know that tax agreements are nothing new. 
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Canada, as everyone is aware, is a trading nation. 
That gives us some indication of how important trading is to Canada.  
Such tax treaties have two main goals. 
Such treaties prevent tax evasion. 
Now we are all aware they have had a great conversion. 
The Conservative Party has no problem with the bill. 
It is a good bill and Canada will be better off for it.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
One might ask why my constituents were not protected. 
It was because they were renting property on Indian land. 
This is not the first time this has happened. 
There was no federal law to protect them. 
They fell through the cracks.  
What was the effect of that happening to these people? 
Some of them can be seen sitting right there today. 
They have been destroyed, mainly through vandalism. 
They could not move their homes. 
That is what happened to these people.  
This is not just a one time local problem. 
Other Canadians on reserve lands could also lose their home faced with this situation. 
This is the point of Bill C-402.  
This is extremely important. 
Tenants would be protected from arbitrary evictions.  
Unfortunately any support I receive today from the House would be an empty endorsement. 
And that was the easy part. 
The merit of this piece of legislation is of no importance whatsoever. 
This deplorable state of affairs must end.  
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
We thank him for that.  
The situation at the Driftwood mobile home park in Penticton was extremely unfortunate. 
Certainly no one wants to see these unfortunate incidents repeated.  
Unfortunately these efforts were not successful.  
I believe this is the case with this proposed legislation.  
It is too limited in scope. 
It attempts to substitute our judgment for that of first nations. 
This legislation fails that very important test.  
This legislation also fails that important test.  
I do not know what proposals will emerge from these various consultations. 
The point is that we should not prejudge the outcome. 
Let us allow the consultations to proceed. 
That is what promoting self-government is all about. 
For all of these reasons I respectfully oppose Bill C-402. 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
(b) by the Minister acting as lessor under subsection 58(3).  
In Quebec, tenants are often said to have more rights than owners. 
In this case, the lessor was shamefully in breach of contract. 
The Indian Act goes back to the last century.  
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Were there consultations with the first nations people of Canada?  
When one is dealing with this act, it is of national scope. 
It goes from coast to coast to coast. 
They are waiting for this. 
They have been calling on the government and on all Canadians for this dialogue.  
There could have been a model for self-governance. 
As well, territorial governments have not been taken into account. 
Someday these territories might have full provincial jurisdiction.  
Where are the present landlord and tenant issues concerning the territories? 
I believe they fall with the northern affairs minister. 
This whole topic opens up a major concern.  
There is a human rights conference being celebrated right now in Edmonton. 
All of these things have infringed on their way of life. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
We cannot willy-nilly and easily change the Indian Act. 
This is a complex issue. 
It is not an easy thing to change. 
The Indian Act sets out provisions relating to reserve land. 
To sell land it must be absolutely surrendered to the minister.  
I want to go back to leased land on reserve. 
We are imposing regulations on first nations.

What will the federal government do at that point? 
That is what Bill C-402 would have done.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.
