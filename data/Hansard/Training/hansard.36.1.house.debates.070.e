The House met at 10 a.m. 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Does the hon. minister have permission to put the motion?  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
Mrs. Claudette Bradshaw (Moncton, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Question No. 60 will be answered today. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
STANDING COMMITTEE ON PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
The House resumed from March 9 consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
There is not a mean bone in his body. 
He is a nice man, in the best sense of the word nice. 
The member for Elk Island is also a Canadian patriot. 
What are we to think of all this? 
More important, what are Canadians to think of all this?  
I will tell the House what Canadians think. 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Does the hon. minister have permission to put the motion?  
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Does the House agree with the terms of the motion?  
STANDING COMMITTEE ON PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:
Is that what you are on?  
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:
Mr. Speaker, I have notes on both. 
We all have a certain responsibility to uphold the decorum that my colleagues spoke about. 
It is adding to a sense of intolerance. 
Members opposite seem to have the- 
Now I am faced with a dilemma. 
If the deal has been made then we will go with the deal.  
I do not know all the understandings in the House. 
Would you please sort this out among yourselves for a couple of minutes.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I think it has gone beyond sorting it out among ourselves. 
Mr. Speaker, I agree with what the whip of the Reform Party said. 
I regret any error that has been made on this side. 
That is the understanding. 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Having done that, I will very specifically address the motion.  
There are rules I will remind him of in a moment.  
But what did he do the very next day? 
He also had his suits paid for by his party.  
On this topic, I have one last point. 
I think that the House can tolerate politics of all sorts. 
And I urge the Reform members to listen. 
There was a huge consensus in Quebec on that democratic right. 
What were the hon. members trying to accomplish with their actions that day? 
They figured they had pulled a good stunt. 
That is extremely important.  
We must talk about the Jacob case. 
There is a common denominator in all of this. 
It is always the same. 
The hon. members today- 
It is hard to hear the truth so early in the morning. 
Yes, there you are. 
They are speaking of sedition, of high treason.  
Reform members felt this was high treason, sedition.  
Mr. Jacob was exonerated in that case.  
He was totally exonerated from the false accusations made by Reformers.  
What did they say? 
What did some Liberal members tell the media? 
They directly challenged the decision-making authority of the Speaker of the House of Commons. 
Let me read article 167, on pages 48: 
The Speaker as Presiding Officer of the House of Commons 
Some members made statements to the media; no one denies this. 
I understand Liberal members were given the word last night.  
They slept on it. 
They put away the Canadian flags. 
-No member may rise when the Speaker is standing. 
There are rules in this House. 
I think there is something abnormal in all of this.  
It is a matter directly related to your powers. 
Your ruling will set a precedent for the future.  
Precedents are often cited in this House in support of a position. 
I do not believe that is the objective. 
I think the Canadian flag was used for propaganda purposes. 
I think that is what tolerance is all about. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Is this what the Reform Party leader meant?  
Is this what was implied? 
Could the hon. member elaborate on this.  
They did not want a Quebec leader. 
They ran at least half of their campaign on the backs of Quebeckers. 
We must bear this in mind, as I answer the hon. member's question.  
I think the leader of the Reform Party is an ally of the government.  
Where will this all stop?  
I think this is but the beginning.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened to the comments of the Bloc member with interest. 
I find that to be reprehensible. 
Will he be here to sing O Canada tomorrow?  
There were too many. 
How did they interrupt her? 
With the Canadian flag. 
With the national anthem. 
That was provocation and arrogance.  
It is in fact because we do respect it.  
I feel no call when it is sung. 
I am not drawn by deeper roots; it is Quebec that calls me. 
However, I have great respect for the Canadian flag. 
I would add that the national anthem was written by a Quebecker.  
The Bloc leader said: 
We will now proceed to orders of the day.  
FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF MINISTER OF FINANCE 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
The budget sets out the federal government's priorities for the coming years. 
I would like to begin by looking at job creation. 
Elect us and we will create jobs''. 
Once in office, it was no longer their responsibility. 
Today they rise in their places and tell us how wonderful they are. 
It is unbelievable, completely unbelievable.  
It is the government's responsibility to build infrastructures that will lead to job creation. 
Take the natural gas line in New Brunswick. 
But Canadians are not going to reap the benefits.  
But the government has a responsibility. 
We are not concerned about you''.  
We have to be careful about the budget. 
It was done at the expense of the poor.  
A lady phoned me last week. 
My husband and I are on welfare. 
The wood in our house is rotten all the way up to the windows. 
That is more worrisome than someone who cannot pay $800 in income tax. 
They talked about job creation, and now today that is no longer their responsibility. 
That is their responsibility.  
Their counterparts in Newfoundland said the same thing, as did the premier of PEI. 
Are they all lying? 
These are all Liberals.  
The New Brunswick finance minister, Edmond Blanchard, is a Liberal. 
Russell King is a Liberal. 
What have they done? 
They were given money and they do not know how to manage it.  
That was not the case in the past. 
The money went into health.  
But the bottom line is that people are suffering. 
We are talking about hard-working people who want to go out and work.  
And then there is the business with EI. 
And they are so pleased with themselves.  
Nothing is more important than Canadians' health''.  
The Liberals did not listen. 
They let Canadians down, paid no attention. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
The member talked a lot about education. 
I would raise with him the issue of education. 
It is very important. 
Those items are there.  
Madam Speaker, I would first like to thank my colleague for his question. 
It gives me an opportunity to elaborate on my ideas a bit. 
I honestly did not come to Ottawa to play games. 
What does February's budget have to offer? 
They come out of university and have no work. 
That is one of the major problems.  
I will give you an example of what happens at home. 
It is a last-minute band-aid approach that is badly organized. 
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and Youth), Lib.):
Unfortunately the whole debate that preceded this casts a long dark shadow over this debate. 
Let us look at youth unemployment. 
Unemployment is one of the most serious problems facing young Canadians. 
This measure will pick up and expand the existing new hires program. 
It will make it more attractive for employers to hire young people.  
This is very important. 
It is important that we make an investment in the education of young people. 
It is important that we do early intervention.  
I started in Inuvik, Northwest Territories. 
There are some difficulties and challenges but good things are happening as well.  
We also visited a computer lab. 
It is quite marvellous and we had a chance to experience that. 
There is a lot of talk about child poverty and rightfully so. 
We all have that commitment and dedication.  
They did community service. 
They cut a lot of wood for the elders who needed it cut. 
These are things that are really hard to institutionalize but need to be done. 
We only hear about the bad things about young people.  
The open door society does wonderful work there. 
Government cannot go in and save communities. 
Communities that organize themselves are the ones that are able to do it. 
Others carried on with other projects. 
Some of the young people were moving on to other experiences.  
We visited a group of young people in another program. 
This is where we need to continue to work.  
We need to revisit some of the goals and recommendations in that report. 
They do very good work. 
Many of them suffer from FAS and FAE. 
It is a very serious issue which all members should consider.  
Most of what I have just said refers to youth at risk. 
This is a very important issue. 
There are many such programs. 
Everyone knows about the Canada millennium scholarships. 
There has been much talk about that. 
This will provide relief to graduates who are having trouble managing their student debt load. 
There is increased funding for SchoolNet and the community access program. 
We talked about child poverty. 
That will happen in July. 
These measures will mean cost savings in social assistance. 
We need to give further consideration to that issue. 
I would like to talk about the north a bit. 
The government recognizes that the economies of Canada's territories are undergoing significant change.  
These are necessary to keep pace with population increases. 
These are the essentials for building healthy citizens in our society.  
In terms of the Northwest Territories, we are undergoing a huge change. 
We cannot do for people what people can do for themselves. 
Governments are facilitators and catalysts, not doers. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
It is a serious problem.  
What hope can she give that changes are in the offing?  
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:
Madam Speaker, I am very pleased that my hon. colleague asked this question. 
An amount of money has been out there and it is a lot of money.  
Post-secondary education is an issue that has, I believe, some crossover. 
There have been some sponsorships. 
It will be funded to a higher amount, I believe, than the current arrangement. 
There will be more money there than there was previously. 
It will be for training in labour market development. 
They were the beneficiaries. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
In 1994 I heard the same thing. 
There is genuine suffering going on and yet each year nothing seems to change.  
I would like to know why. 
I would like the member to answer that.  
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:
He should take the opportunity.  
This is the agreement we have with our provinces.  
The agreements that we have struck are based on client to service. 
We will not prop up the industry of poverty. 
We will not prop up the industry of employment. 
What we are doing is giving the money directly to the people who are affected. 
There is an element of risk. 
We know that but we have a strong accountability framework. 
It goes directly into servicing the clients we have.  
We do not provide core funding. 
We give them money that goes directly to the young people who are affected.  
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
It has given less money to the unemployed. 
What do people do when they are not eligible for employment insurance? 
They turn to welfare, which is a provincial responsibility.  
As we know, welfare is a provincial responsibility.  
Because of federal government actions.  
Here is another example. 
Why are the provinces hard pressed to resolve the educational problem? 
That is what is ironic about the situation.  
It considers it is better placed to identify its own priorities.  
For the most part, these children live below the poverty line. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
I appreciate her raising this in the House.  
The member who just spoke has raised a number of issues. 
That partnership is extremely important.  
There is no question that that is true. 
The provinces were asked to do a very small share of it. 
The member should well know that there are two partners in this.  
My question has to do with the direct issue of the millennium scholarship fund.  
This is not exactly the case in Quebec and Ontario. 
Perhaps students in Quebec will not say no to millennium scholarships. 
We already have a loans and grants program in Quebec. 
The cause lies elsewhere. 
That is what partnership is about, when one understands what it means.  
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
As for the millennium scholarships, some context is required. 
The needs are increasing every year. 
Those merit scholarships, moreover, come from the private sector. 
Speaking of the private sector, a kind of near-privatization is taking place. 
I do not understand Mr. Landry. 
He was either misinformed or conned. 
Nothing is impossible with these people. 
Mrs. Gagnon is known for views that are not normally very favourable to us. 
Further on, she says: 
The millennium scholarships will be grafted, God knows how, onto an already existing grant system. 
With that, I conclude my remarks. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
The issues here are directed to low and middle incomes and accessibility.  
We are speaking conceptually of the principle of access.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
The budget speech clearly alludes to needs, merit and mobility criteria.  
As for mobility, one wonders what it means for Quebeckers. 
I do not believe such opportunities are a priority for Quebeckers.  
The same goes for the Canadian Constitution. 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour, Lib.):
In 1993 our government had three choices. 
We could have continued to add to the deficit. 
This was the Reform Party's position. 
The most vulnerable in our society would have been abandoned. 
Our choice was to reduce the deficit while preserving social programs. 
This approach required sacrifice from all Canadians.  
Where are we today, five years later? 
It is the first time since 1969 and 1970 that there is no deficit.  
This budget of balance addresses the needs and concerns of residents of Guelph-Wellington. 
Guelph-Wellington asked for a zero deficit. 
Guelph-Wellington asked for tax relief. 
In this budget the minister increased the funding for the three granting councils. 
I should hope no one. 
The Liberal government recognizes the importance of research and development. 
This is good news for Guelph-Wellington and for Canada. 
This means that 83% of all Canadians will pay no surtax whatsoever. 
This type of tax relief is directed at those whose needs are the greatest. 
Again, how can anyone fight against it? 
How can anyone oppose it?  
The federal government has always recognized the importance of volunteers. 
The answer is simple.  
We know that volunteers are important. 
Volunteers are what make many, many communities go round.  
Our government has always recognized the importance of self-employed business people. 
This budget ensures that mandatory subcontracting income is reported. 
There are many contractors in Guelph-Wellington who will benefit from this measure.  
How do you criticize a balanced budget? 
There is the key. 
We are protecting our social programs. 
That would not have happened under the Reform's proposition.  
This budget stays the course. 
We are making a difference.  
It is an important one and it is unique.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
What conversion on the road to Damascus did the Prime Minister go through? 
In fact, they spoke against it in the election campaign.  
I am certain that is not her intention.  
That is the reality. 
More Canadians are working now. 
That does mean that the economy and everything else works better. 
We do have more money to support our social programs.  
My speech did reflect that. 
Perhaps the member missed that part of it.  
We do need to have somebody directing and saying that we are on a course. 
This budget does reflect those very values.  
We believe that health care is important. 
We have clearly stood up and said no to the Reform Party's agenda. 
We will balance the budget. 
Clearly it is a budget we all should be proud of.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
Where do we stand today? 
This is the first time Canada has had a balanced budget in almost 30 years. 
What a monumental accomplishment. 
Canada has the only balanced budget of any G-7 nation.  
That is not all. 
It will fall again even more. 
Last year alone some 372,000 jobs were created. 
Employment has risen in every region of our country during the past 18 months.  
What about interest rates? 
That is not all. 
Inflation is at its lowest level in three decades. 
Consumer confidence rebounded in 1997. 
Business confidence achieved record levels in the same year.  
It got priorities-right. 
It helped redefine the proper role of government in a modern economy. 
It balanced revenues and expenditures. 
It opted for prudent forecasts''.  
It is a major accomplishment. 
I would like to read quotations from my province of Manitoba. 
The headline in the Winnipeg Free Press read: ``In the black. 
Surpluses rolling in after 28 straight years of deficit spending''.  
Putting more money into people's hands is good for the economy''.  
Another headline in the Free Press read: ``Students' debt pains eased''. 
It will ease the crushing student debtloads. 
This is going to help our young people participate in the knowledge based economy''.  
Why do they praise the budget? 
The research granting councils receive an extra $400 million. 
This will certainly prevent our best scientists from leaving the country. 
A rising economic tide tide does not lift all boats.  
It is the first time we have had a surplus in almost 28 years. 
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
We have historic high taxes. 
We have historic high unemployment rates for youth. 
We have a historic amount of families living on the edge of poverty.  
What is that doing to social programs in this country? 
Could we not make it truly a historic budget? 
I would like to hear his comments on that.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:
It is simple arithmetic.  
Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Quebec East, BQ):
``It amounts to the rape of federalism. 
It is also politically egocentric, administratively inept and strategically stupid. 
Moreover, it is unnecessary''.  
This is what John Trent wrote. 
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:
The Liberals have the same message.  
We have to keep repeating the message if the opposition refuses to listen. 
We also know that not all expectations have been achieved. 
The first phase has been completed. 
We are now in the second phase and we will go to the third phase. 
If the member will wait he will see all the beauty of our budget.  
The students will criticize Mr. Trent.  
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with my colleague from Nanaimo-Cowichan.  
Inevitably there will be people on both sides of the debate. 
Some will be pleased and many will find fault no matter what you do.  
I do not find much honour in that.  
Instead he made the choice to be many things to many people. 
The minister left many important things out of the budget. 
We can afford $600 million for an office of official languages. 
I think the evidence would point to the contrary. 
What are the Liberals afraid of? 
The budget shows what they are afraid of. 
Canadians will continue to finance massive programs. 
I see nothing honourable in that.  
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
I see those two things as cross purposes. 
That is exactly what Canadians asked for and this government delivered.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for her question. 
Many regional programs that we have seen governments direct are always mistargeted. 
She talks about a reduction in the surtax. 
We think that is great. 
It should apply to everybody. 
I do not see that as helping that sector of society.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Even the aboriginal community was not consulted in that. 
It is a day late and a dollar short in their estimation. 
Maybe he should have consulted with them a little more than he did.  
The member talked about the millennium scholarship fund. 
What do the other 93% or 94% of students do? 
Do they sit and wait? 
This does not kick in until the year 2000. 
Students in our universities are in a crisis now. 
They need some help today, not two years down the road. 
That is a little too late.  
It just does not go far enough.  
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
One might have hoped that it would be under much better circumstances. 
Nothing could have been further from the truth. 
What is the reward for the sacrifices Canadians have made? 
One short word, nothing. 
What they should be getting is broad based meaningful tax relief. 
They deserve nothing less. 
The chequebooks are out again.  
This year the Liberals will spend $161 billion. 
In fiscal year 1999-2000 they will spend $167 billion. 
Finally, projected spending for 2000-01 will be about $173 billion. 
The Liberal government does not seem to get it. 
Canadians are being squeezed and they desperately need tax relief. 
Why could they have not done something about that?  
That is not acceptable. 
This tax just keeps on taking and taking out of the pockets of Canadians.  
We have to see that there are social consequences to this budget as well. 
This mountain of accumulated federal debt requires interest payments. 
We have to do something about the interest payments on this debt. 
Do you see how important this is? 
I would like to read a letter.  
In short, think deficit reduction. 
That is from Bruce and Deborah Maher in my riding.  
Or the government could even give a mix of tax relief. 
Anything would be better than what we have.  
This could only be done if the Liberals reduced the accumulated federal debt by half. 
Sadly this budget does nothing to help ordinary taxpaying Canadians. 
If anything it impoverishes them further by increasing the tax burden. 
I cannot support this budget.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
The hon. member is using a little bit of smoke and mirrors.  
The member also talks a lot about bracket creep. 
He had a lot of fluff in there about all the editorial commentary. 
We are not talking about the substantive items.  
I want to ask him a question about tax relief. 
That is included in the determination of a balanced budget. 
What item is he going to change specifically to provide which tax benefit? 
How much is it going to cost? 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague has hit the nail right on the head. 
How could the government do it otherwise? 
It would not be able to do it. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Miramichi.  
The challenge we must continue to meet and master is clear. 
However, the fact is that the scholarship fund is a one time investment. 
The general tax relief announced by the minister is much more permanent.  
Let us look at the saving to the total number of taxpayers. 
It will continue to grow year after year.  
Surely taxpayers and students meet those criteria.  
For employers, it means paying up to $109 less per employee.  
This measure will benefit some 65,000 Canadian families with children.  
We have also been a government that recognizes the challenge of the aging population. 
We have had to address this in connection with the Canada pension plan. 
Our performance on behalf of the average taxpayer is concrete, credible and consistent. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
However, in fairness, the official opposition has to put things in perspective here.  
Our taxes have gone absolutely through the roof.  
The member should consider the evidence. 
We have some of the lowest interest rates in historical perspective. 
The member makes reference to the G-7. 
We will see more of that. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member on his speech concerning this very historic budget.  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
My wife and I have raised four young people. 
He made $14,613.32 in the last fiscal year. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
Mr. Charles Hubbard (Miramichi, Lib.):
The annual deficits were in the vicinity of $40 billion to $50 billion each year. 
The international bankers were almost on our doorsteps.  
It had to bring confidence back into our economy. 
That is an outstanding accomplishment.  
We have heard today about employment and unemployment. 
We have had difficulties in the Miramichi. 
I am happy to report today on the outcome. 
The member opposite alluded to youth. 
We hear people casting stones about the debt. 
We have certain breaks now for those who are having difficulty with their student loans. 
University programs have been good. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend opposite for his speech. 
In fact the government actually reversed completely the promise it made in 1995.  
I think that is a betrayal. 
It was taxpayers through revenues who really beat this deficit down. 
That is what this government is all about. 
We are out there trying to get more Canadians employed. 
I mentioned that some 9% today are unemployed. 
We would have a tremendous economy. 
The hope is there as we approach the 21st century.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
The government has done it on reducing the deficit. 
It did it over a period of years.  
Perhaps the member opposite could answer that question.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have listened for the most part to the member's presentation.  
Of course the jobs are not out there. 
We have a projected debt that will remain at $583 billion. 
This debt will cost every Canadian family $6,000 a year. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
That was the clear message I received in my riding.  
They were asked to bear some of the hardship. 
Members across the House have raised a number of points. 
There are commitments to be made.  
The stage has now been set for further changes to be made. 
I will conclude my comments because I am sure members will have some questions.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have a quick question.  
My friend stated that governments did not create jobs. 
Will my hon. friend tell me who pays for these very essential people in society?  
That is not the way to manage an economy in a fiscally responsible manner.  
NDPers have their way. 
I understand where they are in the political spectrum. 
I understand where they are in the House. 
That is why the Liberal Party is the governing party. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
My friend is a defender of families. 
He has written a book about families. 
He advocates that all families be treated fairly in the taxation system.  
I understand the thrust of his question. 
I still support that. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
He certainly had a dramatic impact on the budget. 
He is very learned in terms of tax issues.  
The hon. member for Mississauga South has consistently been a strong promoter of families. 
I am sure he has talked to a number of people. 
I would be very pleased to hear what his constituents had to say.  
Many Canadians are unaware of some of these programs. 
I thank the member for his kind words. 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the member asks an interesting question. 
I noted that provision. 
Certain accounting rules of the Government of Canada are not discretionary. 
There are accounting rules as there are for any business. 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
Brett Morgan was convicted of murdering Louise Ellis. 
He also killed an Edmonton woman and is a suspect in another murder. 
Like Morgan, Armstrong is believed to have killed before. 
Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
I am proud to express my appreciation for the distinction these Olympians- 
The hon. member for London-Fanshawe.  
CANADA-IRELAND INTERPARLIAMENTARY FRIENDSHIP GROUP 
Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Fanshawe, Lib.):
Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):
This week in Nagano the Paralympics are taking place. 
This past Sunday Canada won its first two medals of the games. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Time was of the essence for that vaccine to work. 
Was it because the defence minister could not get organized? 
Or was it because he did not care? 
In either case, his assurances were hollow.  
The defence minister should be ashamed of himself. 
We need to pay the highest respect to our forces. 
We need to give them all the protection they need to do their job.  
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
The problems of the Algerians are beyond description. 
Tens of thousands of people have died because of the murderous destruction of terrorism. 
Mr. John Maloney (Erie-Lincoln, Lib.):
The four year mandatory is the right way to go.  
ASSOCIATION FEMININE D'EDUCATION ET D'ACTION SOCIALE DU QUEBEC 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Mrs. Claudette Bradshaw (Moncton, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
Canadians can ill afford the status quo of unaccountability and absenteeism.  
MEMBER FOR EDMONTON NORTH 
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Humber-St. 
What a message from the Reform party to senior citizens.  
I just want to ask one question. 
Senior citizens across the country are outraged to note- 
The hon. member for Kamloops.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
It costs Canadian taxpayers approximately $60 million a year to run the Senate. 
The people of B.C. want to abolish the Senate. 
B.C. is fed up with the Senate. 
B.C. does not want another appointed senator. 
B.C. wants this Senate abolished.  
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Long live the flag of Quebec! 
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
One issue relates to the RCMP. 
Our municipal police forces are worried, and rightfully so. 
Ms. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
Quebec's performance should exceed the Canadian average. 
This is a good argument in favour of keeping Quebec within Canada.  
In the private sector, the situation will also be favourable. 
Such reports destroy the sovereignist myth that the Canadian economy- 
We will now proceed to oral question period. 
The Hon. Leader of the Official Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Does the government agree with these outrageous statements?  
Colleagues, I would judge that question is quite borderline. 
I will permit the question if the hon. Deputy Prime Minister wishes to answer it.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
The hon. member for Fraser Valley.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
What is the Prime Minister- 
The hon. member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
This was eloquently demonstrated by Professor Fortin.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
This means our economy is running smoothly.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
The real question, however, is this:
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, a mistake has to be acknowledged before it can be corrected. 
The minister's problem is that he is determined to deny the evidence.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
You are not helping unemployed workers.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
We are going to continue to serve Canadians properly.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
There was not one penny in his budget for home care.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is so typical of the New Democratic Party. 
According to that party, we should spend first and find out why afterward.  
That is exactly what we are going to do. 
We will then solve the problem.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Canadians do not want more studies. 
They want cash on the table.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):

The hon. member for Beauharnois-Salaberry.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Other measures can be discussed further. 
I would ask the hon. member- 
The hon. member for Beauharnois-Salaberry.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
That is what the priority is for the Government of Canada.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Not at all, Mr. Speaker. 
It is not a matter of infringing upon a provincial jurisdiction. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my supplementary is for the Minister of Justice.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
I have a question for the secretary of state. 
What is this government doing to invest in Canada's future?  
I could mention several other initiatives, but I will stop here.  
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
What is his answer to Mr. Bourassa today?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
He is left with student debts and little hope. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Mr. Speaker, it is time for a good highway question. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have answered the question before. 
I have talked at length on this matter with the hon. member. 
New Brunswick discharged its end of the bargain. 
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton, Lib.):
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, safety is a primary concern to the Canadian coast guard.  
The initiative my hon. colleague talks about is about saving lives. 
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the minister of immigration.  
Is the minister prepared today to categorically reject this racist recommendation?  
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
I personally expressed some concerns regarding such a recommendation. 
I have made it very clear that I myself have some reservations.  
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Mr. Speaker, I did not hear a categorical rejection of that recommendation. 
I put the question to the minister again. 
Will she today categorically reject the racist recommendation?  
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
The hon. member for Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans.  
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Transport. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
We hope it is the first of many more to come.  
This is a matter we are concerned about. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Acadie-Bathurst for his question.  
Once we have understood the reality, we will take corrective action.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
What information can the minister add? 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
They ensure that anything we give to our troops is safe.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Why are these Canadians not being vaccinated for anthrax?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
There are antibiotics and other inoculations for other possible diseases. 
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
Helping women in the developing world is very important for Canadians.  
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
My question is for the Minister of Health. 
When will Canadians see a commitment in financial dollars for home care?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We cannot now spend before we know what we are spending on. 
It is one thing to say there is a problem. 
That is exactly what we are going to do.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
That is exactly what we have been working on.  
In recent weeks I have been engaged in discussions with my provincial counterparts. 
We are making progress. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and Youth), Lib.):
It cannot be just one department. 
There are outstanding reports from previous governments which contain good recommendations. 
My colleagues, that will bring to a close our question period.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
No Member may rise when the Speaker is standing. 
I believe that they are by the vast majority of us. 
Hopefully they will be in the future by all of us.  
The rules of this House are quite clear for all of us. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Citation 164 states that the Speaker communicates the resolutions of the House. 
You refused to listen to him for the remainder of the question period.  
Certainly that was the intent of those questions. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
I will not spend a lot of time on this issue. 
It is a matter of respect for democracy. 
It is a matter of respect for authority. 
Recall does not exist yet in politics. 
Perhaps this is a good thing for those who show no respect for our institutions.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
The Reform whip read: 
(1) Communicates the resolutions of the House to those to whom they are directed- 
He did not finish the sentence, which continues on: 
-and conveys its thanks and expresses its censure, reprimands, and admonitions.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot of reference to this incident.  
There has been reference to you and your role as the Chair. 
Perhaps the most important word that has been used here is respect. 
I would also suggest an important word is impartiality. 
I would suggest that you rightly ruled this out of order.  
There were options available. 
However they chose not to do so. 
They did so in an improper way which you ruled out of order.  
At that time the government remained silent on this point.  
We are seeing this happen quite readily over the last two weeks.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
This is patently wrong and patently ridiculous.  
They should have these words reflected in their actions today.  
But there is a way. 
I do not want to be the focal point of the debate.  
We have better things to do.  
I invite you to do it now so that we can clear the air.  
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your comments. 
FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF MINISTER OF FINANCE 
Do I have another point of order?  
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on another point of order.  
We will take that as a point of debate. 
We have gone to orders of the day.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to return the debate to budget 1998. 
The benefits are now clear. 
It is breaking down the barriers of time and distance. 
It affects all sectors of our economy.  
It will feed a stronger Canadian innovation system.  
Budget 1998 expands and deepens that record of action across the industry portfolio. 
These kinds of initiatives are changing the economic face of Canada.  
Those days are gone. 
By 1997 that figure was more than 800 and it is continuing to rise.  
They are creating opportunities for young people to learn and to find work. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
So, when we are told that the business community was happy, we have our doubts. 
He says that everyone was happy. 
The Income Taxpayers' Association also had something to say. 
There were people representing taxpayers. 
By almost $31 billion in three years.  
That amounts to laughing in people's faces.  
I have a question for the minister, in view of his remarks. 
The new economy will not be built by bricks and mortar. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Quite frankly they do have not a lot of reason for such pride.  
I honestly say that the Liberals can learn something from my colleagues in Manitoba.  
Is the government listening? 
There was a reduction in personal income tax. 
The Liberal government unfortunately has not learned those lessons.  
In the Manitoba budget small business was acknowledged. 
An economic opportunity will be available if the businesses are treated properly. 
Unfortunately the Liberal government has not learned the lessons of other provincial governments.  
There was a capital tax reduction. 
There was an increase in the exemption from $3 million to $5 million. 
That is very positive. 
The Liberal government should take lessons from it.  
Let us talk about the Liberal budget. 
It is balanced for the first time. 
I am very pleased that finally the budget is balanced.  
Let us understand why the budget is balanced. 
Make no mistake about it. 
We live in a global economy.  
We are going to expand into Europe. 
We are going to expand with the MAI. 
We are going to expand into South America. 
Let us have a look at the Liberal record. 
The Liberals have raised taxes 40 times since 1994. 
Canadian wage earners pay roughly one-third more in taxes than their American counterparts.  
There will be record levels with 97,000 registered bankruptcies in Canada this year.  
The government cannot blame anybody. 
It cannot blame previous administrations. 
It cannot blame the economy. 
Quite frankly they will have to pay more taxes. 
I go back to the Manitoba budget. 
It reduced regressive payroll taxes. 
It increased the exemption in capital assets. 
It reduced capital tax. 
The Prime Minister said ``Go and compare with the Manitoba budget''. 
We have a budget that was tabled in the House by the finance minister. 
If he were to acknowledge where he really stands, this budget would be politically indefensible''.  
The budget raises the basic personal amount of deduction by only $500. 
I hate to repeat myself but I will. 
Let us go back to the Manitoba budget. 
The Prime Minister suggested I do that. 
Do I not listen to what the Prime Minister says? 
Go to the Manitoba budget. 
It came from the pockets of the taxpayers of Manitoba. 
That comes from Ontario Premier Mike Harris.  
That comes from the Manitoba finance minister, Mr. Eric Stefanson.  
One area of my responsibility is agriculture. 
That comes from Jack Wilkinson, Canadian Federation of Agriculture.  
``There is painfully little in this budget on agriculture. 
That comes from Nettie Wiebe of the National Farmers Union. 
I have received and looked at the criteria of the Canadian rural partnership program. 
Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Let us put that $7 million into context. 
Let us also put these transfer payments into further context. 
That accounts for 36% of Manitoba's estimated revenues. 
I would like to quote the finance minister of Manitoba: 
The proof lies in the pudding. 
That is okay, the member can hide his head in the sand.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I have two questions. 
I was wondering if the member would agree.  
The second question is in regard to agriculture. 
I agree with him. 
In fact agriculture will be devastated by what this government has done.  
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the question from the hon. member from Yorkton-Melville.  
Agriculturalists, farmers, obviously are going to be impacted quite dramatically by this. 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF MINISTER OF FINANCE 
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
We had a certain amount of finger pointing. 
The last member was pointing fingers at Prime Minister Trudeau's administration. 
We then ended up with a Conservative administration that added to the burden once again.  
Whoever was the architect back then should be ashamed.  
I have two things to talk about today. 
This has led to the taxpayer being penalized. 
This is not the only legacy. 
The answer is so common sense that they wonder why I am asking the question. 
Let us hope we never get back there again. 
Maybe we are still there.  
What does this budget do? 
We have salmon disappearing on both coasts. 
We have unresolved issues with Alaska on the west coast. 
We have yet to go to the north coast. 
Everyone recognizes and agrees that field enforcement has been shorted in a major way.  
They were located where the action was. 
They tended not to be bureaucratized and were promoted from within the ranks. 
With the poorly thought out cutbacks, they are no longer there. 
The DFO needs a new, strong mission statement which includes all people. 
The spin-off is wonderful and can be multiplied many times.  
This government must reset its priorities. 
This government has lost that sense. 
How can we relate to the government? 
The government is too complacent by far. 
This government needs to pay back Canadian taxpayers by delivering debt and tax relief. 
There is no surplus in 1998 because the government spent it. 
The Liberal election promise was quickly broken by a government with no shame.  
Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):
He talked critically about the fact that we were spending money on strengthening communities. 
I was quite surprised to hear him say that.  
We want to strengthen communities. 
My point is that this government is doing things in an insensitive fashion.  
The government is hurting coastal communities in particular. 
That was my point. 
This week we are talking about light stations on the coast. 
They are much more important. 
Entrepreneurs cannot try to get anything done when it comes to developing a new fishery. 
This is a big item. 
It is very sad.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
We have a deficit that is down to zero, or so they say. 
The debt is at $583 billion. 
That is at a cost of $6,000 per year for every taxpayer.  
The Liberals have the chequebook out again. 
No tax relief and no debt repayment.  
A Liberal member asked a question about small communities. 
I was up in the Sunshine Coast in the area of Sechelt. 
I would like to read some of the comments that the husband and wife made. 
These people are in their retirement age. 
They talked about an old age pension phase-in to change the entitlement. 
It is not a bad idea. 
It is being done in other areas. 
There were other concerns that my constituents had. 
That is what people are thinking when we talk to them in our constituencies. 
They expected when they elected this government that it would get that deficit down. 
The message was very clear. 
What has this government done for the debt? 
It has announced $10 billion in new spending programs. 
Let us ask this government what it is doing.  
We are very happy to do that, to help Canada be a united country. 
But we ask what has this government done in fisheries? 
My colleague our fisheries critic has talked about that.  
We have asked why the government is not dredging the harbour. 
Well the silt has built up. 
Where is the money it collected? 
I checked with my Reform colleagues. 
I see Liberal members laughing. 
It is not a funny matter. 
One even sounds like a separatist. 
But we want to know that British Columbia is recognized here in Ottawa.  
That is the feeling still, unfortunately, of a lot of British Columbians.  
We want to make sure our voice is being heard.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
As he mentioned, he was elected in 1972, I believe.  
The process of deficit reduction has taken 15 years. 
My question for the hon. member:
They stopped listening to the people.  
That is exactly what happened.  
It is the people in this country. 
We can stand up in this House and make all the speeches we want. 
I have been in and out of this business a few times. 
If we are not out listening to the people we will not understand. 
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
I am most pleased to participate in this debate on this budget. 
It is indeed a defining moment in our history.  
There are concerns in that area. 
Gaining this position has not been easy. 
Now we have accomplished our goal. 
We have a foundation which we can build on in the future. 
I have been accused of a lot of things. 
We have balanced the budget. 
We have targeted more to the low income people. 
Such measures show foresight and are indeed building for the future.  
I know others have argued that it is not enough. 
He is clearly wrong. 
That is the difference between Liberals and Reformers. 
That is good news.  
There is an additional $850 million to the child tax benefit program. 
There is the new caregiver credit. 
There is the Canadian opportunities strategy. 
What about rural areas? 
These primary industries account for almost half of Canada's exports. 
That is one thing that certainly a balanced budget will help us with.  
That is a very important initiative, especially for the farming community.  
In conclusion, the budget has foresight. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
However, his partisanship clouds his thinking. 
I told them he nonetheless cost them $12 million a year. 
Yet no one knew his name.  
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Vaughan-King-Aurora, Lib.):
No one could have. 
At that time deficits had become a permanent part of our political culture.  
It is the reality we lived with. 
This is a discouraging fact. 
Finally Canadians ran out of patience and voted for change. 
It was an overwhelming challenge but the government did not shrink from it. 
This is their victory''.  
Individuals and groups responded with enthusiasm. 
They came forward with their proposals for what should be in the federal budget.  
Last year I participated in the prebudget consultations. 
The people of Canada spoke out in a loud and clear voice. 
The government has listened and it has acted. 
The budget is the response. 
The 1998 budget responds to the expectations of Canadians.  
Let us consider the following points. 
The government has taken some major steps toward tax relief. 
The budget is a turning point. 
This is the year we stop borrowing from our children. 
This is the year we start giving them something back. 
Instead of mortgaging their future we are now helping them to build their future.  
Let us make no mistake. 
The budget contains other strategic targeted investments. 
At the same time the government is moving forward in key areas. 
That is what we have done. 
The government has taken measures to increase the basic income tax exemption. 
This is only the first step. 
Already this year the government has paid down almost $13 billion of this debt.  
That has been the genius of the government's budgets. 
They have always combined fiscal responsibility with social responsibility. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
He also mentioned that all Canadians will have access to post-secondary education. 
I really disagree with those statements.  
I remember the prebudget hearings that were held in Vancouver, where I come from. 
I want to ask one question on education. 
The member says that there will be access for all Canadians. 
We followed up on that.  
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
It gives me great pleasure to speak on this budget. 
We are now up to $120 million. 
The government is muddling through on this issue. 
First, it fails to address the real agreement. 
It knew that this issue was coming down the pipe. 
It had been coming for many years. 
Yet this government failed during Kyoto. 
It failed to do that. 
The provinces have to be onside for any global agreement on climate change within Canada. 
What did our government do? 
It is the provinces that are going to have to implement this deal. 
I do not think we want to do that. 
That is the level this government agreed to in Kyoto. 
The problem is how we are going to get there. 
There is no plan. 
This government has not put forward a plan. 
Throw $170 million at it. 
That is the answer. 
That simply will not wash.  
That is going to get us a long way.  
Where is the plan? 
That is the bottom line. 
There were a number of concerns with that legislation. 
I would hope that the minister is doing the same thing. 
There is another issue which comes very much to the fore. 
The legislation has to be at arm's length from politicians. 
It was an issue that was just there to catch votes. 
There also has to be clear federal-provincial guidelines. 
There were major concerns with the legislation.  
Finally in my portfolio I deal with the Senate. 
There is one way we can. 
Our very first vote, vote one of the estimates is the Senate. 
It is the Senate appropriation. 
It is the Senate's money. 
A few departments would have that. 
I am simply looking for accountability.  
The Senate refused to do that. 
We have another House that is unaccountable. 
That is the point we should be dealing with. 
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to add some comments on the budget. 
Did you borrow more and more money every single year for the last 30 years? 
Now we have a federal debt of $583 billion. 
That is a mortgage on our children. 
Every single year they have to pay interest on that debt. 
That is money they will not have to look after their own security. 
That is exactly what has been done. 
That has to come out of taxes. 
There is no money growing on trees yet.  
In 1995 it slipped to $18.6 billion. 
Interest goes up and social funding goes down.  
Those dollars are taken away from discretionary spending. 
They are taken away from saving for emergencies. 
They are taken away from the amount each of us has to educate our children. 
They are taken away from the amount each of us can put away for retirement.  
I have just talked about it. 
What has that led to? 
It has led to hospital closures and longer waiting lists. 
Now the government is making a big deal about home care. 
Students are facing rising tuition fees and high levels of debt. 
There is a business cycle. 
This will require an increase in social spending. 
Where will that money come from?  
What will happen when interest rates rise? 
What they pay in taxes has nearly doubled over the same time period. 
It is brutal taxation. 
Liberal budgets have caused child poverty. 
Liberals should be hanging their head in shame.  
The value of the child tax benefit declines every year. 
The refundable GST credit declines in value every year. 
Personal taxes payable creep up steadily every year. 
These stealth taxes fall most heavily on the working poor.  
Families and Canadians must have tax relief. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
I had the good fortune of owning a home in Canada. 
Madam Speaker, the mortgage on our country is not backed up by any asset. 
Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):
First of all, she talks about taxpayers. 
She is right to talk about taxpayers. 
They are an important part of Canada. 
In fact, there was $7 billion worth of tax relief in this budget. 
Do you know why I think she may not have brought it up? 
That party would simply do away with it. 
So I ask the question:
Remember, equalization does not come from the federal government. 
It goes from have provinces to have not provinces. 
It has nothing to do with federal government spending.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am afraid the time has expired.  
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
We have achieved this with balance and with determination. 
We have not been slashing and burning. 
A balanced budget means no new borrowing by the Government of Canada. 
We can now begin to pay down our public debts. 
Our federal budget will be balanced for 1998, 1999 and 2000. 
That is why I am pleased to be part of this historic moment.  
That is quite an achievement. 
Canadians are concerned about the state of our national health care system. 
This amount responds directly to the recommendations of the national forum on health.  
This is totally different from the equalization transfers.  
I would like to clarify that.  
Let us put things in the proper perspective.  
General tax cuts will come when we can afford them as Canadians.  
We have heard much recently about the so-called brain drain. 
The article is entitled Back from the Brain Drain. 
This is not from a right wing think tank. 
This is not theory. 
To sum up, this budget has balance. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I have a very simple question for this member. 
I feel this is totally unfair and unjust. 
The member talks about balance. 
There is no balance here. 
It has ramifications throughout the whole tax system. 
I think we need to look at them carefully but cautiously.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I have listened attentively to the comments by the government member.  
My question is about transfer payments. 
In reality, seven of the ten provinces will lose money with this budget.  
In my province of New Brunswick, the health system is deplorable. 
The hon. member says it is a good budget. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member from New Brunswick for his question.  
We gave the provinces the lead time required. 
In January 1994 the deficit was $42 billion. 
Five years ago I was very concerned about my daughter's future. 
The country was in a financial and political crisis. 
So I have good news to tell my two daughters.  
We are putting money aside to take care of the debt. 
As we all know, education is a priority for this government. 
My parents believed in education. 
I believe this is what the budget does. 
Faced with the challenges of the new millennium, governments have a duty to work together. 
A well educated labour force creates employment. 
This is extremely important for young Canadians.  
Three of them returned to school, and they were street kids to begin with.  
These initiatives will make it easier for young Canadians to integrate into the work force. 
In fact, my constituents told me so. 
This new budget is very significant. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The question is on the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
STANDING COMMITTEE ON PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the amendment.  
The next recorded division is on the amendment to the motion relating to privilege.  
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
Is there agreement to proceed in this fashion?  
The question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the amendment, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the amendment carried. 
The next question is on the main motion as amended. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion as amended carried.  
It is my understanding that all speeches will be 10 minutes or less.  
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
In the budget it is clear that we are again promoting Canadian culture.  
I wonder if we could just ask them to take their meeting outside.  
I must emphasize it was throughout Canada. 
Most of these jobs were in highly specialized skilled and were well paid jobs. 
The direct economic spin-off benefits are in the range of $625 million.  
A country's real strength lies in its people. 
Through them we can express our identity, our similarities and differences.  
Canadians deserve Canadian programming.  
Half of the fund's moneys went to fund CBC programming production.  
That is not true. 
I would like to conclude by reading from this report.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
I should not get too upset or worried about it. 
That is exactly what happens. 
It has forced provincial governments into the red in an effort to balance their budgets. 
This cannot, in my view, be considered a success.  
We can simply look at the $600 billion debt. 
Once again we have all sizzle and no steak from our finance minister. 
It is obvious the Liberals can only think as far ahead as the next election.  
The big government philosophy of the 1980s has not yet left the Liberal Party. 
It was a futile but expensive effort to try to embarrass a past prime minister. 
This budget is clearly without a plan.  
It was a big joke.  
We really only need two parties in the House, the spenders and the non-spenders.  
This increase alone is equivalent to $5,000 per Canadian family. 
Taxes are going to go higher and higher. 
This budget proves it.  
He gave the nation his word. 
He was going to abolish it. 
Instead it is going to draw 46% more.  
This budget offers them little hope.  
The Liberals' ambivalence toward children begins at an early age. 
Our entire tax structure focuses on those who use alternative care. 
Now in 1998 I still hear the same thing from that side of the House. 
But nobody has given any money to these children.  
When are they going to start doing something like that? 
I guess that is not the politically popular thing to do.  
This budget has left them standing in the cold. 
Reform believes that changes should be made on the following basis. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
What this budget really does is provide the tools to weaken Canada. 
As we know, everyone contributed heavily to that effort.  
The Minister of Finance's audacity does not stop there, moreover. 
What is happening in the provinces? 
Cuts are being made. 
What is happening at the federal level? 
The deception has now been revealed, the figures are there to prove it.  
Instead of eliminating the problem, I think he is making it worse.  
This increase will not take effect until next July. 
He is promising something for next July, but he is already $250 million behind. 
These are therefore specific measures that the Minister of Finance often neglects. 
Such a reform has a negative impact on poverty. 
We all know that those who cannot get employment insurance are on welfare. 
Instead of that, we get this skimpy budget. 
And who is going to pay for it in the end? 
They were ignoring educational priorities. 
It is ignoring what is happening in the provinces.  
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member, but her time has run out.  
The hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
We have heard those sentiments expressed from all parts, all areas in this country. 
Medicare is underfunded and people are suffering unnecessarily for it.  
There is no new money in this budget for health care. 
There is no federal leadership in this budget. 
We once had one of the finest health care systems in the world. 
For decades our health care system provided efficient, good quality service for all Canadians. 
The solution is clear. 
A reinvestment in medicare is absolutely imperative. 
These cuts clearly have a disproportionate affect on women.  
We will do what we can to put pressure on the government.  
What is in the budget for them? 
The government plays with numbers. 
It sets targets for inflation. 
There is no new spending for youth employment. 
That is the sad and unacceptable thing about the budget. 
It has missed this opportunity and left a terrible price for all Canadians to pay.  
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Mr. Speaker, we are being spoiled this evening. 
I am pleased to speak to the budget speech. 
The operational deficit was kept under firm control during that period. 
Sight must not be lost of the money this brought into Canada for the government. 
They had promised to abolish this measure. 
The government campaigned on a platform of abolishing free trade. 
We knew at the time that it was the fairest tax. 
That was precisely the objective.  
Tax shelters were considerably reduced. 
But what did this government do? 
The deficit was attained at the expense of the poor and of the individual taxpayer. 
Such is the policy of the present government. 
That is how it is in all fields. 
They are making drastic cuts.  
Editorial writer Alain Dubuc said ``Here is why Mr. Martin is no longer credible''. 
It turned out to be $8.9 billion''. 
That is not a small miscalculation; it is a huge one.  
This was an error of $10.1 billion. 
There are two major problems in Canada. 
In both cases, provocation is involved. 
That takes some doing. 
It did not even do that.  
Again, it is only to create a little interest among those concerned. 
Tariff barriers between the provinces cost a fortune each year. 
I will tell you a secret. 
He is not interested in that. 
All he wants is to write cheques for the millennium scholarships.  
I do not think this is the road to the future. 
I was pleased to say a few words on the budget. 
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
On February 24 we introduced our fifth budget. 
I would like to read into the record my conclusion from that meeting.  
This is certainly reflected in the 1998 budget.  
The Canada millennium scholarship program is the centre of the Canadian opportunities strategy. 
To deal with this problem, the budget proposes five things. 
More graduates will be eligible. 
This represents an important source of funds. 
The 1998 budget proposes two measures to help them. 
This will encourage our best and brightest to stay in Canada.  
I know that in my home province the premier has claimed the opposite.  
In conclusion, our budget has many stages and we go on into the future. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
The members of my constituency have seen through this budget very clearly. 
They have seen the flimflam that is involved with it.  
First, they are asking a very simple question, one of many. 
We note that the finance minister has also eliminated the deficit. 
This is part of the flimflam.  
They are also very well aware of this fact. 
That is part of its saving.  
That is over a one year period. 
The department itself will now be spending $1.1 billion on itself.  
It must drive most Canadian taxpayers wild.  
Let us look at one specific area of Canadian heritage, that of sports. 
It's very exciting. 
There's a lot of interest and emotion. 
She went on to say about the athletes: 
The games will be held Sept. 10-20 in Malaysia.  
``It will cost about $6,000 per athlete to outfit and send the team. 
This compares with the question I asked in the House on Monday. 
This comes right back to the starting point of my speech. 
Where did these extra expenditures come from? 
How did they happen?  
We are talking about 42 countries and probably 2,000 athletes. 
It is absolutely ludicrous.  
I would like to know the priority of the government. 
They are contributing money from their own pockets. 
The government has no idea where it is going. 
All it knows is that it has a blank cheque. 
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Governing is more than merely making the books balance. 
I heard that at the door. 
I heard it at three town hall forums. 
I heard it by way of correspondence and I heard it in my office. 
It is something to be celebrated.  
The debt is divided into two components: market debt and non-market debt. 
He called them the men in red suspenders. 
Some economists feel that the economy will grow us out of our debt difficulties. 
The provinces contribute to the national debt. 
Another reality is the role of provincial government national debt. 
However I cannot say that for Ontario.  
It is a charter member of the flat earth society. 
This is a terrible waste of a time of prosperity. 
In addition, it did not go to the market for any new debt. 
It is on the way to becoming a master of its own house.  
However, certain provinces have not seen the light, in particular the province of Ontario. 
The good efforts of the federal government may well be offset by those provinces. 
The men in red suspenders, I anticipate, will have a few more profitable years.  
A number of private forecasters have in fact said that will happen. 
Spending one's way to prosperity does not work. 
Tax cutting one's way is equally foolish.  
Building into the budget a contingency is prudent. 
Committing to debt reduction on a straight line basis is even more prudent. 
Diminishing the per cent of debt to GDP is more prudent again. 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased I am not wearing my red suspenders this evening. 
There have been studies done on the underground economy. 
We all know what we are talking about. 
If you do this for cash we will not pay the taxes. 
We will give you a special deal if we pay you under the table. 
We know this goes on. 
It goes on as follows: 
Tax evasion through participation in the underground economy penalizes honest taxpayers. 
The federal government has a comprehensive strategy for addressing this problem. 
This budget announces additional measures to reduce the underreporting of income.  
It came united with the private sector, with the labour movement and with academia. 
This was not something that was dreamed up in the finance department. 
I really congratulate them for their foresight.  
The budget page goes on: 
In conclusion on this page: 
We have no problem with that. 
We are not just talking about a sales tax. 
It really makes the entire process transparent. 
I think we will see over time. 
I do not think that is true. 
I do not think that is fair.  
But ask a simple question. 
What is it trying to hide? 
What is it trying to avoid? 
There really is nowhere to hide in this. 
It is transparent and it is fair.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
The first finding is that it is a standardizing budget. 
Everywhere else in the country, the proposed measures have a standardizing effect. 
We will show some innovative spirit''. 
But there are no such initiatives. 
The budget reflects a neoliberal philosophy. 
We see the result of this reliance on the market. 
The situation of some people is getting worse all the time. 
Will this fund be a good thing for Canadian regions?  
But that is not the case.  
In Quebec, however, we already have a student loans and grants program. 
The program is in place. 
It is like the Hygrade sausage complex. 
However, this is not in the budget. 
Therefore, it is a budget against regional development.  
This could have been done in another fashion. 
This type of situation was uncalled for. 
This is not doing a favour to the homeowner.  
It is the same thing here. 
This has a major negative impact in our regions. 
This further contributes to depopulate the regions. 
The market alone must not dictate what happens. 
There again, the budget is not interesting.  
This would have generated enough growth to promote job creation. 
There again, the government has failed. 
It does not get a passing grade. 
This week, we had clear evidence. 
The areas with high unemployment were particularly hard hit. 
The budget lacks those elements. 
There will be a $25 billion surplus at the beginning of the year 2000.  
I will end on that. 
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
Saddest of all, this budget ignores the poor people of our country. 
It will not take the elderly poor off the tax rolls. 
Gone are the days when the single income would support a family.  
The Liberals have created fundamental shifts in the building blocks of this Canadian society. 
It has brought only poverty, not prosperity.  
Who was cut was the poor and middle class.  
There is no balanced budget with the present government policies. 
Canadian priorities and the priorities of the NDP are being ignored by Liberals. 
Our country is wealthy and we do not have to accept poverty in our midst. 
Of this increase, 48% was due to personal income tax. 
Canadian living standards are falling. 
An ever increasing slice of the family budget is consumed by income tax. 
These figures provide a very good picture of the growing disparities in our country. 
This budget makes sure it will stay that way.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in this debate.  
This is one of the things I like about the budget. 
I am thinking for example of the restoration of funding to the Medical Research Council. 
They are going to be buying automobiles, refrigerators and new homes. 
They are going to be stimulating construction.  
It creates salaries for people who will in turn pay taxes. 
In fact I will give an offhand compliment to the Reform Party. 
Let us look ahead. 
Some of the not for profit companies are very large. 
Literally anyone can do them. 
There is a lack of transparency. 
I could go on.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Budgets are supposed to be a reflection of our values and our priorities. 
We need to deal with it more strategically.  
I am speaking on behalf of the citizens of Fundy-Royal. 
One does not have to take it as my word. 
Those are not my words but those of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.  
The government actually maintains that there is tax relief within the budget. 
We can actually put more money back into Canadians' pockets.  
We have a debt of $600 billion. 
The younger you are, the higher proportion of the debt you have to repay. 
It is fiscally immoral to pay for today's programs with tomorrow's moneys.  
That is the minimum we owe Canadians.  
The balanced budget initiative has been a result of almost 15 years. 
Canada needs a plan for growth. 
In terms of our economic spending we almost forget about our youth. 
Less debt means more jobs and more opportunity for young Canadians.  
Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
Those people have paid in ways that they felt hard. 
They are very relieved that the days of cuts are over.  
The people felt relieved.  
This week's budget was the best in a generation. 
It got priorities roughly right. 
It helped redefine the proper role of government in a modern economy. 
It balanced revenues and expenditures. 
It opted for prudent forecasts. 
It resisted the temptation to spend gobs more money in the wrong areas- 
It contained modest tax cuts. 
It was a balanced budget. 
Life-long learning is indeed the future. 
He would love all 75 of them to be able to go.  
We need principles and values. 
Then we can form a plan and only then can we cost it out. 
We are still overcoming the stumbling blocks of privacy and confidentiality. 
We have to do our homework. 
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
However, they did have some reasonable expectations this time around and they were sadly disappointed. 
It reflected their lack of competence to cut elsewhere, to stop the giveaways to favourites. 
They have too many vested interests. 
What is resonating in British Columbia is exactly this, debt reduction and tax relief. 
This goes back to the CCF and Tommy Douglas. 
We cannot ignore the debt. 
As of today, it is moving frighteningly close to $585 billion or more. 
Canada's fiscal house is not in order. 
The Liberals promised to scrap the EH-101 helicopter deal. 
They simply want promises kept. 
It is as simple as that.  
These actions will come back to haunt.  
That is Ernst & Young's analysis of the 1998 federal budget.  
That was Neville Nankivell of the Financial Post .  
Canada cannot continue down that path. 
Our fiscal house is not in order. 
The finance minister cannot claim victory. 
There is still a tremendous amount of work to do.  
This says to me that the government could have done so much more. 
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):
However, I am going to be very honest, there were some reservations.  
Why did I have these reservations in my mind? 
Fortunately with my faith I knew that we could achieve the target. 
Yes, we have all made sacrifices. 
We all know the vast majority of companies in this country have debts. 
We know the vast majority of households in this country have debts. 
We cannot have expenditures exceeding income. 
That is when the sacrifices have to be made. 
They have to curtail their spending. 
I predict that there will be many more measures in budgets in the years ahead. 
Others also complain about that very same issue. 
An interesting point emerged. 
That is quite obvious. 
Let us take a look at what is happening in the province of Ontario. 
There have been a lot of complaints about the transfer payments. 
It is absolutely essential that we be the guardians of the individuals in this country. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
I am extremely disappointed by the budget brought down by the finance minister. 
I got the list of investments. 
Since 1977, American banks have invested $356 billion in local communities?  
What did Canadian banks do? 
What has happened in Canada? 
We have four major chartered banks which have made record profits. 
The number of underprivileged people there is quite high. 
Believe it or not, no more than two are still there. 
They tell me that there are no banks in Saint-Henri any more. 
I call on the solidarity of all my colleagues. 
It requires a certain amount of political courage. 
It requires that we work together.  
Mr. Speaker, I need only your support now. 
(The House adjourned at 10.01 p.m.)
