The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I wish to welcome them to the Senate on behalf of all the senators.  
Congratulations on 130th Anniversary 
The CMA is the voice of organized medicine in Canada. 
New Brunswick Coalition on Violence Against Women 
Hon. Erminie J. Cohen :
"Making Waves" is also effective. 
Child Poverty in New Brunswick 
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson :
Money is only part of the answer. 
They grow up not just in a household but in a society. 
Forty-three thousand children life in poverty in my province. 
Too often government policy-making is done in a vacuum. 
Extension of Powers of Speaker During Question Period 
Hon. William M. Kelly :
We have other options. 
We are all equal in 
In the Interests of Brevity 
Hon. Philippe Deane Gigantes :
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I give notice that tomorrow, Friday, October 10, 1997, I will move: 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
I rise on a question of privilege.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Canadian Human Rights Act 
Bill to Amend-First Reading 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read a second time?

Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Ninety-seventh conference, Seoul, Korea-Notice of Inquiry 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Mr. Masse went on to say: 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
That is not the question. 
The apology was made reluctantly. 
The regrets were given practically in a whisper. 
It is still out there as an official document. 
However, I reiterate what I have said with respect to the presumption of innocence. 
What is being investigated?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
That is as far as I can go. 
I presume we will be provided with the necessary information as the developments proceed.  
Honourable senators, I do not know the specifics concerning that question. 
However, I will attempt to determine them.  
Honourable senators, this will be my last question today on this matter.  
We know that Ms Prost had something to do with the matter. 
The deputy minister of Justice learned about the matter. 
However, I will attempt to embellish answers to his questions a little bit further.  
Your contacts should be better than mine.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, economists are economists, and they will always have their debates. 
This government, of course, is very clear. 
Honourable senators, with respect, we do have a low inflation rate. 
Honourable senators, again, we have varying opinions on this subject. 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I have not seen, obviously, such a memo. 
Efficacy of Existing Liberal Cabinet Ministers-Government Position 
They were powerful ministers."  
Further on, the article reads: 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
That is a loaded question, and I could provide many and varied answers to it. 
Tabling of Particulars of Strategy to Counteract Parental Unemployment 
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Yes, and I thank the honourable senator for her timely intervention and her question. 
I certainly will do as much as I can to further that end. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, after the statement made by our excellent ambassador to Mexico, Mr. Perron - 
- the Prime Minister did not hesitate to speak with the President of Mexico.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, my question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
He has some sort of an agreement to that effect with provincial governments. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, it is a matter worth monitoring. 
I would like to determine the progress that is made in the other place. 
The House of Commons sits for approximately 135 days. 
Hon. Jean-Maurice Simard :
Honourable senators, my question has been asked by my colleague Senator Kinsella. 
I have listened to the response by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I will take Senator Simard's representations into consideration as well. 
Others will be coming. 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the answer is no.  
Hon. Norman K. Atkins :
Honourable senators, my question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
I want to return to the Airbus fiasco. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, yes, I will attempt to get those numbers for Honourable Senator Atkins.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Let me tell you about two items from his response received the day before yesterday: 
With regard to the Sea King replacement, the minister states: 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
May I ask the origin of the letter which the honourable senator is referencing? 
Whose signature is on the letter?  
It is signed by the Minister of National Defence, the Honourable Arthur Eggleton. 
I can forward a copy, if Senator Graham wants one.  
I would be very happy to receive that. 
I am assured by the Honourable Minister of National Defence that progress is being made. 
The government leader has lent great emphasis to this particular situation. 
It is now a full 10 years before we will have one operational.  
I will be happy to do so. 
Business of the Senate 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
I will not debate the contents of it. 
However, where the rules do not apply, custom does.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
With unanimous consent, you can withdraw the notice.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
Notice of Motion withdrawn.  
That the Committee make its final report no later than November 7, 1997; 
a ) paragraph 10 thereof and substituting the following: 
"That the Committee make its final report no later than December 31, 1997;"; and 
b ) paragraph 12 thereof and substituting the following: 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, I rise to speak in support of Senator Wood's amendment. 
What's more, they're looking to obtain privileges that others don't have. 
In 1867, Section 93 was vital to the Confederation pact. 
It is a constitutional guarantee of protection to minorities. 
Professor Peter Hogg describes its importance to Canada's Constitution. 
In his Constitutional Law of Canada, Second Edition, he wrote: 
His strong words disarmed me. 
Senator Maheu has turned out to be an outstanding member of this chamber.  
Minister Dion's public impeachment of the Senate, and the Senate's legitimacy is bewildering. 
members' votes to carry his resolution. 
I am not convinced that this motion is even in order. 
In constitutional documents every single word is important.  
This is unheard of, historically. 
The Parliament of Canada cannot be so subjugated.  
Honourable senators, the Parliament of Canada has been compromised in a very profound manner. 
The Senate should condemn and overturn this compromise. 
The Quebec legislative assembly's words about this compromiseare: 
Yes, honourable senators, you heard correctly. 
The words of the resolution are "...agreement... of the Federal Parliament...". 
Senators should not accept this.  
This contempt of Parliament is further compounded by yet another contempt in the same resolution. 
This is beyond high contempt of Parliament; it is a national disgrace.  
Yet, he will not tell us why. 
The insufficiency and paucity is obvious.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is the honourable senator requesting leave to finish her remarks?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I am sorry, leave is not granted.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Your Honour, I have but two paragraphs left.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I am honoured to support Senator Wood's amendment. 
I urge the Senate to give this matter the proper time and study it deserves. 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
I did not have an opportunity to see them in advance.  
I should like to read it. 
Later on, the motion deals with the powers of the committee. 
Honourable senators, I thank Senator Grafstein for his question. 
I spoke precisely to the issue that is on the Order Paper. 
I believe that I have answered the honourable senator's question. 
However, the resolution has not been brought before us.  
That is the only thing we are debating, as I understand it.  
I am confused, Senator Cools.  
I never said that the study was a corruption. 
I was being quite explicit about the Quebec legislative assembly's resolution.  
I would be happy to table it. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Senator Cools, I am sorry, but you cannot repeat your speech.  
I did not think I was doing that.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
You asked for the tabling of a document. 
That cannot be done without leave of the Senate.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
It is an important document. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, we have two questions before us. 
First, is leave granted for the tabling of the document?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
(For text of document, see Appendix p. 161) 
This is a very serious constitutional issue. 
We are not talking about amending a municipal by-law. 
Some people claim that Quebec recently resolved the matter by adopting a bill. 
That is not what we are dealing with here. 
We are dealing with a constitutional issue. 
This is a major issue, a very serious issue.  
First we have to hear what the people have to say. 
We are not going to take away a constitutional right that is 125 years old. 
If there is none or hardly any, we will see. 
We must start by listening to what the people have to say. 
Otherwise, we would not need a Constitution. 
Nothing would differentiate our country from totalitarian states if we did not have constitutional law.  
This is what Canada's political system is all about. 
We will listen to the people. 
The Senate has a fundamental duty to do so. 
We will gain public respect if we do so. 
In this respect, I am deeply convinced that this is the way to go. 
I therefore support the motion put forward by Senator Wood.  
Hon. Therese Lavoie-Roux :
Honourable senators, I also want to speak in support of Senator Wood's proposal. 
I was not here when she made her presentation. 
I read her speech this afternoon. 
She raises very important points. 
This is a complex issue.  
One person only, and it was me.  
It is therefore not true that everyone agrees. 
However, mentalities have changed. 
We must hear all those who wish to be heard. 
I support Senator Wood's proposal. 
I only have a short question. 
Did you select December 31? 
Hon. Jean B. Forest :
I am very concerned about the time-frame. 
I would prefer that it be longer. 
She went part way in an understanding and acceptance of Senator Lynch-Staunton's position.  
I think that was an extremely important point.  
I was very interested to hear Senator Forest speak a few minutes ago. 
So, too, have the people in the Catholic school system in Ontario.  
I am not clear precisely what the concern is. 
One understands the feeling of insecurity, if you like, of minorities at all times. 
They believe they could be affected by this amendment. 
It is very important that the joint committee hear from them. 
If the joint committee does not, certainly a Senate committee should.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Would the Honourable Senator Murray entertain a question?  
I have it in front of me at the moment.  
Is that your understanding as well?  
I have spoken to the main motion. 
I would like to speak to the amendment only.  
So, if we are going to be logical, we must really hold hearings.  
I therefore support the motion of Senator Wood. 
I think the amendment has merit.  
It is a legal matter, among other things, and there are other issues. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I rise to speak on the amendment proposed by Senator Wood. 
Nothing could be more serious. 
In the city of Rome there are many inscriptions. 
I certainly intend to support it. 
Mr. Dion was somewhat less categorical. 
Let us remember what happened in the case of Newfoundland. 
The Government of Canada and the Government of Newfoundland refused these agreements. 
What was the result? 
Finally, we are not just speaking of linguistic rights. 
However, linguistic boards are proposed to be created at the expense of religious minority rights. 
The question which must be asked of them is:
Can anyone explain why one has to be put up against the other? 
It can be done. 
It has been done elsewhere. 
It has been done in Ontario. 
These are serious questions. 
The Constitution is an overly complicated document. 
We must respect it as a basic law of the land. 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Those who will make representations will know what they wish to say. 
There is some urgency. 
That will, in all likelihood, mean two weeks of no activity.  
The debate would not then take place until some time in February when we reconvene.  
I think that the urgency of the Government of Quebec is reasonable. 
That, honourable senators, is what I see as the urgency here. 
May I ask a question of the Deputy Leader of the Government? 
It is not iron clad, obviously. 
It is an agreement between two governments. 
We will have opinions only. 
Honourable senators, I do not think I admitted to there being confusion. 
I did admit to there being different points of view. 
I would urge this committee to do exactly the same thing. 
We got different opinions, as is normal. 
That is the nature of the constitutional beast.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Do you have a question, Senator Kinsella?  
There is provision for questions and comments within the 15 minutes.  
There is nothing in the rules which relates to that.  
Hon. Therese Lavoie-Roux :
The members of their party were all in favour of a unified school system. 
They simply forgot about the issue for more than nine years.  
Why is there such a rush to produce something in 24 days? 
I think that we should do our best. 
I may speak a bit slower than usual, and I apologize for that.  
This is a fundamental debate. 
The contribution each can make to his country, we see that here. 
That is what the Senate is all about. 
I was an MP for 30 years. 
He became famous in Quebec. 
In this way, I am getting closer and closer to Senator Bolduc.  
Yes, I am a traditionalist, but I also have a good memory. 
I like to be consistent. 
That was just a few days before the official opposition took over. 
There should be no pressure exerted by the House of Commons. 
We have a constitutional duty to accomplish. 
We should accomplish that duty.  
It says in this document that: 
This is a bit like the referendum. 
It is my wish that we fill the Senate by the year 2000. 
Eighteen senators must be named between now and the year 2000.  
What does this have to do with Quebec education?  
I am not out of order. 
I know you are all becoming impatient. 
When you are one of the last to speak, it is dangerous. 
I will not abuse the time. 
I want to make a further amendment to the proposal that is before us. 
First, I will explain why I do so. 
I agree with Senators Wood and Carstairs. 
You must set a date, and then you can change it. 
However, November 7 is too soon for me. 
The fact is that we must have consistency. 
We should not treat Quebec differently.  
We could talk about this for a long time. 
I want to keep us united. 
You know that I am a Canadien francais du Quebec. 
I am suspicious when I see this glorious entente with Mr. Dion. 
My friend Senator Simard agrees with me on that. 
That is how they survived in New Brunswick, by being suspicious and stubborn.  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
a ) adding the following after paragraph 9; and 
"That the Committee be authorized to hold hearings in the province of Quebec;" and 
b ) replacing the twelfth paragraph with the following: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
a ) adding the following after paragraph 9; and 
"That the Committee be authorized to hold hearings in the province of Quebec;" and 
b ) replacing the twelfth paragraph with the following: 
Hon. Celine Hervieux-Payette :
They are not specialists. 
I think that Senator Hervieux-Payette is quite right. 
It is very intimidating to appear before a parliamentary committee in Ottawa. 
In any event, what will they say. 
They will be tongue-tied, they will feel rushed, even if they are treated well.  
They can bring as much intelligence to the discussions as any constitutionalist. 
In my opinion, coming to Ottawa is more constraining, more intimidating.  
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
We can have very little effect on that committee. 
The aim of this committee is a good, solid aim. 
We can make good appointments to that committee. 
Some of the names I have heard mentioned are those of outstanding senators. 
I hope some of them will be on that committee. 
I was the first one to speak against it. 
I also have very grave doubts about what is going on in Quebec. 
However, we are not accomplishing a darn thing about arguing over this deadline. 
Let us get on with it. 
That is a fundamental question. 
I regret that you used that word in your speech. 
We are a totally different house. 
During that time, people will begin to pay attention. 
They will ask why we had no hearings. 
I want to be heard. 
First, I hope the word "tricks" will never be heard again. 
Let them agonize over our decision. 
Thank you for stopping because I was in danger of forgetting what your question was.  
Don't be smart! 
I will outsmart you any time.  
We will have that right. 
This bill will come back to us. 
We are talking about referring it to a committee. 
It will return here and we will debate it. 
I am just talking about the technical part of discussing the deadline. 
I do not see that it gains us anything.  
Hon Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Honourable Senator Taylor. 
We should not be telling the joint committee when to report?  
We should watch for results. 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, I am not sure I am hearing Senator Taylor as he intends. 
That is what I heard.  
Honourable senators, I am sorry if I created that impression. 
I do not know how the committee will react. 
Perhaps we do want to keep this issue going in the house here. 
Let us get the issue into the committee. 
Nothing will be accomplished by waiting.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
It is the motion in amendment by Senator Prud'homme. 
Honourable senators, I move the debate be adjourned.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
In my opinion, the "nays" have it.  
And two honourable senators having risen.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The whips have agreed to a 20-minute bell. 
Motion of Senator Simard to adjourn the debate negatived on the following division: 
Hon. Jean-Maurice Simard :
Naturally, I support travelling. 
I supported my colleague Senator Prud'homme's amendment. 
I supported Senator Prud'homme's motion.  
If we must take 180 days to study this resolution, we will do so. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
a ) adding the following after paragraph 9; and 
"That the Committee be authorized to hold hearings in the province of Quebec;" and 
b ) replacing the twelfth paragraph with the following: 
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion in amendment?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
We are voting on the sub-amendment by the Honourable Senator Prud'homme.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those opposed please say "nay".  
The Hon. the Speaker :
In my opinion the "nays" have it.  
And two honourable senators having risen: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Could we have an agreement on the length of the bells?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
He is acting whip.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
He is acting whip?  
He is acting deputy leader.  
He was appointed just a moment ago.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Rule 67(2) provides: 
That is the requested order.  
Honourable senators, I have a question. 
Honourable senators, rule 67(3) reads: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Your troops are so numerous. 
Why not have the vote now? 
Because we were not expecting a vote today.  
This was not communicated to us.  
Honourable senators, could we not sit tomorrow at nine o'clock?  
No. You have not given notice.  
Child Custody and Access Reform 
Motion to Establish Special Joint Committee-Debate Adjourned 
That the Committee make its final report no later than November 30, 1998; and 
There is a clinical need to improve the situation for children. 
That is why a joint committee can be very useful.  
I think this is very important. 
Honourable senators, I urge you to support this motion.  
On motion of Senator Cools, debate adjourned.  
The Estimates, 1997-98 
National Finance Committee Authorized to Study Main Estimates 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. Noel Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, we on this side are supportive of this motion. 
It is the standard practice that the National Finance Committee receive such authority.  
I assume that it is Privy Council responsibilities which are excluded from this.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is it your pleasure to adopt the motion?  
Vote 25 Referred to the Standing Joint Committee on Official Languages 
That a Message be sent to the House of Commons to acquaint that House accordingly.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Vote 10 Referred to the Standing Joint Committee on the Library of Parliament 
That a Message be sent to the House of Commons to acquaint that House accordingly.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?

Business of the Senate 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Have all honourable senators understood the proposal? 
The sitting of the Senate was suspended.  
The sitting was resumed.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, we have had some very serious discussions with the leadership opposite. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
We still feel that it is highly unrealistic. 
I respect them for maintaining their position, though I deplore it. 
In any event, we have set out our major arguments. 
Their backgrounds certainly qualify them to engage in this sort of study. 
I would hope that the seven can all work together. 
They must go there as senators who are above partisanship.  
I hope that does not happen.  
We will support the motion and the amendments. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, this sudden and happy agreement between the leaders surprises me. 
First of all, I have not been invited. 
However, I understand I do not represent the independents. 
I thought I was involved in a great debate on fundamental ideas. 
Anyhow, I cannot speak for Senator Bolduc or his party. 
I wonder how this Quebec phrase will be translated.  
I must tell you that I am very surprised about this amicable agreement. 
I see Senator Carstairs giving some good directives.  
That was the objective of Senator Wood's amendment.  
I do not know what the Right Honourable Prime Minister's reaction will be. 
I am polite, he is my friend, I say it publicly. 
I want this to be on the record.  
Mr. Dion, my minister, does not want to hear about that. 
He has confidence in his ministers. 
He delegates his authority and I like him a lot for that.  
I think that we should talk to Minister Dion instead. 
We do not have many allies left in the House of Commons. 
There will be a few representatives of the Senate courageously trying to defend us. 
Senator Wood's role will be no easier.  
What Senator Wood has done is not easy. 
She sits with the government. 
It is not easy to do what Senator Cools has done. 
She gave a remarkable speech this afternoon. 
Senator Carstairs has immense responsibility. 
I wish to draw your attention to something which may have escaped your attention. 
He delivered a very strong message 
Do not push him. 
He knows how Quebec works. 
He knows Quebec profoundly. 
His remarks must be taken seriously by us.  
I regret to say that. 
He is the minister ultimately responsible for this bill. 
I want a deal with Canadians, between Canadians and among Canadians.  
Some of us believe strongly that this situation is not good. 
I regret that there will not be a standing vote. 
There will probably be a third step. 
I know that some people want to get rid of religion in schools in Ontario. 
There is an immense program of what I call the de-christianisation of the institution.  
It is an amendment that any Liberal could have introduced. 
I know of seven Liberals who would have liked to have introduced my amendment. 
I can name them if challenged right now. 
They could have introduced the amendment, but I did it.  
We call them "terriens", because they are attached to their traditions. 
That is touching the debate of the school system.  
I baptized my 13-year-old nephew last week, at his request. 
That is very strange in French-Canadian society. 
It is because he learned that at school. 
We are dealing with something very profound.  
It would be easier for us to try to convince people elsewhere.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, what is the agreement?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is that the agreement?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
a ) adding the following after paragraph 9: 
That the Committee be authorized to hold hearings in the province of Quebec; and 
b ) replacing paragraph 12 with the following: 
That, then, is the amendment on which we vote first.  
Will those in favour of the amendment please say "yea."  
The Hon. the Speaker :
All those opposed to the amendment please say "nay".  
The Hon. the Speaker :
In my opinion, the "nays" have it.  
Motion in amendment of Senator Prud'homme negatived, on division.

Motion to Appoint Members to Special Joint Committee Adopted 
Leave having been given to revert to Government Notices of Motions.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
That a message be sent to the House of Commons to inform that House accordingly.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
That would not be worthy of a senator.  
Yes, I did express myself strongly earlier. 
One discusses vigorously and then abides by the majority. 
I will give my consent, and I will not even say reluctantly.
