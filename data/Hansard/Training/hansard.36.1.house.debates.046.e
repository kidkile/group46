EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 46 
Monday, December 8, 1997 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
We must be open and responsive to the evidence of objective assessment. 
Our society exists and sustains itself because of family. 
Child poverty is an example. 
For example, a poor family can have a healthy, well adjusted child. 
This strategy is particularly relevant in family issues.  
Let's consider some of the problems facing the Canadian family. 
Child poverty continues to be a major challenge which is certainly complex. 
The majority of such abuse occurs in dysfunctional or broken families.  
Seventy-five percent of teens who commit suicide come from broken homes. 
When the relationship breaks down, it is not over. 
The fighting often continues for years. 
Needless to say, when the family breaks down, bad things can and do happen. 
They are the ones that are hurt.  
Divorce may be common but the consequences thereof are not. 
The findings of recent studies are very disturbing. 
One in four children do not live at home with their biological parents. 
However, consider the issue of sexual orientation. 
The state respects the rights of individuals to make choices. 
Undeniably these problems are rooted in the bedrooms of the nation. 
Who in this place would deny that the government is intervening. 
Who would deny that it is the right thing to do.  
Based on the foregoing the criteria for action by government should be two reasons. 
The purpose of Bill C-218 is not to promote reconciliation. 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House to move the motion?  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
I have looked at the bill and am wondering about its constitutionality and its cost. 
In looking at how we can strengthen the family let us begin there first.  
What can we do in that regard? 
We have a disaster in this country in this particular area. 
Yet all of these children are living in poverty. 
It is families and communities that are living in poverty. 
We must address that and look at the causes of it.  
This is what causes the stress.  
Three of my eight brothers were also born under those conditions. 
We did not have central heating.  
She thought for a moment and said central heating. 
How we survived I really do not know. 
Do you want to talk about poverty? 
We were looked after. 
They made great sacrifices and we knew they cared for us.  
We had a justice system hanging on the wall. 
He did not want us playing with matches. 
We knew that and that was an inherent feeling.  
It kept us going. 
Let us look at the cause of marital breakdown. 
That is what weakens the economic stability of the family. 
Because they went two weeks without a paycheque. 
I commend the hon. member for bringing this issue forward. 
The area of counselling, who will pay for that? 
Will the family have to pay for that? 
It will be another drain on the economic resources of the family.  
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
Let us start with a historical overview of the Divorce Act. 
The act still had its shortcomings, however. 
Nevertheless, a divorce is never an easy thing on the human level. 
So, legal proceedings must be as effective as possible.  
This is reassuring nevertheless.  
According to Statistics Canada, one marriage in 100 ended in 1995. 
Family law is a jurisdiction that is shared between the provinces and the federal government. 
In fact, Quebec is already prepared to take on this responsibility. 
If Canada wants to rely on our expertise, fine. 
I will examine more closely the intent and effect of this proposed bill. 
Some very basic questions must be asked about this bill. 
There are some implications associated with mandatory legal requirements. 
Reconciliation counselling is to be a requirement imposed on everyone. 
I am sure that many people agree marriage counselling can be a good thing. 
It enables couples to work together to understand and preserve their relationship. 
For some couples marriage counselling may be useful.  
To be successful both parties have to enter the counselling in good faith. 
It is also not the only approach available. 
I understand that there are many parenting educational programs already available. 
The reports are that they appear to be very successful. 
Participants consistently give the programs high ratings on evaluation. 
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
Bill C-218 is not the way to go about saving a marriage. 
Also, in remote areas counselling is not available. 
It is certainly not available in Old Crow. 
The other aspect is that nobody takes divorce lightly. 
They do not approach it on a whim. 
Many couples separate and never go through a formal divorce process.  
There are many causes behind marriage breakdown. 
The economic and social policies of governments are major factors. 
We need a multifaceted approach if we want to protect our children. 
It was very stressful to do on my own. 
Full time parents need breaks. 
We need to recognize that and address it in policies dealing with families.  
That is not the market's concern. 
It is the concern of governments and of cultures. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Bill C-218 has nothing to do with reconciling marriages, absolutely nothing. 
It is clearly not the reason for counselling.  
The bill has two purposes. 
He suggested that there might be a constitutional issue here. 
This program has been ongoing for two years. 
Divorce is really a form of child abuse. 
However that is our process. 
I do not suggest in any way that the Quebec model should somehow be followed.  
I conclude my comments by thanking hon. members for putting their views on the floor. 
It is very important to hear a broad range of interventions. 
I thank all hon. members for their thoughtful comments.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member for Simcoe North on a point of order.  
Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Does the hon. member have the consent of the House?  
(The sitting of the House was suspended at 11.52 a.m.) 
The House resumed sitting at 12 a.m. 
AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF CANADA (NEWFOUNDLAND) 
AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF CANADA 
Any amendment to our Constitution is an important issue.  
We should all be proud of that.  
In this respect, the government's initial point of view was confirmed.  
A few words on the background. 
The 1949 Terms of Union enshrined a school system that is exclusively denominational. 
That commission recommended in its final report a fully integrated school system. 
This is why we created the special joint committee to study the proposed amendment. 
Second, if enacted, term 17 will become part of the Constitution of Canada. 
On that occasion the supreme court explicitly stated: 
With respect to section 93 the court stated: 
This argument is not supported by the plain language of the constitution.  
Therefore I conclude and maintain that the term is in compliance with the covenant.  
As such, any amendment of the Constitution should be undertaken with great care. 
Changes affecting a minority deserve even greater prudence.  
We are setting no such precedent. 
A distinction already exists both in law and in practice.  
There are many different rights and freedoms. 
This is by no means true. 
The federal Parliament must take into account the specific context of each case before it. 
The situation in Newfoundland is not the same as that in other provinces. 
However, this is not a case of fundamental rights. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
It is maintained by many that denominational or confessional rights are not a fundamental right. 
Therefore they are in some way fundamental.  
That original term 17 read as follows: 
It was a compromise solution.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Does the hon. member have the consent of the House?  
That amendment, of course, reads: 
That committee has prepared its report recommending support of the resolution.  
We should strive in our application of these three tests to be consistent. 
First, the test of democratic consent. 
These are legitimate questions. 
In fact it has already been amended twice under that formula.  
That brings us then to the test of the Canadian national interest. 
Majorities have an interest in minority rights. 
We may be part of an ethnic majority but part of a religious minority. 
It is in fact in this area that our caucus has had its greatest concerns. 
The minister assures us that parental rights are strengthened by this amendment. 
I believe he repeated that again today. 
Alas, in the end that servant ended up losing even that which he had.  
I appreciate the applause. 
That is in the realm of provincial jurisdiction. 
I look forward to the representations of other members on this important issue.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
I am going to place this constitutional amendment in its context. 
In such cases, there is little debate. 
How did the people challenge this system? 
They used different means. 
That referendum was approved by 54% of the population. 
Later, there were court challenges and an injunction was requested. 
What was the question asked at that referendum? 
I will read it to you. 
I will come back to this later.  
Now, I move to the Bloc's support. 
We thought it was quite obvious. 
As it turns out, we did not hear much that we had not heard before. 
It too went through the democratic process. 
Another one is the possibility of legal challenges. 
People can do it regarding all sorts of issues. 
Similarly, the charter will not contradict what is in the Constitution.  
There are a number of denominational groups involved. 
There are two things about this that are subjective. 
The two do not share the same view of what constitutes a fundamental right. 
But there is a difference of opinion. 
And there may be many.  
This does not strike me as a very desirable or good approach. 
I think this is where the greater logic lies. 
Here again, prudence is advisable. 
And it gets more complicated.  
I will refresh your memory. 
So the federal government is faced with a problem of logic. 
A good thing the second one passed in 1973. 
It seems to me that I have heard that somewhere else before. 
The people in Newfoundland reacted in very much the same way.  
I would like to comment on what the hon. member said on three points. 
So these are the things that should be balanced.  
Second, I have invented nothing as Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
The issue of minorities has always been on the table. 
Members and senators voted against the first amendment. 
This is an issue that is unavoidable. 
So this issue is before us. 
Does he believe that democracy is tyranny by the majority?  
I would like to go further with this. 
So there is another kind of problem, one of tolerance, which involves significant problems. 
I repeat what I said. 
It is a question of minority rights. 
He is adding another right, it is not the same.  
I am sure it is the same thing in the New Brunswick. 
This an academic debate.  
Yes, it is a very academic debate. 
But let us come back to the case of Newfoundland. 
But where can all this lead us?  
He never started with 32, 38, 27, with assumptions and everything else. 
Mr. Speaker, that is the argument that the minister wants to bring into this debate. 
We have never thought along these lines. 
I invite him to have good discussions with him.  
According to me, that is not the issue. 
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or, NDP):
Publicly funded schools were operated by several denominations. 
This was done in 1996. 
A conflict arose, however. 
It is our responsibility as parliamentarians to answer these questions well. 
The people of Newfoundland are entering the 21st century feeling uncertainty and hope. 
Legitimate questions have been raised about the validity of that referendum. 
This includes districts where the majority of the voters were Roman Catholic. 
It remains the best method of consultation we have.  
On the other hand, proponents disagreed on these matters. 
Religious observances shall be permitted in a school where requested by parents.  
The proposed amendment is consistent with these values.  
However, we recognize that this issue creates strong feelings and passion. 
Questions surrounding religion and rights often do. 
However, all members have in their hearts the aspirations of the people of Newfoundland.  
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to the hon. member' speech. 
We can set them aside. 
I thank the member for her intervention.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague. 
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
The magnitude of this natural disaster is almost unimaginable. 
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral:
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
The work of the Mississauga branch of the order of St. John- 
The hon. member for Lambton-Kent-Middlesex.  
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Now railways are pulling up stake and leaving town. 
Rail line abandonment is a real threat on the prairies. 
With that gone, there is no viable route for grain. 
Our roads are in shambles and our elevators are closing.  
Mr. John Maloney (Erie-Lincoln, Lib.):
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
The government has worked hard to try to protect women from violence. 
I call on all Canadians to- 
The hon. member for Longueuil.  
LEADER OF THE BLOC QUEBECOIS 
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
We want the Canadian people to understand where we are coming from.  
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Indeed some would say it is democracy itself.  
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
The federal transfer cuts to the provinces have been devastating. 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, bye bye Imperial Tobacco. 
I also congratulate our Prime Minister, who said: ``For us, the health question is fundamental. 
The hon. member for Tobique-Mactaquac.  
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
This is exactly what we are doing and what we will continue to do.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, but partnership used to mean 50:50. 
Is this really the way to improve federal-provincial relations?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The hon. member for Edmonton North.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, talk about balance. 
If so, where is it?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
There is a serious problem here. 
The provinces have done some economic impact studies on what this Kyoto deal will cost. 
I want to ask the finance minister this question, not the man for all seasons. 
The hon. Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr Speaker, the Reform Party has so far failed to put forward its position. 
Has the Reform Party calculated the cost of global warming? 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, it is not much of an answer.  
The government must recognize that sovereignty is a possibility.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
We want to strengthen our medical and health care systems. 
We want to strengthen our social programs. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
The question remains unanswered. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We have a plan. 
This is the party that introduced medicare. 
We have no lessons to learn from the New Democratic Party. 
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this government is a wolf in sheep's clothing. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
They would cut it by $3.5 billion to pay for their tax cuts. 
They would gut old age pensions.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
There are absolutely no conditions related to the Canadian child benefit. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
They want those cultural groups to do their dirty work for them.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is precisely what we are doing. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
The Minister of Health has a choice. 
Let the adults have their advertising, if they will. 
Which will it be?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is a little behind the times. 
We are miles ahead of other countries. 
We have done things which the Europeans are planning to do in several years.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Now, the proportion has dropped to 41%.  
Questions must always be directed to the Chair. 
The Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Such were the orthodox and dogmatic ideologies of those people.  
I looked at the employment insurance figures.  
This is how we measure the system's efficiency.  
We will talk again about all this in January.  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
We have agreed in principle that conditional sentencing is working well. 
However, we have decided to monitor the use of conditional sentences very closely. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I am astounded that this question comes to me from a female MP. 
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
This is referred to as non-returnable warrants.  
My question is for the solicitor general. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Under the Criminal Code- 
I would ask that you please keep it down.  
I am returning to the solicitor general.  
The final decision is left to the provinces. 
That is the reason why the federal government and the provinces have to work together.  
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
The solicitor general has had three months. 
Where is the report and why did the parole system fail?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.  
The report is imminent.  
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
It failed when there was a restraining order against Kevin Machell. 
The minister's parole system favours the criminal. 
Canadians want a system that favours victims and law abiding citizens. 
When is this minister going to dump the current system?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is confused about the situation.  
We are now studying how to continue to assist those people. 
To suggest that a particular individual program will continue, as he has, is simply wrong.  
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Today Treasury Board says it will no longer negotiate with PSAC. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the minister of defence.  
The aging Sea Kings were grounded last week for repairs. 
They are supposed to be fixed up for the next four or five years.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, crashes of any aircraft are most unfortunate. 
We checked them out and they are now back in the air.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
These are the same helicopters that were grounded this past weekend.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
It will meet our operational requirements. 
Ms. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
I also want to assure the member that at Revenue Canada we have forensic specialists. 
We will continue the good work that we have been doing right across Canada.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
It is a matter for the internal management of the Senate.  
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
Is she finally going to make it into a pro-unity tool?  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
In many cases, these families are not eligible for welfare. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We are monitoring our reform very closely. 
This assessment will take place in January, after I have received the report.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
That was 79 days ago. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
How does he intend to address their concerns on this very important issue?  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
We have leaked documents that show the minister knew there were problems with distribution. 
Canadians want to be sure the food goes only to the starving civilians. 
Mr. Speaker, the $10 million does not go to North Korea. 
Second, North Koreans have kept very good records. 
REPORT OF PARLIAMENTARY LIBRARIAN 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I ask that an order of the day be designated for consideration of the motion.  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
I seek the support of all parties in this House.  
This creates two categories of unemployed.  
This is why we must support this bill.  
I think that is what sets us apart from the members opposite.  
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
On October 2, 1997, I placed Question No. 21 on the Notice Paper. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the question. 
I will certainly look into it.  
Is it agreed that all questions stand?  
AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF CANADA (NEWFOUNDLAND) 
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Such a case is currently before the courts.  
Yet we are plunging ahead today anyway.  
The MP for Burin-St. 
I was around for about 15 or 20 presentations. 
I want to elaborate a bit on that.  
I am repeating what I heard from these gentlemen. 
Again, I do not have any legal background. 
I am simply repeating what I have heard these very learned and distinguished gentlemen say.  
He was back to defend their position. 
However, that was not the case. 
I will not take any great satisfaction from that at all.  
I regret to interrupt the hon. member, but his time has expired.  
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the intervention of the hon. member for St. John's East. 
I would like the member to comment please.  
The Pentecostal Assemblies he makes reference to were given constitutional protection back in 1987. 
Once this amendment goes ahead, they certainly will not protected. 
I do not have any great legal background. 
They made it perfectly clear that it will be subject to the charter.  
Mr. Speaker, like my hon. friend from Newfoundland, I am also opposed to term 17.  
We are not supposed to show them any moral values. 
We are not supposed to talk about religion any more.  
But when we went to school it was there and it was good for us. 
It was very good for us. 
We did not have a Morgentaler looking over the House of Parliament. 
We did not have abortions taking place. 
We did not have any of these things. 
It is time for us to turn it around.  
That came from Justice Leo Barry whom many of us respect.  
Try that one in the next federal election and see what happens.  
And they are going to lower that standard as well. 
So tell us why.  
Its power to do this is unquestionable. 
I sat on the Citizens' Forum on Canada's Future. 
I travelled this country from coast to coast. 
I was in Newfoundland. 
I was only supposed to be there for four hours. 
They asked me to stay overnight so I could talk to them. 
They said they wanted to talk about their country. 
They were very special.  
We are going to let the Supreme Court of Canada make all the decisions.  
It should be in every school. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
He will be treated well by history.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Saint John.  
No, I do not believe that. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
I will be taking the same position that she will on this amendment.  
Mr. Speaker, yes, I certainly do. 
There is no question about that. 
However, I have to say that the way in which it was handled was unbelievable.  
Never have I seen anything like that.  
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Humber-St. 
I would not lay too much on that one.  
I have to say this. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Laval West.  
It is my pleasure to join the debate on this very important issue today. 
I believe that this coincidence marks a first for successive constitutional amendments. 
There were members of the legislature who campaigned against the resolution in the preceding referendum. 
Those MLAs and their constituents have voted in favour of this amendment.  
I would argue rather that as federal politicians we need to consider the following issues. 
First, have the the people of Newfoundland and Labrador been consulted on this issue? 
Second, have the communities directly affected by this change and challenge been consulted? 
Third, have these communities consented to this change? 
Who does not have these minority rights? 
These people are the true minorities of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
The Jewish community does not have denominational schools at this time. 
That brings me to my last point. 
Mr. Wells made the following points:
What is the logical solution to this situation?  
I submit to this House that the logical solution is the present resolution. 
For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this very important resolution.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a comment and a question.  
My question follows from that. 
Mr. Speaker, I certainly thank the hon. member opposite for the question. 
I am quite cognizant of what needs to take place.  
I think it is very important to listen to what they had to say. 
In the interests of fairness and equity, this resolution now should proceed accordingly.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
It does not belong to just one province. 
Clearly, this is a very important debate. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. member to please answer the question.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the question. 
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
This is not the first time that this matter is brought to our attention. 
We know what happened next. 
The debate on the Newfoundland school issue is not a new one. 
And its officials have a duty to do so. 
That is what subsection 17.3 proposes.  
We do not negate, quite the contrary, that children already receive a good education. 
However we have been told that the books in the schools date back to 1975. 
Obviously a great deal of reform needs to be done to that system.  
Young Newfoundlanders will be the first to benefit.  
The bilateral amendment process will make it possible for Newfoundland to reform its education system. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
There is no particular shared position.  
Mr. Speaker, the question my hon. colleague has asked is a fundamental one. 
She is perhaps in error and should reread that provision in the amendment.  
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Dauphin-Swan River.  
Today we again speak of Canada's constitutional change. 
I am so very honoured to represent Edmonton East in this debate. 
Constitutional amendments affect us all. 
Our Constitution has a permanency of time. 
Our Constitution is the will of our nation's constructors. 
Our Constitution forms a framework supporting our national fabric. 
Our Constitution has the respect of our judiciary and our courts. 
Our Constitution supports provincial aspirations.  
The answer to this question is a resounding yes. 
Democracy and Canada are synonymous.  
The key to my previous question was the term ``for all''. 
I have great concern at this moment that what is before us is wrong. 
I urge all members to please vote with their conscience. 
I am not persuaded that this change should be made now. 
It has not passed the litmus test of satisfying all of three questions:
Does this constitutional amendment have the democratic agreement of the people? 
Does this constitutional amendment conform to the rule of law? 
Are the rights of minorities protected? 
The question of minority rights strikes at the fabric and soul of Canadians. 
We have not been as vigilant in our protection of religious minority rights.  
In my view this remarkable expression of minority collective will should not be ignored.  
Let us not fail in this purpose.  
Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
To my mind there are more than seven religions currently in Canada. 
I put that question very respectfully to the member opposite. 
Mr. Speaker, that is an important question. 
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
The hon. member opposite suggested that the question was unclear. 
Mr. Regular said that ``the clarity of the question makes our task easier''.  
At a 73% referenda, would the hon. member like to comment?  
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
I support the motion to amend term 17. 
Does the amendment put the future of the students first and foremost?  
It is difficult to step into the shoes of a Newfoundlander.  
Some of them receive about one-third funding.  
In Manitoba there is no compulsory religious education. 
As well there is no religious observance practised in schools. 
As I indicated earlier, who knows? 
Most students are attending interdenominational protestant schools in Newfoundland. 
No one will be treated as a minority.  
In other words, the whole issue of equality will be exercised to a greater extent. 
Academic educational opportunities of Newfoundland students will improve. 
As well an efficient and cost effective system will be created. 
A constitution tends to be regarded as a badge of nationhood. 
Not all countries have the same type of constitution. 
Canada's constitution is flexible and not rigid. 
Funding will not be guaranteed under the amendment as proposed. 
Religion is deeply entrenched in the educational system of Newfoundland. 
No doubt many minorities see the amendment as a threat to their constitutional right. 
Change is never easy. 
Through referendum the people of Newfoundland have spoken loud and clear. 
There is no doubt they want change.  
This amendment will set the stage for future educational opportunities in Newfoundland. 
The children of Newfoundland deserve the best education the province can afford to provide. 
I support the amendment to term 17.  
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
It is a privilege to speak to this very important subject. 
It is more in sadness than enthusiasm that I rise to speak to it. 
To me it represents the death knell of faith based education.  
In reality, we are now replacing faith based education with the religion of secularism. 
It has its set of priests, an orthodoxy which is political correctness, and its rituals.  
It is an illusion. 
Points one and two are really one point. 
There was a unanimous resolution in the house of assembly. 
There were two referendums. 
This assertion misses the point and is specious. 
Religion, properly understood, is not a tag on at the end of a school day. 
Those parents will be in some manner doubly taxed. 
This is a dubious argument. 
We do not have seat of your pants federalism is this country. 
It is fundamental English common law that law is created by precedent.  
It also lends meaning to what constitutes consensus.  
Notwithstanding my reservations I will support the amendment. 
The people of Newfoundland and Labrador have spoken. 
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
The proposed amendment reads: 
Their testimonies did not make the task of the committee an easy one.  
The government conducted a referendum on the issue on September 2, 1997. 
Let me quote from the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs: 
If enacted, term 17 will become part of the Constitution of Canada. 
It sends the message that our democracy is vibrant. 
AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF CANADA (NEWFOUNDLAND) 
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
Some actually suggested it was beyond their comprehension. 
I categorically reject that proposal. 
The people of Newfoundland and Labrador understood this question. 
That is very important to acknowledge in this particular House.  
Your humble and obedient servant, 
AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF CANADA (QUEBEC) 
The House resumed consideration of motion.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, it is the second time I rise to discuss this amendment. 
In September 1995, a referendum was held in Newfoundland. 
As you also know, a provincial election was held during that period. 
There were, however, some challenges in Newfoundland. 
This referendum was held on June 2, 1997. 
We in Quebec have been hearing similar arguments for some time. 
I read the question only once and understood it immediately. 
The answer to this very clear question was also clear. 
I wonder how this government would react. 
We had to give this power, this area of jurisdiction, to the people of Newfoundland.  
Other criticisms we heard related to financing. 
The election act was amended for this process but, again, this drew rather strong criticism. 
Again, the federalists opposite do not challenge any of this and they accept these rules. 
Religious instruction will continue to exist where numbers warrant. 
Newfoundland's case is no exception. 
We have virtually no say in the matter. 
Newfoundlanders are really the ones who must have full jurisdiction over this.  
Our position was along those lines- 
A message was delivered by the Usher of the Black Rod as follows: 
Accordingly the Speaker with the House went up to the Senate chamber.  
Resuming debate, the hon. member for Berthier-Montcalm.  
AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF CANADA (NEWFOUNDLAND) 
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I will conclude. 
The second is that education is a provincial matter.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
I do not agree with that parallel.  
You will be masters of your own destiny, as we will be of ours. 
I think you have not understood that yet. 
English Canada is increasingly taking this in. 
In the case of Newfoundland, it decided on its future with respect to education. 
I think it is extremely important and they accomplished it through a referendum. 
It will be the same thing in Quebec. 
Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I listened to the hon. member's speech. 
Madam Speaker, the answer is very simple: no, I do not have any concerns.  
No, I do not have any concerns.  
Again, I do not have any concerns. 
If a debate must take place, it will be among Newfoundlanders. 
Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
The next five years were marked by endless bitter debates. 
The text of the amendment submitted to Newfoundlanders for their approval was very clear. 
It read as follows: 
Again I say the answer can only be yes. 
Four of the government members, including two cabinet ministers, are of the Pentecostal faith. 
This reform will strike a fair and functional balance.  
I know that there are those who fear change. 
In my view, this debate we are having is meaningful in another way. 
We have chosen to go step by step. 
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to comment on what I believe is an inaccuracy. 
Perhaps the member opposite could explain it further.  
The member commented on a difficulty in estimating the Pentecostal vote in the referendum. 
The figures that were quoted in the brief were generally accepted. 
They were even accepted in the report of the intergovernmental affairs minister.  
There were some estimates as to what the votes were. 
These figures show very specifically that the Pentecostals did not support the referendum. 
I wonder if the hon. member opposite could explain.  
There were witnesses who addressed this issue at the joint committee. 
He will find the answers in it.  
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, yes, the Reform Party- 
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Humber-St. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I might be wrong, Mr. Speaker. 
I seek your direction. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Generally speaking, but we also try to have opposite sides being represented. 
Therefore on questions and comments, the member for Edmonton East.  
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Humber-St. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would like to follow your line of reasoning with all respect. 
You invoked the need for debate. 
Then the member from the government side responded to that debate. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Clearly a precedent has been established. 
The Chair allowed this sort of thing at his or her discretion.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
That is my point.  
The Muslims are not included. 
People of the Jewish faith are not included. 
This situation is like choosing which minorities to represent. 
Parliament does not have the ability to cover everybody. 
Education is an absolute provincial jurisdiction.  
There is no comparable effect on another province.  
It is important for my voters in Ontario to understand. 
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:
Could I have unanimous consent to ask a question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the House for the unanimous consent.  
What is important is whether the minority had been consulted or had participated. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is an honour to rise to speak to this issue.  
I also have the distinct pleasure to rise to speak this evening.  
We had a very engaging debate in the special joint committee on this issue. 
I think it was a valuable experience for all.  
We heard from 49 witnesses from various cross-sections throughout Canada. 
It was quite straightforward in my opinion. 
The following was the text of the new term 17 as it was unveiled: 
That is very straightforward. 
The new term 17 is as clear and straightforward as the question itself. 
We have engaged in the debate for decades. 
We knew what we were voting for.  
Pastor Clarence Buckle, as well from the Pentecostal faith, said: 
We understood its implications. 
We have a formula in place. 
It is a changing document. 
They also see the value of learning about all religions. 
That was a very noble and proud thing to say.  
They have confidence in their own denominational faith. 
They have confidence in their own ability to guide their spiritual growth and development. 
I categorically reject that notion.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member used percentage figures in his address. 
I have worked in this business for many years, in fact a lifetime. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, we are beginning to get to the heart of the matter. 
It is about Newfoundland and Labrador. 
It is about Newfoundland and Labrador.  
This is what we wanted''.  
We understood categorically that that is what we were voting for. 
This is what should happen in Newfoundland and Labrador''. 
There is no suggestion whatsoever that this is what should happen in other provinces.  
This is exactly what the issue is. 
That makes it unique to that province.  
Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary secretary was the Commons chair of the special joint committee. 
Is this a question of the majority stomping out the rights of the minority? 
Is harm being done? 
This is the testimony we heard.  
No one particular denomination which may be a majority over a minority can dominate. 
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
I was an educator before I entered public life in 1982.  
To some degree they were partially successful. 
Then again Premier Wells' administration really did try to compromise. 
They wanted this issue dealt with. 
That was certainly reflected in the 73% yes vote, frustration. 
That is what educational reform in Newfoundland and Labrador is about. 
It is not about turf wars or power struggles. 
Reference has been made to the quality of education by a number of speakers today. 
Some have suggested that we rank third in the country. 
There have been big shifts in population, demographics, out migration. 
Our student population has declined for a number of reasons. 
People were afforded the opportunity to speak on the issue. 
The wording was very clear. 
I held back on the issue for quite a while. 
In the federal riding of Burin-St. 
Well over 70% of the people in that riding voted yes. 
How can anyone expect me to come here tomorrow and vote any differently?  
But the message is clear. 
Let there be no mistake about what Newfoundlanders and Labradorians want in this issue. 
They want this issue dealt with. 
It has gone on for eight or nine years. 
We thought it had been dealt with but it really was not dealt with.  
All the church leaders of the province were sitting in the Speaker's gallery. 
I remember it very well. 
They thought they had done so but we have seen what has happened since.  
In my view this issue is about governance. 
The Government of Newfoundland and Labrador was hamstrung. 
They were not able to govern. 
It got off track. 
The issue got lost. 
It was seldom mentioned. 
It turned into turf wars. 
As part of the process the government went to the people for the second time.  
So the people gave their blessing to this reform and to this question. 
It tells us about how seriously people take these matters. 
That is very good and I am proud of that. 
I say that quite seriously here tonight. 
It is very interesting for me to be here and to witness this.  
I make only one plea to the member. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Before the hon. member for Burin-St. 
In response, the hon. member for Burin-St. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
They have lived it for eight or nine years.  
They wanted it to be dealt with. 
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
There was a prayer before the football game or the hockey game. 
It was a total immersion into the catholic experience.  
Does the hon. member for Burin-St. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of the hon. member and his concerns.  
Again to be honest, yes, I do have some concerns about that. 
We are talking about a very important issue. 
We have gone through very tough economic times. 
We have gone through severe population changes, out-migration and other things. 
Education takes place every minute that we are awake. 
I am sure that will continue to happen.  
If parents request it, then they will have religious observances within the school. 
They cannot be denied.  
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I wanted to comment. 
I want to refer the hon. member to another democratic instance in 1987. 
Mr. Speaker, again it is very difficult to sort of respond. 
There is no question about this.  
This is 10 years later. 
As I mentioned, there have been a lot of changes in our province. 
There was the dollar crunch. 
The student population has declined tremendously.  
The government of the province must have the right to govern and to make decisions. 
Maybe we will be changing it back in 2007, who knows. 
If I could look that far into the future with a crystal ball- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
They are ever changing times. 
Who knows in ten years what the situation will be in the country. 
It is very difficult to answer some of those questions.  
I know that is why members are asking them. 
They know they are very difficult to answer.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
But what we are seeing here is governance, an issue of governance.  
It is a little like deja vu all over again. 
It is very much a political issue.  
I recall a marvellous speech given by a member of the Ontario legislature. 
I will not mention his name, for his own purposes. 
That is the push-pull. 
That is why we were sent here. 
We have to ask ourselves was the question legitimate.  
There was a low voter turnout, all of this. 
Let us set aside the issue of the referendum just for a moment.  
There are 48 members. 
Eleven are Progressive Conservative, one NDP and one Independent.  
I served for five years in a provincial legislature in opposition. 
It has a clear majority.  
Did the Tories do that? 
Eleven of them voted unanimously with the government. 
Did the New Democrats do that? 
I do not know the person. 
We have one in this place. 
That member voted with the government.  
The debate took place. 
Newfoundland is a wonderful part of our land in this great country. 
I represent a riding of 140,000 people. 
It is a very fast growing, volatile changing community. 
There would be an opportunity for people to voice their opinion.  
I want you to know that I do not believe that. 
We should not be worried that a precedent would destroy that. 
We should adopt this very historic amendment to our constitution.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
No one can ever say never. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We have at least two more questions and comments. 
We will go to the member for Edmonton East and then the parliamentary secretary.  
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the member opposite mentioned the unanimity of the voting of the legislators. 
That is the reason for the unanimity. 
Would the member possibly explain this?  
Mr. Speaker, if it was in the newspaper, it must be true.  
We cannot have votes of convenience. 
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
I point out one simple fact.  
We did not add the Pentecostal faith to the Ontario schedule. 
We did not add it to the Manitoba schedule. 
We did not add it to the Alberta schedule so- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The last word goes to the member for Mississauga West.  
It is an amendment we can support. 
It is a subject that has been debated in Newfoundland and Labrador for many years. 
It has been debated at length during the last month or so here.  
I congratulate my hon. colleague from Mississauga West for giving such an excellent presentation. 
Those who know me will know that I have given this topic considerable thought. 
I made my wishes known in the last round. 
Our first schools were sponsored, fostered and indeed promoted by the churches and the clergy. 
There is the connection.  
They still possess that right. 
That will be the effect of our amended term 17.  
More than 30 years have passed since such a study was made.  
The commission was chaired by Dr. Len Williams, a very experienced and respected educator. 
They chose the amendment.  
All three parties voted in favour.  
During the last couple of months this issue has been the subject of much discussion. 
There has been a lot of debate. 
I have no hesitation in recommending it, as I did the previous one, to Parliament. 
Anything which is unanimous in that House is compelling. 
It is a very personal decision which I have had to come to. 
I am persuaded on the merits of the amendment. 
I am going to vote for it for these reasons and on that basis. 
I believe that this amendment if adopted will help to make this so.  
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
He mentioned that the vote was unanimous. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
Yes, I do know most of the members of the Newfoundland legislature. 
I know some of them very well. 
I know one member who had second thoughts.  
If they are lucky, they will be one and the same. 
With some difficulty sometimes they can be different.  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
I want to thank him for the passion that he feels for the subject.  
I know the hon. member knows that.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sorry, the time for questions and comments has expired. 
The hon. member for North Vancouver.  
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Kelowna.  
That was mentioned by the hon. minister who spoke before me. 
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
I will refer to a paragraph that I used in my speech. 
I believe in the right of people to make a mistake. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
I share much of his commitment to direct democracy. 
I like to comment on a couple of the member's remarks. 
The point is that the amendment is before the House. 
Mr. Speaker, those are good questions. 
Proposition 13 in California is an example. 
We can look at the Swiss models. 
I still maintain it is nice to have those tools available. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
I will do this from three perspectives. 
Second, the political precedent that this creates in Canada could be significant. 
There is reason to believe that it will probably be the latter. 
Two principles emerge from that statement in this curriculum. 
The first one is that schools do not teach shared principles or values. 
Instead there is a climate of flexible, personal values.  
Many will argue that values are best transmitted in the family. 
That is the most efficient and the most effective way. 
Such a view does not just have implications for education. 
This elimination implies that there is no right desire and there is no wrong desire. 
There could have been in the Newfoundland situation an avoidance of this whole problem. 
That would have avoided the morass that exists there.  
I agree the Newfoundland school system was a mess. 
The organization and administration was a tremendous problem. 
I have known that for a lot longer than this debate has been going on. 
That had to be fixed. 
There was a way to fix it.  
We heard many hon. members say the government had no choice. 
That is to suggest that the government had no imagination. 
It had a choice but it chose not to make that choice. 
That is what it did. 
This was ratified in Canada in 1991. 
We can begin to recognize what the situation is here. 
Why do I say this? 
There is also historical thinking on the very same point.  
That is the foundation on which our laws rest. 
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
They clearly articulated their values. 
I think we have some disagreement. 
Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed having the hon. member as co-chair of the committee. 
I learned to respect him.  
That is what I said.  
It does make a difference and that is the point I was trying to make. 
If the hon. member did not understand that, then he has a problem.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member from Humber-St. 
Barbe-Baie Verte seems to keep referring to members of the Reform Party. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We will give the last few seconds to the member for Kelowna.  
What it would do is open the road for tyranny to take place. 
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I feel privileged to have the opportunity to participate in this debate.  
It does take some of the pressure away. 
This is an easy town for those who are advantaged. 
If we had lots of money this probably would not be such a big issue.  
We are much more driven by secularization. 
That is the current wave that is going through our system right now. 
They came from France. 
We are all human, we all make mistakes, we all fall. 
A denominational institution is different from a non-denominational institution. 
I have been associated with both at the university level. 
I do not think that would be sticking to my core principles or values.  
However that total experience, the teaching of the whole person was important.  
It just missed the whole point. 
This is not about teaching a religious course. 
It is the fact that they can walk down a hall to a chapel. 
It is the fact that there is a daily mass. 
For that reason I will not be supporting this amendment.  
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
I respect his position on this. 
I too went through the Catholic school system. 
I have a slightly different view than the hon. member, which we both acknowledge.  
The integrated education system is a denominational system. 
Frankly, they are very productive citizens in society. 
They are participating in a good structure of society.  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
Mr. Speaker, I thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Resources. 
I see that right being diminished. 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):
School administration is now in the hands of the francophones. 
This is another element. 
It was not requested. 
I suspect that suggests quite a bit.  
We can read into this what we wish. 
Finally, I want to address what our role is as parliamentarians. 
It is definitely not to rubber stamp. 
It speaks very well of the seriousness with which we address these issues. 
We rise above partisan considerations. 
Free votes force members to think about the issue. 
It removes the cushion, if you will, of the whipped vote. 
We have to be accountable for our votes. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
I wish to emphasize that this is a constitutional amendment. 
There are basically five ways of amending it. 
The constitutional amendment before us is made possible through section 43.  
Section 43, the constitutional amendment we are debating, is a bilateral constitutional amendment. 
This gives us some idea of the system in which we live.  
When we consider these issues, we have to keep two things in mind. 
This is what they are going to put an end to.  
It is not recent. 
Its roots warrant mentioning.  
You know, Mr. Speaker, how important education is to a society. 
It is vital to a society. 
That is what the commission of inquiry said. 
After that came a lengthy process. 
First of all, in 1995-96, there was a first referendum. 
In that referendum, 54% supported the government resolution.  
Why do I feel obliged to specify this? 
Second, because there have been consultations of all sorts. 
There was a referendum in 1995. 
There was an injunction. 
The supreme court of Newfoundland ruled in their favour. 
The provincial government complied with the conditions of the injunction. 
Of course, the question triggered a debate. 
That is where we are at.  
It deals with the right to reorganize the school system.  
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member. 
He made a permanent gesture for the Pentecostals in the province of Newfoundland.  
The Pentecostals make up 7% of the population of Newfoundland. 
Does he believe that constitutions are immutable? 
Did the Pentecostals have the opportunity to make their points of view known? 
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will answer the hon. member's question. 
Mr. Speaker, I understand my colleague's point of view. 
It is a testament to his sensitivity.  
I believe that these conditions have been met in the case before us.  
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise and participate in today's very important debate.  
How did we get to where we are today? 
Newfoundland and Labrador does not have a non-denominational school system. 
Is there anything wrong with that? 
Well, it has caused problems in Newfoundland and Labrador. 
Ten years ago the debate began. 
What happened in those intervening years since that royal commission?  
What happened was debate, hot and heavy, passionate debate. 
We did not see eye to eye on everything.  
In the court's wisdom, the compromise was struck down. 
Within days he said we were going to have a clear question. 
That was a very clear question.  
It is true the voter turnout was not high. 
No one questioned the other's motives. 
No one attempted to take political advantage. 
We heard that time and again from people who came before the committee. 
What they came before our committee and asked for was a resolution. 
Those people who came before the committee were not unanimous in their support. 
If there is unanimous support, it is not an issue. 
What makes it an issue is that not everyone agrees.  
I do not believe it. 
Our constitution is a living document. 
It is not carved in stone. 
It can be responsive to the needs of individual provinces. 
It can respond and it can be flexible. 
It is difficult to make change in a constitution.  
The Conservatives supported it. 
Do members know why? 
Let us help them put this into their history. 
Let us give those kids a chance. 
Let the province get past this.  
I hope members of the House will support it.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I need a little clarification. 
The hon. member opposite indicated that someone was tortured. 
I hope that was not in the physical sense. 
Hopefully it was only in the mental sense. 
Mr. Speaker, I am happy to clarify this point for the member. 
It was worry about the students and their future. 
It was about the divisiveness within the community which divided friends. 
It was cruel, mental torture.  
They also used the words ``chaos'' and ``divisiveness''. 
These difficult expressive words spoke volumes.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
I appreciate the fact that it appears to be a free vote in every caucus.  
By no means is there unanimity in Newfoundland with respect to this amendment. 
What does this amendment do? 
Let us be quite clear about what this does. 
It removes a right.  
I think that is really pettifogging. 
I think it is quibbling with constitutional concepts. 
Article 26 of that declaration stated that everyone ``has the right to education. 
I think that is very grave indeed.  
That is why we need a very high standard to alienate such rights. 
Why do I say that?  
I think the referendum was conducted in an atrocious manner. 
That is not my suggestion.  
I also object to the government's direct intervention in the referendum. 
I find this offensive. 
I agree it is a legitimate concern. 
It is to expand those rights. 
A liberal democracy does not create equality by removing rights for some. 
It creates greater equality by extending those rights to all.  
Those who will pay the price the most are poor people. 
I want to make this point. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Questions and comments, the hon. member for Elk Island.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am intrigued with the path the member is taking on this argument. 
Mr. Speaker, yes I can enlarge on it. 
That is why so many parents oppose this.  
I think that is contrary to what I understood him to say in his speech.  
Also the member made reference to a right is a right is a right. 
I am glad the hon. member raised the arguments of that esteemed constitutional scholar. 
They are arguments which give further cause for concern in terms of denominational education.  
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
I use them as a bit of a guide for my remarks this evening. 
It does not trump the other two.  
It wanted to walk away instead of working it out. 
It sprung this referendum on July 31, 1997. 
This is not the case. 
This is bordering on fraudulent. 
The Newfoundland government could have addressed this. 
Why get into this? 
The government had this opportunity. 
In 1892 and 1913 respectively other groups were brought in. 
There is nothing that precludes there being more groups brought in. 
In fact, the churches had co-operated with educational reform.  
Not so, Premier Tobin. 
In fact, these churches had willingly embraced reform. 
They had entered into dozens of joint school arrangements. 
At its worst, it will be hostile to theistic religions.  
It is a cruel joke. 
That being said, who should run the schools? 
Who should decide on the nature of a child's schooling? 
It is parents who have the primary responsibility for the education of their children. 
The Newfoundland referendum is suspect all around. 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
I have thought and thought about it. 
Are we trampling on minority rights? 
I have looked at the issue very seriously. 
Where do I stand on the matter? 
The constitution contains the principles and underpinning upon which we govern and are governed. 
I agree that is true, but does it really take away a minority right? 
These issues are very emotional ones which go to the basic values of individuals. 
In the second referendum over 73% of the people agreed on this issue. 
Therefore I am quite satisfied this was a legitimate referendum.  
The primary responsibility of education must fall on parents. 
Another principle deals with respect for the equality of all citizens. 
We are in favour of citizens having equal rights under the law. 
Another guiding principle refers to the basic right of freedoms of conscience and religion. 
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for my hon. colleague. 
Are there not some bottom lines? 
As a preface I would say that I stand opposed to that. 
There are bottom lines. 
I am personally interested in how the member would have voted on such an issue.  
Mr. Speaker, there are some good analogies there.  
We are talking about changes. 
That is the way I view it. 
I can keep my child at home and teach him religion. 
So there are two basic, strong fundamental factors here.  
That is the way I view it.  
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
Would that have any effect on the francophone school board? 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I do not think so. 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to take part in this debate. 
It has been a long day. 
I think it has been a very interesting and honest debate.  
We need to review that.  
I submit that is only reasonable. 
There is a duty on a government proposing legislation to support it. 
The answer was no.  
Term 17 is part of the Constitution of Canada. 
For there to be a minority, there has to be a majority.  
There was no way to find out. 
In fact the percentage of the vote for yes was 57.9.  
These two groups exist to defend minority rights, to defend minorities. 
Both of these groups were strong advocates in supporting the resolution. 
They were quite candid in giving their testimony before the committee. 
They said that they were in a very unusual position for them. 
They usually oppose government legislation or government resolutions, they rarely ever defend them. 
The last point I want to deal with was the question of precedent. 
For those reasons, I encourage all members to support the resolution.  
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to expand on the statement of the hon. member. 
Mr. Speaker, I did indicate in my comments that indeed there was much speculation. 
He is referring to Mr. Graesser's report, which is a separate document. 
We are not referring to the same document.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Education has to be one of the most important things to parents and to families. 
There are many studies that show this. 
That is very true and there are very few exceptions to that.  
Of course, there are some. 
I rejected their religious faith and ran away from home when I was 17. 
This was a very important and integral part of my life.  
It reminds me of the old days when Henry Ford started the Ford Motor Company. 
I do not think that is a right decision to make. 
There is one thing to say. 
I have been in that position. 
At first that private school received no funding. 
It is a little less freedom than before. 
There is an argument that public funds should not be used to support private schools. 
I cannot forget about Bombardier which is a private business. 
In the case of schools, the parents are taxpayers.  
I will use this analogy. 
Let us visualize it as a big barrel. 
I am saying the same thing for the province of Newfoundland.  
To me that would have solved the problem of whether their rights were prejudicially affected.  
I wish it would have done it.  
I am thinking of this training. 
The member for Broadview-Greenwood put it well. 
He came from the Catholic tradition. 
There are some for whom this is not important. 
I believe in our present society they are probably in the majority. 
We have become secularized. 
We will have courses about marriage. 
Really in a way a course about religion is about at the same level. 
With that I rest my case. 
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
What has been the member's experience with respect to that?  
We made some sacrifices in our family which meant almost no vacations. 
I am still driving my 1982 Chevy Suburban. 
We made those sacrifices because the money had to go to tuition.  
Certainly that should not be necessary. 
That was our solution.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
I went to a private Christian college at great expense. 
I had to work hard during the summers to go there. 
I know how much of an impact that had on me. 
This amendment would alter that opportunity.  
That is a provincial responsibility. 
It might be a solution to look at in this debate.  
It has been a good debate. 
Members have had the opportunity to express their views in a non-partisan nature. 
I have appreciate the opportunity.  
Mr. Speaker, I would like to make one brief point. 
I just wanted to bring that to the member's attention.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for pointing that out. 
I guess I did not make myself very clear on that point.  
My point was much larger. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Having said that, I am going to plunge head long into it.  
I want to tell the House why I oppose term 17. 
On so many occasions we see our freedoms being eroded, taken away from us. 
I can point to any number of examples.  
We can look at the charter itself. 
In section 22 affirmative action is proposed. 
That means we have fewer options. 
I should declare my bias. 
I have two children in a separate school, a catholic school in Alberta. 
I am pleased that I have the ability to do that. 
It means a lot to me. 
That is exactly what is happening in Newfoundland.  
We already had the Pentecostal schools and the Catholic schools agreeing to some reforms. 
That was starting to happen.  
The governments at the time had gone through this twice. 
It could have ramifications for other minorities. 
People have pointed this out. 
It is an extraordinarily important point to make again.  
That is really what we are doing in Canada today. 
It may be democratic, but a more important question is whether it is just. 
I am not convinced it is just in this situation.  
Is this whole idea is necessary? 
Is it necessary to have a constitutional amendment? 
For 1,000 years the church has preserved education. 
Where do people think education came from? 
It did not come from Brian Tobin. 
It did not come from Clyde Wells. 
They were the ones that established the great universities. 
It did not come from the public school. 
It did not come from Brian Tobin. 
Reform was already under way. 
We are a pluralistic society. 
I hear it all the time. 
We have a department of multiculturalism. 
That is my background. 
We have a multicultural society. 
We have all kinds of religions that come here from all over the world. 
We believe it is important to be pluralistic. 
We need to find ways to accommodate that.  
We have that in the current system in Newfoundland. 
I think we are making a big mistake.  
I do not disagree with this. 
It was a democratic initiative. 
Is it possible to make a determination on minority rights using a referendum? 
I do not think it is. 
Maybe it has to be two-thirds, I do not know. 
They are rights that mean a tremendous amount to them. 
Therefore, can we really extinguish them? 
I do not think they can. 
Again, some people say this was necessary for school reform. 
Maybe I have tilled that ground already, but I do not think it was. 
He said ``We were already speaking of the French aristocracy. 
That is what happened in this particular case. 
The reform was already well under way. 
The government just could not wait. 
I can tell members how important they are. 
Some people argue that religion has no place in the school system. 
They bring a world view to the table. 
As my friend said, it simply cannot be otherwise. 
We say parents should be the ones who determine what those values are. 
That is what we believe. 
It is a completely different thing.  
They learn about right and wrong. 
They do not go to those schools to learn about comparative religion. 
Religious observances are fine but in a denominational school religious observance happens every day. 
Religious observances are essentially every day. 
I will deal with a fifth point which I have heard myself. 
Some people say that denominational schools cause divisions. 
But all freedoms do that. 
Freedom of speech causes divisions. 
This is also true for freedom of belief and freedom of conscience. 
All these freedoms cause divisions.  
That is under the charter which a Liberal government brought in. 
That is all we are asking for. 
It is about the denominational school systems in Newfoundland and Labrador. 
The member referred to multiculturalism and pluralism. 
The member for Calgary Southeast also referred to pluralism. 
I suggest the contrary.  
That is something that Canadians with Canadian values would like to see.  
I honestly think that was an exaggeration. 
I do think it has an impact on them ultimately. 
I think it makes them less relevant overall. 
We have seen the churches in decline over the past many years. 
Religion cannot survive and it is not just a matter of conscience. 
It cannot survive in the public square alone with the state.  
It is a good idea to have vibrant and strong churches. 
I think that is a really good idea. 
They serve as a check on some of the things the government wants to do.  
I think that is good and that is healthy. 
I do not think that is good.  
Again, I am not saying it is a malicious thing. 
I am not saying they are trying to do that. 
The second point is that segregation will divide people. 
That is something churches typically teach. 
That is something we will find in denominational schools, love your neighbour as yourself. 
I do not think that is particularly harmful. 
I think it is good.  
I disagree completely with what my friend has said. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
His comment regarding pluralism really strikes at the heart of this matter.  
That is not pluralism. 
It is by definition monism. 
I find this most worrisome. 
I wonder if the hon. member could comment on this. 
It is just absolute nonsense.  
Mr. Speaker, I really must rise to the bait.  
I have heard this red herring before.  
They are quite contrary to what all religions believe.  
That has been reflected in a lot of the disasters in the 20th century.  
(Division deemed requested and deferred) 
(The House adjourned at 10.46 p.m.)
