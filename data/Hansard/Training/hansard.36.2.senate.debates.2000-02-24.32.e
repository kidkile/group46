Accommodation for Senators in Commons Gallery 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I should like to remind you that Monday will be budget day. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I know a number of senators have urgent matters to discuss. 
Thank you, Your Honour. 
Perhaps my honourable friends did not want to hear this.  
A quick read of the book reveals a decided Liberal bias. 
That ended when I read this morning's Ottawa Citizen .  
Honourable senators, what is going on around here? 
Does no one else count? 
They now compound the problem by being selectively secret. 
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration 
Fourth Report of Committee Presented 
Tuesday, February 22, 2000 
This amount is an Operating Budget Carry Forward. 
This Supplementary Estimate is requested to fund unanticipated expenses. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Honourable senators, with leave, later this day.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, what is the wish of the Senate with regard to "later this day"? 
What is the wish of the Senate in that regard?  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, when leave is requested, any honourable senator is able to deny that leave. 
Honourable senators, I have no objection to the suggestion of my honourable friend. 
Perhaps we need to deal with these matters on a case-by-case basis. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
No, Orders of the Day.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Would you proceed to move the motion, please, Senator Rompkey?  
Honourable senators, I so move.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Fifth Report of Committee Presented 
Thursday, February 24, 2000 
Barring some very unusual occurrences, supplementary estimates for 2000-2001 will not be required.  
The Expenditure Plan 2000-2001 accompanies this report.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Honourable senators, with leave, later this day.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Business of the Senate 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Government Notices of Motions.  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, is this a debatable motion? 
I have a question.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
A question can be asked when leave is granted.  
What is the government business that brought us back this week? 
We are suffering through an extraordinary lack of government business. 
Perhaps the answer will allow another question. 
What will we be doing next week in terms of government business?  
I am happy to say it will be brought before the Senate next week. 
Accordingly, our committees are busy. 
I would not say we are spinning our wheels. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Energy, the Environment and Natural Resources 
Honourable senators, I give notice that Tuesday next, February 29, 2000, I will move: 
Agriculture and Agri-Food 
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
Honourable senators, I rise with a question in regard to agriculture. 
I come here today both pleased and dejected. 
I am pleased because finally the Prime Minister has come to the table. 
A very serious situation exists in agriculture. 
The whole situation of commodity prices is ignored. 
The next federal budget is approaching. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I am thankful for the opportunity to respond. 
I was trying to calculate the total amount. 
I want to conclude by quoting, first, Premier Romanow. 
Premier Romanow was quoted in a press release as saying: 
I think we must recognize that statement.  
The same press release states: 
"It's a good day for the family farm."  
However, it is not the whole answer. 
When that is broken down, it is not much money. 
Other things need to be done if we are to save the farmers from bankruptcy.  
It would help if we had a good crop year.  
If we have a drought, God help us.  
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
That is what is happening.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I undertake to do that at my first opportunity.  
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
However, I wish to underscore what Senator Gustafson has said. 
That corporation is moving in on people daily. 
Those words killed us in the AIDA program. 
There is an added impetus to do so now. 
We have a significant amount of momentum as a result of the agreement today.  
I hope the leader will underscore what the farmers have been saying to me. 
I appreciate the serious aspect of these issues. 
Honourable senators, my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
One assumes that the money would apply to those farmers as well.  
As a result, there is no extraordinary help for them. 
Yes, I will do that.  
Request for National Farm Policy 
These words make the program sound like a welfare payment. 
This government has not thought out an agricultural policy. 
The government does not operate that way with the marketing boards in the East. 
That is not done.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
In any event, this does represent a substantial step forward. 
Budget-Possibility of Substantial Tax Cuts 
Hon. Michael A. Meighen :
Honourable senators, my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
Honourable senators, my question is very simple. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I do not deny that we are doing reasonably well. 
We must keep up with our competitors. 
We are keeping pace. 
The economy, therefore, is doing very well.  
Participation in Anti-submarine Exercise in Ionian Sea 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Canada is not listed as a participant. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau , Leader of the Government:
Honourable senators, I have no idea whether there is a specific reason. 
Therefore, we are stretched with our resources. 
Why were we not invited to participate in this exercise? 
Were we not asked to attend? 
Honourable senators, I do not know whether we were invited. 
If we were not invited, I do not know why. 
I shall ask that question as well.  
I refer to places such as Kosovo, East Timor and others. 
It is with good reason. 
We are able to perform our responsibilities in a highly professional and dedicated way.  
Contribution to Efforts to End War in Kosovo 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
What has been Canada's contribution to this end?  
Honourable senators, Canada's contribution has been positive. 
Delayed Answers to Oral Questions 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
(Response to question raised by Hon. Erminie J. Cohen on February 10, 2000) 
Other factors considered included gender, aboriginal and Francophone representation.  
(Response to question raised by Hon. Consiglio Di Nino on February 10, 2000) 
When the Government has proposals ready, they will be brought forward.  
Agriculture and Agri-Food 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Terry Stratton on February 16, 2000) 
This offer was open to the Government of Manitoba as well.  
The Government extended the seeding deadlines for crop insurance.  
Business of the Senate 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
As far as I am concerned, that has never happened before. 
Nonetheless, we let it go.  
I disagree with that. 
Thus, we assume that the chamber will be through certain items by a certain time. 
Therefore, senators can accommodate themselves with whatever. 
I say, Enough is enough! 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, leave has not been granted. 
What I said was not aimed at him. 
I would certainly allow him to speak. 
I thank His Honour for his explanation.  
The principle of asking for leave on many occasions is poorly based. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Provisions of Naval Service Act 
Hon. Calvin Woodrow Ruck :
We see women playing various roles. 
Hon. Dan Hays , Deputy Leader of the Government:
No, it is a rhetorical question.  
In that case, I will take my seat.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is that agreed, honourable senators?  
Sir John A. Macdonald Day Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
What I am proposing is far more modest. 
January 11 will, however, be a normal working day.  
Sir John A. was born in Glasgow, Scotland. 
He settled into his new surroundings in childhood. 
Without him, honourable senators, Canada as we know it would probably never have been born. 
He was, therefore, Canada's first Prime Minister for nearly 20 years.  
I add that the fact that he was a Conservative is a mere coincidence.  
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Honourable senators, I commend the Honourable Senator Grimard for raising this question. 
In that sense, I commend the honourable senator and liberally support his resolution.  
On motion of Senator Hays, debate adjourned.  
Committee Authorized to Permit Electronic Coverage 
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration 
Fourth Report of Committee Adopted 
The total of the Supplementary Estimates is $1.2 million.  
As honourable senators will appreciate, these two things are obviously connected.  
Honourable senators, allow me to give you a few examples. 
They require additional funds.  
These are two areas, then, where we have to make up a shortfall.  
Senators are working harder than we had anticipated.  
I am sure the people in Hansard will be pleased to know that.  
At the same time, we must continue to plan more effectively. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Could we not try to use a different expression? 
In the future, could we not change that word to "business"? 
We may decide to travel. 
This is just a proposal.  
I am not opposing, merely suggesting.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Fifth Report of Committee Adopted 
This budget, however, is significant in other ways. 
We believe it is rational, open and accountable.  
Honourable senators, value goes beyond costs and numbers. 
The Senate contributes a great deal to the public process of this country. 
Many senators have developed areas of specialization in social, economic and cultural matters. 
Senators actively promote awareness of issues about which they and their fellow citizens care deeply. 
Committees have made 13 amendments to five government bills. 
This proposed budget will prove to be money well and wisely spent.  
Honourable senators, I ask you to support the adoption of this report.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Business of the Senate 
Leave having been given to revert to Government Notices of Motions: 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
We did not receive them. 
In answer to Senator Lynch-Staunton, that is my anticipation.  
It is as simple as that. 
I think my views are shared on both sides.  
In this case, however, Bill C-2 is important legislation.  
As my honourable friend mentioned, we are conscious that committees are working. 
Almost all senators are involved in committee work. 
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, February 29, 2000, at 2 p.m
