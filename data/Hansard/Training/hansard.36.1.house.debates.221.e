THE SENATE OF CANADA 
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam, Lib.):
The petition contains some 2,700 signatures.  
Mr. Speaker, I suggest that all questions stand.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1999 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Motion No. 1 will be debated and voted on.  
I will now put Motion No. 1 to the House.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ) moved: 
But we are extremely happy to propose the deletion of these lines. 
The legislation also includes measures that are outrageous. 
There is some improvement with regard to the national child benefit. 
He used almost all of that money to pay off part of the debt. 
The minister could have taken a more balanced approach. 
He could have waited a few more months. 
He could have used this money to further increase the national child tax benefit.  
It will put an additional $180 to $350 a year into their pockets. 
Did the Minister of Finance make the right choice? 
It seems to me that he could have made an effort. 
He could have kept back some of this money to help poor families.  
He ought to walk the walk, not just talk the talk. 
Those trusts were allowed to escape. 
This has not yet happened. 
These loopholes save them hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. 
These, however, are not real. 
The cup is nowhere near our lips. 
But he did not.  
But he does not mention that. 
No, the minister says nothing on that score.  
He is taking all the credit. 
He is no doubt getting ready for the leadership race. 
Ontario was probably in the know. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
I will start by addressing the amendment from the Bloc Quebecois.  
He said that we needed to spend more money on making government bigger.  
I want to back up for a second. 
It is critical that starts to happen.  
I emphasize the government's approach is wrong headed. 
It is a question both of direction and of degree.  
I want to tackle those comments head on.  
I reject the idea that prosperity is purely a United States phenomenon. 
It is a red herring. 
I think we can. 
We can have our own priorities and be prosperous.  
What does the government have against an improved standard of living? 
The standard of living of Canadians is being eroded every day. 
They have seen their standard of living eroded. 
I think that is exactly what all parents aspire to.  
Government is not omniscient. 
People should be allowed to make those decisions for themselves.  
It is time to reverse that trend. 
It is time to lower rates. 
Bill C-71 is inadequate. 
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
It is very clear that poverty is increasing in the country. 
I do not think anyone could argue that. 
The Liberals are bragging that the country is doing better than ever. 
The same children who were hungry before the last budget are still hungry today. 
That will not change unless the government changes its direction. 
I find that very unfortunate. 
There are serious problems in this country. 
Someone should talk with them and begin to give them some hope.  
But instead they decided to go after the surpluses.  
And where did they look? 
The Minister of Finance is quite a creative fellow. 
A look needs to be taken at who actually contributed to this fund.  
That is not true. 
We see the results in our communities. 
We see the results of a lack of job creation. 
The reality in our regions must be seen first hand. 
We live in regions where the jobs are seasonal. 
We can still see ice on the beaches.  
This must be understood: we live in a country of great diversity. 
The rich get richer and the poor get poorer. 
Children who went hungry before the budget are still hungry, and will continue to be. 
One day, I hope, we will have a government with a conscience.  
The majority of people going to food banks need help. 
He might reconsider some of the decisions he is making.  
I am convinced the minister is prepared to do her job. 
She will not be able to do her job until she gets those resources.  
This is difficult to do when the official opposition's goal is to lower taxes. 
But at what cost? 
Some provinces need help. 
We all recognize that, but we must also recognize that social programs are needed. 
We need to help those who are suffering. 
The $42 billion deficit has been eliminated.  
Who paid off part of that deficit? 
We must help them, because they are in need. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
That rate would be enough to sustain the EI fund even during an economic downturn.  
The government is trying to make its numbers look better.  
There is the issue of the seasonal worker. 
In the finance committee we are talking about productivity issues. 
Those people did work at least part of the time and contributed. 
I recently participated in the Canadian Tax Foundation's annual conference. 
The political will is not there.  
Again, the government has shelved the report.  
The Prime Minister is still focused on a 1970s command style economy. 
I think he has an incredibly important point. 
I look forward to the comments of the other members.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I find that disturbing.  
I must correct that statement with some fact.  
They dealt with all questions involving transfers to the provinces. 
I do not consider it a gift. 
I do not think many members of the House consider it a gift. 
I do not profess to know how they think. 
Essentially we have restored cuts that were made to deal with the deficit. 
I do not consider health care and education big social programs. 
Many high tech companies talk about skills training. 
Canadians would not support that. 
We have indicated that we will continue our measured approach.  
We pay an exorbitant amount of interest on that debt. 
We need to continue to reduce it. 
We need to continue to reduce taxes. 
We will continue to do more as we continue to reflect Canadians priorities.  
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
No subsidy was too large, no project too small. 
Take it out of one pocket and give it back to another. 
So it went for 30 years.  
Best of all, they could have revived the taxpayer. 
They could have given him the best health care that money could buy. 
They could have given him a safe secure job through increasing national productivity.  
Unfortunately the Liberal government blew that chance. 
A two tier health system exists in the country today. 
Let us have a look at what tomorrow will bring. 
After all, he was just given a free flag. 
His family is feeling the pinch of these high taxes. 
That does not even include the cost of living expenses.  
When he got there he was told there would be a small wait. 
``No problem'', he said. 
``If you would please sit down, we should get to you within the next year''.  
The finance minister calls these differences errors of prudence. 
The country needs to get competitive again. 
In December 1998 the chief economist of CIBC Wood Gundy said: 
We need them now. 
Here comes the person the parliamentary secretary was asking about. 
That is just one example of brain drain in this country.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
I remember that the 1995 reform of the social programs took two years. 
I recall the type of consultations we had. 
Quebec was hit particularly hard. 
There was nothing to be proud of, but it is a fact. 
That was what the Minister of Finance promised. 
They have short memories. 
That is all the member is saying.  
The hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot merely raises this point. 
Great consternation is stirred up on the other side. 
They say ``My goodness, what he is proposing is insignificant, wrong, and far-fetched''. 
This is terrible, scandalous.  
The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs claims the provinces asked for this change. 
The Liberals reneged on their own signature on social union.  
That is not all. 
They did not say yes, of course. 
However, they did vote in favour of it.  
But in the House, that means nothing. 
It is like the election promises in the red book. 
He did nothing of the sort.  
It no longer works that way''.  
We must condemn this kind of about-face. 
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
This was money that was in the health care system to begin with.  
Let me offer an example from my own riding of Nanaimo-Cowichan.  
This is nothing new. 
Chaos reigned supreme on that day. 
At one point, four ambulances were lined up outside the emergency room. 
Half of them were dependent on ventilating machines. 
Guess where the only available bed was? 
Sadly this is not a Hollywood soap opera. 
This is a real Canadian nightmare. 
Think of the mental anguish to those patients. 
This is unnecessary pain and suffering. 
Why is there such chaos? 
Why are lives hanging in the balance?  
The Liberal government has taken a world class medical system and ruined it.  
We need an immediate overhaul of the entire system. 
The Liberals have decimated the level of health care for Canadians. 
Something needs to be done, and done soon. 
This was to be used as a means of raising funds for the band. 
The contents of the band bylaw are then unknown. 
Talk about misrepresentative taxation.  
Lo and behold, to receive one's cheque, one had to vote. 
At that time no housing was being worked on and nothing was projected. 
Big money and no action.  
This story has an all too familiar ring to it. 
This simply will not do.  
Accountability is a large part of such solutions.  
They do not have a solution. 
They do not know how to get themselves out of the quagmire they have created. 
It is out of their control.  
This bill is only a small example of the problem that exists. 
The Nisga'a agreement is another example. 
In matters of both health and Indian affairs the government has failed. 
For these reasons I cannot support Bill C-71.  
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
First, there are the fiscal arrangements between the federal government and the provinces. 
The third measure is the suspension of arbitration. 
The fourth concerns the management of public funds. 
The fifth involves the Sliammon first nation. 
The sixth part concerns the child tax benefit.  
Finally, the ninth part concerns farm product marketing programs.  
This figure increased to 50% for 2002-03. 
Take a neighbouring province, Ontario, as an example. 
It will receive 47.2% of the $11.5 billion. 
This does not make sense. 
The only consequence of changing the calculation is that the richer provinces will benefit.  
The decrease in transfer payments will be made up with an increase in equalization''. 
They are there to help the poorest provinces. 
Does this mean Quebec is a poor province?  
They are what gets the economy going and encourages economic growth. 
The Liberals opposite had promised help for the unemployed. 
These Quebecers were looking for a sign of hope, some breathing room, in this budget. 
I will be told that, five years ago, these people had no cause. 
But that was not the case. 
The statistics speak for themselves. 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
At the outset I would like to say that my party opposes the motion. 
The documentary clearly pointed out what is wrong with our health care system. 
Where will they get the nurses? 
It takes four years to train a nurse. 
Where will the trained manpower come from? 
I got a call last night from a constituent of mine in Calgary. 
It has cut health care when it could have cut something else. 
Now it is putting money back.  
There is the education system as well. 
Imagine the government coming out with this millennium fund. 
It is only going to look after 300,000 students. 
I have two daughters in university. 
They are not going to be subject to anything. 
How are they going to be helped? 
Yesterday I got another call from a constituent who is fiercely concerned about high taxes. 
Actually, I get calls every day in my office. 
Constituents walk in every day with one single theme, high taxes. 
Their disposable income is not right.  
One constituent said something very interesting. 
That is something new we have heard. 
Canadians are saying enough is enough.  
Lately we have heard the debate on productivity. 
One minister is saying productivity is low due to higher taxes. 
The finance minister is saying that everything is hunky-dory. 
Let me say what is wrong. 
Yes, but there is also frivolous spending by this government. 
There is the millennium project where the government is spending money. 
I do not know why we are spending money on that project.  
I applaud him for that initiative, it is good. 
We are a good exporter of our bright young individuals''. 
It needs a comprehensive solution.  
The days of election goodies are over. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to this particular motion.  
I should say at the outset that we oppose this motion. 
This budget was touted as a health budget. 
We have to look very closely at what this really means.  
This budget is not attached to any comprehensive long term planning. 
In reality it provides only a perception that health care needs are being addressed.  
More and more is demanded of the system. 
There are long waiting lists in various hospitals. 
This budget does very little to address those issues.  
The dosage is too low and the recovery is too slow. 
Let us put this budget in perspective. 
Members of the government keep repeating $11.5 billion, $11.5 billion. 
In reality they have not emphasized the amount that has been cut from this budget. 
This budget also failed to address a number of very important issues. 
It failed to improve benefits for the unemployed. 
We have seen the government seize funds belonging to the unemployed. 
It wants to put these funds into the general account to pay down the debt.  
This budget has failed to combat the homeless crisis. 
All we have to do is walk down our streets. 
Yet this budget does not really deal in any concrete fashion with that particular problem.  
In many parts of our country the highways are in severe need of repair. 
In my home province of Nova Scotia there is a need for highway work. 
The government has failed to address that particular issue in its budget.  
It has failed to provide proper tax relief. 
The families do not have adequate water. 
People have wells that run dry in the summertime. 
These people have been attempting to obtain a hook up to the main water supply. 
I have been pursuing this issue on the federal level. 
Where does the government put its priorities? 
Where are the priorities when it comes to serving the needs of people? 
This, to me, is wrong. 
Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Quebec East, BQ):
There were even some clearly defined agreements and announcements. 
That is not what happened. 
And there are more examples of anti-Quebec behaviour. 
A case in point is the national child benefit. 
As we know, the needs are huge in Canada. 
There are many other examples. 
Employment insurance is another one. 
These are instances of gross social injustice. 
There are ways of doing this. 
There is not one single senator in the world who would accept such a budget. 
This would encourage senators to retire and to enjoy a comfortable pension.  
This budget could not be rejected by the Senate.  
Senators do not represent anybody. 
This would be a way to emptying with the Senate without abolishing it. 
This kind of budget would encourage senators to retire. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
We all want to have access to maintain that health.  
Education certainly has to be high on the priority list. 
It is something that will benefit all Canada. 
We would see the poverty and say ``we must address this''. 
Instead, we see people living in squalor and committing suicide. 
We are doing a very poor job. 
This should be a high priority.  
What about the environment? 
We have to work on all those things. 
That needs to be reinforced and helped. 
It is a priority.  
There were people who suffered last summer. 
I heard that in 1993 when I came here. 
Nothing has been happening there.  
Every day we get reports. 
We strike all kinds of weird committees. 
We give grants to big business. 
If one does a good job in management, it will work.  
CIDA comes up with all kinds of projects. 
It is a wonderful thing that we have multicultural people in our country. 
I was more than pleased to put up my money.  
Many have different cultural backgrounds and different roots. 
They all had a great weekend working together and doing this. 
These people were from all walks of life and from all backgrounds. 
We paid admission and it went well.  
They went back into their communities and became Canadians. 
It is time that we started lining up these priorities. 
We have to start putting budgets together that implement addressing priorities. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
That cap was there because of the economic prosperity in those provinces.  
It means that we are returning to equity.  
It is a poor province. 
In other words, a budget should reflect the priorities of the Canadian people.  
Perhaps the member for Wild Rose did not read the last budget. 
We have hospitals that are crowded. 
We have waiting lists.  
I will try to clarify some points around that.  
In contrast I will outline what the Government of Ontario has done. 
It implemented tax cuts, which is great. 
We have been implementing tax cuts. 
We would like to implement more tax cuts.  
It is very simple. 
They attend Mississauga Private School. 
We have also shown some leniency with respect to student loans. 
Our government is responding to youth.  
Some 95% of those students get jobs. 
I have been at some of the ceremonies where students receive awards.  
This budget is a good news budget. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
I have rarely heard so many falsehoods. 
Maybe ignorance is bliss.  
Why are we so disgusted by the CHST? 
Because it will cost Quebec $350 million every year. 
The maritime provinces and Quebec have had to make do with transfer payments. 
We are unable to show who we are''. 
It is the same thing with productive spending. 
I will point out what I would have liked to see in the budget. 
Last week's consultations in the regions by the federal Liberals regional prove me right. 
The message is coming from their own grassroots members. 
It was the same kind of reaction in Trois-Rivieres. 
In Gaspesie, the Minister of Human Resources Development was even shut out. 
We were also hoping to find a shipbuilding policy. 
This is the kind of productive spending we had in mind. 
Why does the government not do so? 
Whatever the reason, the results are obvious. 
There are also more concrete elements. 
That measure could easily have been incorporated into the budget. 
Again, there are no such measures in the budget. 
The interests of Quebec are at stake.  
Nobody on the other side will be able to say that. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Bloc members are really riding a dead horse. 
However, today they have switched horses. 
Today they are not talking about separation. 
Today they are talking about wanting more from Canada.  
Unfortunately, the whole program of transfer payments to the provinces is very convoluted. 
Quebec is above average. 
Today we hear them talking about being against this one part of Bill C-71. 
I have a lot of respect for them individually. 
I regret that in the House we cannot use props. 
Some time ago I computed at what rate we were putting money into that barrel. 
Actually it is not a difficult thing to do. 
I think we have around $150 billion a year in government expenditures. 
The same is true for health care. 
There are some variances. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Let me begin by starting where the Reform Party left off. 
I take some umbrage with the last speaker's comment. 
What we are dealing with here is more than a mathematical equation. 
That particularly applies in the area of health care. 
I do not need to repeat the statistics. 
Canadians are fully aware of them. 
Where are we at? 
It has grown to 30% of all spending on health care. 
Some would say that we already have a two tier health care system. 
How does that show up in the lives of ordinary Canadians?  
There has been no retreat from that despite public outcry. 
People who have the money can get access. 
Those who do not, tough luck. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
Madam Speaker, yes, I blame the Liberal government. 
Our plea today is to reverse this agenda. 
It is not enough to stop the waiting lists. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
A number of areas are involved; in fact, the bill has nine parts. 
As we know, the federal government collects taxes, lots of taxes. 
The consequences are obvious. 
Individuals and corporations are being taxed excessively. 
This may have been the case in the past, but it is no longer so. 
That is what they call per capita redistribution.  
We talked about tax issues, among other things. 
But there is more. 
I see that my time is up. 
I could go on and on.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
I come from a community and province which have a great understanding of that. 
That is a decision it can make. 
It can decide if it wants to abandon those who are most in need. 
That means that the province has to cut further in other areas of its jurisdiction. 
That is essentially what is happening if we look at the country. 
I talked about the impact on schools. 
Let me talk about the impact on the environment. 
I was well received.  
The chair of the committee asked a pointed question of me. 
It told the chairman that the municipality had no money. 
What is the municipal commitment? 
I want to make a few other points. 
There is a real lack of creativity in the budget. 
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the debate today has been fairly wide ranging. 
That is usually something Reformers are arguing in spades. 
I can give some good examples. 
The folder which came from Heritage Canada had each province in a separate booklet. 
I made a quick scan through it. 
It was unbelievable some of the spending that was going on.  
The bureau is quite proud of the spending. 
It should not have even been in this budget at all.  
Tell me how that relates to the millennium. 
They are an excuse to spend money.  
I will give a few more examples from B.C. and Ontario in particular. 
Of that I am pretty sure.  
There is a really big one in the Vancouver area. 
We can be sure of that because the millennium only comes once in a millennium. 
Listen to this, Mr. Speaker. 
This is a project description to justify $130,000. 
That is a quote directly from the project.  
This church burned down 30 years ago. 
This is very worthy. 
It was called the Multicultural Mask experience. 
It was submitted by Earth Muffin Productions of North Vancouver. 
I think most of us know what earth muffins are. 
I did read about the project and it was appalling.  
That is the millennium bureau. 
That is what should have been in this year's budget.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
I am referring to social transfers.  
I suspect that, so far, nobody has understood where I am coming from. 
I will start with a history lesson.  
This had been going on since 1969.  
They had just announced a major reform of social policies. 
It took poverty into account. 
What did the Minister of Finance do in his budget? 
The federal government will no longer take that into account. 
This is what we wanted to condemn in all possible ways.  
Was this a novelty, a reform, a gift? 
No, it was the result of prior commitments and agreements.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Let us look at the big picture of what he is asking Canadians to do. 
That does not make sense, but that is exactly what the finance minister has done. 
He has slashed and burned health care in the country.  
We must first listen to what somebody says and then look at what they do. 
In this case, they are not.  
However, that is not what I am hearing from constituents. 
That is the response we hear from the government.  
These are members of the Liberal government saying these kinds of things. 
More Canadians think they have been abducted.  
The Liberals cannot even figure it out over there. 
The Minister of Industry has figured it out. 
Taxes are simply too high and they need to be lowered. 
THE LATE STEVE CHIASSON 
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
He represented Canada at the 1987 world junior championship.  
He was a dedicated player and a family man.  
He made his off-season home north of Peterborough. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, today I am proud to be a Canadian. 
We must trust that this assessment is reliable. 
Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam, Lib.):
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
To you from failing hands we throw 
The torch; be yours to hold it high.  
We shall not sleep, though poppies grow 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
It is only right and proper that we do so. 
They are just a small portion of this country's future. 
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
These great Canadians have collected an amazing 40 tractor-trailer loads of goods.  
They make us all proud to be Canadians.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville, Lib.):
This year, 1999, also commemorates the centennial of the Canadian Forest Service. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
The service was conducted by the Reverend Dale Lang, Jason's father. 
There could have been bitterness and blame and a call for revenge. 
As a parent, I would have understood. 
The loss of a child is every parent's worst nightmare. 
GRAND PRIX D'EXCELLENCE-MODE QUEBEC 
Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert, BQ):
Congratulations, Isabelle, and good luck in your new career.  
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
So, the hearings begin here at 6 p.m., in the Centre Block. 
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Meanwhile, Canadians are worried about their postal services. 
In Sackville there are super mailboxes which freeze in the winter. 
In Shediac there are long line-ups. 
In Richibucto the post office building is for sale. 
More and more it seems that Canada Post's only concern is to make profits. 
Could it be to make deregulation or privatization easier?  
Canada Post should work toward offering better service to all Canadians.  
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
As of March 31, 1999, the surplus was $7 billion. 
Canadians and Quebecers will never condone this behaviour.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
MEMBER FOR CALGARY SOUTHEAST 
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
When he tours the country to simply preach this type of partisan nonsense- 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has been spending too much time with Castro- 
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
We want to both hear the question and the answer. 
I would ask members to listen to the answer.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the opposition should be embarrassed by these questions.  
They belittle the parliamentary process by asking such inane questions.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, as I have already indicated, we are doing that. 
We have had scoping out discussions. 
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Does the minister agree with this statement?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I share the view that we should complete our scoping out exercise. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, we are dealing with something after the fact. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this matter has been raised at the transport committee by the hon. member. 
I have discussed it with members of the various unions involved. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the Ontario budget will be delivered later today. 
Over the past four years the Premier of Ontario has reduced taxes significantly. 
He has increased provincial spending on health care and education. 
The hon. member for Kings-Hants.  
Mr. Speaker, we seem to have the attention of members opposite. 
Perhaps they can start acting on tax cuts like Mike Harris has done.  
I am not sure that relates to administrative responsibility. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
That is the difference between us.  
What is happening in Ontario? 
Mike Harris promises tax cuts. 
Where does he get the money? 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
The hon. Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The hon. member for Fraser Valley.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Let us look at this Nisga'a treaty one more time.  
Since when did the Prime Minister become a booster for sovereignty association?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
That is something this party has stood for for a long time.  
That is what we have done.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
All I got was a very evasive answer.  
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is a very simple one:
Is the government going to freeze his assets? 
Have they been inventoried? 
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
What happened to the democratic process?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
I feel quite differently about that.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
The democratic process is being trampled in this deal. 
The government has made parliament completely irrelevant to the process. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let us understand that the house of parliament can amend the enabling legislation. 
We have always introduced signed agreements. 
Why would we do it any differently for the Nisga'a agreement?  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Quite obviously, the two approaches cannot coexist.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
I would like to remind the House of some of the approaches of the opposition. 
Are we to take them seriously at all?  
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
Why does the Prime Minister want to entrench race based employment in the Constitution?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Let us clarify this. 
It is not race based; it is rights based. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
I would like to know what the government's position is today. 
What is the government's position on across the board tax relief?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have made it very clear. 
Yesterday, the member for Calgary-Nose Hill confirmed that opinion.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
It cut more hospital beds than all the provinces combined. 
That is the record of the finance minister. 
He is the Jack Kevorkian of health care.  
I will go to the Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
They can have him.  
We are going to stand behind an education system that works. 
We understand what the united alternative stands for.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
It is investing in the index. 
Under those circumstances, we are not going to interfere with what they are doing.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
That includes an ethical investment policy for the CPP.  
Now, who would like to answer this one? 
The hon. Minister of Health.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
That is the essence of a number of the problems we face. 
The hon. member for Markham.  
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Mr. Speaker, it sounds like the industry minister is wimping out.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that was pretty convoluted. 
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia, Lib.):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Where exactly does the government stand? 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is behind the times. 
That was what was to happen in the last budget and the one before that. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
The hon. member for Rosemont.  
My question is simple. 
Has the federal government appointed its negotiator, yes or no?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
PUBLIC SERVICE PENSION PLAN 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Now, we learn that Statistics Canada has still not released its 1998 report on productivity.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
In fact, in 1998, its provisional estimates were released on July 21. 
In 1997, they were released on June 5. 
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
That brings to a close our question period for today.  
COMMENTS DURING QUESTION PERIOD 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order to correct the record.  
The Minister of Finance referred to a statement I made. 
I am sure the record will show that it is corrected. 
It is a point of debate.  
1999 BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT 
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
What does he mean by productive spending?''  
And it is his own people he is trying to disown.  
It even had huge budget deficits. 
That was a good incentive. 
They were paid not to set up business in Quebec. 
Ontario has its automobile industry, Quebec has aviation''. 
There was talk of $850 million, maybe $900 million. 
So much for the technological spinoffs, the productive spending. 
Once again, none for us. 
We just got the crumbs.  
I heard what the hon. member for Elk Island had to say. 
He takes the cake. 
He needs a lesson in history. 
At the same time, the Government of Canada populated western Canada. 
In other words, they paid about 50% of the taxes.  
The member for Elk Island is denying this. 
They contributed more than their share to this country. 
They anted up when it was time to do so. 
We need offer no excuses to the member for Elk Island. 
I see the member for Beauce watching me all in a state. 
This is what is happening in Quebec. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien:
This is not a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
This is not a point of order but a point of debate.  
This is why the member is getting all worked up. 
History keeps repeating itself. 
This is the impression we have. 
Because of things like this.  
At one time, the Liberals held 74 of the 75 seats in Quebec. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
The other measures are simply housekeeping changes.  
What I am driving at is that our tax system is failing. 
We heard already the debate on productivity. 
We do not know what the government is doing.  
This is killing jobs in Canada.  
That is how they balance the budget. 
This is matching of the budget, not balancing the budget at all. 
Duplication and waste are not eliminated.  
There are about 200,000 patients on the waiting lists for medical services. 
Who are the people who are waiting? 
They are our relatives. 
They are real people. 
They are human beings who are waiting on the lists to get treatment. 
They have done absolutely nothing.  
The government has its priorities wrong. 
That is peanuts to improve the system. 
The auditor general has refused to sign the books for two years in a row.  
Then they were busy cooking the books. 
They started frontloading the budget. 
It completely ignored small business. 
There are many examples I could give but just to summarize- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am afraid the hon. member's time has expired.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
I would like to give you an example. 
He is scared to go.  
Take the millennium scholarships for example. 
It would appear that Ottawa is always trying to duplicate structures. 
Once again, he is duplicating structures.  
There are two agriculture ministers. 
Same farmer, same cow, but two different agriculture ministers. 
Dairy farmers now have what is called mixed quotas. 
So both ministers have jurisdiction over the same cow. 
This is news to the Prime Minister. 
He has no living expenses, because he has an official residence. 
The Liberals will go around Quebec spreading the good news. 
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
I speak in opposition to the Bloc Motion No. 1.  
The provinces had to deal with this crisis. 
They shut down hospitals and closed beds.  
Unfortunately we still have the same problems. 
They really belong to the people. 
That is where the government gets them from. 
The government needs to plan in terms of how to retire that debt.  
The government keeps pointing a finger at the Progressive Conservative Party. 
There is no shortage of money. 
The money keeps flowing in. 
It still gets a big pile from the GST, the CPP, and EI. 
There are examples of the free spending attitude the government still has. 
We need to seriously look at how we spend. 
We are going to forgive the debt of the following countries:
ACOA's increased contribution will cost taxpayers $8 million. 
Additional capital costs to the NRC come to $16 million. 
We all know that taxes kill job creation and that taxes also create dependency. 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
These are not mere details. 
It is a fundamental change and the results are brilliant. 
It is one reason among many.  
Such notions will have no place in the new Canada of tomorrow.  
In my opinion, Canada has to centralize because of international pressure. 
This is a necessity for Canada, but it is a disaster for Quebec. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The question is on the motion No. 1. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The division on the motion stands deferred until tomorrow afternoon following Government Orders.  
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas-Charlottenburgh, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP):
This bill ignores that principle. 
Instead, they will be made by an unelected board of directors.  
``Oh, that has nothing to do with us,'' it will say. 
``It is all the fault of CMHC''.  
When they were in opposition, the Liberals would have found this unacceptable. 
Given this government's record on patronage, there is no way we would suggest that. 
This is already happening.  
Under this bill, these provisions are gone. 
This bill paves the way for the privatization of social housing in Canada. 
With social housing this can be a very expensive proposition. 
The NDP is also concerned about the elimination of national standards for public housing. 
Bill C-66 removes this provision. 
The explanation given was that flexibility is required. 
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
There are also things that I like about it.  
The alternative has been the co-operative housing marketplace.  
It is a pleasure to walk through. 
They know their neighbours and there is stability in the neighbourhood.  
They look after one another's children. 
It reminds me of old times in small-town Ontario where I grew up. 
Quite often that is something which is missing today. 
He goes on to say: ``We have concerns about Bill C-66. 
Those are concerns the Reform Party has as well.  
One other concern should be mentioned. 
It is a serious concern for many of the co-ops in my riding. 
They entered into mortgage agreements in times of high mortgage rates. 
They are stuck with the high rates. 
They cannot take advantage of the newer lower rates.  
That is a fundamental problem. 
The co-ops are owned collectively. 
That is fundamentally wrong.  
I should mention one other thing when I say that this point is unfair. 
She had a pretty good job and was paying a pretty high rent. 
Then she had a physical health problem and was unable to work. 
It is only right that happens. 
The group is looking after its own and that is correct.  
Lower cost housing does not mean lower quality housing. 
It was certainly adequate for my parents and four kids. 
However, with size comes expense. 
It prices people out of the market. 
The motions the NDP is proposing will do just that. 
It does not want to allow private sector builders access to funding. 
I think that is wrong.  
There is a place in our society for them. 
They were smaller and affordable.  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there unanimous consent to proceed in that way?  
I rise on another point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Does the parliamentary secretary have unanimous consent of the House?  
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
I read about 10 articles on this issue. 
I was quite surprised by that. 
It is instantaneous through the Internet and other electronic means.  
It stomped on someone who was already down.  
It is one of its specialties.  
Granted, these were not always large contributions. 
The Liberals have become masters at this. 
Mind you, I do not envy them.  
It is often subtle, but it is well done.  
What interest is there for the taxpayer? 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there unanimous consent?  
NATURAL RESOURCES AND GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Do we have unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The House will now proceed to debate the motions in Group No. 3.  
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP) moved: 
That Bill C-66 be amended by deleting Clause 7. 
That Bill C-66 be amended by deleting Clause 8. 
That Bill C-66 be amended by deleting Clause 25.  
That Bill C-66 be amended by deleting Clause 26.  
That Bill C-66 be amended by deleting Clause 27.  
That Bill C-66 be amended by deleting Clause 28.  
That Bill C-66 be amended by deleting Clause 30. 
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP) moved: 
That Bill C-66 be amended by deleting Clause 31.  
That Bill C-66 be amended by deleting Clause 33.  
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP) moved: 
The government has talked a good line on housing. 
National standards for public housing are being eliminated. 
In Bill C-66 this wording has been significantly weakened. 
I ask, flexibility for what? 
Currently the act allows loans to be forgiven. 
This has the effect of allowing the CMHC to make contributions.  
In its release, the minister described this program as providing both loans and grants.  
The usual justification is given, the need for flexibility. 
This is what the NDP amendment restores.  
Motions Nos. 31 and 33 both improve the accountability of the CMHC. 
For this reason, New Democrats will support these amendments.  
It is helping to ensure the fine words- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Resuming debate, the hon. member for Mississauga Centre.  
Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
I can only presume she does fully understand the implications of her suggested amendments. 
As they stand, CMHC's renovation assistance programs are in a straitjacket. 
Would the hon. member from Cape Breton deny this to her constituents? 
I would like to think not. 
Yet the changes she is proposing would do exactly that. 
They would also prevent CMHC from working co-operatively and effectively with the other provinces. 
Again, what would be the motivation behind such a proposal?  
The government has no intention of denying such important benefits to Canadians. 
What are we to make of this?  
I believe that the bill, as it stands, is in perfect shape. 
It is upgrading old legislation that has to come into the 21st century. 
It is here for the Canadian public. 
It is an excellent bill and it requires no amendment.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
That is the first sign that there is something wrong. 
If there was nothing wrong, then they would not have to say they were perfect. 
Everybody would know it. 
I believe one has to take issue with that.  
I was a participant in that particular mission. 
It was very successful. 
Clause 29 on page 20 would replace section 14 with the following: 
The Corporation may establish branches and employ agents.  
That is a totally different issue. 
The hon. member should review that.  
That is its purpose. 
Let us keep that very clearly in mind.  
There is no indication of where the profits will go. 
It does not even call it a fee. 
The clause states that these shall be considered expenses. 
Can money be paid to the consolidated revenue fund? 
It simply says that the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation may invest. 
It is not clear at all.  
I believe that is an inherent flaw in the bill. 
That is the minimum.  
The taxpayer is going to pay and that is a terrible intrusion. 
I will speak briefly about capitalization. 
It is interesting that the corporation has capitalization of $25 million. 
There are two problems here. 
We need to be very careful in that regard. 
Let us face it. 
It has insured something like $280 billion worth of mortgages.  
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Then they were to scrap the GST. 
We all remember that. 
Then we have the national child care program. 
Yet she wonders why we cannot trust the government.  
How about pay equity? 
We just cannot trust it. 
Also the parliamentary secretary mentioned decent affordable housing. 
Single parents are using 50% or more of their income to pay their rent. 
The budget was brought forward in February and it showed a surplus. 
What did the government do with the surplus? 
It did not put it in health care. 
Does the government really care? 
In February the Liberal government had a chance to do something about these things. 
That is what we saw and to hell with social programs. 
This is what is happening. 
It is clear that the bill will not improve anything. 
Technically we have heard everything that is wrong with the bill. 
Every day we receive phone calls from people looking for a place to live. 
If one does not have a home, how can one hold a job? 
That is a serious problem.  
It is clear it is something we cannot support. 
Hopefully the government will find a conscience some day.  
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
It has decided to go into business abroad. 
The structure was not designed for that. 
I wonder if she listened to us. 
A document was given to us in English only. 
So, this bill was rammed through. 
The bill was rammed through.  
The member for Kelowna, who spoke before me, alluded to the issue of accountability. 
With this bill, who is responsible for what? 
Now, everything will be done in secret. 
Appointments to the board of directors are also a farce. 
The parliamentary secretary did not go into any detail. 
It will pay dividends and therefore becomes a crown corporation.  
Will it be subject to audit by the Auditor General of Canada? 
They are no longer managed by parliament. 
It does not make decisions for them. 
This is what is tragic in the current Liberal approach. 
However, efficiency does not justify everything. 
We cannot bypass parliament in the name of efficiency. 
This bill reassures no one. 
This is steamroller democracy.  
I cannot support such a bill. 
It has become a real joke. 
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
I will then have some general comments.  
These are amendments with which I wholeheartedly agree. 
First, the balance will be upset in favour of the government. 
This should stay as it is.  
There is another point I want to talk about. 
I travel across the country, not that I like to do it. 
It is not being increased. 
That is what the government has been doing since 1993, wasting taxpayers' money. 
It is a real shame.  
Can she make up her mind? 
We need a better housing policy. 
We need to help those people. 
We need to put more money into different programs. 
I am not saying that the existing programs are all that bad. 
What is the government doing about it? 
The Liberals are half asleep over there right now. 
It is time to get to work. 
Put the partisan politics aside. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
It is smoke and mirror tactics.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I must interrupt the hon. member. 
ACCESS TO INFORMATION ACT 
I will continue to put forward private members' motions which try to address this problem.  
Some 17 years ago that piece of legislation was brought forward. 
All of this should be a non-partisan issue. 
After all we have an information commissioner and the bureaucracy in place. 
That is not true. 
Debate and questions are simply no longer adequate.  
It has become an essential means of guaranteeing government accountability. 
That is an important addition to the system of government. 
Sir Francis Bacon once said that knowledge itself was power. 
The Access to Information Act is currently inadequate. 
This seems to be a relatively straightforward aim of this act.  
These seem to be very reasonable restrictions. 
I think all of us would agree with them. 
In other words, open government is more than a privilege. 
That is also a violation of the existing law. 
I will now cite others.  
Does he think we will find out that the troops are not combat capable? 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour, Lib.):
The Canadian public is sending us the same message. 
They want a more open and accountable government. 
Last spring Bill C-216 was debated in the House. 
Building Canada's information economy and society''. 
There are no two ways about it. 
I see the member nodding yes, agreeing that is right.  
Consequently, at this time we cannot support this motion. 
I think everyone does want openness and transparency. 
For that I commend him. 
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
Is there anything more harmless than this information on cheese import quotas?  
On another occasion, I asked for information from another department. 
And they claim they are abiding by the Access to Information Act. 
It is a sign of fear. 
Therefore, there is some danger in that and it could cause a lot of damage. 
I am greatly concerned about this.  
I believe there are things all would want to keep confidential. 
That is what we call the right to privacy. 
No one in the House would want this either. 
It would be rathr difficult to apply the terms of such a motion. 
Of course, we respect and understand the sound principles on which it is based. 
We were told ``We are an independent agency. 
The bylaws that we pass and publish are none of parliament's business''.  
The two mall owners came to my office. 
Fortunately, it did not happen.  
I wanted some assurances. 
Would there be a call for tender? 
Would it be public? 
The person who gave me the information did not want to mislead me. 
As members can see, the Access to Information Act could be used in that situation. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
It is truly not a new debate certainly in this House. 
The current legislation is not achieving that end.  
It was used by the parliamentary secretary in her remarks. 
There we are on the horns of the dilemma. 
This is the case in private industry as well. 
Information protected for a price undermines equal access to government information.  
The balance that must be struck is something we must constantly strive for.  
I personally support the initiative of the hon. member. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, Motion No. 2 states: 
What is access to information? 
That is the Access to Information Act. 
There should be nothing to hide about the Canadian Wheat Board, for example. 
In that case documents were altered, severed, lost or destroyed. 
It shut down the Somalia inquiry.  
The copies were different but they were supposed to be the same documents. 
Our access to information laws should be reviewed and strengthened. 
That is what this motion is asking. 
That is what the official opposition is trying to accomplish with this motion. 
The Canadian taxpayer finances federal government endeavours. 
Where are the details? 
That is a big question. 
Why are other important agencies protected? 
We need to know that. 
That is why we are debating Motion No. 2. 
The Liberals forced the debate to take place.  
There is another way the Liberals could have proceeded. 
However we know they do not do that.  
We need access to information.  
We have seen the Prime Minister strangle a taxpayer. 
We heard him talk about an imaginary friend. 
Yet the Prime Minister and the elite Liberals do not want it to happen. 
The democratic record of the government is abysmal. 
Members across the way should be ashamed of their record on democracy. 
The government does not like the democratic process.  
Did CIDA change the name of the study? 
Or, was there really no such study? 
It is difficult to tell.  
Canadians have the right to know what is happening with their money.  
This is all wrong. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
It is the same with the media. 
There is a huge issue here. 
We as parliamentarians are subject to all kinds of scrutiny. 
In the CBC we can see none of that.  
I wrote him back and got a letter back from him again. 
I wrote to Peter Mansbridge, one of the top journalists in this country. 
I say to the member for Red Deer, way to go.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
That example is probably what it is all about. 
That has not happened. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
(The House adjourned at 6.27 p.m.)
