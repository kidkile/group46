The House met at 2 p.m. 
Members sang the national anthem ] 
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
How else can we explain his erratic behaviour? 
Let us review the facts which go back several years.  
He asks people to write him. 
He does not like that either. 
Then the phoenix that rises from the ashes is even worse. 
Just when you think it cannot get any worse, it does. 
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
So once again did inmates of the Warkworth Institution.  
But this year as last, our high schools deserve special mention. 
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
I also welcome Mr. Gord Chaplin to the House today.  
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
The Bloc Quebecois salutes and fully supports this endeavour.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
GOODS AND SERVICES TAX 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, October is IDD month. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
It is unacceptable for there to be only voluntary measures in this area. 
Ms. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
If you give it, the cabinet ministers will come.  
Never have so many given so much for such obvious rewards.  
Come on, everybody is doing it.  
The end justifies the means.  
It is better to give so that you can receive.  
The answer is in the mail and trust me, you will like the answer.  
Of course it may be that you will receive the grant without a donation. 
I mean, anything is possible.  
Cheques are fine, but cash is better.  
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, our government is delivering on its promises with respect to employment support.  
This is good news because it will result in job creation.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
How dishonest, how hypocritical, how heretical on the- 
The hon. member for Brandon-Souris.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
There are a number of reasons for this cause of concern.  
THE LATE CHIEF JUSTICE NATHAN NEMETZ 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Canadians taxpayers, environmentalists and the industry need to know.  
When will they produce the real targets?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We are consulting with the provinces and with the stakeholders. 
We are working at the same time with other nations to develop a consensus.  
We have to involve both the industrialized nations and the developing nations.  
The hon. member for Edmonton North.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, yes, we are concerned about all these things. 
They are doing this absolutely backward.  
It is the same thing today. 
The Liberals refuse to wait for the provinces to agree. 
What makes our prime minister think that Canadians would- 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are going to Kyoto to negotiate with everybody. 
At this moment no consensus has been reached at this moment between nations. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, they need to get their story straight. 
He brags about how he will beat Bill Clinton at whatever he does. 
Surely that is not the first priority of the government.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have explained to everybody the position of the Canadian government.  
Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the solicitor general, so I will speak very slowly.  
We showed the minister a copy of this document last week. 
What is he going to do about it?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, as usual the member is not accurate.  
Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):
This one comes from the outside.  
At least somebody is getting out of debt.  
I have a question for the temporary minister. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
We are looking for gloves for people. 
The inmates in Kingston do not have keys to their cells.  
We cannot take these questions seriously.  
PROGRAM FOR OLDER WORKER ADJUSTMENT 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
The Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I do not underestimate these workers. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, it is not a question of underestimating these workers. 
The Minister of Human Resources Development should remember that. 
He should ask the member for Saint-Leonard to fill him in.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Let us be reasonable.  
On the contrary, what has been proposed until now is an improved POWA program. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
The Minister of Human Resources Development has the floor.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
POWA was too restrictive.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
This was an agreement among all the provinces. 
The hon. member for Halifax.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
It is a narrow actuarial study. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The NDP was at the table for the discussions. 
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
When exactly will he deliver on that? 
What amount of money will they put to it?  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
In other words he was either- 
The hon. member for Sherbrooke.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I doubt I can be misinformed. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I do not think APEC should be mixed up with this problem. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
He does not think it is a very big deal. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Let us instead look at the facts of the case.  
As the hon. member knows, this is a government that respects its commitments. 
We are going to respect it. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
The minister actually admitted in public that he is uncomfortable with this decision.  
What did they do? 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are respecting a commitment. 
That is the way to get kids to stop smoking. 
That is the way to prevent young people from starting. 
That is the effective measure the government is going to take.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Solicitor General of Canada.  
The Solicitor General of Canada.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
We have worked diligently since yesterday to find out if we could confirm that. 
We have called the Surete du Quebec, the RCMP, the municipality and the mayor. 
The allegations that were put have not been established. 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
I ask the Prime Minister, who is the next target? 
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we have reached the Liberal utopia of absolutely no accountability.  
Is this Liberal Airbus justice?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
It was binding arbitration.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Solicitor General of Canada.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Two Hell's Angels challenged that transfer. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
That is not the point. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
He wants to talk about anything but his own plan.  
Let us talk about the $600 billion unfunded liability. 
Young Canadians are being saddled with a second national debt.  
Will the finance minister admit- 
The Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for his question. 
Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):
Can the Deputy Prime Minister tell us what is the status of this case?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
The next meeting of the tribunal will be in February.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
If the department is so open, why was the minister kept in the dark?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
These are unarmed missiles. 
There was absolutely no damage to personal property, absolutely nobody injured.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
I am talking about what happened on the Huron . 
The minister is trying to confuse the issue. 
I do not know how much more evidence the minister is going to need.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
PROGRAM FOR OLDER WORKER ADJUSTMENT 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the BC mine near Thetford Mines will close Saturday. 
Does this government take pleasure in seeing people suffer? 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
It was great for people who could enter the program, but the majority- 
The member from Burnaby-Douglas.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the minister of fisheries. 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
As he knows, this government is concerned about the national highway system. 
I think that is a strong response by our government. 
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Secretary of State for Parks.  
Member spoke in Inuktitut ] 
Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
My question is a very simple one:
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
The Minister of Justice has said she is open to suggestions. 
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
This act was before Congress for 13 months. 
Where were Canadian diplomats during this period? 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
The hon. member for Vancouver Island North.  
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
The Liberal government has known since 1993 that this has been happening. 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We must and we will keep the promise made last April.  
Colleagues, I have two points of order and a question of privilege. 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
It is entitled ``Employment Development Program:
Program Report, January 1997 to September 1997, of the Community Fisheries Development Centre''. 
Of course we will table the document. 
CANADA PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
I want to refer to two precedents from Hansard .  
The second precedent also concerns the goods and services tax. 
The situation before us is similar but much, much more serious. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
As such, it would be overstating the facts considerably.  
That is not claimed at all by the government. 
The implementation date will only be firm once the bill is finally passed.  
It is the prudent thing to do. 
The hon. member for Fraser Valley quoted from a document which I have not seen. 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
Mr. Deputy Speaker, first it is a pleasure to welcome you in that seat. 
It is the first report of the Standing Committee on Official Languages.  
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
PARLIAMENT OF CANADA ACT 
The hon. government House leader, on a point of order.  
When shall the bill be read a second time? 
The hon. government House leader on a point of order.  
There has been consultation among all parties. 
Is there agreement that the bill be ordered for consideration later this day?  
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
LABELLING OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions today. 
The first has to do with health warning labels on the containers of alcoholic beverages.  
PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS COMPENSATION FUND 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions.  
They furthermore urge the legislative assemblies of the provinces to do likewise.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
GOODS AND SERVICES TAX 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
She is very determined to have that changed.  
Mr. Speaker, the next petition is again about taxes. 
I again endorse the comments of these constituents.  
Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma-Manitoulin, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have several petitions to present today.  
The petitioners call on the federal government to take measures to deal with this issue.  
Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma-Manitoulin, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
Does the hon. parliamentary secretary have the leave of the House to propose his motion?  
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
PARLIAMENT OF CANADA ACT 
The hon. government House leader on a point of order.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
The House has heard the proposal of the government House leader. 
We have different points of views in the House of Commons. 
We were all sent here to make Parliament work.  
The proposed changes to the Board of Internal Economy will essentially do the following. 
The Leader of the Opposition, or his delegate, will be represented on the board. 
These changes have been made with the support of all the parties involved. 
I want to reiterate my appreciation for the support and co-operation of everyone. 
Negotiations of this type are never easy. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
I believe it is a consensus organization. 
Presumably it is non-partisan.  
We should manage the way any good organization should manage. 
Hopefully that is what this amendment to the bill does.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
Section 52 of the current Parliament of Canada Act reads: 
No reference is made to a member of the Privy Council. 
The members present shall designate a member from among themselves to chair the meeting''.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
There was no opposition representation on the board.  
It is not only Reformers in the west. 
In my home province of Manitoba NDP members outnumber Reform members four to two.  
I notice the obsession with proportionality. 
That fact has been recognized and I welcome this development.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Obviously we hope and pray this will never occur.  
With respect to the proportionality, there was a concession made and we do acknowledge that.  
I want to congratulate all the members who participated in this decision. 
Is the House ready for the question?  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
(Clause 1 agreed to) 
Shall clause 2 carry?  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Chairman, the explanation is a rather simple one. 
Which is highly unlikely.  
That is the purpose. 
Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):
Mr. Chairman, what the minister is saying surprises me. 
Are you assuming that the Speaker is partisan?  
No, Mr. Chairman, the situation is this: the Speaker is not partisan. 
Of course no one wants to imply that. 
So he is not partisan in favour of the opposition.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
This seems to be the omission with respect to this. 
The Deputy Speaker would automatically assume the position of the chairman. 
This seems to be an automatic ascension to the chairperson's position. 
This would prevent any concern on the part of the government side.  
There is no longer a reference to the Deputy Speaker from here on in. 
(Clause 2 agreed to) 
MACKENZIE VALLEY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ACT 
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
This is a very commendable goal.  
Three of our eight children are aboriginal. 
We love them as much as we do our first family of birth children.  
It is not that at all. 
It is because the bill is flawed.  
But it does so at a price. 
First, it will create yet another layer of interjurisdictional confusion. 
Second, there will be even less clarity in the rules and standards. 
Third, all this will result in an inevitable increase in the costs of compliance.  
The chamber stressed a number of points. 
On these matters the chamber said: 
The bill does not address this concern.  
It will also affect changes to leasing.  
I urge my colleagues on both sides of the House to do the same. 
Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
It does not affect the Indian Act. 
As I have already pointed out, there are some very good things in this bill. 
At the same time we know there are some concerns. 
It will mean fewer jobs and less money going into our northern areas. 
No one would want that.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
I am very interested to know his views on the following.  
I ask the hon. member the following question. 
When speaking to aboriginal peoples, their concerns differ very little from yours and mine. 
They want a good job. 
It grieves me tremendously to see what is happening with our aboriginal peoples today.  
Somehow we have to fix this problem. 
We have to work with our native brothers and sisters to do something about it. 
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
I would like to indicate a few through this intervention.  
It might be worthwhile noting that the Mackenzie Valley covers quite a wide territory. 
It is a huge area.  
That is something we would like to prevent.  
For instance is the system which is currently in place working? 
Will the proposed additional regimes improve the situation? 
Will each of the new regimes address transboundary, international and environmental impacts? 
They are more effective when mandatory rather than permissive language is used.  
The fourth point has to do with the following question. 
Canada has many environmental assessment regimes. 
The federal act provides for funding for participants. 
We are very proud of that fact. 
This funding was introduced by Liberal legislation some years ago.  
This will require thorough committee reviews. 
Of course, the availability of funding for participants is very essential. 
In doing so we will achieve something of lasting value for many generations to come.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
I have one question. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the parliamentary secretary for his question which relates to joint reviews.  
I think it can only lead to very positive results. 
Therefore, my answer is in the affirmative.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
I listened very intently to- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We will be calling for debate again after the time allotted for questions and comments. 
Perhaps the hon. member could put his point at that time.  
On questions and comments, the hon. member for South Shore.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It is tough some days. 
The microphones, as hon. members know, pick up any little sound. 
Again, on questions and comments, the hon. member for South Shore.  
Mr. Speaker, thank you for your patience. 
I will put my paper down. 
Are we going to move forward on this very important matter? 
I suggest we move ahead.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The question is on the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
On a point of order, the hon. government House leader.  
INCOME TAX CONVENTIONS IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1997 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.) moved: 
I know you are going to do a great job. 
I enjoyed very much our working together in the past.  
I wish to share what has been done to bring us to this point.  
A tremendous amount was learned through this process. 
The views of those who participated in the consultation process have been carefully considered. 
The data bank will be established and maintained by the RCMP. 
The benefits of using such a system are numerous. 
Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate you on your appointment. 
This is my first opportunity to say this publicly with you in the chair. 
As do my colleagues, I look forward to this session with you in the chair.  
Let us talk about Bill C-3. 
The theory is sound and solid. 
No one in this party would disagree with that.  
We think the bill at very best is a half measure.  
I quote Rockne Harmon, senior deputy district attorney for Alameda County, California: 
-the results occasionally exonerate a suspect or suspects. 
Investigators can redirect their efforts to alternative suspects.  
Very few governments would take that route without convincing evidence. 
What is too far? 
That really is the question.  
You are certainly not convicted of a crime at that point in time. 
That is true, of course. 
The other argument I hear is about the security of the registry itself. 
That must be continued and strictly enforced.  
This bill should be a very critical part of our justice process. 
That goes without saying. 
It must be a major part of our process. 
We have seen evidence of that in Canada during the last few years. 
That is something no one can argue with in this country.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
We all know that a DNA profile is the best way to identify someone. 
What sort of questions might we have? 
There are some I would mention here today. 
First, the bill contains provision for the storage of bodily substances taken. 
Once again, these are huge ethical questions. 
Where will it stop? 
I have another concern. 
Let us give sample collection over to qualified medical personnel.  
There is also the question of the disclosure of profiles. 
I am thinking of such things as the FBI or Interpol. 
As it now stands, the bill gives commissioners considerable leeway. 
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
I look forward to debate on the retention of DNA samples. 
The solicitor general indicated there were compelling arguments on both sides at the current time. 
My own feeling would be that retention causes real problems. 
I look forward to that debate in the House as well.  
At the time individual are charged they are the accused.  
At that time the person we are calling the victim is the accuser. 
At that time I am the accuser and he is the accused. 
As the solicitor general indicated, many groups made presentations to him. 
Many groups opposed the legislation. 
Certainly there are benefits to the accused. 
The automatic taking of the sample is something I have some problems with.  
Then the sample ought not to have been collected in the first place. 
Those concerns will demand very real examination in committee. 
I cannot stress that enough. 
I feel very strongly about that point. 
Who will be taking the samples? 
Who will pay for it? 
Obviously the commissioner will be a member of the RCMP. 
The RCMP will have a huge influence on the way the legislation is dealt with. 
All those questions deserve very careful consideration.  
As I have indicated I look forward to the debate. 
I think it will be lively. 
He is a former prosecutor. 
I am a former defence counsel. 
The two of us worked in the same province. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
He mentioned the Morin case as well as the Milgaard case in his province. 
Caution must always be exercised in the use of this type of technology.  
A discussion paper entitled ``Establishing a National DNA Data Bank'' was tabled. 
It was also introduced in time for inclusion in the red book.  
Police officers, particularly those involved in the Canadian Police Association, do not feel it will. 
In essence, it is opposed to the legislation in its current form.  
It might even encourage suspected offenders to skip bail. 
Most people charged with offences do receive release pending trial. 
We certainly do not need more unnecessary loopholes in our justice system. 
Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have seven or eight minutes left. 
I will try to conclude my remarks by 5.30 p.m. 
Rest assured that the Government of Canada is taking these questions seriously. 
You can see a broad cross section was consulted.  
The legislation includes numerous safeguards. 
MACKENZIE VALLEY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ACT 
Actually what I have is a trap door here, and if you don't- 
The Speaker: -you go down.  
The question is on the motion.  
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
(Bill read the second time and referred to a committee) 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC) moved: 
They have become more efficient and are lower cost producers.  
The industry has evolved and modernized. 
The federal government has no specific industrial or trade policy dealing with shipbuilding. 
This forces us to compete on an uneven playing field.  
Canadian shipyards cannot, would not and have no interest in participating in this aggressive market.  
Shipbuilding construction has shown consistent increase in demand since the early 1980s. 
Shipyards around the world are preparing for continued growth. 
The industry is imploring the government to visit this initiative immediately. 
There is no reason the government cannot take that step right away. 
The industry also wants to see the one-sided aspects of NAFTA eliminated. 
Otherwise they are open to free trade. 
This legislation was exempted from the FTA and from NAFTA.  
This unfair and imbalanced version of free trade puts Canadian shipbuilders at a severe disadvantage. 
I agree with the Minister of Industry on this issue. 
The industry has proven that it is competitive. 
They recognized the need for a national shipbuilding policy. 
The industry and the ship owners association are calling for a national policy.  
All these folks are not wrong. 
This is a national policy. 
All we are imploring the government to do is to begin dialogue. 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
As has been stated earlier, overall the major shipyards employ about 4,000 workers. 
Essentially there are three elements to the policy.  
We recognize that the international playing field is not level. 
Things are slowly changing.  
The extra costs get passed along to consumers in higher prices. 
There is a result of subsidies.  
This is a very slight improvement but still not good enough.  
That is what they say every year.  
Certainly new opportunities are out there. 
There is evidence that the international shipbuilding industry has come out its global recession. 
We must be prepared to compete in the global marketplace. 
A lot of work has been done but a lot more has to be done.  
There is much work to be done.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
The intent of the motion is probably one we could all support. 
This is the same minister who does this. 
The unfortunate part of it is that is not unusual. 
It so happens that this is a Liberal government right now. 
There was a PC government before it which did exactly the same thing. 
It also subsidized the one but not the other. 
So there is nothing new here.  
This is just one of those crazy back and forths. 
One would think it was a ping-pong game we were involved in here. 
It reads something like this. 
They want the policy to focus: 
The hon. member said that there are all these other programs. 
There is nothing new here. 
It was led by the premier of New Brunswick.  
The Reform Party has talked about this for the last eight years. 
We know that is the answer. 
The answer does not lie in subsidies or grants. 
That is what is wrong with subsidies.  
What has to happen here is that the environment needs to change. 
Those are two absolutely critical questions. 
They lie at the very base of a Canadian shipbuilding policy. 
What ought it to be? 
I think the hon. member will agree that those are the key questions. 
I do not have the answers to those questions.  
Part of it was to reduce the number of ships, and that is fine. 
We do not have a level playing field in Canada. 
It also raises the question of providing certain kinds of guaranteed loans.  
This is a double whammy on the taxpayer. 
First the taxpayer is asked to give the grant or subsidy to a particular industry. 
When that industry defaults, the taxpayer has to pay again.  
That is what is wrong with this kind of system. 
We cannot afford to do that. 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
The debate this evening is, however, highly relevent.  
I will explain with an anecdote.  
All that remains is to deliver.  
That is why we are debating Bill C-9 again today.  
The Standing Committee on Transport had tabled a report entitled ``A National Marine Strategy''. 
This is what the Liberals promised in 1995. 
That is why we tabled a minority report.  
That concludes my remarks.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Canada was once a key player in the global shipbuilding industry. 
Apathy, resignation and ineptitude have been the hallmarks of its approach.  
The government approach has had devastating consequences. 
Close to one-third of the world fleet is more than 20 years old. 
In sectors such as oil tankers this figure is much higher. 
The do nothing approach taken by this government to date is no longer acceptable. 
We believe that to be simply scandalous. 
I will do what I can to support the motion. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
That is because of what the Liberals and the Conservatives have done in the past.  
There is no work and it is sitting idle. 
They have spoken with a number of members.  
His statement was that the government is not in the subsidy business. 
I want to make it clear that we are not advocating subsidies at all. 
That does not mean subsidies.  
Over 10,000 people in the country would be put back to work. 
The Liberals can become heroes. 
When they do it, we will stand up and applaud. 
And what happens then? 
The families come to us saying ``Daddy is gone. 
Daddy is not coming back.''  
So we are saying to them please, please. 
Lease financing has become a predominant method of financing significant capital items. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Has it been seconded? 
If so, by whom?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
There has not been unanimous consent. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
On every turn the public's interests have been subsumed by commercial interests.  
What did they do when they became government? 
They simply carried on with Bill C-91.  
That brings me to my second concern. 
What did they do when the standing committee reviewed this issue last year? 
What happened to the draft report of that committee? 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health.  
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
But the dialogue has just begun. 
Canada's health care system is a partnership. 
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
The idea behind the use of acquisition cards is sound. 
I believe any idea that can save taxpayer money is definitely worth looking into.  
Employees are not properly instructed on the use of acquisition cards. 
When an employee leaves, cards are not properly cancelled. 
I own a small convenience store in Tilley, New Brunswick. 
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):
In our times of restraint, departments are identifying better ways of operating. 
In fact since its inception we have had a savings of some $6.5 million.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The motion to adjourn the House is deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 7.14 p.m.)
