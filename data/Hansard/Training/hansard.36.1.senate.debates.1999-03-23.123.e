The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
On behalf of all senators, I bid you welcome to the Senate of Canada.  
The Year of Canadian Francophonie 
Hon. Jean-Robert Gauthier :
Canadian Intercollegiate Athletic Union Basketball Championships 1999 
Congratulations to Saint Mary's University Huskies on Winning 
Hon. Wilfred P. Moore :
This marked the first time such title has been decided in overtime.  
Ross Quackenbush, coach of the Huskies, was a member of those 1978 and 1979 teams. 
We heartily congratulate Coach Quackenbush, his team and their legion of supporters.  
International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 
Hon. Erminie J. Cohen :
That is an important commitment, and it warrants our attention. 
Statistics suggest that hate crimes have been on the rise in recent years. 
If this is the case, it is the case of placing expediency over principle.  
The last one conscripted was Robert Bourassa.  
No one was taken in by his little ploy. 
Robert Bourassa would not have offered such an insult to the francophones of Canada. 
The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce was the founding sponsor.  
International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 
These proactive and largely preventive efforts are salutary. 
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
The new legislation came into force in October 1996.  
However, these are not forms of discrimination. 
They are critical steps in the direction of genuine equality.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
On behalf of all honourable senators, I bid you welcome to the Senate of Canada.  
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration 
Thirty-Second Report of Committee Presented 
Tuesday, March 23, 1999 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act 
Bill to Amend-Report of Committee 
Tuesday, March 23, 1999 
The Standing Senate Committee on National Finance has the honour to present its 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Could the deputy leader give us some information on this?  
In addition, some other very important things are happening tomorrow. 
As honourable senators can see, tomorrow will be a busy day. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Canadian NATO Parliamentary Association 
Fiftieth Anniversary of Confederation-Notice of Inquiry 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
I have stripped him of his stripes. 
My question has to do with matters that have been raised in this place before. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
So far, I have been unsuccessful. 
Then I have been somewhat remiss in not prodding you about this matter.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
That is an excellent suggestion. 
I shall take it to my colleague the Minister of National Defence.  
Prime Minister's Office 
Hon. Erminie J. Cohen :
I am sure we can expect exciting and concrete results from this new ministry.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I would be happy to do that, honourable senators. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
I am happy to read it. 
When it has been translated, I will have it tabled.  
Honourable senators, I do not believe it is a ministerial position. 
I believe it is really a coordinating role. 
Mrs. Bradshaw is an excellent appointee to that task.  
I do not know. 
It is the Prime Minister's prerogative to make the official designation.  
Employment Equity in the Senate-Government Position 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
It will be discussed by the committee at the earliest possibility. 
We consider it a very important issue indeed.  
Delayed Answers to Oral Questions 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
( Response to a question raised by Hon. Ethel Cochrane on March 3, 1999 ) 
( Response to question raised by Hon. Janis Johnson on March 9, 1999 ) 
All three utilities are owned by their respective provincial governments.

Bill to Amend-Report of Committee 
Leave having been given to revert to Reports of Committees: 
Tuesday, March 23, 1999 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Pages exchange program with house of commons 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I welcome her to the Senate.  
Canada Customs and Revenue Agency Bill 
Third Reading-Debate Adjourned 
My speech today will examine these aspects of the bill.  
This example is not unusual. 
It currently takes up to 12 months to staff a position at Revenue Canada. 
Revenue Canada's business volumes are rapidly increasing. 
Business service demands are significantly rising. 
This is simply not true. 
Employees will receive benefits from any pay equity settlements. 
Revenue Canada wants to preserve the employees' fundamental rights while retaining flexibility. 
Therefore, it does not form part of current collective agreements. 
This would continue under the agency.  
Employees of the agency will remain in the Public Service of Canada. 
Honourable senators, I hope you will find these guarantees assuring.  
Yet the Province of New Brunswick currently has no representative in Revenue Canada.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, might I ask the Honourable Senator Carstairs a question?  
On motion of Senator Stratton, debate adjourned.  
Foreign Publishers Advertising Services Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
...become enriched with the exertions of Native Genius.  
That it was to be regretted: 
The NHL is run out of New York City. 
Most of the leading players are non-Canadians. 
Salaries are in American currency. 
Senator Graham has told us that: 
I have no quarrel with that. 
Now we are being assured by Senator Graham that: 
They are also, of course, consistent with our obligations under NAFTA.  
The government's record in this area is dismal:
Fixed by whom, we may well ask. 
Q. Why do you say that?  
Q. Do you think that the solution is in the bill then...  
Bill C-55 is not an isolated case. 
On motion of Senator Kinsella, debate adjourned.  
Appropriation Bill No. 5, 1998-99 
That must be a concern for everyone. 
Despite those figures, we must be cognizant of the potential "slippage" that we see happening. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Appropriation Bill No. 1, 1999-2000 
Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
I am certain that this will be of great interest to Senator Stratton.  
On motion of Senator Stratton, debate adjourned.  
First Nations Land Management Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Heaven knows, we have been in error enough in our point of view. 
Why not give them the opportunity to do the same?  
There are problems in this bill. 
There are areas that we must consider. 
We spoke about the legislation with great candour. 
I expressed to them my concerns. 
Let me speak to the two areas with which I have concerns. 
In exchange, the government endeavours to create some level playing field of compensation.  
Such expropriation cannot be done lightly. 
We have those provisions in federal and provincial statutes.  
I have seen three such land codes. 
They had no reference or very limited references to expropriation. 
After all, their lands are being expropriated.  
I should like to point out an interesting fact. 
He told me about the tax situation, which is before the courts.  
Honourable senators, I suggest that a simple amendment to this legislation would suffice. 
That would set out all the necessary rules and regulations. 
I recommend that our committee seriously consider putting forward an amendment of that nature. 
I am hardly an authority in this area. 
I do not know the answer to that question. 
This issue has been examined many ways. 
At page 51 of Volume 4, it states: 
Indian women on-reserve, therefore, are seriously disadvantaged. 
In another section of this same report, under the title, "Indian Women," it states: 
This is an important issue. 
Honourable senators, those are my suggestions regarding Bill C-49. 
However, it is legislation with flaws and gaps, and which cries out for amendments. 
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
I am much more concerned with the issue of women than I am about expropriation.  
I can see the problem. 
I hear the non-native people squealing about expropriation.  
I suppose that we will have to look at how these expropriations take place.  
It will be interesting to see how we work this out.  
I now wish to address individual rights. 
Both sides of the House looked at this subject. 
Part of classical liberalism, something in which both our parties believe, is emphasizing the individual. 
That is not so. 
This might be a time to start thinking about the individual.  
What kind of economy will they develop? 
What kind of vote will they have? 
What rights will they have as shareholders? 
Will it be entirely a band-owned operation into which these monies will be invested?  
We are not doing that. 
This is not something which just arose. 
Governments are still expropriating and taking away rights that properly belong to our aboriginal people. 
Certified General Accountants' Association of Canada-Second Reading 
That year, CGA-Canada had 84 members, all based in Montreal. 
Modernization is essentially what Bill S-25 seeks to do.  
In brief, honourable senators, this bill does three things. 
Second, the bill provides for the short form name "CGA-Canada." 
It develops educational programs for its students and members. 
It disciplines its members. 
It participates in setting international accounting standards. 
It conducts research and publishes papers. 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone 
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
The response from the public has been overwhelming. 
We have received many letters on this issue. 
We all know that milk is an important product. 
What happens with rBST? 
I am a farmer. 
I have worked with cattle all my life. 
I recommend that every senator read this detailed report. 
The major recommendation was for continued study and scientific investigation into rBST. 
There was a report of stolen papers, reports of coercion, reports of manipulation. 
Most of it is covered in the report. 
Also, the issue of licensing by Health Canada was raised.  
I will give you one example. 
Europe will not take canola from Canada because our canola is genetically modified. 
Europe will not buy our canola product. 
Again, we wish to thank the witnesses for their testimony. 
It is the committee's intention to call further witnesses. 
I wish to thank the committee for its work. 
Let me conclude by throwing a little flower to the Senate committee at this time. 
In general, there was good agreement on the things that were positive or negative.  
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
Honourable senators, I should like to ask the honourable senator a question, if I may.  
Therefore, as a committee, we certainly intend to get to the bottom of that situation.  
First, the document the committee released is merely an interim report. 
This report is by no means final. 
We will hold accountable all those who made promises before the committee.  
The committee's staff worked long hours. 
These people are responsible for putting this product on your shelf. 
Honourable senators, rBST is a production drug. 
It is not a therapeutic drug. 
It does nothing for society whatsoever. 
I am not against biotechnology or biodiversity. 
However, there is no need for this hormone in our country. 
It was instituted by Senator Hays' late father. 
He worked with the provinces and the producers of this nation. 
I was a consumer of milk at that time. 
I do not know if I was a good manager of supply at that time. 
No one can argue with what they do. 
Quebec is now in that same position. 
Because we give them an economic return for producing a high-quality product. 
The committee also received over 1,000 letters. 
These are individual letters.  
I received around 500 letters. 
Other members of the committee received letters. 
Each year in the United States alone 60,000 people die from diabetes. 
As I have said, these results have raised major concerns in Europe. 
They talk about how many countries have approved this product. 
How many of these countries can export a quart of milk? 
I find that to be hypocritical.  
I have always looked upon research as our most important product. 
We know that our researchers are scared now. 
Who will hire them? 
A dangerous situation is being created in our society. 
The Codex organization is clouded in secrecy. 
When do they meet? 
Where do they get their information? 
Membership on the committee is not permanent. 
Rather, members are appointed prior to each meeting. 
It is a relationship which this committee will investigate further.  
The situation in the United States is of great concern. 
This does not sound like a legitimate health review.  
Monsanto lost $250 million last year. 
Tests were done for 90 days on 30 rats. 
The process was certainly speeded up. 
It is obvious they did not have very much knowledge. 
That is just unbelievable.  
This is why I emphasize that our report is merely an interim one. 
The committee would welcome Monsanto's scientific evidence.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable Senator Whelan, your time has expired. 
Is leave granted to allow the honourable senator to continue?  
Voices of disapproval are sometimes heard from within this building as well as from without. 
They are getting good value for their money. 
We have worked to our full potential. 
We have not let partisan interests get in the way of our work. 
There is no need for the addition of this hormone.  
That evidence is not yet available. 
I am confident in the knowledge that it never will be.  
Honourable senators, it is a great pity that Senator Whelan must retire. 
I certainly agree with his remarks about the operation of the committee. 
Those of you who are farm people will understand that reference.  
Last month, Britain's London Observer called us for comment. 
That is not supposed to happen. 
They will interview Senator Whelan.  
In a word, it is a matter of trust. 
Yet they waved it through.  
Drug evaluators believed the manufacturer had tried to bribe them. 
We did not get it. 
Again, the operative word is trust. 
Somehow, we take this for granted and yet it does not always happen.  
This month there is more cause for concern. 
That report has been tabled. 
I want to address that issue head-on. 
We want to be open-minded in hearing all new evidence. 
Senators from both parties called it as they saw it. 
Many of us have farm backgrounds. 
I always knew he would do the right thing. 
I hope the minister and any future minister of health will stay the course. 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Honourable senators, would my colleague entertain a question?  
In the Quorum of today was an article which dealt with this issue. 
During the committee's deliberations, were there others who made similar claims? 
We have to be careful, honourable senators. 
The superficial way in which this drug was dealt with is really quite shocking. 
In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration misreported it. 
That is what the committee intends to do.  
Honourable senators, I, too, should like to ask the chairman of the committee a question. 
He talked about the genetic work that is being done. 
Is the chairman of the committee aware of that?  
On motion of Senator Milne, debate adjourned.  
State of Financial System 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
This was of great interest to me. 
Who are the people who run pension funds?  
How well do they do their jobs?  
What incentives do they face?  
We need to build up some knowledge in a hurry. 
We will not understand it and we will end up with bad policy.  
I find the whole area of institutional investor activism particularly interesting.  
The reality is that institutional investors are becoming more active in Canada. 
As the OECD notes: 
The absence of confidential voting is a key issue. 
Institutional investors do not micro-manage. 
Canadian institutional investors should become more intimately acquainted with a smaller number of companies.  
The issue is one that comes up again and again. 
He added that in general, "there are few well-governed boards." 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Are you requesting leave to continue?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Thank you, honourable senators.  
Continuing with the words of John Palmer: 
As far as we know, most plans are well managed and well founded. 
However, some plans could benefit from improvements in governance procedures and from better funding.  
Pension funds present a particular problem in this area. 
In the corporate world, shareholders elect directors to protect their interests. 
Shareholders have a significant degree of control over their own destiny.  
Professor Jeffery Macintosh of the University of Toronto testified that: 
John Por testified that: 
The committee was quite concerned about this possibility.  
All of these things require a high degree of skill and knowledge.  
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
Honourable senators, may I ask the honourable senator a question?  
That is something that many of the witnesses who came before us raised.  
We will vote against them if you bring them forward to your meeting."  
They would say, "We would like to have a meeting." 
The information that they would be getting would be insider information. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, Senator Meighen would like to speak on this tomorrow. 
With leave, I adjourn this debate in the name of Senator Meighen.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
On motion of Senator Oliver, for Senator Meighen, debate adjourned.  
Review of Nuclear Weapons Policies 
That is not the intent of the motion.  
Who knows for how long it would go on?  
That is the point at issue.  
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Honourable senators, the promise of this resolution, on the surface, as least commends itself. 
The NATO expansion would have reversed the result, so said General Butler. 
Where do we go from here? 
Some proponents of this resolution may have different objectives in mind than I do. 
What kind of debate can this be, then?  
Where should we in the Senate inform the government about NATO? 
In a nutshell, where should Canada stand? 
After the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, Robert Kennedy asked this question: 
This raises the basic question of foreign policy. 
Should states be measured and calibrated by principles of individual morality? 
Yet Niebuhr himself went on to explain that states cannot be sacrificial. 
Governments do not have the luxury afforded to individuals. 
Of necessity, they are agents, rather than principals. 
Niebuhr quoted Hugh Cecil's argument. 
The duty of self-preservation conflicts with the individual duty of sacrifice. 
Confusion rather than clarity results. 
National interests, in short, cannot totally displace international morality.  
The key issue is deterrence. 
A recent book, America's Achilles' Heel:
some exceptionally capable nonstate actors.  
These are critical questions requiring analysis and critical studies. 
These are new, complex and runaway risks.  
When are such weapons justifiably deployed? 
Salus populi, suprema lex est , he proclaimed . 
This begs yet another fundamental question. 
Yet Canada has joined this international armada in the air and on the ground. 
Our collegiality should not be confused with consensus.  
Honourable senators, I move the adjournment of the debate.  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
All the senators could reach an agreement. 
The Senate could decide on something. 
I hesitated a great deal about speaking on this motion. 
I examined this subject in the External Affairs and National Defence Committee. 
The meeting is to take place in April. 
I am going to take a calculated risk.  
It is a calculated risk. 
I will not read my speech in favour of this motion. 
I ask for support of this resolution before six o'clock. 
I see that our agenda is heavy. 
We have not gone through much of it today. 
It seems there is agreement. 
I take the chance.  
I support this motion. 
Let us not get excited; it is only a motion. 
That does not mean we want to transform NATO. 
We do not want to completely transform NATO. 
The Hon. The Speaker :
On motion of Senator Spivak debate adjourned, on division.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
There is nothing on the Orders of the Day at the present time. 
Honourable senators, according to the Rules of the Senate , adjournment is at six o'clock. 
Senator Carstairs suggests an extension of the debate. 
This motion is debatable. 
An item on the Orders of the Day has been called.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
No, that is not so. 
At six o'clock, I have no choice. 
It is now six o'clock.  
Debate Respecting Posting of Troops Outside Canada-Inquiry-Debate Continued 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Under this same traditional paradigm, the Serbs find themselves in the same position. 
This would make the current struggle less irreconcilable.  
On motion of Senator Carstairs, debate adjourned.  
Committee Authorized to Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
Response of Government to Requests and Recommendations-Inquiry-Debate Continued 
Honourable Senator Prud'homme, P.C. ) 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
It seems that people do not seem to understand the rules. 
Earlier, I let it go. 
This time, I can speak. 
My speech is ready. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
He has begun the debate, and he will continue the debate. 
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
On motion of Senator Prud'homme, debate adjourned.  
Hon. Lois M. Wilson rose pursuant to notice of March 16, 1999: 
That she will call the attention of the Senate to the situation in Sudan.  
Is it because it is an African country? 
The reality is much more ambiguous. 
The human toll is horrendous but largely unknown. 
Others put the death toll much higher. 
Famine and starvation are being used as strategic tools of war. 
Corridors for the delivery of humanitarian aid are continually being cut off.  
How long are they willing to keep this up? 
Food is being used as tool of war.  
The question is one of implementation.  
There would be support from a small dedicated technical support staff. 
Time is of the essence.  
A number of issues exercise Canada. 
A second one is the need to rebuild trust between the warring parties. 
The mediator must consider confidence building measures. 
It is that Canadian business presence is a reality in Sudan. 
Canada's image is now of some concern. 
How will the wealth be split, or will it? 
The oil starts flowing this June. 
Does that mean game over? 
On motion of Senator Prud'homme, debate adjourned.  
That the Committee have the power to sit during sittings and adjournments of the Senate; 
That the Committee submit its final report no later than October 29, 1999. 
That clearly lies outside the normal areas of NATO responsibility as defined in 1949. 
This time, history may not repeat itself. 
We are a long way from Suez, Cyprus and the Golan Heights. 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
I would like to put a question to Senator Lynch-Staunton. 
Which issues should have priority? 
I am very sympathetic to this issue. 
I have my doubts with respect to enlarging NATO.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted for the Honourable Senator Lynch-Staunton to reply? 
Is leave granted for the Honourable Senator Lynch-Staunton to reply?  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Were you intending to take the adjournment, Senator Carstairs?  
Might I have a few words, then? 
I wish to lend my support to Senator Lynch-Staunton's motion. 
In my opinion, we have an opportunity to take a timely and very critical look. 
This was done by a regular standing force of some 60,000. 
Canada's navy has yet to see a new maritime helicopter. 
As well, three light infantry battalions of about 3,000 soldiers have been created.  
Maybe our army should be restructured with these operations in mind. 
Those who do not sufficiently understand the past are bound to repeat it. 
Thus, I support this timely motion.  
In the Senate we have a Foreign Affairs Committee. 
The division of efforts and responsibilities was found to be wanting. 
That can happen without too much interference.  
Yes, I wish we had our own committee. 
However, I am very happy with Senator Stewart. 
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
Senator Kinsella has put forward some good ideas, as has Senator Forrestall. 
I was helping to establish a geological survey for Marshal Tito. 
Slovenia had most of the money.  
Marshal Tito was considered a revisionist. 
I do not know what we can do as senators or as individual Canadians. 
However, I think the wrong move is to attack. 
It should be published in every press in the country.  
If bombs are dropped, we can be sure that innocent people will suffer. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
If no other honourable senator wishes to speak, I will proceed with the motion.  
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
International Position in Communications 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I should like to ask a question of the chair of the committee. 
Is it anticipated that this extension will be costly? 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Senate adjourned until Wednesday, March 24, 1999, at 1:30 p.m.
