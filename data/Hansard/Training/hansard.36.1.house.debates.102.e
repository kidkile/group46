EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 102 
Friday, May 8, 1998 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
This turns democracy and labour relations upside down.  
That was in May 1997. 
Why should they have to go through that?  
Whatever happened to freedom of association in this country? 
This is an absurdity.  
It got the names and addresses of the members. 
There were seafarers who had their legs broken. 
The goons knew where everybody could be found.  
I know we have come a long way in the last 40 or 50 years. 
Nevertheless, it still happens.  
That is the way it is.  
It is a privacy issue. 
I do not know who on earth came up with that stroke of genius.  
I have carried a union card. 
I imagine there are other members of this House who have carried a union card. 
The final thing I would like to mention is final selection arbitration. 
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
The union has served them extremely well. 
However, this legislation in my view tears some of that down. 
First and foremost, unions must represent their people. 
But this bill does not address the real issues. 
With the old bill, the old ways, people had to certify for a vote. 
The first thing that does not get picked up is the garbage.  
There needs to be some way to address these issues.  
This is the Wal-Mart case.  
We feel this is wrong.  
My colleagues and I will push this issue because we feel it is paramount. 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
My thrust today is going to be from an employer's perspective. 
That employer finds himself in a very difficult situation. 
Therefore he cannot say yes, he cannot say no. 
What can he say? 
He can say no comment. 
This is a perfect example. 
Who is this employer really concerned about? 
Who is he trying to meet the needs of? 
We paint these employers as if somehow they have some grudge against their employees. 
That is certainly not the case, in particular with this operation. 
These are employers who are concerned about the livelihood of their employees, their families. 
They want to make sure there is a viable operation for years hence.  
They put their faith in government which is a big mistake.  
That is abdicating our responsibility.  
These amendments are totally counter to that kind of thrust.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
We are discussing important amendments to an important bill.  
We see that in this place in our committee meetings. 
We receive a written brief. 
The same kind of situation should apply to the Canada Industrial Relations Board. 
We need the opportunity for an oral hearing. 
It will help expedite some of the minor cases and will streamline the process. 
In the end it should save taxpayer dollars. 
We think that particular amendment by our colleagues in the Bloc goes too far. 
We need the opportunity for oral hearings.  
This amendment ensures the wishes of the majority are upheld. 
This amendment would certainly ensure that the wishes of the majority are upheld. 
That is why I speak in strong support of Motion No. 7. 
Bloc Motion No. 8 would weaken the employers association. 
In terms of Motion No. 30, we support this amendment which we are bringing forward. 
The determination of what constitutes an unfair labour practice is left up to the CIRB.  
It would allow for the views and wishes of the majority to be represented.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
We see workers in industry. 
Their rights will not be preserved to the extent they should be.  
It does not create the necessary balance which we want in industry.  
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
That is why this is so important.  
This amendment ensures the wishes of the majority are upheld. 
That is a very important part of the legislation. 
We are putting forward a democratic principle. 
The motion is worthy of the support of the entire House. 
We should give it our due consideration. 
The motion is very important for the workers of Canada. 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
It has now been reintroduced in this parliament with minor changes. 
I do not think very serious changes have been made. 
That is why we see so many of the opposition parties proposing amendments. 
It is very important that we take the bill seriously and try to accomplish something.  
I hope the Liberals will work with us in doing so.  
This is democracy in motion. 
I know Reform finds this very important. 
Quite often we forget that in the daily events of the House.  
There are innocent people out there who are trying to work for the common good. 
They are trying to support their families and their livelihoods. 
We need to allow the democratic process to work. 
I am upset to see that. 
I would hope they would put the interests of workers first.  
We need to do all we can to support it. 
Another major point is something we cannot forget. 
That must be reflected in our labour laws.  
The House is supposed to uphold these types of visions. 
That is what we must work toward.  
Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton, Lib.):
The rules are quite simple. 
It donated the crayons and the prizes for the pages. 
This year's winner is Gaelle Halliday from St. John's, Newfoundland. 
Her creation was a very innovative piece of art. 
All entries were very well done.  
Once again we have a great group of pages to assist us.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Emergency preparedness is about responding to a crisis. 
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood-Assiniboine, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
CMHA also wishes to encourage the public to help by talking to neighbours. 
COMITE QUEBEC-PRINTEMPS 1918 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
RIGHTS OF THE CHILD 
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Canada has long championed the rights of the child. 
We are signatories to the United Nations convention on the rights of the child. 
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):
SPINAL HEALTH CARE WEEK 
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Clearly chiropractic care is an important component of the Canadian health care system.  
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
Thanks to them all.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, tomorrow marks the sixth anniversary of the Westray disaster. 
The Westray tragedy was not an accident and it was not a natural disaster. 
It was profit before people.  
Together they were the driving force behind the Westray inquiry. 
SOCIETE NATIONALE DE L'ACADIE 
Mrs. Claudette Bradshaw (Moncton, Lib.):
I believe it is extremely important that we promote our Acadian heritage. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The member for Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Canada boasts 235 million hectares of commercial forest land. 
QUEBEC CITY CONFERENCES OF 1943 AND 1945 
Is that not using history for political gain?  
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
That is what his fans will say today. 
Super stardom never went to Bobby's head. 
Congratulations on behalf of all Canadians and Edmontonians to Bobby Curtola.  
RESTIGOUCHE RIVER RATS HOCKEY CLUB 
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Last season they finished in last place as an expansion team. 
However, this year they won the maritime junior A hockey championship.  
My hat is off to a job well done.  
Welcome, my friends from Ecole polyvalente Sainte-Therese.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
It had information that could have prevented this tragedy.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
He took them into account when he prepared his report in three full volumes.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
They grossly underestimated the numbers of people infected.  
This Liberal government shirked its responsibility in those days. 
Why is it shirking that responsibility today?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
He made no reference to support coming from the federal government. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, he is misstating completely. 
Mr. Justice Krever took it fully into account. 
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
The facts are clear. 
The federal regulators knew the blood system was contaminated prior to 1986.  
The federal regulators knew that surrogate testing was available. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Let me emphasize the point made by the Deputy Prime Minister. 
Notwithstanding that, this government showed leadership by arranging for compensation- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Okanagan-Coquihalla.  
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
For a solid month now we have been hearing the government denying its liability. 
The Liberals have no problem fingering a government when they were not in power. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
The consensus is clear.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. Deputy Prime Minister.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
And when will he get out of the education sector?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
In fact, we are arranging that meeting for next week.  
We will work toward developing a new consensus among governments. 
Those that have been stated are really very different. 
So it may be difficult to reach a consensus.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Other provinces are waiting for a signal from Ottawa to do the same.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We are now trying to set a date for next week. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
The Krever report says compensate all the hepatitis C victims.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Do you have a contingency plan? 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
He bullied him and tried to intimidate him into not going to those meetings.  
Why did the minister allow that to be done? 
Why will he not let Mr. Beaty be at all of the upcoming talks?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member is quite wrong. 
It does a grave disservice to Mr. Dossetor to suggest such a thing.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, that is certainly not what Mr. Beaty says. 
The health minister knows these talks are about the money. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let us stick to the facts. 
That is the right thing to do. 
It follows on the resolution the House has adopted. 
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Now Quebec has changed its position, and Ontario as well. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Argenteuil-Papineau.  
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
I will be there to make that determination.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
That is like putting Mr. Fox in charge of chicken coop security.  
There should be an open competition for this job. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Meanwhile I would suggest to the hon. member no nomination has been formally offered. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
This is an issue of accountability and openness. 
Will he do it and if not, why not?  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it gets even worse. 
One would think that this House must be democratic.  
CANADIAN INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCY 
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Co-operation.  
Mr. Speaker, we continue to want to help those less fortunate. 
It should be pointed out that CIDA has tried to do more with much less.  
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I will say it again. 
The reports from our programs are excellent.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
This is supposed to be about openness and transparency.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, no name has been offered. 
No name has been offered, so none has been offered in contravention of anything. 
I wonder who would lose in the process.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
I have no idea what he is talking about.  
What we are talking about is the process. 
Why is there not a search committee? 
Why not have the best person for the job? 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is changing his tune. 
He is saying that the system of appointing officers of this House should be changed. 
When did he and his colleagues ever advocate such a change in the past? 
I think people should watch out before they talk from both sides of their mouth.  
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Labour.  
They have been under way since March 1995. 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Canada regards itself as a humanitarian nation. 
It brings into this country in excess of 200,000 people on an annual basis. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
It is an interesting proposal. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Some of the questions he has raised we will be asking as a government. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
When will the government stand up and stop the bleeding of post-secondary education? 
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and Youth), Lib.):
We have gone to extraordinary measures. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and Youth), Lib.):
I think it can be said that the government's commitment is real. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the minister of fisheries. 
The quotas could very well determine the survival of these communities.  
Time is running out. 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the northern shrimp issue is complicated. 
In one area at least, area 6, it is substantially higher.  
It will be a very difficult decision. 
It will probably be made within the next four to ten days. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
We expect that there will be a turn up in some two to three years.  
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Secretary of State (Children and Youth).  
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and Youth), Lib.):
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
It will save lives, and it passed unanimously.  
Last year, however, 122 people died while waiting for a transplant. 
The minister has the opportunity to take the necessary steps. 
People's lives are at stake.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
There are things that can be done by the federal and provincial governments. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
At the present time Canada opposes large scale exports of water. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the minister of fisheries. 
I wonder what the minister has to say about this. 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
This is a particularly important one. 
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour, Lib.):
The Supreme Court of Canada has refused to hear an appeal. 
This is a provincial issue.  
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
We are living and working within those rules.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Acting Prime Minister.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Potentially thousands of jobs could be lost. 
In Regina 33 local branches belong to one of the merger partners. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and Youth), Lib.):
This unfortunately has happened and we are dealing with it. 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The unemployment rate is now at its lowest level in almost seven years.  
All of these jobs have been in the private sector.  
We have eliminated the deficit. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Will the minister publicly denounce these irresponsible comments?  
Mr. Speaker, all I can say- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
If the hon. minister wishes to answer it is totally up to the minister.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
This will bring an end to the question period.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would like to correct that and point out that B.C. has had a- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That is a point of debate, not a point of order.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am wondering if these are irresponsible comments.  
Why will you not allow- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
When it is over it is over.  
We will proceed now to the daily routine of business.

COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Vaughan-King-Aurora, Lib.):
GOODS AND SERVICES TAX 
Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we will be answering Question No. 80. 
In so far as Public Works and Government Services Canada and Transport Canada are concerned: 
(a) The operator, CTMA Traversier Ltee, identified the availability of a used vessel. 
There was no public tendering process. 
(c) The M.V. Madeleine entered into service on July 5, 1997. 
Subsidy levels are expected to remain the same for the foreseeable future.  
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all other questions stand.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Question No. 21 has been on the Order Paper since October 3, 1997. 
Mr. Speaker, I note again Question No. 21. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it agreed that the other questions be allowed to stand?  
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
He is totally out of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I thank the hon. member for Trois-Rivieres for bringing this to my attention.  
Mr. Guy St-Julien:
It is the only time today. 
Nowadays, we speak about replacement workers.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
I am going to concentrate on two of the motions. 
That is rather remarkable since I am a professional mathematician. 
I taught at the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology. 
At the time when I started there was no union there. 
We had no union.  
Instantly a number of things happened. 
Instead of having one boss, we now had two bosses. 
But there are some situations where a union shop just does not fit.  
In our professional capacity there as instructors it did not fit. 
The reason I say this is we were not permitted to exercise our democratic rights. 
It was very frustrating.  
I suppose I was a reformer before Reform was even invented. 
I tried my best to represent our wishes. 
Most of my frustration was with the union. 
It would not listen. 
We had very inequitable treatment. 
We asked formally if we could get out of the union. 
The employer was totally intimated by the union.  
It must be done democratically.  
Over a period of time there were some very interesting developments. 
Instead they had new boards appointed. 
I will not get into a discussion of political patronage appointments at this stage. 
So I will not talk about that.  
We were called on to choose our bargaining agent. 
There were at each of these institutes and colleges a number of instructors and teachers. 
We were called instructors where I worked. 
There were a number of different locations with a large number of people. 
It is quite practical to have a collective agreement in situations like that. 
Having the board of governors come in gave us that window of opportunity to choose. 
I do not hear a voice of protest from any of them as I speak.  
It really was a great window of opportunity and we discussed it. 
They thought it would have greater clout. 
It was decided that we would have a vote. 
I was there to organize it and put it all together. 
We had a great time representing our people. 
This bill before us denies the union members, the workers, that actual choice.  
That is not democratic and is a violation of the very principle of democracy. 
I see my time is up. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
There is not unanimous consent.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the hon. member calling quorum?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
I think the kind of procedural games the government plays is shameful. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
As a point of fact, that is not who denied unanimous consent. 
Let us try to keep the remarks elevated somewhat.  
That is what Bill C-19 at page 14 states.  
They do not have to. 
They can certify the union themselves.  
They have more power in this bill than do ordinary working Canadians. 
That is a disgrace.  
That is called democracy.  
It is simple and it speaks for itself. 
Mr. Jim Utley is vice-president of human resources at Cominco, another major employer. 
We are going to force the 151 to accept what the 43 wanted''. 
That is not democracy. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this has turned into a very spirited debate. 
The idea of a labour code for Canada is not a bad thing.  
I have lived on both sides of that equation. 
I worked for a number of years when our company was not unionized. 
I was there during the unionization vote when the members voted to join the union. 
I was a member of the union even then. 
Eventually I went into full time management. 
I have seen it from all perspectives. 
I would suggest there is a balance here.  
That is a right unions have. 
Balancing that though is also the right of workers to their privacy. 
That should be the choice of the workers. 
They should have the choice. 
By all means they may be very interested in that information. 
Many people have a different view. 
They say ``That is my choice. 
That is their right.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Do workers have the right to organize? 
That is a basic democratic right in a free society. 
We say that is a right and it must be maintained. 
Now we get into the how to make this a balanced and fair procedure.  
It was kind of a strange twist at the time. 
I remember thinking it was so ironic. 
They will do that. 
Organizers have their own way of doing that. 
People voted and they were able to go forward.  
We said we would have to adjust some of our things accordingly. 
I could not understand it, never could and never will. 
That was the workers' choice. 
They made the choice and went ahead.  
The choice is theirs and should be theirs in a secret ballot. 
I either want to join the union or I do not''. 
That is the check and the balance in itself in the secret ballot box.  
We think we can read their minds, we are omniscient. 
I wonder what would happen on the decertification side. 
These are adults making a choice in a free and democratic society. 
It is a simple case. 
It should say that it will not stand for whatever the activity might be. 
You cannot coerce people on this. 
We should also have that choice to join or not to join a union.  
This Reform motion tries to bring that balance into the legislation. 
This balance is not in this legislation. 
The balance we propose under Motion No. 7 brings it back in.  
Mr. Speaker, we do not have a quorum.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The recorded division on Motion No. 6 stands deferred. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):

The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The recorded division on the motion stands deferred.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The recorded division on Motion No. 30 stands deferred.  
We will now proceed to the motions in Group No. 3.  
That Bill C-19, in Clause 45, be amended 
(a) by replacing line 25 on page 35 with the following: 
``tion 24(4) or 34(6), section 37, 50 or 69,'' 
(b) by replacing line 32 on page 35 with the following: 
``subsection 24(4), paragraph'' 
Perhaps we should give the minister and his department that much.  
This is a disincentive to business. 
Some members on the government side have some concern with this part of the act. 
I am anticipating their overwhelming support for my motion.  
There is some merit to the aspect of preboarding screening. 
We all feel a lot better about that because we use those services so often.  
I am very concerned because of what might happen through orders in council. 
I would ask them to consider very carefully this aspect of the bill.  
In Alberta there are short line railways. 
I encourage members to vote in favour of this most sensible amendment.  
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour, Lib.):
I urge members to not support those motions.  
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
This is the policy that is codified in law.  
This is what the Reform Party wants to lay open to question again.  
They challenge them instead of recognizing them.  
The working conditions of the honest worker are at stake. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I am quite interested in these clauses. 
There are recent horrifying examples that have worked out to the detriment of workers. 
It is the union's job to achieve economic and social justice.  
It is cause for concern. 
It is not even that far under the surface. 
It is sometimes quite overt. 
Right to work is the sad state of affairs in 21 of the United States. 
In fact, copies were delivered to my office.  
There is nothing wrong with fair wages. 
Fair wages benefit the whole community. 
I think there is an underlying objective here. 
I can point out one case certainly. 
How democratic is that?  
Are those members not satisfied that people have voted once? 
They talk about democracy. 
That is nothing short of sleazy. 
It is an abuse of power.  
But that is not what they mean. 
It is a much bigger package than that.  
Have they talked to the UGG? 
Have they talked to the pool elevator operators? 
It is good for Canadian working people and it will create balance.  
They were talking about the guy from Papua, New Guinea. 
It is completely absurd.  
They want unions out of the way. 
They do not recognize the legitimacy of unions.  
Labour is a legitimate practitioner in the community. 
Labour is seen to have a valid opinion and is consulted.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
I am going to talk about the amendments in Group No. 3.  
You have some support on the other side there, Werner.  
That is very good and I commend government members for it. 
There are a lot of things at the heart of this issue.  
If we look at the bill we see that the connecting word is ``or''. 
Then it says ``or''. 
But after that we find the word ``or'' and it states: 
That is at the heart of this issue. 
That is precisely what contract negotiations are all about. 
All of those are written into the contract to take away that ambiguity.  
The employee is employed by the minister. 
We want to know what it will cost us.  
We want to know how much an employment contract will cost. 
Then we can plan our budgets properly. 
Then we would have a contradiction and a major conflict.  
This is the number one purpose of the bill: 
That is the underlying principle which is supposed to be governing this legislation. 
Who would not agree with that kind of statement? 
It is amazing the way in which Liberals can twist logic.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC) moved: 
The issue I have brought forward is not a terribly romantic one. 
The agricultural industry is a huge industrial sector in Canada. 
Now our transportation systems have changed quite dramatically over those years. 
We now have dramatic changes in air travel. 
Rural infrastructure is deteriorating as we speak. 
The rural infrastructure is in peril. 
There is no federal money going into the national highways program. 
The provinces spend their money. 
They have done it with provincial dollars and without federal dollars. 
Thus they do not have any provincial dollars to put into secondary roads. 
That downloading has caused severe problems.  
It lies with the federal government to put in place a national highways program.  
This does not take a rocket scientist to understand.  
What about the equalization funds?  
The equalization payments have already been cut. 
There are some alternatives. 
The economy that is developed and generated from rural Canada is immense. 
We must further develop that infrastructure. 
I do have an opportunity to wrap up in the last five minutes. 
I will be more than happy to do that.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Clearly none of these options is acceptable.  
It is simply bad policy.  
In an era of limited resources government must be focused. 
We will also balance the budget this year and next year. 
Improving Canadian health care is one of the government's core priorities. 
We saw the unemployment numbers just the other day.  
Governments have to make choices. 
That is why I urge all members to reject the motion before the House. 
It is bad policy. 
It is a policy that does not reflect Canadian priorities.  
We see the fruits of our labour. 
To do what the hon. member is asking we would have to raise taxes. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
There is always money for folks like them. 
Then there would be no argument here today.  
In fact he is hardly clear on any concept.  
Another 24,400 kilometres are part of the designated national highway system.  
It was a stick with which to beat the Canadian people.  
We are not using the excise tax for that purpose any longer. 
With partners like we have in the federal government there is just no hope.  
Now we are paying for it ourselves.  
The highways and municipal roads are falling apart. 
It is in the Maple Creek area. 
They are everywhere and this government will not pony up to its responsibilities.  
We have a federal government that shirks its responsibility.  
I think it makes eminent sense. 
This is happening right now. 
As a Reformer of course I cannot avoid talking about costs. 
The hon. parliamentary secretary alluded to it. 
But if we do not look after our roads they disintegrate.  
What is the old saying, a stitch in time saves nine. 
The Trans-Canada Highway is old by highway standards. 
It has to be fixed. 
It is about time they started to live up to their responsibilities.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Unfortunately, it is like knocking at the wrong door. 
The situation is the same in the case of the rural road system. 
Now, we are having to repair the road in question.  
I think we have to put things in perspective. 
The jurisdiction is provincial and the responsibility, municipal. 
This might be an approach. 
So, there is perhaps another approach to be considered. 
In the end, it is always the same consumer who pays. 
It lacks the efficiency for this. 
The local government knows what is required. 
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or, NDP):
Rural Canada produces almost half our exports. 
Our world trade surplus in 1995 was $73 billion, a staggering success.  
The economic output of rural Canada accounts for close to one fifth of the GDP. 
It is not all fresh air and lemonade. 
It is clear to all that rural Canada remains neglected. 
There we have it, a crisis in the midst of our economic engine.  
It is simply called the strategic economic network. 
The rural transportation system is out of balance. 
That takes a toll on the road network. 
Not all the problems are economic. 
Poor maintenance can result in conditions that make driving dangerous.  
Most rural roads are not double lane or twinned highways. 
They will have to continue to face more dangerous driving conditions. 
The first thing to recognize is that in Canada roads are a provincial responsibility. 
However the federal government has a tradition of contributing to road building. 
An inadequate infrastructure hampers our ability to compete. 
It is as simple as that. 
I do not see how this benefits rural Canada whatsoever. 
My hon. colleague is to be congratulated for his concern. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this is a perfect example of the importance of Private Members' Business. 
Some of the best ideas that have come to parliament have been through private members. 
This is absolutely one of the best examples of that.  
$1.11 goes to income tax. 
If the government cannot live with that it is really shameful.  
I urge all members to support this bill. 
It is a very wise and important bill and a very necessary bill.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I will try to sum this up as quickly as possible.  
What I am suggesting, however, is a plan. 
It may well mean $350 million a year over a 10 year period. 
I am not getting into provincial jurisdiction. 
It is not that difficult a concept.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House adjourned at 2.28 p.m.)
