EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 55 
Monday, February 9, 1998 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC) moved: 
Unfortunately the motion was deemed non-votable. 
I put forward Motion 225: 
The timing is very important. 
In October I put forward this motion to committee. 
There are still some issues and some problems with that. 
It has been a long time coming. 
The unfortunate part of this is it is about two years too late. 
I also understand how we might tackle the problem. 
This is not helping the situation.  
Canada exports approximately $18 billion to $20 billion worth of food products every year. 
These are conservative estimates.  
He has declined to do so. 
I am not suggesting any changes in policy. 
The committee process is vital to our role as parliamentarians. 
If anything, I hope this exercise is not a waste of time. 
I have a number of concerns. 
One is that of rail abandonment. 
There is no finger pointing. 
It is going to take political will to make the system change. 
Right now the Canadian Wheat Board controls the allocation of cars. 
However he has no control of that product. 
I also have a concern about the delay in Justice Estey's report. 
There is one other issue that I have a real serious concern with. 
It is the CTA hearing itself. 
I am sure the hon. member's views are shared by all hon. members.  
Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
I would like to go back a bit. 
Let us get all the issues on the table''.  
Justice Estey will be conducting the review in two phases. 
Work in this phase of the review is already under way. 
Justice Estey has eagerly begun to perform his duties. 
The system has responded well to the challenge by the minister. 
This review is only the start of that process. 
The Minister of Transport took great care in the selection of Justice Willard Estey. 
I appreciate that the hon. member brought forward his particular motion. 
However, we now have a review process that is independent of the political process.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
It is a disease called terminalization. 
At that time I said that the inquiry would never take place. 
It moved on until July. 
I want people in this House to think for one moment. 
I have a constituency right now where there is an oil boom. 
Still the majority of people are dependent on agriculture for a living.  
Those people are out of business. 
I want to inform the minister and members of this House what has happened. 
That is what is existing at the present time.  
It is a zero plus for any western farmer today. 
That is what has happened.  
The grain companies have decided where they are going to put the various terminals. 
Even the producer will not have an option as to who buys the grain.  
Talk about living under a regime. 
They have developed a very serious thing in the prairies.  
I would like to provide information which I think is very important. 
What is the hurry? 
They are in top shape. 
It is reaching the point where it is case closed. 
There is no place for them to haul.  
Short lines are out. 
Most of the branch lines are at risk in Saskatchewan. 
There is no free market. 
I believe every word of all those reports. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
We must try to find workable solutions.  
The government has seen fit to take some action. 
We welcome Mr. Estey's appointment in this effort. 
He was wise enough not to accept their recommendations. 
Farmers grow grain and they have to move it to market. 
We are not talking about hypothetical situations. 
I refer to the line that includes Eston and Elrose. 
He will know about the Elrose area, Dinsmore, Beechy and Estonia.  
This is not an answer Saskatchewan will accept.  
There is no sound reason for CN to reject it.  
It is a real scorched earth policy.  
That is the real problem. 
That is a very significant concern. 
It is something the government could and should move on immediately.  
This is not the only cost to individual farmers. 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to address this issue. 
It is also important in many other communities across Canada.  
The system is very complex and involves a number of different stakeholders.  
Farmers truck their grain an average of 15 miles. 
There are four main reasons for reforming grain transportation policies.  
There were five components to western grain transportation reform.  
We are indeed implementing effective reforms.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
We will go our own way''.  
MINISTER RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD-SPEAKER'S RULING 
I want to thank all hon. members who spoke to this issue. 
CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ACT 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The hon. member is quite correct. 
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
I have always appreciated them. 
On the class action suit these farmers said that Parliament should deal with it. 
This amounts to about $358,000 that has been deducted. 
What do I do to get this issue resolved properly?  
How do I handle that?  
The government failed to file a defence.  
How do we deal with a bill that is actually in contempt of court? 
The government has not filed a defence but is still prosecuting farmers.  
I would like Mr. Speaker's learned wisdom on how to deal with this.  
The Chair is not to be involved in a legal dispute. 
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your advice. 
I knew you could give me some learned experience on that. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I wish to seek unanimous consent for the two following motions. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
(3) No dilatory motions or quorum calls shall be received; 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, perhaps a bit of further clarification. 
The hon. member said consultation had been undertaken. 
A meeting of House leaders was held approximately an hour ago.  
There is no agreement. 
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
I think that is the number one question in western Canada. 
The minister does not listen. 
That is one question I have not been able to answer. 
We wonder why the minister is not listening. 
To me that is not listening, it is dictating. 
There were 600 people at the meeting in Weyburn. 
He said that he supported that type of meeting.  
They used to call this area the red square. 
This gives us an idea of how much attention he is paying to this issue.  
This is what the minister did.  
He also has some interest in some land there. 
They kept jacking up the forfeitures. 
This is how the minister is treating these western farmers. 
It is a sign that democracy in Ottawa just is not working. 
That is what this bill is about. 
It is exactly the opposite.  
That is the way this whole government is going.  
It surprises me when I look at some of the western provinces. 
This is something they have the right to enjoy. 
Democracy works in this fashion. 
Democracy works from the bottom up. 
Democracy works when the elected parliamentarians listen to the people. 
Dictatorship is the reverse. 
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
However, the federal government does have substantial interests at stake.  
It will continue to provide the Canadian Wheat Board with substantial financial guarantees. 
That is taxpayers' money. 
It will guarantee the initial payments. 
It will guarantee sales made under the credit grain sales program. 
Regulations can be updated and changed to meet current circumstances with much greater ease.  
One of the questions that was most frequently asked was:
Will the Canadian Wheat Board become more accountable to farmers? 
The answer is yes. 
There will be 15 directors in total.  
They will be expected to demonstrate accountability to producers. 
Another question which was frequently posed was:
Here again the answer is yes. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Maybe they have a point.  
Look at the representation from the areas that produce this bill. 
These are the people who should be listened to. 
The wheat board is entirely responsible to the Government of Canada and not the producer. 
That is what the decision has been.  
It is the Ottawa wheat board. 
It is legislated here. 
The court decisions have said that it is responsible only to the government.  
Then we have the board appointments. 
Again, it is the Ottawa wheat board. 
The board makes the appointments from here. 
Who makes that decision? 
Again, it is made in Ottawa. 
It has nothing to do with the producer in any way.  
Let me give an example. 
No place else grows better durum than right there. 
The better the durum, the better the pasta.  
The previous wheat board says get everything out of the west. 
Let us reap the advantages.  
We do not want to destroy grain marketing. 
It would not be a viable operation.  
Here is a group of farmers growing organic grain. 
All the people of Canada should listen to this. 
This whole thing is antiquated. 
It is completely out of date. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
It was intended to be finished and be law before Christmas. 
However, because there were so many other pressing matters before the House it was delayed.  
This debate has been before the country for a long time. 
I submit that is not the case. 
Whom is he representing? 
I am making a major point in the whole issue. 
They have told me in no uncertain terms about it. 
I went beyond that. 
I asked them about some amendments that have been proposed. 
I put forth amendments that can be put into three simple categories. 
I asked farmers about those amendments, what they thought.  
I am telling the minister publicly what the people of Saskatchewan are saying. 
The present aim of the wheat board is out of date. 
Farmers do not want that. 
Does that not seem reasonable?  
Do you know, Mr. Speaker, the percentage of farmers who support that amendment? 
It is between 96% and 97%. 
Let us do something about an undemocratic institution.  
Why does he not listen to the amendments that have been put forward?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
The debate is about choice but the minister is not listening.  
The minister has brought it back and has made it even worse. 
He wants to put new crops under the Canadian Wheat Board.  
If that is the best the government can do, it is a total failure. 
They want a choice in how they market their grain. 
That choice is not available. 
It takes away my ability to do my job.  
The Sask Pool seems to be bailing out. 
It is jumping ship, realizing that things are changing.  
They were chanting ``Goodale must go''. 
These people support orderly marketing. 
They see changes that are not acceptable. 
Who asked for the legislation? 
This is all about accountability. 
Russia used to have state trading enterprises. 
We have seen what planned economies did over there. 
Why was that done? 
Indeed that is what is needed. 
People had puzzled looks on their faces. 
What kind of a responsible minister is that? 
I suggest the minister will be the death knell for the Canadian Wheat Board. 
Western Canadian farmers respect each other's abilities and responsibilities. 
There are those who want to market their own grain, which I support 100%. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
That is what farmers are almost unanimously requesting on the prairies. 
There is only a halfway elected board being proposed by the minister.  
I do not know of any other organization that operates under those parameters.  
Farmers are not made that way.  
This is a little personal anecdote. 
The key speaker was Lorne Hehn, the chief commissioner of the board.  
So much for the results of the minister's vaunted consultation with producers. 
Replies are still trickling in. 
It just does not make any sense. 
He can only be a captive of ministerial discretion.  
I would like to jump to No. 18 on this list of proposed amendments. 
That is a rather absurd way to operate a business enterprise.  
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
They also believe that options must be made available to the producer.  
The Canadian Wheat Board must be made more accountable to the Access to Information Act. 
The wheat board should be audited by the auditor general. 
Former speakers have alluded to that aspect.  
Agriculture is the backbone of the economy in Dauphin-Swan River. 
The meeting concerned the Canadian Wheat Board and grain transportation. 
The mileage distance has not changed. 
It still has a storage capacity of five million bushels. 
The town of Churchill depends on the port for economic survival. 
They told me about the impact of the port. 
The rail line brings tourism. 
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
The Canadian Wheat Board is of great significance in my constituency. 
The wheat board and this government somewhere along the line have lost touch. 
We are almost at an impasse. 
Producers want a fully elected board. 
The outstanding amount owed is equal to $1000 for every average family in Canada.  
Instead it insists on appointing the key members of the board. 
Once again, the issue of democracy should supersede sweeping ministerial powers.  
To reach any other conclusion is insulting to producers.  
This is an issue of respect and fairness. 
The importance of Motion No. 16 cannot be ignored. 
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
It is an added input cost. 
What does a farmer yield? 
About 20 to 25 bushels an acre. 
They need a significant return on their investment. 
The uncertainties should be the weather and infestations of pests and things of that nature. 
How does he market his crops when the Canadian Wheat Board is not involved? 
He spends his entire winter getting into the markets in Chicago and Winnipeg. 
That is the way he manages his risks.  
Who knows what a wheat board which takes no risk is doing? 
What is a basis cost? 
It is the transportation cost after delivery. 
That does not make sense to Mr. Torkelson.  
What else can he do outside the Canadian Wheat Board? 
He can lock a price in with a broker from Winnipeg or Chicago independently. 
There is a risk involved, but it is the owner's risk. 
He takes the chance. 
He already took a risk putting the crop in the ground. 
He is taking a risk selling it. 
It is his land, his machinery, his crop, his choice, his risk. 
However, as it is, he opts out.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
We are just north of Winnipeg. 
Here again we are talking dollars in the pocketbook.  
It went to the United States and the Canadian milling industry. 
Why does anyone suppose that is where it went?  
They do not want to be part of the Canadian Wheat Board. 
They do not want to be a director. 
Why do we have the wheat board that we have today? 
We end up with these massive legal arguments. 
That is what should be dealt with here today. 
It is that very profit making incentive.  
That is the kind of elections we would like to see.  
That is one of the big concerns of the farmers in western Canada. 
Decisions are not made purely on a commercial basis.  
I spoke to this very issue when I was travelling around my constituency. 
A lot of them want to have this marketing board. 
The elections will go ahead. 
It will not survive more than a few years if they go through.  
There would be no in-fighting.  
I appreciate the opportunity to talk on this topic today. 
It has a lot to do with the profits we will make in the west. 
Please, give us a break.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
I listened carefully to the member from the Reform Party, a member from my province. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am looking forward to his remarks in that regard.  
I am glad that you have ruled it is not.  
What is the response of the Reform Party in both cases? 
That is a history lesson. 
Oh, no, the Reform Party is bothered again. 
One of its members is up on another point of order.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I beg that the Chair rule on the relevance of this. 
The member is not relevant. 
He is saying things that are totally inappropriate and off topic.  
We have heard some yelping on the part of the Reform Party. 
What happens to this principle when it comes to farmers? 
This principle seems to have gone out the window altogether. 
Perhaps somebody could explain that when they get up next.  
We have to be careful what we ask for. 
Now they have it and they cannot stand it. 
It is their own fault.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
It is interesting to hear my friend from Winnipeg speak. 
The more things change, the more they remain the same.  
You had better stick to the amendment.  
My friend says that I had better stick to the amendment. 
I certainly will, unlike him.  
My friend raised one issue that is addressed in the amendment. 
We want to ensure they all have a vote. 
Why does the NDP insist on attacking family farms? 
What do NDPers have against family farms?  
Do they not believe in allowing farmers to control their very own institutions? 
It makes tremendous sense to me. 
Not only does the NDP not want that but the government does not want that.  
I come from a part of the country where we embrace free enterprise principles. 
People there believe in the free market. 
We want the choice. 
A few minutes ago somebody spoke of the wheat board as a co-operative. 
It is not a co-operative as it stands now. 
To me that is absolutely ridiculous. 
Let us allow people to be a part of it if they so choose.  
People in the west are upset about it.  
I cannot believe it. 
I am someone who comes from the west. 
Farmers and everybody else are expected to live up to a different standard. 
We have seen that over and over again.  
The government displays unusual effrontery this time. 
It is the one that raises the issue. 
I urge members to support Motion No. 16 in Group No. 4. 
They will not tolerate any half measures. 
They want to see sweeping change. 
They want to see a voluntary Canadian Wheat Board. 
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood-Assiniboine, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Canada is seeing gold, Olympic gold.  
Good luck Team Canada, your country is behind you.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
The Minister for International Trade says this is true. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
I urge the government to start looking for such a plan.  
THE LATE MARK MACGUIGAN 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, February is heart awareness month. 
We are making great progress in fighting cardiovascular disease. 
Strokes and heart disease are caused by our lifestyle.  
By mobilizing society as a whole, we can enhance- 
The hon. member for Nanaimo-Alberni.  
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
Now is the time to end this senator's siesta. 
Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):
I urge young Canadians to take part in the Canada Train project.  
The initiatives of these young people are a reminder to all of us- 
The hon. member for Laval East.  
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
Only the provinces are in a position to use this money- 
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member. 
The member for Ottawa West-Nepean has the floor.  
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
This does not mean that the farm will be frozen in time. 
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Investment is the lifeblood of economic development. 
Investment leads to trade and trade leads to jobs for Canadians.  
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
We must make it clear. 
Well, we are ready and waiting for him. 
Go right ahead, Mr. Bouchard. 
The people in the affected areas are ready and waiting for you. 
But take care, because sometimes shots like that backfire.  
Mr. John Maloney (Erie-Lincoln, Lib.):
It is long overdue.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
But we still have some serious questions for our Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we are possibly on the eve of a war. 
The leaders of the nations of the world are taking positions. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister still has not given us an answer to the question. 
We have been asking it now for two weeks.  
We know all of these positions.  
The Canadian people want to know what the Prime Minister's position is. 
Why will the Prime Minister not tell us? 
Is he for military action or is he against it?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
That is a very good position.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
That is what we are asking for. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I just stated a very clear position. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is what I hope. 
Everyone is hoping for a diplomatic solution.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
At that time he expressed the need for a diplomatic solution. 
The Prime Minister has said exactly the same thing. 
At some point you have to be able to say that- 
The hon. member for Beauharnois-Salaberry.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are in constant contact with all the countries involved. 
That is the most important consultation. 
We would like to have the co-operation of the opposition in doing that.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, our position is clear. 
If Ms. Albright indicated that I said yes, it is misinformation. 
I want your views.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Even General Norman Schwarzkopf says bombing will not work. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We are doing everything we can. 
We are getting ready to do the ``or else''. 
When the times comes we must be ready to do that.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Also, we should not make any references to who is or who is not here.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Will he at least inform us of that today?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
What is the hon. member complaining about? 
We want to have a debate but he does not want it. 
Last week he asked for a debate. 
I asked for a debate tonight and he does not want one. 
He should make up his mind. 
He is as confused as ever.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
My question is when will the finance minister fulfil his end of the contract? 
When will he eliminate the 3% and 5% surtax?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
What the Reform Party seeks to do is to break the social contract.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
My question is for the Prime Minister:
It is a company that clearly has the ability to raise money itself. 
The hon. member for Temiscamingue has the floor.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
This does not make sense.  
That is where we really come up $12 billion short.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
She said she did not know.  
I am having a little trouble with the question. 
I will rule the question in order, but it is quite borderline. 
I will permit the hon. minister to answer.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Finance. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
This is a malicious act on the part of the Minister of Finance.  
I have a supplementary. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Everyone knew he owned Canada Steamship Lines.  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is an ongoing RCMP investigation.  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Will the government pay for Bruce Starlight's legal fees?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
TRANSFER PAYMENTS TO PROVINCES 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
My answer is the same.  
All formulae contain an exemption for economic downturns and catastrophes. 
This is not our intention. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question.  
The report is the result of the working group study. 
The hon. member for Delta-South Richmond.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
Judge Thomas was not making it up as he went along. 
He was guided by recent decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
Does he not understand that without the support of the courts chaos will reign?  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's question is based on a very curious premise.  
He states that the courts prosecute. 
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Does the minister not know that this is not true? 
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
The Bloc Party was on side. 
The only party that said cut and run was the NDP. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
The minister referred to the WTO on Friday. 
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what we have been advocating.  
The hon. member's party is against the bilateral route. 
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
I would like to ask a question of the Minister of Foreign Affairs.

Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
When did she call in members of the RCMP? 
What exactly are they investigating? 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, obviously the opposition prefers to deal in innuendo and allegations. 
Let me just get the facts on the table again for the House.  
IMMIGRATION AND REFUGEE BOARD 
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member for Longueuil does not have accurate information.

Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
This is a very important issue of equity.  
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
We are demanding the minister release these reports now. 
When do we get them?  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
The information he is requesting has been made available.  
TRANS-QUEBEC AND MARITIMES GAS PIPELINE 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
The bulk of Canadian spinoffs from this project were related to this contract.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this act keeps getting worse on the far end. 
Nothing less is good enough.  
Colleagues, that would bring to a close our question period for today.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
I refer to the annotated Standing Orders which state: 
I refer the member to 409(7).  
THE LATE CHARLES BEVERLEY KOESTER 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
I wish to say a few words of tribute to him.  
In both capacities I was able to appreciate his sagacity and his foresightedness. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I stand in the House today to pay tribute to Charles Beverley Koester.  
In 1980, Dr. Koester moved to Ottawa to become Clerk of the House of Commons.  
He served the Speakers and members of this House with dedication and wisdom.  
I am sure Bev Koester will be sorrowfully missed.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
He was to remain in naval service until 1960.  
Over that period, he was to serve under seven Speakers of the House of Commons.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
I certainly remember the days when Mr. Koester sat at the table as Clerk. 
He swore me in a couple of times. 
He served this House well. 
He will be missed. 
My NDP colleagues and I extend our sincere condolences to his family.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Dr. Koester's service to this House is well known. 
He wrote a biography of the Conservative MP Nicholas Flood Davin. 
Parliament has lost a friend and the country a great man.  
I found that Bev Koester was unfailingly a professional. 
That he was a scholar goes without saying. 
He was highly respected in the Commonwealth.

Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
I would like to get some clarification from the parliamentary secretary about this delay. 
The matter was very serious. 
I am seeking clarification on this urgent issue. 
We need the information.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Shall the remaining questions stand?  
CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ACT 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Bill C-4 ignores too many farmers in this country. 
This is one quote. 
That's enough to promote entrepreneurship. 
No one can do that because no one can afford to do that. 
This is a quote from the Globe and Mail . 
What does the Globe know? 
It is a Toronto paper so let us pretend it does not exist.  
How about an Edmonton paper? 
It is talking about the case of Clay Desrochers who is 24 years old. 
Imagine a farmer who grows something. 
Imagine, a farmer buys a piece of land with his own money. 
He takes the risk. 
He plants the seeds and takes all the risks. 
He does all the work. 
He harvests that wheat and what happens? 
He does not have the right to do as he sees fit with that wheat. 
That wheat is under the control of the Canadian Wheat Board.  
Here is another article from the prairies again. 
It does not do that. 
Imagine if we had a board for the lawyers. 
I am not talking about the Canadian Bar Association. 
I am talking about a board that all lawyers must belong to, the lawyers board. 
It is kind of like the minister of silly walks.  
They cannot take on clients from around the world or from anywhere. 
How many people think that would be a good idea? 
He was quite an innovative farmer and risk taker. 
He was going into unchartered territory by growing wheat in the Fraser Valley. 
He left my riding and he moved to McBride. 
You cannot do that. 
So he would only go to McBride. 
That is what these amendments would do. 
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
I learn a lot from them.  
I think that last part is very important. 
It is an insult to farmers. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, thank you for the reminder. 
We have this hybrid kind of board. 
I have been on the record before as calling it that. 
I understand the obstinacy and the stubbornness of the minister responsible for the wheat board. 
It is akin to the stubbornness of a mule. 
Appointed board members from time to time came up for reappointment. 
They were put in their positions by the provincial government. 
In that case it was the provincial government. 
These appointed members will also have those concerns. 
As we say, he who pays the piper calls the tune.  
Of course, I am pushing. 
Reformers want a fully elected wheat board.  
We need a fully elected wheat board.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
There are 48 motions of amendment. 
Members need to be relevant to that group. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we certainly appreciate your wise intervention.  
It is unfortunate that the government has continued to ignore those.  
I would like to begin with something very important. 
No. They in fact have done a lot better. 
Their production has gone up. 
Their ability to invest within their industry has improved. 
The last I checked this was supposed to be a democracy. 
A democracy does not run when the minister controls the wheat board. 
Anything short of that would not be a democracy.  
They are motions that will help our farmers be more effective. 
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Would the hon. member for Malpeque be kind enough to repeat his point of order?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
What is there to fear about having the president of the Canadian Wheat Board elected? 
What is wrong with that?  
They provide the new wealth on which the government taxes so exorbitantly every year. 
Then those in agriculture would be accountable and responsible. 
It really does not care. 
They are looking for security, as I think everyone is.  
Why would they want a greater return? 
It is so simple. 
I have not talked to anyone who is against the election of the board. 
That has formed part of the common ground that could bring the both sides together.  
Transparency is another issue. 
That is what they are seeking. 
There are areas of common ground that we could be moving on. 
Is there a subsidy? 
What will the international tribunal have to say if there is a challenge there? 
Many of the motions in Group No. 4 would lend themselves to striking that balance.  
What is the wheat board afraid of? 
Farmers always take it in the neck. 
I was talking to representatives of the two railroads. 
The farmers pay for that.  
I had a farmer say to me ``What is wrong with the picture? 
The cleanings are sold and I receive no benefit''.  
There is much wrong with that picture. 
It does not strike the balance. 
I feel there is a balance that we need within those amendments.  
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
He was very well respected among all political parties in my riding, Mr. Jack Frazer. 
That brings me to the Group No. 4 amendments we are talking about today. 
These amendments could apply to all government ministries. 
That is what we are talking about. 
The government is proposing what it wants to call a mixed enterprise. 
I am involved with the fisheries committee. 
Here is what the Liberals are suggesting. 
We are to have an elected board. 
Lo and behold, what is their definition of democracy? 
More important, who are they appointing to this board and in what positions? 
This is what I find absolutely appalling. 
They are to appoint a president and a CEO to the wheat board.  
The government is doing nothing. 
It is still a dictatorship. 
There is no democracy. 
That is what I find so frustrating.  
This institution, this House, represents democracy. 
I am here because I believe in democracy. 
We see troubles all over the world. 
What the government is suggesting is an absolute dictatorship and nothing less. 
It is going to appoint five members and the president and CEO to this board. 
It is going to have control of this organization. 
What we have is a dictatorship.  
I would like this House to recognize what is going on. 
The last four speakers have been from one political party. 
Out of this entire democracy, this whole House, who is standing up on their behalf? 
I do not hear anybody from the NDP. 
I do not hear anybody from the Tories, the Liberals or the Bloc. 
This is a major bill affecting Canada. 
The next part is about ethics.  
The hon. member for Prince George-Peace River has put forward this motion. 
He is trying to incorporate what the government has been pushing for.  
We have our hands in that one. 
Imagine if we had to have those guys live by the code. 
We saw all about ethics in question period today. 
I will not go there, I would be here all afternoon.  
When it comes to ethics, the government is out the window, it has no idea. 
That would be terrible, some of our people are there. 
They would never be able to abide by those rules.  
It is about democracy and it is about ethics. 
It is about a board that is going to affect the prairie provinces. 
These people are left with a dictatorship. 
There have been recommendations to have it run like a corporation. 
The government is totally ignoring that. 
The big points are democracy and ethics. 
I will come back later and speak on the other groups and motions.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
However, the government in its great wisdom has decided to keep five positions for itself. 
It is Motion No. 6. 
What exactly does this mean?  
Obviously, they control it. 
Right now, they run it. 
I respect their right to do so. 
He was appointed ambassador to Israel.  
This is known as a tactic to liberate ridings. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The member for Bourassa on a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
With respect, this group of amendments has to do with appointments to the board. 
The hon. member for Frontenac-Megantic is relevant.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien:
This House is no circus.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The member for Bourassa on another point of order.  
I think the hon. member- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien:
You seem to be nodding your approval, and I thank you.  
He will then have two hefty pensions.  
In closing, I wish to raise a final point. 
I do not know what is going on. 
I am asking you the question, Mr. Speaker. 
They do not seem to go together. 
We have a good Minister of Agriculture, who does the very best he can. 
Why not give him all the tools he needs? 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
I understand they are extremely delectable.  
Farmers are among our most productive people. 
They are also among our most reliable people. 
These are the people who understand ethics probably better than anyone else. 
These people are humble people. 
This is a very significant part of our agricultural community.  
It must be based on sound governance and principles of sound governance. 
It must be based on principles of sound management. 
Let us examine each of these principles in turn.  
First, is the board operating in the interests of farmers? 
A fair return for the product they produce is what the farmers want. 
They do not want an exorbitant high price. 
They do not want a diminished price that is excessively low. 
They want that to be the case within Canada and internationally.  
They want something else. 
It outlines cash flow for the initial year. 
That is what the farmers are looking for. 
It is a lot more difficult to do that in the farming community. 
Nevertheless that is in the interests of the farmers. 
That is the first principle which needs to be observed by this board.  
The second principle is one of sound governance. 
The primary issue is that of democracy. 
That is not the case with the wheat board.  
For some reason or other the governing structure here is one of appointment. 
I believe he has a very sound statement to make.  
If nothing else, we should think about that.  
I do not think the board acts in the interests of the farmers. 
The third principle relates to the application of governance. 
This has to do with looking at the policies and the principles that are involved. 
All those things need to be there.  
Wheat board policies must guide the action very clearly. 
We also need to recognize that there need to be clear lines of responsibility. 
There is no clear line of responsibility.  
We are not having anything to do with it''.  
To whom is the CEO responsible? 
In this case it is to the minister.  
In effect, they have no power. 
All the power rests with the minister in the final analysis.  
He has a divided personality.  
He will not know what he is. 
That is a critical point.  
What about if disciplinary action has to be taken? 
Will the board do it or will the minister do it? 
These things are not clear.  
What about the release of information? 
What kind of information will be released by the board to the farmers? 
What information will be released by the minister to the board? 
These are some of the things which are wrong with this bill.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I have made one observation and I would like to offer this as a suggestion. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That is certainly not a point of order.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
I wish to make it very clear that is not the case. 
New Democrats have always been supportive of farmers. 
We are proud to stand and fight for farmers.  
They should be elections by and for farmers. 
We do not want vested corporate interests interfering. 
We see too much of vested corporate interests nowadays. 
Fair elections mean one producer, one vote. 
We say that is anti-democratic and we want no part of it.  
Wealth dominates too many things today. 
We want to see fair elections and spending limits.  
That is very important today.  
It is a very big industry. 
Certain corporate interests would just love to get their hands on it. 
So we talk about democracy. 
Again, democracy is where the majority rules.  
The coalition is a soulmate to the Reform Party. 
Again, we come back to the question of fairness. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
I am not delighted at all. 
I am very upset about this legislation. 
It is strictly farmers in the west. 
The fact is there is a lot of very serious opposition to this bill. 
Sure, what was the question. 
It was a rigged question just like that question in Quebec was. 
Monopolies basically stifle any good performance. 
Farmers in the west have been dumped on. 
I suppose this is a question of unity. 
They are getting to a point where they want to revolt. 
It is just like these guys are doing right now. 
They are sitting over there, disrespectful. 
Look at that potato farmer from Prince Edward Island. 
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The member referred to me as a potato farmer. 
I am not a potato farmer. 
I do not like my name being taken in vain by this member.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member does make a valid point. 
What is annoying is that they will. 
What we have here is a very basic freedom. 
I have a despicable story to tell. 
Meanwhile he has his granaries full of grain. 
We will but we are not there yet. 
Very frankly, as long as they have the majority it is in their hands. 
Very often we have these farmers getting together with different associations. 
There is a farmer in my riding who specializes in selling seed grain. 
Seed grain, specifically, does not come under the wheat board. 
It is not for the general market. 
They confiscated his truck at the border.  
I can see where the farmers out west can be upset. 
That has to change. 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Twice now I have been accused of being gutless. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I apologize. 
I guess all I would say is I challenge them to prove me wrong.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
The minister responsible for the wheat board would have that authority. 
Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Fanshawe, Lib.):
On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It is a fact of life.  
On a point of order, the hon. member for Yorkton-Melville.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We are in debate.  
We do not have second reading on this bill. 
If some of the debate seems to be somewhat extraneous- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
You are casting aspersions.  
It is not casting aspersions; it is a simple fact. 
I think that has great relevance to the discussion today. 
We are talking about an elected board, elected by the farmers. 
That is the way it should be.  
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
The hon. member for Prince George-Peace River, on a point of order.  
That seems to have been the pattern.  
I am sure the hon. member for Bourassa will proceed accordingly.  
One thing that is certain, I think that the former producer of- 
The ``Rocky Horror Picture Show'' might have a sequel after all. 
We have heard about that place because it is a horror show.  
We have just been given a definition of what the Western bloc is. 
That gang is no better than the Bloc Quebecois. 
Good for nothing but creating a diversion.  
Now to get down to business. 
The people of Bourassa understand the significance of Bill C-4. 
They have understood the importance of democracy. 
They have understood the significance of transparency. 
Is that not democracy with a capital D ?  
Now they are back whining again. 
There should not even be any talk of an amendment. 
Bill C-4 should receive unanimous approval.  
We decided to take a stand for farmers. 
They decided to take a stand for certain obscure lobbies I have never heard of. 
When they do not have much to say, they hurl insults. 
They have taken a stand on behalf of the lobbies. 
Ladies and gentlemen listening today, it is truly pathetic. 
The record has been set straight. 
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
I am a third generation grain farmer. 
It is a matter of legitimacy when we speak. 
I do not understand these members.  
The hon. member for Bourassa on a point of order.  
Mr. Speaker, I will never allow my legitimacy to be called into question. 
We have a valid concern and a valid point to make on behalf of producers. 
On Saturday afternoon a farmer in my riding contacted me. 
There must be some transparency in the board. 
It certainly is not elected. 
Farmers in my riding want to support the Canadian Wheat Board. 
However, because of its historic injustices, they want control of the board. 
They want to elect the people who control the board. 
It is an extremely serious issue in my part of the country. 
Already in my part of the world farmers are turning to other alternatives. 
The government is being unreasonable. 
It makes me quite sad to see that response. 
With that I will close my remarks.  
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
It might clear up some of their inconsistencies and untruths.  
I look across the floor and see the Bloc in sheep's clothing. 
Certainly he and members of his party have been suggesting regionalism. 
It is not a country as a whole. 
Today is not my House duty. 
According to their view they have absolutely no right to speak to fisheries officials. 
That is something this party will not buy into.  
I will touch on a couple of questions that should be answered at this point. 
Will the Canadian Wheat Board become more accountable to farmers? 
That is a simple question. 
The answer is yes. 
There will be 15 directors in total, 10 of whom will be elected by producers. 
The government is only able to appoint five members. 
Will directors have real power? 
They have the power to set the salary for the CEO. 
There will have to be consultation with the minister before the CEO is appointed. 
The board of directors has true authority in the matter.  
They continue to contravene themselves on these matters.  
The wheat board will be fully audited. 
The wheat board has a duly appointed external auditor chosen from the private sector. 
Of course it is and there are two reasons for this. 
Think of the uncertainty that would create in the marketplace.  
It is a simple question and farmers have the right to know the answer. 
The government can appoint the president, but only after consultation. 
The hon. member for Saskatoon-Humboldt on a point of order.  
I do not think he said that. 
In any event, it is not a point of order.  
There seems to be some disagreement about this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, this is not indifferent to some of the committee work. 
They only hear selective things that they want to hear.  
This is a good bill for Canada. 
It is guaranteed in the country of Canada. 
We all have a right as parliamentarians to speak to this bill.  
Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
I wish that members of the Reform Party would listen to their own advice. 
I do not think they are treating this matter very seriously. 
I come from one of the prairie provinces. 
I say to every member- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We have not said that these people cannot speak.  
I say shame on you. 
He admonished us to stand on our principles. 
But no, Reform members are the trained seals. 
They are the ones who stick to one particular line over and over again.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I wish he would speak to that.  
What were the results? 
That was the fact but we will never hear that from the Reform Party.  
Is that not nice. 
Over $6 billion of its financing is underwritten by the federal government. 
That is something no other grain company has.  
I suspect we would be in the courts just like that. 
A situation where one particular company is favoured and not the others would be untenable.  
Have you ever been on a farm?  
Yes, I spent the first 19 years of my life on a farm. 
I happen to know a considerable amount about farming. 
The hon. member can throw that at me all he likes. 
The last time I checked my arithmetic 10 constitutes a full majority. 
They will run the board. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
It was quite interesting to listen to the parliamentary secretary. 
He did not talk about any amendments until the end of his speech. 
The member for Bourassa also made some comments. 
He talked about people acting disgracefully in this House. 
I thought that was very unsatisfactory. 
Using his words, it is disgraceful to hear that kind of talk in this House.  
We have been speaking on behalf of farmers since this party was formed. 
The parliamentary secretary can get booed off stages in the west any time he wants. 
We would like to boo him off the stage again.  
The member for Simcoe-Grey also made comments. 
The Liberal Party has only Ontario left. 
The member for Simcoe-Grey talked about appointing directors. 
In some of the amendments here propose a fully elected board. 
Is that not unusual? 
That is what this party is asking for here. 
It makes common business sense. 
We can go on and on about these appointments.  
That is why they do not win any seats anymore. 
We have all these amendments put by my colleague. 
Anybody on that board is beholden to the minister. 
One could go on and on, but I do not think I really have to. 
That is the way it should be.  
It is just absolutely ridiculous. 
I have never hard anything so- 
You are anti-Quebec.  
Mr. Speaker, the member is saying we are anti-Quebec. 
That is absolutely untrue. 
That member should come out and visit British Columbia once in a while. 
He should come out and visit western Canada. 
We are pro-Canadian. 
His cheap attacks on this party are not going to go very far. 
The House will now proceed to the motions in Group No. 5. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ) moved: 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC) moved: 
Section 5 of the Act and the heading preceding it are by the following: 
That Bill C-4, in Clause 6, be amended 
(a) by deleting lines 1 to 3 on page 8. 
(b) by deleting lines 28 to 35 on page 8. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP) moved: 
That Bill C-4 be amended by deleting Clause 7. 
Section 7 of the Act is replaced by the following:'' 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP) moved: 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC) moved: 
Section 18 of the act is repealed.''  
Previously the Canadian Wheat Board has simply been committed to orderly marketing. 
That would make sense.  
However, I submit that is simply hogwash. 
He was merely there to try and get input into regulations.  
We do not want to talk about that. 
We want to talk about how to actually accomplish the election.  
There is another point I would like to make in the time I have left. 
I think my numbers are fairly accurate.  
We are saying that they should be. 
What a concept, that we are actually here in this place to talk about legislation. 
That is exactly what this Reform amendment would accomplish.  
I believe that makes sense.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
I also have respect for the legislative process. 
There are 48 amendments which have been put forward. 
Some of the amendments are good. 
The government has a majority and it wishes to put through this legislation. 
One of them is Motion No. 21. 
Let me clarify that amendment. 
That is a good amendment. 
It is there for the producers. 
This amendment clarifies the mandate of the Canadian Wheat Board. 
Does that not make sense? 
It is a good amendment. 
I believe this is self-explanatory. 
Has the Canadian Wheat Board not wandered from its original mandate? 
The question must be asked.  
There is another amendment I have tabled in this grouping. 
It regards the repealing directives given by the minister and not the board. 
I cannot stress that enough. 
There are a couple of other areas within this grouping. 
There are a number of amendments. 
As a previous speaker indicated, unfortunately time is of a premium. 
The fact of the matter is that I do listen to the people. 
That probably speaks to the fact that we must move into the 21st century. 
There have to be changes. 
There have to be amendments. 
Do not do it just because a minister says he wants this piece of legislation. 
Listen, read, look and support some of these amendments. 
The legislation will be better.  
There are two other areas that are dealt with in this grouping. 
One is the elimination of the contingency fund. 
The contingency fund could and should be done away with. 
The last point is the subject of access to information. 
If there is nothing to hide then do not hide it. 
Access to information should be built into this piece of legislation.  
Thank you for your indulgence, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
That is exactly what I said four years ago. 
That is what should have happened. 
I hope some people have picked up the article and read it. 
This is what he says: 
That is what farmers want. 
They want a choice.  
This is what farmers object to. 
This gentleman goes on to say: 
But the Manitoba case goes to the crux of the matter. 
Why do we have a wheat board if it is not going to represent farmers? 
A special regime of law for government can lead to tyranny.' 
This is exactly what we are experiencing.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):
Clearly what the minister said was that there- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It is certainly not a point of order.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:
That is what is so serious about this statement in the House. 
I know there are about a hundred court cases right now. 
What is going on here? 
That would make farmers happy. 
That would make the farmers put their trust back into this wheat board. 
The majority of farmers want that option. 
It will probably destroy itself. 
The farmers laid complaints with the local RCMP. 
What is wrong with that? 
Is that not the way a democracy is supposed to run?  
They do not have the recourse that other industries have.  
We would be taking civil disobedience.''  
We do not want to see that. 
We want to have an accountable, democratic system in this country that treats everybody fairly. 
That is all that farmers in western Canada want. 
They want to be efficient. 
They want to be accountable. 
They want to pay their taxes. 
They want to have a livelihood that puts food on their table. 
They want to be treated fairly.  
That is the direction to go. 
That is what the amendments in this piece of legislation say. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The same thing happened in other countries. 
On such occasions the elected representatives of our people must be heard. 
People have to know where we stand. 
I look forward to hearing the views of my parliamentary colleagues. 
They will help us to make an informed decision.  
I believe the responsibility of Canada tonight is solemn and sober. 
Iraq must do so or face very serious consequences.  
This gives us no pleasure.  
Canada is not a nation which rushes to embrace the use of force. 
We do not lightly endorse military action. 
For us it is always the last resort. 
Indeed, a diplomatic resolution is far and away our preferred resolution to this crisis.  
Given his past record, this can be of no surprise to anyone. 
There is no doubt about it.  
From the very outset he has failed to honour this agreement. 
Through seven years of lies and physical threats they have carried out brilliant detective work. 
For seven years he has lied, resisted and tried to hide the truth. 
This deadly game of hide-and-seek has gone on long enough.  
Military intervention is not imminent. 
We believe that Canada cannot stand on the sidelines in such a moment. 
Our allies, led by the United States, have asked that we support such a mission. 
They have asked for military support, not for combat troops. 
However, it would mean a Canadian presence in the action against Saddam Hussein. 
That is the decision we must make. 
I believe the choice is clear. 
Moments like this are never easy. 
Important decisions are seldom easy. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
There is no doubt about it in our mind. 
Leaving Saddam Hussein unchecked would exact an enormous toll in human suffering. 
If military action is undertaken, the lives of military personnel themselves will be jeopardized. 
The human and moral side of the issue must be kept uppermost in our minds. 
I think that is the only moral justification for capital punishment. 
I think it is the only moral justification for taking lives through military action. 
That is really the moral issue with which we are dealing tonight.  
This is simply common sense. 
As far as the official opposition is concerned, our principal contribution will be this. 
The government has not yet provided evidence along that line. 
We trust that it will do so before this evening is over. 
This criterion remains to be satisfied.  
We expect the government to provide something on this mission definition tonight. 
It has not yet done so. 
Perhaps it will do so before the end of the evening. 
This criterion remains to be satisfied.  
We expect the government to give evidence along that line tonight. 
So far this criterion remains to be satisfied.  
Again we expect the government to provide some information on this structure. 
It has not yet done so. 
This criterion also remains to be satisfied.  
There are five points.  
(2) Our support should be military as well as moral and political.  
(4) As parliamentarians we should make the political decision to support. 
The hon. member has asked for unanimous consent to put a motion. 
Does the hon. member have unanimous consent to put the motion?  
He does not have consent.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
We would all wish it had not come to this.  
There could be a war on the horizon. 
The Americans and the British could therefore prepare to take military action against Iraq.  
The Bloc continues to favour a diplomatic solution. 
Such support carries indisputable moral weight. 
Let us think of the importance of Russian support. 
This is certainly not what we want to see happen. 
It is nonetheless participation in an armed intervention.  
Instead it took a wait-and-see approach. 
Instead, the Canadian government decided to wait to hear from the Americans.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Let there be no doubt about that. 
It is truly morally repugnant.  
That is the plan.  
What is our obligation? 
Let us not forget that hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians have already died. 
Canadians expect no less of us.  
Second, I believe that Canadians favour truly multilateral solutions to such international crises.  
All 22 members of the League of Arab States also oppose it.  
The vast majority of members of the international community oppose such action. 
Because a military operation in the region could have unexpected and undesirable consequences.  
It reads, ``the smart bombs won't be any smarter this time''. 
There are those who support military action over diplomatic initiatives.  
In conclusion, wise heads are right to counsel caution and careful reflection. 
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Unfortunately, we met with a blank wall, a flat no.  
If that is the case, things have reached a sorry pass. 
We have certainly slipped in our international stature.  
It is not repetitive to say it today. 
It is not insignificant to say that. 
That is the position we take.  
Yet we were left in the dark as to its significance. 
The government has waited to this day to make its position clear. 
We have reached a point of total absurdity. 
This is nothing new. 
There are many questions in regard to this whole debate. 
We have to ask what is at stake. 
What is the best way of dealing with this dangerous situation? 
What forces and facilities are needed in the event of military action? 
Is parliamentary support necessary?  
What is the best way of dealing with this situation? 
However, should diplomacy fail then the use of force would then become justified.  
The resolution goes on at length but it is very clear.  
Pretending this problem does not exist is not going to make it go away. 
It is unclear at this point what exactly is being asked. 
Now is the time to be clear on this.  
There are those who may not think it is significant. 
Yet some seem already to have forgotten. 
Because it must be clear from the outset what objective we are pursuing. 
We have yet to hear exactly what it is. 
The joint committee would help to establish and clarify that position. 
What is the state of Canada's military equipment? 
These are all questions we have to ask.  
What objective will we pursue? 
I see two obvious objectives. 
These are all questions that need to be answered. 
We also know that time is running out.  
We learned a great deal from the experience of 1991.  
This is a happy coincidence. 
Let me quote from Debates of 1990. 
That was said by the member who is now the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
That is what he thought then.  
Let me quote again. 
It should not be a unilateral decision''. 
That was the same minister recorded in Hansard on September 24, 1990. 
I can only regret that he does not seem to be as forthcoming today.  
I do not understand what this government has to hide.  
Why not strike a committee? 
Why not make a statement in the House of Commons? 
We have just been through a crisis. 
We have another motion asking for unanimous consent to take a particular action. 
He does not have unanimous consent. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
We called them and said ``tell us what you are prepared to do''. 
We never heard back from them.  
They, too, have asked for briefings, which they will be given. 
Then he might be able to get his facts straight.  
Therefore we must find ways of stopping him. 
He recognizes no restraint of the normal civilized world.  
It is a forbidding place. 
More important, it is an immoral place from the point of view of that government. 
Several members have said ``Why isn't Canada being more diplomatic?'' 
I can say we have been very busy on that diplomatic front.  
He does not recognize that. 
There does come a time when some decision has to be made. 
I do not understand what he is talking about. 
He wants us to go and deliberately show that there is a split. 
That is what I was saying today. 
Let us try to do what is pragmatic and useful.  
I would suggest one thing that this House should consider. 
It goes back to what the Prime Minister said. 
These are difficult decisions. 
I think the Leader of the Opposition said the same thing. 
No one relishes it. 
That is the way we have to do it.  
That is true for one basic reason. 
There is no real difference in this issue. 
Therefore we have to take a stand to make sure they are not used.  
That is the dilemma that we face.  
That is why we are here in the House today. 
We are consulting with the House. 
I would say to the hon. Leader of the Opposition he knows this well. 
I ask him to look at the record. 
Ultimately I must say this. 
We will continue to make that commitment to do so. 
I may be wrong. 
No one is more imperfect than Saddam Hussein in this kind of question.  
We hope members of Parliament will help us get there next fall.  
I am glad he did. 
It saves me the trouble of doing so. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
We could have had a question and answer period for however long. 
That is an approach we should look at for the future. 
An often asked question is what kind of person is Saddam Hussein. 
He seems to have no compassion in his use of those kinds of weapons.  
Look at his history. 
He used chemical weapons on Iranian soldiers and on his own people. 
He worked on enriching uranium and on biological and chemical weapons. 
We know how he has functioned in government. 
He has even killed his own relatives. 
He kills Kurdish minorities. 
We know what kind of person he is. 
We have to look at the history of UNSCOM. 
I have talked to our own people about that. 
I have talked to the Americans, the British, the French, the Russians.  
Is this stuff really there? 
I think all have heard the facts and figures. 
These facts and figures are there. 
It has been documented that 38,000 tonnes of chemical weapons have been destroyed. 
This guy produced those things and they have been destroyed. 
There are 480,000 litres of CW agents for the production of chemical weapons. 
This guy produced that. 
That is the kind of person we are talking about.  
One drop will kill an individual. 
He has produced them and we know they are there.  
What more facts do we need? 
What more proof could we have of the danger of this individual?  
I could continue to talk about this matter but will add only a few notes. 
Everybody is for that. 
However, if that is not possible, who are we dealing with? 
What is Saddam Hussein like? 
That is the point.  
We are all worried about that. 
All of us care. 
Our war is not with the Iraqi people or the Arab states. 
Our war is with Saddam Hussein, an insane dictator. 
That is whom our war is with.  
Turkey has already suffered from all kinds of instability and terrorism. 
Iran is extremely concerned. 
It is not a matter of establishing how dangerous the person is. 
We all agree how dangerous he is. 
I think that is what we have to ask. 
He will continue to develop delivery mechanisms. 
What does that mean? 
It is one thing when he terrorizes his people. 
It is one thing when he terrorizes his neighbours. 
Could he affect us? 
Could he destabilize our civilization with his terrorism? 
That is not dreaming. 
That is not science fiction. 
There are no other options. 
Everything must be inspected.  
The next part of it is that the weapons of mass destruction must be destroyed. 
We want it to the bitter end. 
It has gone too far this time. 
He was produced too much. 
He has too much there. 
He is now a danger to the world as we know it.  
It is time we put that message to him diplomatically. 
We cannot pretend it is not an issue. 
We cannot say Saddam Hussein might be all right. 
We cannot say maybe he will not use these weapons. 
We cannot hide from it. 
The terror must end. 
It is time for what is good for Canada. 
That is what Canadians want to hear from us in the House tonight.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
That is a glaring inaccuracy. 
That is a glaring inaccuracy on the record.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
That is not a point of order. 
We will resume debate with the hon. Minister of National Defence.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
While that threat has diminished it still exists. 
There are still a lot of those weapons in the world. 
Nowhere is that more evident than in Iraq.  
It was used against the Kurds. 
He is indeed, as has been said here tonight, a very dangerous individual. 
The evidence is overwhelming. 
They do not require sophisticated delivery systems like nuclear weapons do. 
The UN resolution is quite clear. 
He and his country need to abide by that resolution. 
We cannot walk away from that resolution. 
We cannot walk away. 
The credibility of the international community would be badly damaged if we did so. 
We cannot, as the British found out in 1939, appease dictators. 
We cannot expect that we will be to control the situation on his terms. 
They have to be on the terms of the international community. 
We continue to press for diplomatic resolution of the matter. 
A terrible situation exists with respect to the survival of the people of that country.  
We have to be a part of that effort. 
Are we in a position to do that? 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Roads are made by walking''.  
The Government of Canada has no- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Pardon me, the hon. member's time has expired. 
The hon. member for Laval East.  
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
The position of the Bloc Quebecois is clear. 
Every diplomatic effort must be made to avoid this catastrophe.  
These negotiations must therefore be stepped up so that a negotiated settlement can be reached. 
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
We are dealing here with an aggressive, dangerous and unpredictable man. 
There is no doubt.  
Who makes these weapons? 
Where do they come from? 
I do not recall such a statement.  
Whenever we declare war, we help Saddam Hussein. 
Why not abandon the fruitless imposition of sanctions? 
Sanctions have not worked. 
Why penalize the civilian population? 
Why not allow Iraq to sell its oil on the market? 
With affluence, civilian standards of living would improve. 
It has happened elsewhere. 
We have not forgotten who used them first. 
The solution is not to be found through war. 
The morality of the Reform Party would lead to bringing back capital punishment. 
The state would take a life in retaliation for a similar act. 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
I think it is a precedent for future action and a welcome one.  
There has been some discussion of 1991. 
In fact the gulf operation was rather special. 
I think the legal authority is there.  
We do believe in the peacekeeping role. 
We have tended to eschew the use of armed force. 
It is search and rescue operations, transport operations, but not more. 
The United States is aware of that. 
That is the primary obligation. 
International law supplied the general rules.  
We are aware of this. 
Our allies are aware of this. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Vancouver East.  
The member for Davenport had some very important things to say to the prime minister.  
This is a very important debate tonight. 
Clearly, Canadians are engaged as well in the debate.  
Is she taking us for granted? 
Was it a misquote? 
Or does she know something that has been kept from the rest of us?  
Canada is a sovereign country. 
We have just brokered an international treaty on the disposal of land mines. 
It was a proud moment.  
And why do the Americans want our support so badly? 
Significantly the Arab countries in the Middle East are opposed.  
In 1991 there was a bona fide coalition against Saddam Hussein. 
Today there is none. 
The United States is contemplating drastic action without much support from the world community. 
The question to ask is this:
What is the point of Canadian participation in another bombing spree against Iraq? 
Could Canada not play a diplomatic role in this regard? 
Rather than weakening it will only secure Hussein in his position.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
The military action that has happened in the past has led to untold civilian deaths. 
They are severely malnourished because of the sanctions.  
The Geneva conventions prohibit the destruction of vital systems for civilian populations. 
These are the basic necessities of human life and survival. 
We reject the approach being put forward by the Reform Party.  
Therefore we must reject the invitation from Mr. Clinton. 
Canada has the credibility and the record to accomplish this kind of objective. 
We have seen that with the work that was done on land mines. 
The question today is what do we teach our kids? 
We need aggressive diplomacy. 
We should be part of a middle power effort to bring about diplomatic solutions.  
I have a question for the prime minister. 
Does it seek to work for global disarmament? 
That is why the motion and the invitation have to be rejected.  
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
We must stand behind the United Nations to protect the lives of innocent people.  
We are dealing with a man of no conscience. 
We must not lose sight of Saddam Hussein's wanton and reckless aggression. 
Other nations are guilty by association and by helping his supply. 
Israel suffered 39 Scud missile attacks during the gulf war. 
The population had to don gas masks. 
The possibility of such an attack is frightening beyond measure. 
It is called ``Why Do We Pray''. 
We cannot merely pray to You, O God, to end war; 
For we know that You have made the world in a way 
That man must find his own path to peace 
Within himself and his neighbour.  
We cannot merely pray to You, O God, to end starvation 
For You have already given us the resources 
With which to feed the entire world 
If we would only use them wisely.  
We cannot pray to You, O God, to root out prejudice 
For You have already given us eyes 
With which to see the good in all people 
If we would only use them rightly.  
We cannot merely pray to You, O God, to end despair, 
For You have already given us the power 
To clear away slums and to give hope 
If we would only use our power justly.  
We cannot merely pray to You, O God, to end disease, 
For You have already given us great minds 
with which to search out cures and healing 
If we would only use them constructively.  
Therefore we pray to You instead, O God 
For strength, determination and will power, 
To do instead of to just pray; 
To become instead of merely to wish.  
Let our diplomacy work in the interest of all mankind.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
I believe that is truly one of the many principles that make us uniquely Canadian.  
It is the Canadian way in terms of one of the differences. 
We are not by nature a warring people. 
This, in our great democracy, is one of those times, sadly.  
How can we tolerate that? 
I also talked with a good friend, an Ottawa cab driver. 
He name is Mel. 
Mel is from Lebanon. 
It is easy to say. 
I said to Mel I am not sure I know how to do that.  
How will military action put an end to this? 
We are in a partnership. 
We cannot have it both ways. 
What President Clinton has apparently asked for, we are told, is support. 
He is not looking for frontline troops. 
I regret and I fear that day may come. 
I suppose in reality it is very possible.  
Will he use them? 
I do not think there is a doubt in the world. 
I hope and I pray that they are the right decisions.  
But in this case the evidence is irrefutable.  
It is very frightening to live in a world like that.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Do not get me wrong, I have learned the lessons this century has taught. 
I understand that when tyranny is permitted to reign the entire world is in danger. 
The government turned down the motion and dismissed it as hypothetical. 
It is words like those that instil confidence in the hearts of all Canadians.  
Now we know what has been decided upon. 
For example, what is the status of our biological and chemical defence? 
Do we have an antidote on hand for anthrax and VX gas? 
What is the extent of our nuclear, biological and chemical weapons defences?  
I hope this government understands its responsibility. 
Yet, we know that these decisions are tough for this Liberal government. 
Time ran out when the president phoned. 
The government does not have time to take a public opinion poll. 
A request is on the table that the prime minister cannot duck. 
There is no place to hide. 
He will have to make a decision and he will have to act.  
This is not familiar ground with this Liberal government. 
Let me try to be helpful. 
Let us make things easier for the government. 
Iraq is an aggressor. 
Those resolutions remain in force to this day.  
Therefore, the choice of the government should not have been so tough. 
He will need courage. 
That is precisely why Canada must take part. 
When tyranny is permitted to reign, the entire world is in danger. 
When freedom is confronted with danger, action must be taken. 
Have confidence that Canada is on the good side.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabasca, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I will start by very briefly addressing three major items.  
First, the topic of this evening's debate. 
We are extremely disappointed.  
They refused, claiming there was no emergency. 
We also called for an emergency debate in the House, and that too was refused.  
That was the purpose of this evening's debate.  
But I will get back to this later on. 
Again, the resolution was adopted on April 3, 1991. 
It is not a new resolution. 
It is a very long resolution which also says we can intervene. 
Today, questions were put to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
He does not seem to be up on things. 
He says: ``Yes, but you know it is not easy''. 
Once again, I would like to digress for a minute. 
It makes no sense. 
Our position remains unchanged. 
Would you call that diplomacy? 
As we say where I come from, he lost it. 
What will he do before the security council? 
We are quite prepared to co-operate. 
So, I think there are problems.  
I want to mention two things in closing, so as not to take too long. 
I have another quote. 
He did not, and it is very unfortunate.  
Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask for unanimous consent to put the following motion: 
I am sorry, there is not unanimous consent.  
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
We faced the same issue in 1991.  
Let me be clear in the way I see the situation. 
We have never been an imperial force. 
I want to ask one final thing of our government. 
I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this debate tonight.  
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
The question is this.  
Let us give President Bush his due. 
Today's reality is completely different. 
Under the circumstances, why should we accept to participate in a potential military operation?  
Time calls for caution. 
For the time being we should say no.  
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
This world is becoming a more dangerous place. 
The NDP member felt that there should be no action taken. 
It calls for assistance from our allies. 
Saddam Hussein had to be stopped. 
That is not what it is all about. 
Again, I am encouraging the Liberal government to take a strong position. 
I know it will be deliberating this evening and tomorrow over this matter. 
I know the government side here has chosen not to do that. 
It offers greater support in a very timely fashion. 
It was on the public record.  
He will have to think twice and open his door again. 
I think that is the intent of this unified effort.  
I know that we have an opportunity to deploy our military in support. 
I believe those troops should be offered. 
I am trusting that will happen.  
This statement came up in debate in the British parliament. 
It became pretty clear that British parliamentarians would not buy that statement at all. 
That was the point. 
The threat was that Hussein may have been hiding other goods from the inspectors. 
It had nothing to do with Clinton's problems in the United States.  
These countries are standing up united against a terrorist.  
It was because there was not a clear mandate. 
The troops are gone from there now. 
The situation is still rather desperate in that country. 
We are not saying when the Americans say jump that everybody should jump. 
This situation is much different from the situation in Haiti. 
The threat is much greater. 
There is a need for a definite set of rules of engagement, a plan. 
We support action when action is required. 
On this occasion action is required.  
It should be clear that we will act if it is necessary.  
Our military has a proud history of fighting for democracy and freedom. 
I know that other members across the way have joined in such excursions. 
Our forces did an outstanding job in the 1991 gulf war. 
They served professionally and with much competence. 
We have much to be proud of through their actions.  
They know their limitations and they know what they can accomplish. 
They often have a habit of exceeding our expectations time after time. 
I believe this mission will be no exception.  
In summary, we want to see a peaceful diplomatic resolution to this conflict. 
However, we have a moral obligation to stand united with our allies if necessary. 
We must not allow dictators to make a mockery of the international community. 
Our military is capable and prepared to act. 
Let us demonstrate to Saddam Hussein that we will not tolerate his terrorism.  
Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood.  
We did this in 1991 and we are doing it again tonight. 
I have not changed my mind since then. 
It appears we may be entering into one more operation.  
The importance of this refusal cannot be understated.  
Iraq must continue to allow weapons inspection teams to conduct their investigations. 
This is not the first time he has tried to obstruct inspections. 
Personally I do not think it will be the last time. 
That is why we cannot allow this to continue. 
Kuwait is proof of his intentions.  
The potential for human devastation is great. 
He intends to use them.  
Our options are simple. 
We can do nothing. 
It will be our own fault.  
Let me say that next time there will be countless casualties and fatalities. 
The death toll of the innocent will be extreme. 
To do nothing is not a viable option. 
By acting now we can save possibly millions of innocent lives down the road. 
We are not so sure Saddam Hussein holds that same value. 
This issue has been simmering for quite some time. 
Every effort possible has been made to settle this very difficult problem. 
Unfortunately diplomatic efforts have failed thus far to resolve the issue. 
That is why military action must not be ruled out. 
We must be able to say that our forces are combat capable at all times.  
This is an important point. 
They did not involve all three components of our forces.  
Even peacekeeping has changed dramatically over the years. 
In modern day missions each component has become vital to the overall mission. 
So even peacekeeping requires more of a multipurpose combat capable force.  
I would like to highlight the achievements of our forces. 
To me that is a multipurpose combat capable force.  
The present situation in Iraq needs to be resolved. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
This is an emergency debate on possible Canadian intervention in Iraq.  
Let us recall that the current situation is the result of the Gulf War. 
That position was taken by the UN. 
It is under the responsibility of the UN Security Council. 
I feel that care must be taken to respect these authorities. 
No one disputes this.  
I think this aspect deserves considerable attention.  
There are lessons to be learned from the past. 
I feel it is important to make one thing clear. 
Pardon me, you had 20 minutes.  
It is the most staunch of Washington's allies.  
The majority of the Arab countries are opposed to military action. 
These are forces that may play a significant role in the present situation.  
I think there is still time. 
The Reform Party quickly indicated its readiness to support the American position. 
The Conservatives' attitude is similar.  
I will conclude, and it will only take a few minutes. 
I am not judging the Americans and Iraqis. 
That is what I want to see happen in this Parliament.  
Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
The world must act.  
Nor does our interest stop there. 
Today we are proving that again. 
I want to emphasize two important points. 
Canada also sent 26 F-18 fighters to the gulf. 
The members of the forces made a difference.  
The Canadian forces' performance in the gulf war was simply outstanding. 
Some were short missions lasting only a few months and others are still ongoing.  
We contributed to the United Nations observation group in Lebanon. 
They provide second line logistic support to UNDOF. 
Canada also provides communications detachments to all UNDOF units.  
We must take action to resume these inspections and ensure unfettered access.  
In the face of such defiance, we must not back down. 
Mr. John Maloney (Erie-Lincoln, Lib.):
This onus is most formidable.  
Tonight I find myself asking, would we be so fortunate a second time?  
How have we arrived at the brink once again?  
Baghdad believes the weapons inspection process is taking far too long. 
Iraqis accuse the Americans on the multinational team of being spies.  
We have arrived at a stalemate.  
We must be more than thorough in our deliberations. 
Are there compromises and positions that we have not explored? 
Are we satisfied that they are so necessary? 
We have done much but can we not do more? 
Can we not work harder to prevent this pending conflict, to promote a peaceful resolution. 
All diplomatic measures must be explored and explored to the point of exhaustion. 
Canada respects the United Nations. 
Canada respects international laws. 
Unfortunately Saddam Hussein does not. 
One might say that is not terribly difficult to comply with.  
Iraq claimed that the VX nerve gas project was a failure. 
The question is can Hussein be trusted. 
The answer is terribly obvious. 
We earnestly seek a compromise, a negotiated settlement, a diplomatic solution. 
Yes, we wish to avoid war and we must earnestly work to achieve these ends. 
We must be prepared to act and if action is necessary, we will.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for St. Albert. 
From now on all my colleagues will be sharing their time.  
We have supported various international sanctions against Iraq. 
The terms of peace were broken.  
Last month, weapons inspection teams were blocked from 72 sites in Iraq. 
Fourteen of these sites were inspected since. 
The world has reasonable grounds to assume that Saddam Hussein will use these weapons.  
We, the Canadians, are not against Iraqi people. 
Then it could amend it after the debate.  
The Leader of the Official Opposition had to fill in that vacuum. 
So far, we meet three of those criteria.  
We support a diplomatic solution to the crisis caused by Iraq. 
Failing that, we go to plan B and that plan is military intervention.  
There still remains a chance that a diplomatic solution can be reached. 
I hope Saddam Hussein will yield to the military pressure and back off. 
I really hope he does, at least for the sake of the innocent people.  
We have always participated in the most significant international efforts. 
Recently we have much to be proud of in this regard. 
The world knows Canada as a peace loving, diplomatic nation. 
This should be left to the military experts to determine and not to the politicians.  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
We know that in Iraq there is no democracy. 
The people have no right to choose their own government. 
We believe in free speech and free expression. 
We know they do not exist in Iraq today. 
There is no opportunity. 
Life in Iraq is quite bleak. 
We expect our leaders to serve their people. 
He uses them and he abuses them. 
We have the right to protect ourselves, our families and our children. 
When that is at risk we do have the right to defend ourselves.  
Saddam Hussein has demonstrated in the past that he has the capacity to attack. 
He has attacked his own people. 
He has demonstrated his capacity to attack a foreign country. 
We have seen that through his invasion of Kuwait. 
We have seen that through the scud missile attacks on Israel. 
He could attack us with these weapons. 
Unfortunately those kinds of weapons can be transported quite easily. 
We are not without risk. 
But first things first.  
I know they have reached impasse. 
I know they have reached failure at this point in carrying out their mission.  
It appears to be, unfortunately, no.  
I know they have some concerns. 
We do not throw them away. 
When we are threatened, we have the right to retaliate. 
We must think about that because we know he is a dangerous person.  
I said earlier that we threaten when we are threatened. 
But we should be careful and think it through. 
Diplomacy in the end, when it works, is always the best way to do it.  
Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau, Lib.):
We saw what the results of that mission and its aftermath were.  
We are told that diplomatic measures have failed. 
There are other resolutions that are completely ignored.  
That is our role. 
Solutions should not be decided on the basis of what suits certain countries.  
Is it any wonder that they question our intentions? 
Which countries sold these weapons? 
That is a point of view that must be re-examined. 
Why would we want to lose that trust? 
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
Why rush into this when diplomatic solutions are still a possibility? 
Perhaps other efforts should be undertaken before we proceed with military action.  
Perhaps this is another diplomatic measure which should be considered.  
Unfortunately there appears to be little consensus among many of our allies.  
However innocent civilians will be the biggest victims of such an attack. 
They are absolutely correct. 
I share their view.  
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
We know he is prepared to use them. 
That was in 1938. 
We know what happened in 1939.  
The military stands ready to carry out missions assigned by Canada.  
These missions from time to time are going to require combat capability.  
That should be our caveat. 
History tells us that the world simply is not like that. 
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
Canada was built by immigrants from around the globe. 
Who better than Canada to defend world peace. 
Our military performed admirably in the first gulf war. 
Our support should be military as well as moral and political. 
As parliamentarians we should make the political decision to support. 
This must not happen again. 
Saddam lives by weight of arms and might. 
He will only submit to the same.  
These two were scheduled for inspection and destruction until Saddam intervened once again. 
Yet seven years later the world might face more. 
Let us set this debate in its historical context. 
Why are we contemplating putting our armed forces into Iraq? 
The answer is clear. 
Iraq is once again flaunting its disregard for international standards.  
Let me make some distinctions. 
The Toronto Star made an interesting analysis in its coverage. 
That is the historical substantive context of the situation.  
Let me move to the political context of Canada's potential role. 
There are several issues I would like to briefly mention. 
Second, I would like to briefly discuss the specific mandate of the Canadian armed forces. 
Is this the way we want to spend our defence budget? 
Caution is the watchword.  
The objective is not disputed, but the means to achieve it require some thinking.  
I understand these concerns. 
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
We have been supportive of our friend and our neighbour. 
The situation we are debating tonight is also about human rights. 
It is Canada's responsibility to provide moral leadership. 
We have been working toward peace in that region through non-military means. 
I ask whether we have used up all peaceful resolution to this conflict. 
Have we used up all means at our command? 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
I think there is a lesson in that for us here. 
Have we exhausted all the diplomatic options here? 
It is something that needs to be considered by the government and by other governments. 
I was glad to hear that coming from the other side of the House. 
What I want to do tonight is say what I think this is not about. 
I heard the member who just spoke refer to Mahatma Gandhi. 
But that is not the position from which we are arguing this day. 
There are a number of things I would like to put on the record. 
For one thing, it was the west that armed Iraq to the teeth. 
There was no talk then of the evils of Saddam Hussein. 
It is just that then he was doing what we wanted him to do. 
I say we in the west sense. 
And now he is not.  
One cannot help but feel there is a certain amount of hypocrisy. 
Why should we have some uncritical trust of our allies? 
That is not a Canadian tradition. 
We hear a lot about the importance of the UN. 
The UN is no stronger. 
Let us talk about the UN. 
Obviously by disobeying the UN this is to be deplored. 
The attack on the UN comes from many directions and for many reasons. 
That cannot be said about the United States.  
Again, with respect to UN resolutions, I agree that UN resolutions should be enforced. 
We have a World Court ruling on nuclear weapons. 
There are a number of other things, the position of the Kurds. 
There are many countries with weapons of mass destruction.  
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):
We want to arrive at a solution by peaceful means. 
Some suggestions came forward in my discussions. 
I agreed to pass on this suggestion to the appropriate authorities.  
But if one looks at the prevailing situation it becomes less obvious.  
There has been a barrage of media coverage on this in the last weeks. 
It would be very difficult not to know of the intentions of the United States.  
I would argue that might be a tad facile. 
They are knowledgeable about world affairs and current affairs. 
They have remained essentially silent. 
That is the situation we are confronted with.  
It is not unanimous. 
Canada is not a neutral country. 
Time and again we have stood with our allies. 
What alternative then is left if these do not bring the results we wish?  
Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk-Brant, Lib.):
We have reacted and we still continue to react to that type of behaviour.  
That is the case and we should be proud of that. 
There are mixed messages. 
It has been said that all they will do is hurt the Iraqi people. 
That was a debate many of my constituents had. 
It is a tough question to answer.  
Over 16,000 people have disappeared in Iraq.  
Iraqi people do not have the right of association. 
They do not have an opposition like the one across the floor. 
Whole villages, small rural villages disappeared. 
Why are we at this point? 
Why are we at the point of military build-up in the gulf? 
We are at a standoff. 
But if we do, how do we trust him?  
We negotiated a settlement on the gulf war. 
The United Nations brokered a settlement. 
He said he never got involved in biological warfare or chemical warfare. 
We found out differently. 
How do we trust a negotiated settlement with this man?  
The threat that this man has on the world scares me. 
We need to send a message to the world that it is unacceptable behaviour. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
This is a very difficult debate. 
The parameters are not as clear and the situation is more nebulous. 
The threat, while there, is not as clear. 
Nonetheless we have some decisions to make. 
Should we stay or should we go? 
It is certain that Saddam Hussein has chemical and biological weapons. 
Of that there is no doubt. 
The issue is how to get rid of them.  
The United States wants to bomb if diplomacy fails. 
The worst case scenario would be very bad. 
Also, it would end the visits of UNSCOM in Iraq. 
We can be certain of that. 
This has enabled us to get rid of them. 
Those inspections would end in the event of bombing.  
We must avoid any kind of collateral damage of the civilian population.  
Diplomacy should involve the Arab nations. 
The Arab league is against the bombing scenario. 
Some give and take could occur. 
This would add an element of impartiality and would eliminate that argument.  
The U.S. has asked us for support which will likely be peripheral support. 
We can provide that support if diplomatic initiatives have truly been exhausted.  
There are some inconsistencies in our foreign policy. 
We are all desirous of supporting UN resolution 687. 
The political solution is the solution that will end the regime of Saddam Hussein. 
It has to come from the remnants of opposition parties that still exist within Iraq.  
It is also important for us to understand our role as Canadians. 
We have two roles. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Motion No. 279 proposes: 
I would like first to address the rationale behind my motion. 
I submit that such comparisons are not entirely outlandish.  
That is the kind of regime we are dealing with. 
It is a regime which simply cannot be reasoned with.  
No rational person could possibly disagree with that proposition. 
Diplomacy cannot be exercised with a stone wall. 
Diplomacy cannot be exercised with a tyrant who refuses to negotiate. 
Let us get one thing perfectly clear. 
This is not some theoretical threat we are talking about. 
I want to close with this sentiment. 
Are we prepared for that fate?  
Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):
I am splitting my time with the member for Mississauga South.  
The question is how and what should Canada's role be. 
We are not in a position to do nothing. 
We are already part of these alliances. 
They are essential to global stability.  
I would personally rather win in a poker game than in a military engagement. 
We should continue to assert Canadian ways within the alliance. 
Only if we are present will we have the ability to assert these Canadian ways. 
Sometimes we are rather good at it. 
I have three more points to make. 
First, this enforcement action should not be seen as a one-off exercise. 
All this is important to our collective global future.  
Second, the targets of any enforcement action must be military. 
Where would we be if we all did nothing? 
I do not think we want to wait meekly. 
I think we want to act internationally.  
I do not believe that we can do nothing. 
I do not believe they have much choice.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Members have been very clear. 
The president of the United States has asked Canada to provide non-combat support. 
There are just as many questions that have to be answered. 
Ms. Alton is utterly opposed to any military action. 
That is certainly an important aspect. 
Canadians want that assurance. 
That is part of the consideration. 
This kind of attitude probably has no place in terms of the decision making process. 
This is a very serious situation.  
There is the question of guarantees. 
It is a very good question. 
It is in fact taken to be a threat, a real threat to world peace.  
Many members have outlined its responsibilities. 
It has not been allowed to do its job. 
It represents the monitoring agency and the agency which is going to deal with things. 
Yet there are still many more there. 
This is a serious threat.  
Before I came to the House today I looked on the web. 
I wanted to see what CNN was reporting. 
We need those assurances. 
This is a very important element. 
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
I believe it should be our humanity and our desire for peace that guides us.  
It is an admission of failure, the absolute failure of the world's leaders. 
It is not an admission I would like to make.  
As a parliamentarian I have not been briefed by our government. 
We have not had any UN representative to brief us. 
I do not know all the weapons information that there is. 
Are they there in Iraq? 
The UN inspectors have not been able to go in and confirm what is there.  
What do we know about our Canadian army? 
We do not know what the financial cost of this endeavour will be to Canadians. 
Will we be able to get out? 
More importantly, can we afford the human cost?  
What do we know about Iraq? 
There is little if any medicine. 
I would like to know who is arming this dictator. 
Who is selling the arms? 
Once again, the UN inspectors have not been able to finish their work.  
I have heard over the last few days that what we have here are principles. 
Our principles are at stake. 
I believe, more importantly, that lives are at stake. 
There will be no winners in this war. 
However, there is time and there are options. 
We do not have to go to war. 
The language has changed so much that the death of civilians is called collateral damage. 
Once again, other countries have weapons of mass destruction. 
This damage and threat can be warded off with diplomacy. 
Saddam Hussein has shown himself to be very capable of surviving anything. 
We also face the unknown that will follow if we do start bombing. 
There will be a conflagration in that area. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 1.40 a.m.)
