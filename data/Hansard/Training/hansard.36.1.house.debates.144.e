The House met at 2 p.m. 
Members sang the national anthem ] 
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Canada is proud of her. 
I wish her luck in her next event.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
This is through no fault of their own. 
Farmers do not want handouts. 
All they want is fair treatment. 
But did this government listen? 
Now what is this government going to do?  
NATIONAL SLEEP AWARENESS WEEK 
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
The hon. member for Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik.  
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
In addition, the employer abolished a dozen or so positions during the conciliation process.  
COMMONWEALTH JEWISH COUNCIL AND TRUST AWARD 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
This government support is provided as seed money for new businesses.  
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
There is magic in the hills of Wilno.''  
Now, Mr. Speaker, you know about Wilno.  
CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION MONTH 
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, October is child abuse prevention month.  
Up to 12,000 ribbons will be distributed in the Peel region.  
THE NISGA'A LAND CLAIM AGREEMENT 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
The parallels are striking. 
The hon. member for Winnipeg-Transcona.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
JOURNEES QUEBECOISES DE LA SOLIDARITE INTERNATIONALE 
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, we are celebrating this week the Journees quebecoises de la solidarite internationale.  
Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the sheep producers are on Parliament Hill.  
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Now two years later we are learning the truth. 
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
The film reveals the lives of those courageous Chinese pioneers. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Perhaps then he will be persuaded to take the farm crisis seriously.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
It is not what we have done.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
I remind the Prime Minister this is 1998. 
Will the Prime Minister come clean and make his position clear? 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I learned that in April 1963 when I became a member of parliament.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
This on his fingers right now. 
I would like to ask the Prime Minister- 
The hon. member for Edmonton North.  
Who will decide if the Prime Minister went too far?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it was a very good situation in 1963. 
We did not have the Reform Party in Canada.  
The Right Hon. Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
The inquiry will look at all aspects.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
This commission is not even operating right now and the Prime Minister knows that. 
When will we get a full judicial inquiry into this matter?  
We are impugning motive. 
I would like hon. member to withdraw the word deliberately.  
Excuse me, Mr. Speaker. 
I will withdraw that word.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
At that time I did not have time to discuss anything with the police. 
Anybody with common sense would know that.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We are not responding to a request on which all provinces agree. 
It was an initiative- 
The Leader of the Bloc Quebecois has the floor.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
That is what he has always done.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister says he needs a consensus to act.  
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
If he is serious, why does he not act?  
For example, we did not touch the equalization payments. 
This is what Canadian solidarity is all about.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister says he needs a consensus before he will take action.  
If he is serious, why is he doing nothing?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Obviously, however, the Bloc Quebecois is not interested in the real world. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
That is precisely what the minister's story illustrates.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
That is how we can help children.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Will the solicitor general tell us what he is going to do?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
To what ends will this government go to prevent the truth from coming out?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
It is internationally respected and it is on the job now. 
It is master of its own proceedings. 
This government respects this parliament's decision to establish that commission.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister says he needs a consensus to act.  
There was a national consensus on employment insurance. 
If he is serious, why does he not act?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
If he is serious about this, why is he not acting?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The hon. member for Skeena. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
This is a ridiculous conflict of interest.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
The hon. member for Skeena. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let me clarify that I am a farm girl. 
The First Nations understand that as well.  
We are doing that at the local level. 
The hon. member for Wild Rose.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I find the minister's answers to be ridiculous. 
People are living in old broken down buses. 
They are sitting on apple crates. 
Nothing is happening because this minister refuses to talk to the people. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
The hon. member for Wild Rose.  
Jerry Fontaine is the chief of the Sagkeeng reserve. 
His reserve is $11 million in debt. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
I will have none of it, none of it.  
HARMONIZATION OF THE GOODS AND SERVICES TAX 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister says he needs a consensus before he will budge. 
Even Jean Charest thinks that Quebec was had.  
If the Prime Minister is serious, why does he refuse to budge?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
In Quebec's case, there was no loss. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
In Quebec, there is a strong consensus against the millennium scholarships. 
Quebec wants to be able to opt out with full compensation.  
If the Prime Minister is serous, what is he waiting for to act?  
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
We have been calling for forensic audits on reserves from the start.  
It is over a year since those words were said.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
I can say that the solutions being recommended by the opposition will not work. 
We have to do it with a planned approach. 
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
We are calling for a forensic audit of all of this. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let me give an example of how this partnership is working.  
The hon. minister of Indian affairs.  
What has happened is the chief and council are working with their community members. 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
We do not wish to participate in that for that very reason.  
We doubled the cap for animals yesterday for compensation.  
We are also putting $1 million into animal identification in Canada. 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Minister of Canadian Heritage.  
The National Arts Centre is a very important Canadian cultural institution. 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
My colleagues, all questions in this House have equal value. 
The hon. member for Lethbridge.  
Mr. Speaker, I will get right to my question. 
However, the commissioner for the environment says different. 
Where is the plan or is just another holiday in the sun?  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
We are going to negotiations next week. 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
This is not a surprise.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That is what we are in the process of seeing. 
That is why we put in a series of measures helping the working poor. 
It is why we dealt with education. 
The hon. member for Dartmouth.  
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
For the previous 15 years it had been decreasing.  
That is a very important. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Mr. Speaker, agriculture is in crisis.  
Producers are selling at a loss. 
The time for meetings is over. 
The time for action is now. 
What is the minister's plan and how much?  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
I am not taking the approach the member would.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
This minister keeps hiding behind NISA but NISA is not enough. 
When it comes to agriculture their pockets are empty. 
Is this because there is no political will from the minister of agriculture?  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we certainly share the member's concern. 
In the past the Prime Minister has raised the matter directly with his counterpart. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, Canadians are concerned about the humanitarian crisis occurring in Kosovo. 
Canadians do not want that repeated.  
Why is the minister sending unarmed Canadians into this war zone?  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
There are several things in place.  
Under these circumstances we think it is important for Canada to contribute to- 
The hon. member for Trois-Rivieres.  
ICE BREAKING IN PORTS 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  
That is the real problem.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
I am sure the minister wants to move heaven and earth to feed these families. 
How is she going to make sure they eat well this winter?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
The cost of transportation of perishable goods to the north is extraordinary. 
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
The minister has a chance to do something. 
Will he act now? 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We are looking at it.  
We will take advice and we will do the right thing.  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
JUSTICE AND HUMAN RIGHTS 
Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. 
I am very proud to table this report.  
NATIONAL DEFENCE AND VETERANS AFFAIRS 
Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Fanshawe, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Unfortunately the report must come from the official opposition.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there consent to revert to reports from interparliamentary delegations?  
Mr. Bob Speller (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
PARLIAMENT OF CANADA ACT 
Mr. Speaker, I think you would find unanimous consent for the following motion: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is there unanimous consent of the House to move the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions that I would like to present to the House. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):
The petitioners ask that the government regulate the use of watercraft. 
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have a petition to present on the defence of provocation. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
It has to do with human rights.  
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
I am pleased that the Supreme Court of Canada recently concurred.  
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Mr. Gary Pillitteri (Niagara Falls, Lib.):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have three petitions to present today. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Question No. 129- Mr. Lee Morrison: 
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Federal taxes are levied at the manufacturing level. 
Consequently, no figures are available showing excise taxes collected in each province and territory. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
My constituents have been waiting 231 days.  
The RCMP gave its response to the government 114 days ago. 
Our record in responding to questions is very good. 
We have already responded to a very high percentage. 
I ask that all remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
Today we stand at the crossroads of a very important time in Canadian history. 
Bill C-57 is the bill in question. 
Let me answer that question as follows. 
Its judges will be appointed by the federal government. 
That court will be called the Nunavut court of justice.  
It represents another successful example of co-operative federalism. 
Bill C-57 is the result of those efforts.  
Currently a court party will fly into a community. 
The lawyer arrives on the same plane with the court party. 
The accused has 15 minutes to talk with the lawyer. 
The future of the accused is to be determined in that little time.  
The long waits between cases is just not healthy for anyone. 
Consequently they have to see each other in the store and the community hall. 
This would help address those situations which I just gave examples of.  
I would like to give another example. 
The people of Nunavut are already preparing for this. 
This arrangement has worked very well. 
Appeals in respect of indictable matters will remain unchanged.  
The review will lie to a single judge of the court of appeal of Nunavut.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments by the member for Nunavut. 
I congratulate also the local officials in Nunavut. 
Why is this different from the rest of Canada? 
The rest of Canada has a different system. 
Why are we giving a part of our country a different system of justice?  
These provinces do not get these changes.  
What this government is doing with this legislation is creating another province. 
The Skeena riding is 244,569 square kilometres itself. 
It is two-thirds the size. 
The Prince George-Peace River riding is 217,188 square kilometres. 
I need more time''. 
Why are we allowing this area of the country to get special treatment? 
We should use the same law system we have for the rest of Canada. 
The federally appointed judges are going to make $180,000 a year. 
Do we need this kind of expensive court? 
There will be three judges at $180,000 a year plus their expenses. 
They will get up to $300,000 or $400,000 each to operate. 
It will be well over a $1 million. 
That is not what we need in this country. 
It is not good legislation.  
The legislation calls for one senior judge and two other judges. 
As I said earlier, the salaries are very misleading. 
They do not take into case the new salary increases and also further increases. 
They also get their regular expenses. 
I know the workload those judges have.  
I know in the north they have to travel. 
But we also have that in the rest of Canada. 
That seems rather strange to me.  
Four members of parliament from British Columbia represent an area of 700,000 square kilometres. 
We have gone out of our way to set things aside.  
They need to happen because of where it is.  
There are probably better ways of doing this. 
This is not a small amount of money. 
That is roughly $20,000 for every man, woman and child there.  
I wonder who has made those decisions. 
I wonder how high that is going to go up every year. 
When do all these costs stop? 
I am sure I also would if I were their member of parliament also. 
Today this government brings it in regularly to run the House of Commons.  
They are the ones who changed this rule. 
It was a sad day for Canada when they did it. 
We accept the fact that it passed. 
We hope the government will be prepared to answer those questions at committee. 
Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):
Bill C-57 will permit this to happen.  
This immense territory is divided into three regions and includes 28 communities. 
The most southeasterly point of Nunavut meets northern Labrador. 
Nunavut is also bordered by water. 
Its most northerly part touches the shores of the Arctic Ocean. 
On the east, Baffin Bay divides Nunavut. 
So the Inuit are in the majority. 
In fact, the word Nunavut means our land in Inuktitut, the language of the Inuit.  
The Senate functions thanks to political paybacks. 
This objectivity is vital. 
Negotiations were broken off in 1977. 
Let us now return more specifically to Bill C-57. 
This is what Bill C-57 is all about.  
This transfer is nonetheless vital and responds to the needs of the far north.  
The structure of the court reflects the peculiarities of the eastern Arctic. 
We would be further enlightened by meetings with the principle stakeholders. 
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
Where Nunavut goes, the others are sure to follow.  
In speaking of the high standard, Nunavut is really to be envied. 
It is a territory that is able to start from scratch. 
Justice is an expression of our sovereignty. 
There is no community support. 
The legal system really has nothing to do with anybody. 
Circle sentencing is not an easy or a light process. 
It demands an incredible amount of dedication from the communities involved. 
They fill most of the prisons across this country and are overrepresented. 
Their cultures are not taken into account. 
Generally there is the federal level. 
The federal appointment comes from Ottawa. 
This certainly makes them less responsive to community demands.  
I have one main reservation with this bill which concerns the appointment of judges. 
There is no screening process in parliament for federal judge appointments. 
That is a big concern because it echoes what is going on here already. 
That is one thing we should not carry forward in creating the new system.  
The NDP will be supporting this bill, with some reservations. 
I look forward to considering it in committee.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I found that statement extremely interesting. 
It had a lot of compassion. 
I certainly support it. 
The need for justice to be delivered in Canada or anywhere else is very important. 
I could not agree more. 
It should be as close to the people as possible. 
It should be swift. 
Those are all extremely useful kinds of situations.  
However, why would we support a different kind of justice structure? 
I fail to see it. 
It seems that by definition justice has some kind of standard component. 
Justice, after all, is justice. 
We want to be treated fairly and equally before the law. 
Those who live in a large centre have a court. 
They have to wait until the circuit comes to them. 
But that is not what we are talking about. 
We are taking about a single level of courts here.  
That is a good change. 
That is the question.  
There will only be one circuit, not two or three. 
It will go to the same community, but will deal with different issues.  
I believe justice should be able to move forward and change. 
Who is this judge coming to my community? 
They have no idea who they are.  
This bring justice closer to the people. 
It is a good and important change.  
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
I certainly agree with that.  
It should be extended. 
We could look at a whole system for remote areas of the country.  
Bill C-57 could set the precedent. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
I believe that we owe that to the people in the remote areas of Canada.  
But I have a concern. 
Is that what the member meant? 
Mr. Speaker, no, that is not what I meant. 
The laws of Canada are the laws of the territories. 
It is just the method of making the courts and justice accessible.  
Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay-Boundary-Okanagan, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, there is something that gives me great concern. 
I would like to know what the appeal process is for that. 
But that means that the people of Nunavut will lose their right of appeal. 
Mr. Speaker, I share the member's concern. 
It will have to be addressed at committee. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Whether this will be the result remains questionable.  
One of the concerns of the Inuit is the location of prisons. 
These three judges will preside over civil, criminal and family cases. 
The PC Party was instrumental in establishing the basis for this new territory. 
I welcome the opportunity to study the legislation at committee.  
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
I guess it will not have much effect in terms of incarceration.  
The Conservative Party certainly has a long history of building prisons. 
If he could provide some information on that it would be helpful.  
We will be looking at that in committee. 
A number of questions with respect to the legislation have not yet been answered. 
It is something they would be very interested in. 
They also have the opportunity to wait and see. 
For them there is a benefit to be derived from that.  
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
I also commend the efforts of the hon. member for Nunavut. 
The people of Nunavut deserve better.  
I do not share these objections. 
Let us compare Nunavut's size and population with other jurisdictions. 
Nunavut's 1.9 million square kilometres fall just under the figure for Greenland. 
Then we factor in population distribution. 
Nunavut has only one-hundredth of one person for every square kilometre of physical territory. 
For example, Nunavut has only 20 kilometres of highway. 
Moreover, there is a disparity between communities. 
The largest community is its future capital, Iqaluit. 
More than 3,000 people call Iqaluit home. 
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened to the hon. member's comments with great interest. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.  
In Canada we have many provinces and territories. 
We have provincial and federal laws. 
I am sure this new act will help the people of the north. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to the hon. member. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Did I miss something?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member from the NDP for his question.  
He was more interesting in talking about the Senate. 
That is what I was relating to.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
These people live in an area of Canada that experiences a harsh climate. 
It is not a very large population at all but it is a huge expenditure.  
I suggest there is a good likelihood the challenge will succeed.  
What they are getting is a huge bureaucracy. 
We know they do not.  
I believe the thinking behind Nunavut is faulty.  
How much will this piece of legislation cost? 
Who is going to pay that?  
I just do not see that.  
I say there is something fundamentally wrong with that. 
I do not think anyone in the House would disagree. 
Yes, they still want to dictate to us. 
That is why Reform is here. 
I simply argue that this is not the case.  
I just do not understand that thinking at all.  
The legislation is in furtherance to that whole bad idea. 
Therefore I cannot support what is being proposed. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
We have a situation where apparently justice is the issue. 
Why should there be a separate system in this part of Canada?  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his excellent question. 
He has put his finger on a big part of the problem.  
It does not depend on any identifying or distinguishing characteristic. 
The legislation is another indicator that we have to be on guard against a danger. 
We see this expressed in many areas. 
We even see it expressed in the House. 
Those rights should be immutable. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
In 14 months we will be into a new millennium. 
I do not know if I have answered the member's question succinctly enough. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
TAX ON FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP) moved: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Debate is on the motion as amended.  
I will get into that a little later on.  
Dr. Tobin made the suggestion a number of years ago. 
The idea is to impose a very small tax on foreign currency transactions. 
Today it is about $1.3 trillion. 
That is a lot of money.  
The problem is spreading into Brazil and parts of Latin America.  
I think the answer is yes.  
We have had the Minister of Finance before the finance committee last night. 
I do not thing there is any denying that. 
That is one thing we should look at. 
This motion does not bind the government. 
He had papers commissioned on the Tobin tax at that time.  
In the last year there has been a change in government in both those places. 
As I said, this has been debated before. 
I want to give three examples of the so-called Tobin tax. 
This is the secondary objective but it is still a very important objective. 
Some money could be used for employment and jobs. 
There are many worthy causes around the world.  
How would this be implemented? 
There are a number of ways of doing it. 
Who would collect the tax? 
National governments would collect the tax around the world.  
This cuts across political lines. 
People are concerned about what is happening in Brazil. 
All of a sudden it started to tumble down like a deck of cards.  
It brought down some of my stocks.  
It probably brought down some of the member's stocks. 
I want to ask the House to take this motion seriously. 
It does not say that we should do this by ourselves. 
Of course we cannot do this by ourselves. 
It says that we should do it in concert with the international community. 
Change only comes if we pursue an idea. 
Canada is a highly respected country in the world. 
Canada could start talking about this idea with the new governments in Europe and France. 
There are new governments in France, Germany and Britain. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
A Tobin tax is one such option.  
But financial markets are not perfect institutions. 
Clearly they do not always get it right. 
They run on rumour. 
They sometimes ignore fundamentals and all too often they overshoot.  
I am sure that they will be debated for some time to come.  
All countries would have to agree. 
There are other practical problems. 
Financial turmoil was the inevitable result of these inappropriate policies and practices.  
The private sector gets involved only at the end, if at all. 
Quite clearly that is not an equitable way to share the burden. 
More to the point, it is no longer on.  
Obviously there is still work that needs to be done on this subject.  
Unfortunately those are very big ifs.  
The finance minister has demonstrated that leadership. 
We can support this motion in principle.  
In the meantime, we will continue to show leadership as a country. 
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
Today we are really having a discussion about socialist myths. 
In plain terms a financial transaction tax can be any tax. 
A financial transaction tax would ultimately discourage financial transactions. 
This would not be good for our economy. 
All opposition parties wanted a reduction in a specific tax. 
A nice result to help the medicine go down.  
The main purpose of taxing something is for the revenue it brings. 
Whose money is it anyway?  
Would redistribution favour countries that have important financial centres? 
What about assigning revenues to global causes? 
How could any international organization possibly get all the countries to agree? 
The power struggle that would occur would be disastrous.  
The story is similar in the United Kingdom. 
The U.K. is considering getting rid of the tax. 
Sweden has also had bad experiences with the tax. 
To get all countries onside appears to be an insurmountable task. 
That is his criteria. 
Obviously that would be absolutely impossible to achieve.  
It is impossible that all jurisdictions will subscribe to the methods of the Tobin tax. 
Complicated schemes will be developed to get around the tax. 
There is no end to it.  
In 1995 the IMF wrote a paper on financial transaction taxes. 
It spoke clearly about substitutions. 
The stated goal of the tax is to slow the velocity of foreign exchange markets. 
It would then become a very difficult disincentive for the overall world economy.  
The bottom line is that there are insurmountable loopholes through this idealistic scheme. 
Financial markets contain numerous products that are close substitutes to other products. 
A government bond is a close substitute to a high quality corporate bond. 
Bank deposits are substitutes for money market funds. 
If we tax one product, any investor is going to search out for a replacement.  
This would be disastrous for countries that went ahead and implemented the tax. 
Money moves when there is a failure to perform. 
Often the volatility of money in the world has to do with seeking higher performance. 
Therefore, I directly oppose the idea of a Tobin tax.  
We need lower taxes. 
Money markets worldwide are volatile. 
Eventually it is revealed that the underlying fundamentals of these- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sorry but the time for the hon. member has expired.  
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
And my colleague from Lac-Saint-Jean clearly demonstrated this. 
Wholesale unregulated globalization is a little scary.  
Members will see why later in my remarks.  
The meaning of ``financial transactions'' in general ought to be specified. 
Again, I think not.  
To sum up, yes, speculation should be taxed or regulated. 
People see what they want in it and it is blamed for many things.  
Only a few are missing.  
But this is what we have today. 
But there is a framework. 
How does it work? 
Who decides where meetings are held? 
International institutions are capable of working in harmony. 
However, people are playing Russian roulette with foreign currencies. 
Let me give you an example. 
This can have an impact at the international level. 
A few months or a few years down the road, unfortunately, Canada will be affected. 
I was listening to the parliamentary secretary and I was somewhat surprised. 
He also talked about the difficulties related to the implementation of such a tax. 
As even supporters of the concept willingly acknowledge: 
What did the government do with those recommendations? 
We never saw such a committee.  
In closing, I want to propose an amendment to Motion M-239. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
In fact, it sank like a rock. 
Periodically this monster pops up. 
Some people see it, typically during periods of turmoil.  
I have significant concerns about the Tobin tax. 
I do disagree with the concept of a Tobin tax. 
Those efficiencies can benefit in many ways as opposed to hurt.  
The Tobin tax would work against us.  
The main problem is enforceability.  
We can improve the reporting of governments. 
It is not the currency speculators. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House adjourned at 6.30 p.m. )
