Thursday, December 16, 1999 
The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
That person, of course, was Richard Greene. 
I simply assure Richard that our friendship will never end. 
Those memories, I share with Richard Greene.  
It shows what will happen in this chamber. 
Richard was a professional to the end. 
I thank you for those years in which we worked together, Richard. 
You will be missed.  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, there is an underlying plot here that we did not see. 
I think Mr. Greene was highly inspired by that event.  
Mr. Greene and I have travelled and worked together. 
That is what I am hoping he will do.  
Canada-Europe Parliamentary Association 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
You will notice that North America and Europe are close geographic neighbours. 
All this will be economically feasible early in the next century. 
I take this opportunity to wish all senators a merry new millennium.  
Contributions of Prominent Canadian Women 
As a society, we owe them a great deal. 
Time prevents me from mentioning them all. 
This year, we are celebrating the 70th anniversary of the Persons case. 
Therese Casgrain was the first Canadian woman to lead a political party. 
The convention is still held today, a lasting tribute to her efforts.  
Other Canadian heroines include Elizabeth Bagshaw, Dr. Marion Powell and Dr. Lise Fortier. 
She directed the Ontario clinic illegally from 1932 to 1966. 
Dr. Powell did the same in Toronto. 
All have shown courage, tenacity, leadership and talent. 
And may these words of Nellie McClung inspire our heroines of tomorrow.  
Condition of Senator Willie Adams 
The prognosis looks very good.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Government Response to Report of Special Committee Tabled 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
State of Domestic and International Financial System 
Report of Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee on Study Presented 
Thursday, December 16, 1999 
The Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce has the honour to present its 
The report was adopted by the Senate on Tuesday, December 14, 1999. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Internal Economy, Budget and Administration 
Third Report of Committee Tabled 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Gary needs no introduction to any of us. 
He has served us faithfully and well. 
He is a teacher. 
Above all, Gary has given us outstanding service. 
He is one of those who is intent upon serving. 
I know that he will continue that attitude in his new position.  
Allow me to recount an apocryphal story. 
It was a suit for a height-challenged and rather rotund male. 
Richard fit the suit perfectly. 
He got the job and has been with us ever since. 
That is the exercise of power.  
Richard, I want to say congratulations from Gerry and Nicky as well.  
We welcome them to their new positions. 
We congratulate them and thank them for their work in the past. 
I thank them for the high quality of service that they have provided to us. 
The Hon. The Speaker :
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
He is a most efficient man, and a very reserved man as well. 
Thursday, December 16, 1999 
The Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has the honour to present its 
Clause 9, page 18: 
(a) Replace line 26 with the following: 
(b) Add after line 38, the following: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Statistics Act National Archives of Canada Act 
Bill to Amend-First Reading 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Canada-Europe Parliamentary Association 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Canada-France Inter-Parliamentary Association 
Agriculture and Agri-Food 
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
I have been asking questions on this topic for a year and a half. 
They did an excellent job. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Did the Prime Minister meet with the committee?  
That committee did a wonderful job, and I was there to see it. 
What golf course is he on? 
That is what we have to find out.  
Plight of Western Grain Farmers 
Honourable senators, I have a supplementary question on this issue. 
Well, it is time to get a little rough around here!  
We on this side of the floor have been very patient. 
We have asked these questions for a year and a half now. 
It is not as though we raised this issue just yesterday. 
I have asked these questions. 
We may have a bad program." 
Everyone in the country knows it is bad. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Their solution is simply to ask for more money from the federal government. 
He is very proud of that, and he should be. 
Plight of Western Grain Farmers- Request for Response by Prime Minister 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Second, we need a clear statement that something will be done.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
There was a process and it is a joint program. 
Admittedly, the program is not functioning properly. 
We have had discussions of that nature here and in other places. 
The federal government committed $170 million to the program. 
That would have been consistent with the joint program. 
They did not say that. 
As my mother would say, two wrongs do not make a right. 
The Prime Minister has a responsibility for the entire country. 
Honourable senators, I appreciate the concern raised by Senator Andreychuk. 
Hon. Jean-Robert Gauthier :
This is yet another problem!  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I was able to seek some advice with respect to it. 
It exercises that authority within constitutional jurisdiction. 
That authority is given to it in the form of provincial legislation.  
However, that does not translate into an ability to declare itself officially a bilingual city. 
Yesterday, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs said: 
The government has indicated that it is reviewing possible options. 
No decision has been made at this point with respect to those options. 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
Honourable senators, the senator asked the very question I had in mind. 
I thank the honourable senator for that comment. 
In that respect, the municipality has no authority.  
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
I asked Senator Joyal about the disallowance power. 
I understand that it has fallen into disrepute. 
None are the preferred option. 
I will ensure that this option is before the Attorney General as well.  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
A country has one capital. 
I take a different approach. 
That is another debate.  
That is a completely different debate.  
Second, it is not a partisan issue. 
The views of honourable senators are well known and must be regarded seriously. 
I am confident that the government shares those views.  
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
The question revolves around the expression itself.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I am aware of the situation of which the honourable senator speaks. 
These negotiations are conducted like all negotiations. 
There is give and take and much argument on both sides. 
Positions are advanced and compromises are made.  
It was signed by both parties. 
Honourable senators, it has been three weeks or more since I had that brief meeting. 
Request for Response to Committee Report on Aboriginal Veterans 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Many aboriginal veterans have died since that report was presented. 
The government's response is extremely important to those who survive. 
When will we receive a response from the government?  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, this is the first time this issue has been brought to my attention. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I regret that the time for Question Period has expired.  
Appropriation Bill No. 3, 1999-2000 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
On page 3 of the bill, clause 6 provides: 
Under "Purpose", paragraph 933, we see: 
Honourable senators, clause 6 presents a problem with this bill. 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, I thank the Honourable Senator Kinsella for his question. 
As I said, I missed part of the honourable senator's question.  
Honourable senators, this is the issue and this is the principle. 
If you look at page 30 of the bill, Schedule 2 is: 
In addition, Schedule 2 refers to: 
Honourable senators, this bill deserves proper consideration. 
In addition he was performing his duty as a senator. 
I am grateful that we all will be paid.  
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.  
Income Tax Conventions Implementation Bill, 1999 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I thank Senator Cools for that royal consent, which I appreciate very much.  
Her comments are sufficient enough that mine will be very brief. 
Hopefully, that is something which will be emphasized over the years.  
The treaties are all fairly similar. 
They are meant to avoid double taxation and tax avoidance.  
Her answer was as follows: 
Even when sanctions are multilateral and well enforced, they are not always particularly effective.  
This a philosophical argument that we need not get into today. 
Some people feel that engagement is the key. 
I feel that isolation and boycotting might have more impact. 
Again, though, that is highly theoretical and hypothetical at this stage. 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Will the honourable senator accept a brief question?  
Honourable senators, I thank Senator Grafstein for that excellent suggestion. 
Hon. Celine Hervieux-Payette :
I therefore move passage of Bill S-3.  
Nisga'a Final Agreement Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
The bill before us is an historic achievement. 
The only organized communities in the Nass Valley are Nisga'a communities.  
They have a complex culture which is based on the rich resources of the sea. 
They can also be found in many of the world's museums.  
Today, about 2,500 of the 5,500 Nisga'a live in four villages:
Kincolith, Greenville, Canyon City and New Aiyansh. 
Most other Nisga'a live in Terrace, Prince Rupert or Vancouver. 
High value is placed on schooling and post-secondary education. 
The Nisga'a operate their own provincial school district, School District No. 92. 
One seat on the elected school board is reserved for a non-Nisga'a resident. 
They have also worked cooperatively with their neighbours. 
Their trip to Victoria was unsuccessful.  
In 1890, they established their first land committee. 
In 1973, the Supreme Court issued the Calder decision. 
Only with the full consent of the stakeholders can we progress.  
Negotiations commenced in 1976. 
The Nisga'a government will be a democratic government within the established Canadian model.  
It will operate within and be subject to the Constitution of Canada. 
The treaty sets out specific requirements of the Nisga'a Constitution which must be met. 
These cannot be overturned by any future Nisga'a government. 
It can and will be held politically and legally accountable for the decisions it makes.  
The treaty establishes three urban locals in Terrace, Prince Rupert and Greater Vancouver. 
Let me now turn to the Nisga'a law-making authority. 
They must meet a number of other requirements. 
They also have to be consistent with the Nisga'a Constitution itself.  
The Nisga'a treaty makes this abundantly clear.  
In this third category, federal and provincial laws would prevail over Nisga'a law. 
As I have said earlier, this is a practical and workable arrangement.  
The Nisga'a Final Agreement achieves this objective. 
The Mayor of the City of Terrace, Jack Talstra, said to the standing committee: 
We wish our Nisga'a neighbours well. 
Let us move forward with this new treaty.  
In future, the Nisga'a will be able to develop Nisga'a lands. 
I say to my fellow British Columbians that such a risk is not justifiable.  
That is not the case at all.  
This is a false belief. 
The Nisga'a Final Agreement provides for a "modification of rights" approach. 
Mr. Campbell conceded in his submission to the standing committee in the other place that: 
Honourable senators, that is exactly what we have done.  
He has caused litigation to be commenced to seek judicial intervention and interpretation.  
The courts have confirmed that those rights may be infringed where proper justification exists.  
Honourable senators, the Nisga'a treaty states: 
Further on, Professor Monahan says: 
The legislative power remains unimpaired. 
A further criticism of Bill C-9 is that it is based on race discrimination. 
In the same article he says: 
There must also be one law for all people.  
All private property rights are fully protected. 
It is possible, in Canada, to be aboriginal and to be Canadian. 
They look forward to freeing themselves from financial dependency.  
Later in his remarks he said: 
As significant as any matter which was enacted at the time was section 35. 
This system works very well.  
Is that the case?  
I wish to thank Senator Beaudoin for that question. 
Therefore, we have the concept of section 35 protecting the rights contained within this agreement. 
I do not have any problem with the rest of the agreement.  
I look forward to that study.  
The honourable senator raises an essential point. 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
I have a question for Senator Austin. 
Some describe that as the "right of return." 
The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate that the following communication had been received: 
The Honourable The Speaker of the Senate Ottawa 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Parliament of Canada Act 
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
Nevertheless, I am grateful to him for making this suggestion to the Senate. 
He has had months to do so. 
You should therefore know that I am biased.  
I found this sentence written by Beaudelaire: 
...and no one answered.  
Stello defends a very particular point of view, which I share almost entirely. 
To separate poetic life from political life.  
And to achieve that: 
Here is Dr. Noir's second precept to the poet: 
Alone and free, to accomplish one's mission. 
Because Solitude alone is the source of inspiration.  
There is a lot more, but that is the essential.  
What sort of line divides language and power? 
And all honour to the poet for that. 
I shall do so during the adjournment, after the holiday season. 
What has happened to our ability to dream, our talent to explore? 
It is as if we lacked the maturity to do anything new. 
Are we so lacking? 
I am not speaking for the poets, I am expressing a profound conviction of mine.  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Order Stands 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Second Report of Joint Committee Adopted 
Hon. Rose-Marie Losier-Cool :
Honourable senators, I move that this report be adopted.  
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
First Report of Joint Committee Adopted 
Hon. Celine Hervieux-Payette :
Honourable senators, I move that this report be adopted.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is it your pleasure to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Report of Foreign Affairs Committee on Study- Order Stands 
Hon. Peter A. Stollery :
Honourable senators, I should like Order No. 4 to remain standing in my name.  
The Foreign Affairs Committee has been quite busy of late. 
Honourable senators, I move that this report be adopted.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is it your pleasure to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
You should be grateful for all the good things we do for you. 
Just do not ask for recognition or acknowledgement of what you are. 
Do not expect anything as a right. 
How does it feel? 
Honourable senators, it hurts. 
That is no small matter. 
I commend the Government of Ontario for taking that step.  
I am sure that none of us disputes that or would wish to dispute it. 
It is also indisputable that Ottawa is a special case. 
The National Capital Region is not the capital. 
In Canada, we have two official languages. 
It is one of the pillars of our identity and of our national policies. 
That raises a whole different provincial matter. 
That, however, does not affect the Ottawa question at all.  
There have been court cases to that effect. 
We know that there is some resistance to this step in some quarters. 
We can come to embrace that change. 
They never spoke French. 
They were proud that I learned to do so. 
I am eternally grateful to them for having given me that opportunity.  
Why do we have flags, for example, if symbolism does not matter? 
Symbolism matters enormously to all of us. 
Where does it matter more than in the capital of the country?  
There are considerations of possible federal action. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Once that is concluded, we will continue the debate.  
The commission was read by a Clerk at the Table.  
May it please Your Honour: 
To which bill I humbly request Your Honour's assent.  
The House of Commons withdrew.  
The Honourable the Deputy Governor General was pleased to retire.  
A number of federal states have bilingual, if not multilingual, capital cities.  
The division of jurisdictions must be respected.  
That is already something.  
I have come to the conclusion that the capital of our country must be bilingual.  
Honourable senators, I listened with great interest to the comments made by Senator Beaudoin. 
You said that Part VII was obligatory and not merely declaratory.  
This matter is currently before the courts. 
Honourable senators, basically we all want the same thing. 
We are all fighting for the same outcome. 
It is contested, but this is our system. 
We must try to lay our arguments before in court.  
That the capital of Canada would be anything but bilingual is unthinkable. 
Canada and bilingualism are synonymous; they are one.  
Since 1898, the Yukon has had a very active and proud francophone community. 
Today, they are represented by the Association francophone Yukonnaise. 
It is a unity issue. 
Bilingualism is a given. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, an agreement has been reached. 
Report of Aboriginal Peoples Committee on Study Adopted 
Leave having been given to revert to Reports of Committees: 
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Social Affairs, Science and Technology 
Committee Authorized to Study State of Heath Care System 
In particular, the Committee shall be authorized to examine: 
( a ) The fundamental principles on which Canada's publicly funded health care system is based; 
( b ) The historical development of Canada's health care system; 
( c ) Publicly funded health care systems in foreign jurisdictions; 
( d ) The pressures on and constraints of Canada's health care system; and 
( e ) The role of the federal government in Canada's health care system; 
That the Committee submit its final report no later than December 14, 2001; and 
Honourable Senator Di Nino ). 
Honourable senators, I support this initiative, as do other members of the committee. 
We must study this issue seriously. 
There are many realities that we must face. 
I respectfully request that authorization for this study be granted.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Do any other honourable senators wish to speak?  
Honourable senators, I will make only two very short comments. 
Honourable senators, those are my comments. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. Peter A. Stollery , pursuant to notice of December 9, 1999, moved: 
Recommendations of Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples Respecting Aboriginal Governance 
Aboriginal Peoples Committee Authorized to Extend Date of Final Report on Study 
2. the mechanisms of implementing such new structural relationships; and 
Motion in Support of Declaring Ottawa Officially Bilingual Adopted 
Hon. Jean-Robert Gauthier , pursuant to notice of December 15, 1999, moved: 
I hope that this debate will continue to be apolitical.  
A check in the dictionary shows that the word "official" means: 
...emanating from an authority that is recognized, duly sanctioned, authorized, et cetera...  
Honourable senators, I was born in Ottawa. 
I have lived here all my life. 
I call upon my friends in the Senate to support this motion.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Ours is an officially bilingual province.  
The only province in Canada to be officially bilingual. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
I always thought of myself as Senator Gauthier's assistant. 
Honourable senators, it is very easy to be divisive in order to be popular. 
It is too easy to do so. 
I was supposed to bring greetings from Mr. Pearson, who had to return to Ottawa. 
I have never chosen the easy road, which is to denounce. 
They are now in Mr. Pettigrew's district. 
This is why I congratulate Senator Kinsella. 
He is not afraid to express his opinion. 
I just returned from Pakistan, among other places. 
It is a country that is in the making every day. 
Sometimes, you must refrain from trying to get even, as some of us do. 
Honourable senators, each of us has a duty. 
We should rededicate ourselves to Canada. 
Hon. Norman K. Atkins :
Honourable senators, I want to congratulate Senator Gauthier on his motion. 
Honourable senators, I rise to speak on this motion for two main reasons. 
First, I want to support Senator Gauthier. 
Senator Gauthier and I were both elected in 1972. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I am sorry to interrupt you but it is six o'clock.  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Your Honour, I propose that we not see the clock.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
Then, as unilingual anglophones, we had to learn a lot about Canada. 
Many of us still do not speak French. 
We speak the language of Shakespeare. 
I can see Senator Cochrane admonishing me from her place. 
We make no apologies for that. 
It is other people who have changed the English language, not us.  
The linguistic status of Ottawa is neither a francophone issue nor an anglophone issue. 
It is a Canadian issue. 
This provision is important. 
That is why I support this motion, honourable senators.  
Senator Gauthier was put on earth for a moment like this. 
The farther we go from the centre, often the harder the struggle becomes. 
This issue is a battleground.  
I am proud to stand beside my colleague Senator Gauthier on this question. 
Of course, they do!  
I say to Senator Gauthier, "Thank you." 
My mother cleaned that glass and put it on a stand in the living room. 
Hon. Francis William Mahovlich :
We were very successful; and 1972 was a very good year.  
Honourable senators, I wish to express my support for Senator Gauthier's motion. 
I thought it would be taken for granted that I would support that motion. 
Of course I support it. 
We must encourage people to respect both official languages of the country. 
I unconditionally and sincerely support this motion.  
Honourable senators, today we see the position the Senate occupies in our country. 
All the teams that support us deserve our congratulations.  
Hon. Louis J. Robichaud :
We also hold something else dear, and that is bilingualism. 
We would so like to see an end to these battles. 
We would so like not to have to fight to have bilingualism officially recognized.  
I did not intend to say anything at all. 
I am very clearly in favour of bilingualism.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
If no other senator wishes to speak, I will proceed. 
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Leave having been given to revert to Government Notices of Motions: 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I wish everyone a very Merry Christmas and a very Happy New Year. 
I wish you all the very best for the coming year. 
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, February 8, 2000, at 2 p.m.
