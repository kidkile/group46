Wednesday, October 7, 1998 
The House met at 2 p.m. 
Members sang the national anthem ] 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
These awards honour all aspects of English language television production in Canada. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
People of the Pacheedaht and Kwicksutaineuk bands and others are pleading for answers. 
The minister of aboriginal affairs must get her head out of the sand. 
She must stop the thuggery that is taking place on some of the reserves. 
She must do her job to help these people to help themselves.  
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
Their community spirit and determination has certainly paid off.  
Here's to Merrickville, the best bloomin' village in all of Canada.  
INTERNATIONAL RURAL WOMEN'S DAY 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
Bernadette was a humble and unassuming woman who went to church every day. 
When she died, over 30 priests attended her funeral. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
The minister is burying his head in a stubble field. 
Next year will be worse.  
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
Realizing the Potential of Global Electronic Commerce''.  
It allows people to connect with each other. 
Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne-Blainville, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, here we thought the fight for equality had been won. 
We thought discrimination in all its forms was a thing of the past. 
Men and women were equal before the law. 
And before that, the poll tax was eliminated.  
SACRED WALK FOR HEALING 
Mr. Robert D. Nault (Kenora-Rainy River, Lib.):
He is the first aboriginal bishop in the Anglican church. 
They began in Lac Seul and have today reached their destination of Ottawa.  
This is something we all can do, everyone together''.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
I want this House to go beyond a sense of concern. 
Obviously, Canadians are outraged over the horrors being endured by civilians in Kosovo.  
SACRED WALK FOR HEALING 
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
He attended a reception in his honour hosted by All Saints Anglican Church.  
The actions of Bishop Beardy and his companions speak for themselves.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
He went on ``We will invest in children, our most important resource''.  
In keeping with their tradition, the Liberals did exactly the opposite. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
He has broken that promise. 
All they seek is fair compensation and equal treatment. 
They gave the Minister of Veterans Affairs the benefit of the doubt. 
The hon. member for Brome-Missisquoi.  
INTERNATIONAL EASTERN TOWNSHIPS DUCK FESTIVAL 
Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the solicitor general is supposed to be the nation's top cop. 
Why is the solicitor general still sitting in cabinet?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
The person I was speaking with supported my position.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
These petty boasts have betrayed sensitive government business. 
When will the Prime Minister demand the solicitor general's resignation?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
``There was absolutely no reference per se to Airbus. 
Again the hon. member does not have her facts right, as usual.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is a funny thing. 
He defends him, supports him and brags him up.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
That is the best proof coming from that member. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is absolutely no respect for the truth. 
There was no discussion of Airbus in that discussion.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
It means that there is a new rule for solicitors general. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The hon. members have written questions. 
They are not quick enough to correct them. 
They have to read them again. 
I am telling them not to refer to Airbus. 
The hon. leader of the Bloc Quebecois.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
They did an excellent job at the G-7 summit in Halifax. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
On Monday, the Solicitor General suffered a complete memory lapse. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
To me, that is good enough. 
As for the notes allegedly made, are they accurate or not? 
The hon. member for Roberval.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
The hon. leader of the New Democratic Party.  
If the solicitor general resigns, who will act as cover for the Prime Minister? 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I have never needed any cover to defend myself.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
The Prime Minister said it himself:
Why is the Prime Minister refusing to do the same thing? 
Does he have something to hide?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
After that, everyone will know the truth.  
I am sorry to have to interrupt the Right Hon. Prime Minister. 
The hon. member for Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough now has the floor.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Will the solicitor general be accountable for his mistakes? 
Will he act honourably? 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
I think the request from hon. members hits back in the other direction.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
The solicitor general general strikes out on all three of those. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I cannot have a better witness than the member for Palliser.  
Who is not following the rules? 
He just wants to score cheap political points.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Prime Minister.  
This minister had public discussions on the airplane. 
Everyone can make mistakes. 
He talked about the new international centre for correctional studies in Canada. 
That is before the cabinet of this country.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have debate. 
At this moment everybody is talking about the next budget. 
Everybody is raising questions about what we should do.  
Today we have participation because we have an open government. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
What time did he do that on Monday?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
I could not recall who I was sitting with on the airplane.  
I determined who was sitting beside me. 
I made a phone call. 
I found out what the discussion was about. 
That is the basis of my position and it is the truth.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have discussed this problem. 
That would serve everyone's interests.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I would ask the Prime Minister not to change the subject.  
We are not talking about the commission, but about his minister. 
Mr. Toole's letter is clear. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I answered that question yesterday and again today. 
The solicitor general has the confidence of the government.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, let us summarize here. 
We have the solicitor general prejudging the outcome of the APEC inquiry. 
He is publicly commenting on Frank Moores and Karlheinz Schreiber. 
Finally, he is breaching cabinet security.  
When is the minister going to resign?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, all three of those allegations are false.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
When is he going to pick one and resign?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
I think it is unworthy of this place. 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the answer is no.  
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
It has now been proven that this minister has loose lips.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the solicitor general rose in this House. 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Headlines across the country indicate that he is the fall guy. 
I thought people were innocent in this country until proven guilty.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
He has obviously prejudiced the outcome of this procedure.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, six times I have said no. 
Maybe they are not listening.  
We have an inquiry that is looking into the matter at this moment.  
What is is amazing is that hon. members only have this to talk about. 
There is only one little problem. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
In other words, the Solicitor General did speak of it.  
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. leader of the Bloc Quebecois. 
The Solicitor General now has the floor.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have replied to the same question many, many times. 
He has been an extremely diligent member. 
Usually a snooper does not get his facts right.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
That was then, this is now, Mr. Speaker. 
If he was not talking about Airbus, exactly what was he talking about?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
The solicitor general cannot have it both ways. 
Will he fess up? 
Will he tell the truth? 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
This parliament is not going to operate on that level- 
On both sides we are getting very close in our language. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my supplementary is for the Prime Minister. 
Will he boycott the Malaysia APEC summit?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Should we boycott the UN because they are at the UN? 
Should we boycott every international organization because they happen to be members of those organizations?  
The hon. member for Madawaska-Restigouche.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Will the minister do the honourable thing and resign?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, what the hon. member is alleging is absolutely not true.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Will the Prime Minister protect the confidentiality and integrity of future inquiries? 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
There was no reference to it.  
If he had discussed it, I would act differently, but he did not. 
Ms. Colleen Beaumier (Brampton West-Mississauga, Lib.):
There are presently four more Baha'is on death row.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
I take this extremely seriously. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
This is even better.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
I hope Robin Hood is not here today. 
I would ask the hon. member to please put his question.  
My question to the Prime Minister is this:
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is a debate on this. 
It is interesting to note that other members are holding public consultations. 
I could table the press clipping in the House.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau, Lib.):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
We have found it deficient in some safety areas. 
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
If he was not talking about Airbus, what was he talking about?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
The conversation on the aircraft was private and nobody should have been eavesdropping.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Does he consider that usual and responsible?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
That is what I discussed.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
That is the way the opposition seems to work these days.  
I will be tabling the report very soon. 
I think the hon. member will find it very interesting.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Justice must not only be done; it must be seen to be done.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The people will know exactly what the facts are. 
Is the hon. member's question of privilege arising from question period?  
Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question of privilege arises from question period. 
However I am going to try to make my point as succinctly as I can.  
It stops me from hearing the question- 
The House of Commons, in its wisdom, has had discussions. 
The hon. member has another avenue by which he can pursue this matter. 
I am sure we can give him this advice a bit later.  
As a question of privilege I would judge it is not a question of privilege.  
COMMENTS DURING QUESTION PERIOD 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Generally speaking there is no word which in and of itself is unparliamentary. 
We would not permit one member to call another member a liar. 
I do not say this facetiously.  
I take the admonition in the spirit in which it is given.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?

Question No. 111- Mr. Chris Axworthy: 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
QUESTION PASSED AS ORDER FOR RETURN 
Question No. 91- Mr. John Cummins: 
I ask, Mr. Speaker, that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
In accordance with the order made earlier this day, we will resume the debate.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
It is an omnibus bill.  
Let me say this at the outset. 
Bill C-51 deals with gambling. 
Does it deal with gambling as an addiction? 
Does it deal with the increasing problem of gambling as a health issue? 
What does the bill do? 
Are we dealing with violent crime? 
Those convicted of violent crimes too often receive concurrent sentences. 
The government could have dealt with that. 
Child prostitution is a huge problem in our country. 
Prostitutes as young as 11 or 12 are being procured. 
What has the government done concerning child prostitution? 
It has invoked suggestions and amendments to ensure that wiretaps are allowed. 
Our party has been putting forward constructive solutions for years.  
Why do we have mandatory minimum sentencing for anybody who is pimping children? 
She should go to Vancouver or Toronto. 
She should see what is occurring on the street.  
Let us consider conditional sentencing. 
Let us consider organized crime. 
They have to apply for consideration for parole.  
We are fully sympathetic with giving people a chance. 
This has to do with people who commit murder. 
This has to do with gross abuse of innocent civilians in our country. 
Those are the people we need to be hitting hard. 
The government had an opportunity to deal with crime prevention. 
I think it is a move in the right direction. 
It saves the taxpayer $30,000 per child. 
How can hon. members disagree with that? 
The government has an enormous leadership role. 
Then they could find out what does not work and eject those programs. 
They could keep what works and integrate those programs into a national program.  
It is only the ministers who are sitting across from us today. 
Let us get on with it. 
Let us not see a bill such as Bill C-51. 
They are win-win situations across party lines.  
Let us stop introducing politics into these issues and deal with the facts. 
Look at those solutions based on facts and implement them.  
The government could also deal with the horrendous situations on aboriginal reserves. 
They need to deal with the horrendous situations that are occurring on the reserves. 
Many of my colleagues and I have aboriginal reserves in our constituencies. 
Are these moneys being used for education? 
Are they being used for substance abuse issues? 
Are they used for training? 
People turn a blind eye. 
They stick their heads in the sand.  
Money is given without accountability. 
Who do they abuse? 
When they go to their councils, a blind eye is turned on them again.  
Money that is supposed to go to them for educational purposes is somehow disappearing. 
It is alleged that it is going into the hands of the council. 
Does anybody look into this? 
Because we are being hamstrung by political correctness and we are afraid to.  
I challenge any member on the other side to look at this.  
Whose confidence do we lose? 
They want to be the masters of their destiny. 
They want what we want.  
Why have we done this? 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
The problem seems to be a lack of democratic accountability. 
Is there room for improvement in all provinces in that regard?  
It deals with the issue of democratic accountability.  
Right now many bands are run very well but many are not. 
No one is helping them out. 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
I will try to limit myself to the 40 minutes allotted me.  
The reason is quite simple. 
I am convinced that Loto-Quebec will be very interested in that provision.  
The bill modernizes the fraud and theft provisions in respect of valuable minerals.  
I believe it is pertinent to read it: 
( a ) all the people participating in the lottery scheme are located on the ship; 
( d ) the ship is registered 
It is also supported unanimously by the greater Quebec City regional community. 
It was said that the Bloc Quebecois would block the system. 
A very intellectual remark.  
We had, and we still have, a role to play. 
We have no problem there. 
This is a monumental aberration. 
Every one of us has a legitimate right to sit here. 
We have all been democratically elected to this place. 
No one in Canada had a gun to their head when they voted. 
We are not perfect. 
We do our best and have strong beliefs. 
I am asking our fellow members of Parliament to respect us as individuals. 
We were elected in a fair manner. 
We gained some experience as a regional caucus during the previous Parliament.  
As well, ships that already come here, could do so more often. 
This would develop many more stopovers.  
Most of these ships have American passengers. 
We say: let us amend the Criminal Code. 
We have no problem with that. 
That is perfectly normal.  
Changes to the Criminal Code-authorization of casinos on the St. Lawrence 
Unfortunately, nothing came of it, and no progress has been made on this issue. 
I do not think so. 
That is Mr. Giguere, the president of the Quebec Urban Community, speaking.  
And it is signed ``Denis Giguere, President of the Quebec Urban Community''. 
We received a copy of this letter.  
This fact prompted the managing director of the port de Quebec, Ross Gaudreault, to say: 
The article went on to say: 
And I will stop here.  
The minister's response was a very simple one. 
According to all the economic studies, they contribute a lot when they come ashore. 
Let us not forget that these are people who are rather well off.  
I will get the numbers for 1997, but they were significantly higher. 
Unless I am mistaken, they were close to 900,000. 
I am pleased to have had this opportunity to address the bill. 
We do hope the government will be receptive to our recommendations.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
That was over an omnibus bill.  
I have a casino in my own riding called Club Regent. 
Yet today that is the case.  
I am sure a lot of my constituents are happy that it is there. 
It is a good location for them. 
Sometimes they win, sometimes they lose, but it is not destructive.  
However, the fact is that for a lot of Canadians it is destructive. 
It is destructive of their economic and personal lives. 
Where can they build another casino? 
It was frowned upon. 
It seemed to be something on the seedy side of life.  
I think that is a mistake. 
I think a lot of Canadians think it is a mistake. 
I just wanted to put that concern on the record. 
It is certainly something that comes not just out of my own political tradition. 
Up until this point we have not allowed people to participate in throwing the dice. 
We know that gambling disproportionately disadvantages the poor. 
There will be no significant increases in CPP or OAS. 
I am paraphrasing, but members know the teaching I am talking about.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of this bill. 
It does provide safety and security for families. 
That is simply not the reality experienced in this country.  
It is a bill that police chiefs and police associations have supported in large number. 
It is scandal envy. 
Members opposite see what President Clinton is going through. 
Why not make up a scandal and get somebody? 
All this is done instead of getting on with the business of running the country. 
We do not have questions about those issues. 
What do we have? 
Members say that we should not be playing politics.  
I want to talk about the gambling issue. 
The casino in Windsor generates hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue. 
Can we close them? 
What will those casinos do to the casino in Windsor? 
It has a serious problem in competing with them.  
What is our option? 
What damage were they doing? 
The provincial government came along and said ``They are unregulated. 
They are out of control. 
The provincial government called for proposals. 
Proponents submitted proposals and spent millions of dollars. 
Give us some lifeblood. 
Give us some opportunity to survive''.  
What are their options? 
But we now have no choice. 
We all know this.  
It is because they want to change the victim's mind. 
Most of the time it is the woman who is suffering from this violence.  
This bill says that cannot be done any more. 
They can no longer interfere.  
Why is that important? 
We administered social services during that time and still do. 
My wife is currently a member of that council. 
We dealt at the ground level with the results. 
They refuse to proceed. 
To vote against the bill will mean this change will not occur.  
There is the issue surrounding child prostitution. 
As well, the bill will benefit police enforcement. 
The bill will allow that to take place.  
The government has done that in other areas. 
To suggest otherwise is playing politics. 
Who are those organizations?  
However it has been done appropriately. 
We are a safe country. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
I listened very carefully to Liberal members. 
The Liberals are doing six things with the bill. 
Let us remember that number. 
I will go over those six things very soon.  
The Liberals care more about criminals than about victims.  
Bill C-35 is another example. 
What they are proposing in the bill is very weak and indeed very meek.  
There is nothing of that sort. 
Canadians do not even take cruise ships because they cannot afford it. 
The Liberal government is not fooling anyone. 
There is a contradiction between both governments.  
Do the Liberals forget what synergy means? 
Do they want to make two plus two equal three or five?  
The second effort in Bill C-51 is the homicide amendment. 
We had a death recently in my constituency of Surrey Central. 
Sandor Nyerges was a deaf and mute 80 year old veteran of two world wars. 
He was attacked in a botched robbery attempt in his home. 
North America has a serious drug abuse problem. 
In the lower mainland of British Columbia this problem is well known. 
Injection drug use is on the rise and prevalent. 
It is the most dangerous and serious of the drug use categories. 
It causes people to become sick, reckless and desperate. 
The Liberals could have gone further. 
However the Liberals are not getting tough on crime.  
The government missed another opportunity today to get tough on crime.  
The fifth area the bill deals with is organized crime. 
There is a big change. 
The Liberal government should not be concerned about the rehabilitation of the criminal. 
It should be concerned about the criminal committing further crimes. 
Again the Liberals are not getting tough on crime.  
For example, in some societies gambling is allowed.  
Our government should be proactive and not just reactive.  
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
I am not sure of this.  
We do need laws, of course. 
My question does not address crime per se. 
How can we eradicate it in a highly civilized society? 
I believe this can be done through prevention.  
It grows, and becomes part of his very being. 
My point is that what is needed is prevention. 
But it does not mean I necessarily agree with him in what he is saying.  
Prevention is always good and prevention is better than a cure. 
All Canadians are demanding that our laws be tougher so that we can prevent crime.  
Bills we see in this House do not have any teeth. 
But this government has not done that.  
Our system is such that it is a motivation for the criminals to commit crime. 
It is not a deterrent to prevent crime.  
This government is at fault.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
I refer him to issues around domestic violence. 
Why is it not listening to victims? 
Why is it determined only to listen to the criminals? 
Criminals are committing crimes and getting away with it.  
That is why we are not supporting this bill. 
This government does not listen to the people. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
SCHOLARSHIPS NAMED AFTER OLYMPIC ATHLETES 
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP) moved 
This is what Canadian universities have wanted to avoid. 
Bill S-9 is an insidious bill. 
I think the Liberals in this House should be absolutely ashamed of themselves. 
I cannot believe it.  
It is a five to one ratio. 
This would help Canadian universities as well. 
I salute and support those efforts by the Canadian Federation of Students.  
Our students are now handcuffed. 
We need more heroes like that. 
We also won silver and bronze medals. 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
It is unfortunate, however, when we politicize the Olympic games and our Olympic champions. 
I will not go into the great flag flap during this debate. 
There was excitement in their success and that of our bobsled team.  
Some people made disparaging remarks about curling being an Olympic sport. 
One of our smaller provinces turns out tremendously talented athletes who did- 
And members of Parliament too. 
I do not know about that. 
There is a need at times for athletes to train in warmer climates. 
That has not been the case in the past.  
Other forms of scholarships exist which I will go into momentarily. 
They support the worthy. 
This is the kind of excellence. 
It is an extraordinary challenge for a family to undertake.  
There are opportunities for fundraising. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
It is a private member's motion which reads: 
As the House knows this is not a votable motion. 
I am sure the member for Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre feels that way. 
It is fair to say to the member that there is some inconsistency here. 
I think that would be a better goal to achieve.  
That is what it has done. 
It is extremely important that we support quality education in our country. 
It would be appropriate to address the idea of athletic scholarships as worthy of support. 
Athletic excellence is a very important component of human endeavour. 
Athletic endeavour should therefore be encouraged and recognized.  
First year students are not eligible. 
We can thank the government for a lot of that difficulty.  
There is a lack of dollars. 
Our Olympic program is valued. 
I think this is an interesting motion. 
I appreciate being able to speak on it. 
I thank the hon. member for putting it forward to the House.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
The motion refers to study bursaries at the university level for top athletes. 
Education is a provincial matter. 
For example, Quebec already has a system of loans and bursaries. 
This is not the right sort.  
These people are facing real financial problems. 
This includes skates and all sorts of equipment. 
It adds up to thousands of dollars very quickly.  
I am very aware that parents often face a rather serious problem. 
The hearings on professional sports attracted a lot of people. 
There were many empty seats. 
Yet, the problem that exists is a very important one.  
This is not the only level of competition where there is a problem. 
It is a bit insulting, when it comes right down to it. 
It hits home even more when put in perspective. 
This motion refers to universities. 
They can enter the labour force immediately upon graduation. 
I am not suggesting the member's intent was to exclude these people. 
In that sense, we must applaud the member's initiative in putting this issue forward.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
This is totally outrageous. 
Only 7% of Canadian students will actually benefit from this fund.  
It is obvious our students require immediate assistance. 
They are mortgaging their futures without the hope of finding a decent job. 
However, these scholarships would also serve other very important purposes.  
They epitomize the meaning of commitment. 
I am not necessarily talking only about commitment in sports. 
Our Olympic program is suffering from a serious lack of funding. 
Canada still has much to be proud of in our Olympic athletes. 
Let us help instill some pride in our country and pride in our athletes.  
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
We are proud of them for getting there, for participating at that elite level. 
Every community greatly appreciates its own Olympic athletes. 
The government is playing a great role. 
We are making great financial contributions. 
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments made by members tonight with respect to this motion. 
I thank the member for Churchill for seconding this motion. 
That is a very important thing to do at this moment.  
It does provide an additional amount of support for our young people for their education. 
I disagree with the member on that. 
It is something she should look a little closer at.  
He is still fighting the 1995 Ontario provincial election. 
That was the indication I had from his remarks. 
He was speaking for his government and basically it missed the point.  
It is not surprising that he attacked the New Democratic Party. 
He attacked young people. 
He attacked the unemployed. 
He is playing politics. 
He thinks this motion is something that is not worthy of consideration by this House. 
That is a good idea that could be incorporated in this motion.  
I thank members for participating in the debate. 
I appreciate their viewpoints. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.) moved: 
The Yugoslav government has a long history of its involvement. 
A couple of quite tragic examples will suffice to make the point.  
Virtually every house in that village had been destroyed. 
There was no trace of any of the inhabitants of that village.  
Clearly, many people paid the price with their lives.  
We invested a lot to prevent that in Bosnia. 
There are times when we have to look at the rules that guide us. 
Clearly, in this case we have the making of a major humanitarian disaster. 
Thirty thousand have become refugees in surrounding countries. 
The remainder are displaced persons within the republic of Yugoslavia.  
We also know that in that part of the world winter is soon approaching. 
As I said, they have that special access. 
He agreed to set up centres where displaced persons could seek help.  
Police routinely denied any kind of access for international observers. 
Over the summer the tempo of aggression toward its own people had increased.  
The Belgrade authorities had clearly decided two things. 
The price of supporting the insurgents would become too great. 
It was an act of terrorism. 
Second is very much the point of tonight's debate. 
The question is what are the choices and options before us. 
Resolution 1199 has clearly called upon the Yugoslav authorities to meet a series of conditions. 
It is clear that the Belgrade authorities are not of a mind to negotiate willingly. 
NATO is an important part of this effort.  
It is also clear that NATO must be ready to act. 
They are difficult and they must be wrestled with. 
In the meantime we can only make our representations. 
That is a tough dilemma. 
That is a dilemma we have to face.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a number of questions for the minister. 
I will try to be brief.  
I realize how difficult the situation is. 
That is a question we need to ask. 
We also need to know what happens after that. 
What are the contingency plans? 
What are we going to do to help those 270,000 homeless people?  
What are we actually going to do? 
We hear about the independent Kosovo. 
That is what Kosovans want.  
That is the kind of equation we are dealing with.  
The Russians have made very clear statements. 
They were in Belgrade just this last weekend. 
There will be meetings tomorrow in London of the contact group. 
They have been part of the contingency planning at this point. 
These people are afraid. 
They are not going to come back to their villages. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I have three questions for the minister.  
My second question concerns the work done by the minister's personal representative. 
``We shall not kneel before NATO missiles. 
We shall not allow ourselves to become enslaved to NATO or any other foreign power''.  
Is the minister concerned about such statements? 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the questions.  
But I think that again depends on the resolution itself. 
As I said, there is still some time to play.  
That really is the issue which is at stake at this point in time.  
But he did not have a great deal of success. 
But we never know. 
We were making the case. 
As for the statement that was read, it is somewhat of a threatening statement. 
It is not unusual. 
I am not surprised by it. 
We certainly heard similar kinds of statements when we wrestled with the problems in Bosnia. 
I do not think it will result in a wider conflict. 
They have been given notice to leave. 
We will likely maintain a small skeleton staff at the embassy for the duration.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
That was one of the first issues on the table. 
It is obvious that we do need to deal with it. 
There are 275,000 people suffering, both of Albanian and Serbian background. 
There are 50,000 or more homeless people. 
Therefore, this evening I will try to ask some of these questions. 
There was nobody there. 
There was total silence. 
There were not even birds flying in the air. 
It was totally dead silence. 
There were nothing but graves.  
We could not step off the roadside. 
We could not drive our vehicle off the road. 
There were mines in the corn fields. 
Cobs of corn had plastic explosives in them. 
When someone picked that cob of corn they would loose an arm or a leg. 
They would be maimed.  
The children had all gone into the school. 
I visited with those children. 
They wrote to me about what it was like to live in a war zone. 
They looked like full Coke tins sitting on the table. 
I said to the translator ``Those are Coke tins. 
He said ``Let me grab a big stick''. 
He grabbed a big stick and pushed the Coke tin off the table. 
There was a loud boom and the table disappeared. 
There was a mine underneath that Coke tin. 
That would be retaliation.  
That is what we are talking about. 
It is obvious why we need to get involved. 
The humanitarian factor is so obvious, but the problems are many. 
As well the minister mentioned the problem of the United Nations. 
This is a problem that we are going to have to deal with. 
This problem is not just in Kosovo. 
The inability of the United Nations to respond is becoming a more serious problem.  
I travelled to India and Pakistan this summer. 
We need to deal with the Kashmir problem. 
We can show some leadership. 
We could become the mediators of the world. 
I use some of these examples and I would even carry it as far Kosovo. 
We belong to NATO. 
We belong to all kinds of things. 
I could grab other ones. 
We have done nothing. 
That is extremely frustrating for all of us. 
We have to end it. 
We have to find a better way of dealing with these kinds of situations. 
I have difficulty with take note debates. 
Then we could vote on what we should do. 
We could come to a consensus. 
I think foreign affairs lends itself to that and we would be respected. 
We would feel better in ourselves. 
I would like us to address that. 
Canadians want to know a number of things. 
They want to know what we will bomb if we have to bomb something. 
They want to be assured that we are not just going to create more victims. 
How far do we go? 
We should talk about that.  
We understand that in Serbia there is a really good radar system. 
There are missiles, there are rockets and there is a defence system set up there.  
If Canadians are at risk we should know that ahead of time. 
Are we considering using ground troops? 
We know ground troops would be the way to make it work. 
These kids can talk about what happened in 1942. 
My goodness, they are living 500 years of history and it is affecting them.  
The answer would be to get on the ground and come up with a plan.  
We are proud of them. 
I think we have earned our stripes. 
We have been there from the beginning. 
We need to ask what it is prepared to commit in its backyard. 
I know the difficulties in asking that question. 
They need to face up to that as well.  
Who has the commitment and the money? 
Only on a big, collective issue can we do it. 
The concept of regional instability troubles us all. 
However, this is not situation we are looking at. 
I hope the minister thinks seriously about a different approach to take note debates. 
If it does not work we can always come back to this method. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for my colleague, the member for Red Deer.  
Experts came before us and resolutions were put forward. 
I see the chairman nodding on the other side. 
It needs more debate. 
We need to get the information out. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have taken into account the comments of the hon. member. 
I will defer to my friend from Vancouver soon.  
We can work out the techniques for that.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
How would he relate that to the protocols additional to the Geneva protocols of 1977?  
That is the only thing he understands. 
We also believe that these questions should be asked and answered. 
That is what Canadians want to know.  
Overall our party and Canadians support our involvement in international situations. 
Obviously, though, we are responding to a humanitarian need. 
It is very troubling that the veto will be used. 
That is troubling because I believe it greatly weakens the position of the United Nations. 
It means that more and more people will challenge its authority. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
That in itself is justification to take decisive action. 
The member for Vancouver Quadra asked whether we would support air strikes. 
I would support air strikes. 
I would support quite a bit if I knew for sure what the objective was. 
We want to solve it. 
What is the political and military objective when we start the process?  
I want to stop the suffering. 
The difficulty I am having is what we will consider a victory.  
Kosovo has been not annihilated but mostly annihilated. 
What will get people back into their areas? 
What will get the refugees to come back? 
What assurances, what political stability do we hope to offer in the long term?  
What military assurances can we give those people? 
The people will not go back. 
I think that is what will happen. 
I have not seen it yet. 
I do not know what it is. 
There is no simple answer.  
Will we do this with F-18s? 
Will we strike and make a statement? 
That is basically what I wanted to say comment-wise. 
What is the long term plan? 
What is the vision? 
It is discouraging for me because we all want to take that decisive action. 
The hon. member for Red Deer deserves some time to reply. 
He will have about 30 seconds.  
Mr. Speaker, I think the frustration is obvious. 
The minister has expressed that. 
I think all of us would express it.  
I would start with education, hospitals and infrastructure. 
We could ask about dollars and who will do that. 
Do we have the will? 
Do we have the money? 
Mr. Speaker, may I make a request? 
Could I have the unanimous consent of the House for that purpose?  
That is the order under which we are operating. 
The hon. member now has the floor. 
Ask for unanimous consent.  
That is the problem. 
If we do it on one we are going to get it later. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I think my colleague's concern is interesting. 
The Minister of Foreign Affairs has the floor.  
That would have to be part of any discussions and negotiations at the table. 
There is that combination.  
I am not trying to be vague. 
I think these comments are very helpful. 
There is still security council activity potentially tomorrow, Thursday. 
There will certainly be NATO meetings beginning on Thursday, Friday and likely Saturday. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
The Bloc Quebecois supports the motion before the House this evening. 
They have been known for a long time, in fact for too long. 
These appeals have been fruitless. 
This is why we must now use a different approach. 
Its actions must be consistent. 
Kosovo refugees are already on Macedonian territory. 
Refugees could find themselves in neighbouring regions as well.  
We must act quickly in concert with our international allies. 
I understand the dilemma the Minister of Foreign Affairs described. 
We have a motion before us, a motion that may be too modest, too timid. 
The government is asking that we take notice of this terrible situation. 
It is indeed time Parliament took notice of this situation. 
We are told that these measures seek a diplomatic solution to the problem. 
All this seems pretty weak. 
Strength without justice is tyrannical. 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
The possibility was mentioned of a NATO-led intervention. 
What way is there around this legal impasse? 
Does he have any useful suggestions?  
Mr. Speaker, the House wants to hear about international law tonight. 
The member for Red Deer gave a very political answer.  
That question remained unanswered. 
I know that legal opinions were provided on the subject.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Versions of this have been regurgitated over time.  
One example I can think of is what is going on in Algeria. 
There are problems in Angola. 
There are hundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia.  
It is a crisis in Kosovo and that is why we are here. 
We all agree about that. 
Martin Luther King was right when he coined the phrase.  
Mr. Speaker, that is a very good question, and a very difficult one to answer. 
That is the simplest answer.  
That is when it happens. 
There was also a threat of international peace and security in Somalia, in Africa. 
The member also mentioned Sudan and Algeria. 
That is why there is a very cautious attitude to intervene in Africa. 
That is very unwise. 
Africa is a lost continent. 
It is continent that is sacrificed nowadays. 
I do not think it should be. 
We should not accuse the United Nations of that. 
We should never forget that the United Nations is composed of member states. 
Those states allow or disallow the intervention of the security council.  
That is the more complex answer. 
It does not justify double standards. 
Once double standards are lifted we will live in a better international community.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Is the House prepared to allow this division of time?  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson:
My colleagues and I in the New Democratic Party support the motion.  
Nevertheless, we support the motion.  
Other members have spoken of this earlier. 
These are war crimes. 
These atrocities can also strike home. 
This has gone on for far too long. 
Tragically that action was not taken by the United Nations. 
I witnessed them when I visited Vukovar. 
This is mostly within Kosovo. 
Some 50,000 have not found shelter yet. 
Many others are living in very difficult conditions. 
Over 700 have died. 
And with winter fast approaching there is a very real danger of a humanitarian disaster.  
We would prefer a resolution of the United Nations security council. 
Let us be under no illusions about the possible risk to Canadians. 
This is a humanitarian disaster. 
Where is the international outcry on that? 
Where is Canada's voice on that?  
So the member for Fraser Valley is right. 
Again, my colleagues and I in the New Democratic Party support this motion. 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
It is still subject to some limitations. 
Can he help us to this next step? 
Customary law can gallop at the present time. 
There has been the phrase used, instant customary law. 
A number of quick precedents can help make new norms.  
Can the hon. member help us here? 
I think there is a good possibility of a political all-party consensus emerging.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson:
Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra is correct. 
Clearly international law is an evolving body of law. 
This is not an anticipatory action, as the member is well aware. 
This is an action in response to brutal war crimes against humanity. 
Those crimes are well described in international law. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
We all know it is a very serious topic. 
The motion before the House reads: 
As has been indicated by my hon. colleague, the NDP supports the motion. 
It is one that should be of concern to all of us.  
Perhaps that is one of the problems with the world today. 
We are moving fast. 
We do not take the time to slow down and deal with issues appropriately.  
That aside, this is a humanitarian issue. 
We read statements about the suffering that has taken place. 
One news article contained these words ``the television pictures are bad. 
These things are very disturbing to us. 
This is a serious problem. 
We know there is a long history between the two factions fighting in the area. 
Another news article talked about a family that was massacred. 
The bodies of several of the victims displayed clear evidence of mutilation.  
Her belly had been cut open. 
Then along came a religious leader. 
That is the kind of concern that we as individuals- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am afraid I have to interrupt the hon. member. 
His time has expired.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson:
I wonder if I might hear his concluding comment.  
Madam Speaker, I will conclude very quickly. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
That is totally unacceptable.  
The government has asked the House to take note of the situation. 
He refuses to put his policy to a vote, a fundamental characteristic of democracy. 
This is not new evidence. 
Thousands have been killed.  
In Bosnia the United Nations failed. 
Although leadership on this issue has been lacking, NATO must act now. 
But it is not a straightforward issue. 
Kosovo is a province inside Yugoslavia. 
Yugoslavia is ruled by Milosevic. 
Should we be in favour of Kosovo independence at this juncture? 
But Mr. Milosevic is not a reasonable man. 
This government talks about taking measures. 
Canada has six CF-18s based at Aviano Air Force Base in Italy. 
They must be used. 
First, the CF-18s will be flying over hostile territory. 
Milosevic has no small force. 
He has four brigades and will attempt to shoot down any NATO planes. 
This is a risk, but a risk that Canada must take.  
As I mentioned earlier, Canada has 1,300 troops in Bosnia. 
They will be threatened and that is a danger. 
The government must tell the Canadian public about this danger. 
The Canadian public must know that Canadians will be part of this operation.  
Third, after this bombing, it may be necessary to put troops on the ground. 
He said that if it is done, it will only be European troops. 
There are other factors. 
There is the Russian factor. 
As the House knows, the Russians are related ethnically and religiously to the Serbs. 
They have told us that they are against NATO bombing. 
That is unfortunate, but unfortunately NATO will have to go ahead without their approval. 
Bosnia showed that NATO was the only credible force Milosevic will respect.  
Canada must play a role of responsibility. 
My party will stand behind this government if this government stands behind its soldiers.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
I believe we face one of those moments today. 
We have been engaged from day one. 
We returned in 1939 to do so again. 
As history shows, the idea caught on.  
This decade alone has given us several examples of just such circumstances.  
We were there with our allies. 
Currently we have almost 1,300 Canadian personnel in Bosnia-Hercegovina. 
The heavy hand of the Yugoslav authorities in dealing with the Kosovars is unacceptable. 
However, diplomatic pressure may not be enough. 
We did this with the notion of diplomacy backed by force. 
Naturally, Canada would prefer a diplomatic solution. 
It is not our tradition to retreat in the face of intransigence. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:
There has been every effort made. 
He has recently been to the United Nations to try to bring that about. 
That has been uppermost in this government's mind. 
There are people who have been displaced. 
There are refugees who risk starvation, who risk freezing to death this coming winter. 
So we have had to move very quickly.  
I think we have a pretty good idea of what the issues are here.  
As far as troops on the ground are concerned, that matter is under active consideration. 
At this point two activation warnings have been given by NATO. 
Both relate to the possibility of a limited air option, a limited air strike. 
The other is a phased air campaign. 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
For the record I support the positions they have stated. 
I support the use of military intervention. 
I will add a few comments and some concerns. 
I support Canada's involvement there and the use of Canada's military. 
We have a role to play.  
This is clearly not acceptable to a civilized nation such as ours. 
I believe we have a duty to intervene. 
I came back from the Canada-Europe parliamentary meetings in Strasbourg. 
This was an emergency debate over there. 
They also expressed exactly what I have stated in this House.  
This is the feeling I had after speaking to some of these people. 
It will set the tone. 
They burned out entire villages.  
I believe Canada has a duty to participate. 
He may even agree with that. 
Let us assume we are going to proceed. 
That has to be followed up after. 
Yes, the air strikes have to happen. 
I am not sure whether we can reason with a man like that.  
It is a very difficult situation. 
Hopefully this region could become a republic separate from Serbia. 
We have had a very interesting debate. 
These are fascinating debates when we look at all the details. 
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
It was in Kosovo that the church of Serbia was born. 
The suffering is immense, the atrocities unbearable and the crimes unforgivable.  
We must push for a political settlement. 
Several speakers have referred to a NATO intervention. 
In that context let us have no elusion. 
The future status of Kosovo must be placed at the top of the international agenda. 
That is quite clear now. 
It is high time that we do so. 
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
We have the means of helping to resolve this situation quickly. 
Perhaps we have even delayed too long.  
Some of these fleeing children were even missing limbs. 
Canada must not hesitate. 
We must offer our modest contribution. 
Such is the justification of the bloodthirsty dictator who wants to subdue these people. 
This is a barbaric act. 
It is an unacceptable action which Canada must not condone. 
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
We have been appalled by the recent massacre of 14 civilians. 
The time has come for action in Kosovo.  
Fourth, this participation would constitute a logical extension of our prior commitments in the Balkans.  
However, should NATO decide in favour of military action, Canada should take part in it.  
Ruins could be seen throughout the countryside. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
We have been here before. 
What are they supposed to do? 
They started the Kosovo Liberation Army to try to defend their people. 
They were successful initially but they have been losing quite badly.  
And we still sit on our hands.  
He will understand nothing but force.  
We have tried diplomatic initiatives time and time again and they have been completely fruitless. 
There are some solutions that would solve the problem.  
One, Milosevic has been given the ultimatum. 
Right now it is a joke. 
The Russians want a foot in the Balkans. 
That blockade has to be strengthened if we are going to meet success.  
The Field of Black Birds is a very important symbol for them. 
It is a shrine for the Serbian people. 
They must be allowed free and unfettered access to it.  
We must not support an independent country called Kosovo. 
If we do this, a compromise can be made. 
However, the compromise is being made much more difficult by the actions of President Milosevic. 
Unfortunately this tragic situation will bubble up again.  
We have heard some discussions today about intervention. 
International law respects and supports intervention. 
The proof in the pudding is when we look at who pays the price. 
Civilians pay the price. 
It was not always that way. 
Wars took place between nation states. 
They generally are not wars between nation states.  
We need political will. 
We need a spine, we need guts and we need courage. 
I was disappointed earlier today. 
I was deeply saddened that the House did not give unanimous consent. 
I am glad we had this debate. 
Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre-Rosedale, Lib.):
His question is an excellent one.  
I think NATO has a responsibility. 
All those nation states could be involved in the larger conflagration. 
If that happened, the world simply could not turn a blind eye.  
With respect to Bosnia, we were far too late in intervening. 
Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre-Rosedale, Lib.):
We have now been watching this for more than a year.  
The situation of violence and oppression is creating a humanitarian situation of enormous proportions. 
Some 290,000 people have been displaced as a result of the conflict in Kosovo. 
I come from a city of 3.5 million people. 
How would we cope with the enormity of that disaster?  
This is the terrifying aspect. 
I can echo that. 
We have been there. 
We have seen devastation in those areas. 
The same is now taking place in Kosovo.  
We acted with efficiency. 
We finally were pushed into the situation where we had to do something. 
That plan is succeeding for one reason and one reason only. 
However words will not deal with Slobodan Milosevic. 
The need to act is clear. 
All members in the House that I heard speak tonight have echoed that. 
How to act, however, is less clear. 
There will be debate and there will be reasonable discussions about how we should act. 
If we act without legal authority that is an issue.  
We debated a resolution on Kosovo. 
I would oppose the same approach we are taking tonight. 
The foreign minister addressed the reason in his remarks. 
We must be aware of that.  
We must prepare to act. 
It must be a preparation that is credible and determined. 
That is what the situation will be. 
It will drag on for years. 
We will not see 200,000 refugees; we will see 400,000 refugees. 
Inevitably people will be dragged into the situation. 
It is always that way. 
We are forced to act.  
All of this is true. 
The risk of not acting is worse than the threat of acting. 
I read a little history as I prepared for my speech tonight. 
We are on the threshold of the 21st century and nothing has changed.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
They are always highly intelligent and highly constructive. 
There is an opportunity to bring like-minded countries together.  
He is an activist as we know from the land mines debate. 
Canadians can bring a special quality to bear on this debate on the world stage. 
I thank the member for his questions.  
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
It is a privilege to participate in this brief time.  
The consequences of this conflict are reverberating through southern Europe. 
Canada has played an important role in the Balkans in recent years. 
Several months have passed since the fighting began in Kosovo. 
The time for inaction and wringing of hands has run out. 
NATO must now act. 
Canada stands ready to play its role in these important efforts.  
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for that question.  
The humanitarian crisis is there nonetheless.  
Winter is setting in and things are get worse actually by the hour in Kosovo. 
Therefore Canada stands ready to act with NATO.  
Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre-Rosedale, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to follow that up with the parliamentary secretary.  
I recall when the minister was speaking the parliamentary secretary was here as well. 
Would that be a fair way of putting it?  
Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
But this crisis has not occurred in a void. 
Ethnic ties are betrayed at a whim when it serves the interests of such politicians. 
It is a tactic to which they frequently resort.  
Canadians find such behaviour reprehensible. 
Recognizing this is key to any lasting solutions.  
Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre-Rosedale, Lib.):
It is a lesson in this country that we have to bear in mind ourselves. 
Indeed, he underlines very well the dilemma.  
Canadians have moved beyond their history in some regards. 
Canada has a reputation internationally. 
I think today we still have enormous credibility in the international community. 
I think we can reach out. 
I do not mean in any way to sound naive. 
The history is long. 
Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):
That poses, potentially, a dilemma for many countries. 
We do not in this country condone armed insurgencies. 
That reign of terror includes murder. 
It is not just murder, it is murder with a message.  
It is murder which leaves a message. 
What were apparently happy settlements are settlements no more. 
It is a very sad situation.  
The objective is to reach our goal, to attain our goal. 
As long as we get there, it does not matter how. 
I have seen this and as a legislator I do not have a solution.  
I think we are getting better at dealing with deceit. 
We lose valuable time and that is a great tragedy.  
I do not have a solution. 
The quicker we can reach these conclusions, the better we can respond.  
We are then fortunate in having NATO. 
A man came up to me quite unannounced. 
That was my read on the situation. 
I do not doubt his sincerity in his exhortation to me. 
I hope this initiative will happen within hours.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the question is a good one. 
However, we are dealing with a complex international situation. 
I have not been briefed. 
Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
I do not remember his answer because I do not think he had one. 
So many hopes and aspirations were stopped.  
Mr. Speaker, I agree that we have to take the risk. 
There is a reasonable prospect that objective can be met. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
We certainly have a moral obligation to take action against ethnic cleansing. 
Ultimately we must support our allies. 
Canada cannot shirk its responsibility in this regard.  
These are the questions. 
Have all diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis failed? 
What are the dangers and possible implications of military action? 
Is there true multinational support for this mission? 
Is there a workable plan for military action? 
What precisely is Canada's role to be? 
Is the role realistic in terms of Canada's military capability? 
Who will command the Canadian troops?  
Have diplomatic efforts failed? 
We will see but the answer to date appears to be yes, they have. 
I think we can all hope this will be a similar case.  
However, at the same time, we cannot be certain the Serbs will comply. 
In other words, we should be looking at the worst case scenario. 
NATO has to be prepared for that eventuality.  
The answer to the third question appears to be clear. 
Obviously some concerns remain among the European members of the alliance.  
Is there a workable plan for military action? 
Granted, the member may not have been briefed on that. 
Maybe there is a plan, but Canadians should know. 
We are possibly sending Canadian troops into an area of conflict. 
How long would they be there? 
Will the UN Security Council approve the action?  
Our planes are moving back and forth. 
A myriad of questions remain unanswered. 
Does the government know the answer to any of these questions? 
I have not heard much debate in that regard. 
The debate has been more philosophical.  
Has the government asked NATO what will be required? 
If ground troops are sent in, how will they get there? 
How many ground troops can we send? 
The Canadian army is already stretched to the limit.  
All we can send is a smaller battalion group force. 
Even that would be a severe strain on our capabilities given the present task. 
What equipment do they have? 
We must however be clear and realistic about Canada's role. 
We must support our allies, but we must also support our troops.  
Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre-Rosedale, Lib.):
We have had the opportunity of travelling together in Bosnia and looking at these issues. 
I think the member has more depth to him than that. 
I have watched him and I would like his answer to my question. 
We have looked at what we have at the base at Aviano. 
We all recognize that our facilities are stretched to the limit.  
We have asked a great deal of our troops. 
We cannot ask too much of them. 
All of that is true.  
The member knows that NATO has been looking at this situation for over six months. 
He knows how NATO operates. 
They have been looking at this for six months. 
Does it not want to get into the fray? 
There is no question that debate is raging on in a very substantive way.  
On the political side it is not very clear exactly what is going to happen. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I think Canadians are great people. 
Unfortunately from time to time, they have been getting some ineffective governments ruling this country.  
I hope the Liberal government will show some leadership. 
Kosovo has a population of about 2.2 million. 
This status was abolished by Mr. Milosevic in 1989.  
The Kosovo region has a historical significance to Serbia. 
The civilian population in Kosovo is in a desperate situation. 
The farms, the fields and the residential areas are infested with mines. 
Some mines are very cleverly designed to specifically kill children. 
The Serb armed presence remains a significant force in that area. 
The disproportionate use of force is designed to terrorize and subjugate the population. 
We must respond to this terror.  
There could be two plans. 
Plan A should be a diplomatic initiative. 
I understand why we have to do that. 
The farmer who owned the donkey was giving it medicine that was very bitter. 
The farmer's son was helping him by holding the donkey by the ears. 
We have to do that; we have to pull the ears. 
This bitter medicine is the only medicine that will work in this situation. 
Do they have enough equipment and facilities? 
What strategy do we have to deal with the regional security situation? 
I will be looking forward to those answers.  
Unfortunately this situation will happen again. 
We have to show leadership.  
We have sent many peacekeeping missions around the world. 
Let me give an analogy. 
When a domestic pressure cooker is heated, steam is produced. 
To contain that stream we put weight on the pressure cooker. 
Have we ever involved an issue by solving the problem before it happens? 
Unfortunately the government has not has taken any action. 
The government lacks a pro-active role. 
It is just reactive. 
It does very little to prevent conflicts in the world. 
I look forward to the government showing- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member's time has expired.  
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Why should we as Canadians be involved? 
I think tonight many speakers addressed that question. 
We need the resources available to participate in whatever action.  
We have the CF-18 aircraft in Aviano right now. 
We need to work with speed because winter is approaching. 
These barbarous actions have ramifications that are felt beyond Kosovo. 
The consequences of this conflict are reverberating throughout southern Europe. 
Is this doing something? 
The United Nations and the international community has expressed concern and outrage. 
It seems to me that is not enough. 
It is certainly not those with the arms who are using force against the people.  
We are on the verge of a new century. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened to the hon. member very carefully. 
We are talking about a humanitarian issue here.  
The question arises here of whether we are well equipped. 
Are our brave men and women well equipped with the materials they need?  
I would also like to know from the member how much it will cost us. 
For how long are we going to commit our military forces? 
What are the long term plans? 
Can the member throw some light on that?  
I think there is a moral situation here. 
That decision has to be one whereby we join with others. 
We use whatever resources we have.  
It is not an accounting job here. 
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
I hope we do not make this into a partisan issue. 
It is worth mentioning what has been done. 
We need it so badly. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
He mentioned Chechnya, Bosnia, Haiti, Rwanda, Iraq and so on. 
What plan does the government have to prevent this type of conflict in the world? 
Mr. Speaker, Canada is one country among many in the world today. 
We are certainly not the most powerful country of all. 
This tradition has been maintained all along.  
How has Canada helped? 
Tomorrow there will be a vote in the United Nations. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
There being no further members rising, this debate is concluded.  
(The House adjourned at 11.31 p.m.)
