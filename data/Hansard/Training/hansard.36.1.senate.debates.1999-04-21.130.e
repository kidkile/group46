The Senate met at 1:30 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
These are the Canadians who really get out on the field and participate. 
Thanks to all Canada's volunteers.  
Hon. Therese Lavoie-Roux :
A recent survey conducted by Statistics Canada found that volunteering is on the rise. 
The greatest increase in volunteering is among youth. 
They may feel that they are aging less quickly if they help others.  
Far too often we take volunteers for granted. 
Volunteerism and the International Year of Older Persons 
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
The causes for this absurd, senseless act may go beyond human understanding. 
What should be more safe than the premises of a school? 
Only by the mystery of divine providence, they were not.  
Last night, President Clinton said: 
Would that we might use that logic in our own affairs. 
Bill to Amend-First Reading 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
When shall this bill be read the second time?  
Compassion for Citizens Suffering Loss of Autonomy 
Notice of Motion to Establish Day of Recognition 
Honourable senators, I give notice that tomorrow, Thursday, April 22, 1999, I will move: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Welcome to the Senate.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
They have also been in regular contact with all of their NATO allies. 
Honourable senators, I am not aware of any specific resolution. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, my question is on Kosovo. 
The cost of this operation was estimated at $100 million.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I think we should put things in the proper context. 
I thank the Honourable Senator Prud'homme for his suggestion.  
The focus of relief for the refugees is now on regional resettlement. 
Senator Prud'homme mentioned the figure of $100 million. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
There are only two or three of them.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I would be surprised if that were not the case. 
Of course, they are top of the line, honourable senators. 
They are the finest in the world and they are well trained. 
It is not because of that I ask the question. 
I certainly can give that undertaking to Senator Forrestall. 
I will bring it immediately to the attention of the Minister of National Defence.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The leader said that he would examine that letter. 
I would like to know the government's response to Mr. Pearson.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the letter in question was not sent by Mr. Pearson alone. 
There were other signatures on that letter. 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Forthcoming Summit-Proposed Initiatives by Government 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Is Canada bringing to the pending NATO meetings any proposals? 
Is it playing any mediation role? 
Are there are any proposals forthcoming? 
I am not asking for their contents but simply whether they exist.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I wish to reiterate what I have said. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
We work in concert with our 18 other NATO partners. 
What is Canada's view on this?  
I will pass it on to the Prime Minister." 
It has become a major military operation in which Canada should be fully committed. 
I would like to know how far Canada's commitment goes. 
We will leave that to Canada, our leadership, and our allies. 
I do not have the solution in my hip pocket. 
The honourable senator has expressed his opinion. 
Because it does not have one.  
Hon. Lois M. Wilson :
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
I wish to ask a question concerning Item No. 8 in that response.  
Despite this, the government does not endorse this recommendation. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
If indeed they proceed, it will be done only on a test basis.  
It shreds democracy and robs the government of any credibility. 
Therefore, I would appreciate an answer.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. James F. Kelleher :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
According to the minister, and I quote: 
That came out of left field. 
None of the officials had ever raised it with me. 
None of the Americans had ever made a point of it...  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Neither did Minister Marchi.  
No, no, Minister Marchi.  
Rather, why Minister Axworthy did not tell Minister Marchi. 
I am sorry, I really do not know.  
Hon. James F. Kelleher :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Delayed Answer to Oral Question 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Changes To Employment Insurance Act-Request For Further Particulars

Employment Insurance premiums are part of the revenues of the Government of Canada.  
Canada Customs and Revenue Agency Bill 
(3) The Commissioner must exercise the"; and 
( b ) by renumbering all cross-references accordingly 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion in amendment?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those in favour of the amendment please say "yea"?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those opposed to the amendment, please say "nay"?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
In my opinion, the "nays" have it.  
And two honourable senators having risen.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
We will have a standing vote. 
Please call in the senators.  
Motion in amendment negatived on the following division: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, we are now back to the main motion. 
Does any other honourable senator wish to speak on the main motion?  
On motion of Senator Stratton, debate adjourned.

Clause 44, as it now stands, reads as follows: 
Senator Grafstein proposes that clause 44(2) should read: 
I am not surprised. 
The first subsection is, therefore, mandatory and the second is discretionary or permissive.  
South of the border, the death penalty exists in many states. 
I am informed that it stands in 26 states.  
I agree with Senator Bryden on that crucial point. 
Most democracies have abolished the death penalty. 
For example, the greater number of countries in Europe have abolished the death penalty. 
However, not all democracies have done so. 
However, the Grafstein-Joyal amendment may do a lot also. 
That is what the debate is about.  
However, since the amendments have been moved, we are now speaking on those amendments. 
I think we should think about the nature of a bill like this. 
This bill is designed to modernize our extradition system. 
That is one of the prime things that it does, if not the prime thing. 
It arises also, for example, in the evidentiary requirements for extradition. 
Not all countries have the same rules of evidence that we do. 
We are legislators, not philosophers. 
Some of the people who came here we were glad and proud to welcome. 
It could happen again.  
If we build that haven, they will come. 
They are not accused of any crime in Canada. 
He is more concerned with the fundamental principle of capital punishment. 
I respect his view profoundly, but I cannot share it.  
I turn now to the question of a two-track system for international tribunals. 
If I might quote from Senator Grafstein's remarks last week, he said: 
...a two-track system is exactly what we need. 
Is one murder co-equal to genocide? 
Yes, but should we not treat them somewhat differently, if possible?  
Hon. Herbert O. Sparrow :
Honourable senators, might I ask a question of the honourable senator? 
Is it not possible to have them deported because of entering Canada illegally? 
Honourable senators, that is an interesting question, but in a sense it evades the issue. 
I would have the same reaction to that. 
What happens if they have not been convicted? 
The whole procedure of the law comes into play. 
We are not talking about shoplifting here.  
Sometimes those assurances are given by the American state in question. 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, we have all enjoyed listening to the senator. 
I am aware of the situation. 
The honourable senator raises several interesting points. 
One, of course, is imposing our judicial system on other lands. 
We would not wish other lands to impose their judicial system on us. 
We try to avoid imposing ours on other countries. 
On motion of Senator Joyal, debate adjourned.  
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
