The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Today, the Honourable Gerald-A. 
Beaudoin was made Chevalier of the Ordre de la Pleiade. 
Today is also the opening day of the Year of the Francophonie in Canada. 
The visit was greatly appreciated on all sides. 
They made a number of comments to us. 
We would like to pass some of them on to you now. 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
Let us stop saying "French Canada" and "English Canada." 
That is a myth. 
There are proud francophones right across the country. 
Honourable senators, happy Year of the Francophonie in Canada.  
International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Hon. Mary Alice Butts :
Honourable senators, we must listen to Canadians.  
Over 320 youth teams have entered this competition. 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Honourable senators, I, too, wish to make some comments on this very important day. 
I shall start by giving you a little background on this issue.  
The declaration came into force on October 24, 1970.  
Canada's support for the new convention came as no surprise. 
The changing demographics had much to do with the shifting patterns of immigration. 
By 1971, they comprised 29 per cent of the population. 
Speaking on the Bill of Rights, Mr. Diefenbaker said: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Thank you kindly, honourable senators.  
The Right Honourable John Diefenbaker thundered, with quavering jowls: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
However, I will recognize one more honourable senator.  
International Year of Older Persons 
Hon. Marisa Ferretti Barth :
I refer to the specific needs of seniors in Canada's cultural communities.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I would request leave for one more statement.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Canada Customs and Revenue Agency Bill 
THURSDAY, March 18, 1999 
The Standing Senate Committee on National Finance has the honour to present its 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition):
That the committee have the power to sit during sittings and adjournments of the Senate; 
That the committee submit its final report no later than October 29, 1999. 
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
Role of Canadian Judicial Council 
Media Comments-Notice of Inquiry 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
d) to the matter of justices' public statements in the media; and 
International Criminal Tribunal For Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda 
Stance of Madame Justice Louise Arbour-Notice of Inquiry 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
International Position in Communications 
Leave having been given to revert to Notices of Motion: 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Tuesday, March 23, 1999, I will move: 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I would obviously need to seek an answer to that question. 
If GST was applicable, it certainly would have been applied.  
Thank you for the question. 
Honourable senators, I would be very pleased to do so. 
As a matter of fact, the thought crossed my mind immediately. 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Canadian Forces Budget Shortfalls-Request for Answers to Order Paper Questions 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, I have had questions on the Order Paper since October 21, 1997. 
Why all of the revisions? 
How long must one wait to get an answer to a very simple question?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the government is not embarrassed at all. 
I shall certainly pursue the matter immediately upon the adjournment of the Senate today.  
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Canada is taking very seriously the whole question of our relations with Cuba. 
We believe that continued engagement is the best course of action.  
Honourable senators, Canada has entered into a constructive dialogue with Cuba. 
We have taken their statements at face value to this point. 
The Human Rights Commission is imminently sitting, dealing with the issues. 
Improvement of Situation of Democracy in East Timor-Role of Government 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Perhaps it is a harbinger for good things to come in Asia.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, Canada played a prominent role. 
They have made very strong representations with respect to the situation in East Timor. 
Religious Freedom in Tibet under Chinese Occupation-Government Position 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I shall certainly take that question under advisement. 
Compensation Package for Merchant Marine Veterans-Government Position 
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I presume the honourable senator is referring to the Minister of Veterans Affairs. 
Remarks of Minister on Problems with Productivity-Government Position 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
We inherited massive unemployment and a runaway deficit. 
We have started reducing taxes. 
We have invested more money in research, development and education. 
We have invested more money in health care. 
There are 157 Cape Breton employees at that particular plant. 
Could he address those questions directly?  
Delayed Answer to Oral Question 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
(Response to question raised by Hon. Noel A. Kinsella on March 3, 1999) 
Answers to Order Paper Questions Tabled 
Treasury Board-Scope of Public Service Bonuses Paid to Public Servants 
The Hon. the Speaker :
On behalf of all honourable senators, I bid you welcome to the Senate of Canada.  
Bill to Amend-Third Reading 
These reviews confirmed the validity of the legislation's underlying principles. 
They all played an important role in the development of this improved bill.  
Stakeholders commended the process by which this legislation has been developed. 
In particular, they appreciated the opportunity to fully voice their concerns.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.  
War Veterans Allowance ACT 
Department of Veterans Affairs Act 
Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act 
Bill to Amend-Second Reading 
Thousands more were also injured, both physically and psychologically.  
The average age of those still alive will soon be 80. 
I would now like to look at certain specific features of the bill. 
Passage of this bill will also benefit former prisoners of war. 
We are pleased to provide these benefits to former prisoners of war. 
The changes are not minor, however, to those directly affected by them. 
Hon. Orville H. Phillips :
A very commendable effort, sir!  
That, in itself, is a very important milestone for me.  
There was a long lineup requiring a considerable length of time to complete the process. 
I think our leap of faith was justified. 
Now, it can be done at any level of award.  
I will have more to say on that later.  
I will have certain questions about that matter at committee stage.  
There, again, we will probably get the answer to that question in committee.  
They say this was the reason for the exclusion. 
I should like to make two suggestions, honourable senators. 
The first would be an annuity paid to the surviving merchant seamen. 
This would put those two groups on an equal footing.  
The first is the partial exclusion of individuals who served in the ferry command. 
The VRAB is asking for three changes. 
Discretion will have to be used there.  
The amendment allows him, as chairman, to designate any one member to make such decisions. 
These are what I would call bureaucratic amendments. 
In effect, this recognizes the benefit of the doubt. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Foreign Publishers Advertising Services Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
Honourable senators, I wish to begin my remarks by recalling a little bit of history. 
It was printed by John Howe, the father of the great and famous Joseph Howe. 
Honourable senators, this magazine was read by some 200 subscribers. 
Sadly, it was forced to fold after just three years. 
Magazines constitute the only national press we possess in Canada. 
...the thread which binds together the fibres of our nation. 
Honourable senators, our magazines today fulfil our high expectations. 
They tell us the small stories.  
Some of our more distinguished writers honed their skills writing for Canadian magazines. 
Our writers and editors are among the most highly regarded in the world.  
Honourable senators, we have a vibrant, if fragile, magazine industry in this country today. 
In 1956, there were 661 periodicals published in Canada. 
Today, over 1,500 Canadian magazines are produced by more than 1,000 publishers. 
Over 65 per cent of all magazines circulating in Canada today are Canadian.  
It is this threat that Bill C-55 would address.  
The bill before us would not change that state of affairs. 
The free flow of ideas across national borders is enriching and important. 
This should, and will, continue unabated.  
Honourable senators, the magazine industry in Canada is not a very profitable industry. 
Indeed, approximately half of Canadian magazines do not make a profit. 
It is a difficult industry at the best of times. 
That is exactly what Bill C-55 would do. 
It would not prohibit sales of advertising services directed at other markets.  
The act would be enforced in several ways. 
This would be in addition to any other penalty.  
These magazines have been grandfathered under the bill. 
The difficulty was with the particular instrument chosen to implement that policy.  
The Government of Canada has fully complied with the WTO ruling. 
They are also, of course, consistent with our obligations under NAFTA.  
It will put in place tough, appropriate penalties for foreign publishers who contravene the act.  
The Reform Party has been alone in opposing it.  
Hon. John B. Stewart :
Honourable senators, Senator Stewart's question suggests a supplementary one. 
Is that offer still on the table?  
Honourable senators, the negotiations are not ongoing as we speak. 
I know that last week there were negotiations at a very high level. 
There are none that I am aware of.  
Who has been in charge of these negotiations? 
That is correct, to my understanding.  
Who is in charge?  
The minister responsible for the bill is the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
Obviously, there are implications for the Minister of Trade. 
Who provided the mandate to those negotiators?  
Quite obviously, they are acting under the direction of both ministers.  
I wish to emphasize that Canada has played by the rules. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I have a supplementary question to the last exchange. 
That is my understanding as I speak today.  
Otherwise what is it doing here? 
I cannot confirm it because no decision of that nature has been taken.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, am I to take it that the government has made up its mind? 
Is that the government's decision?  
Is the opposition not listening?  
The government will not give in?  
That is their prerogative.  
That might be wonderful.  
Honourable senators, I do not know if that would be so wonderful. 
Will we cave in to the Americans again? 
If you call that wonderful, then, yes, you are probably right. 
Why are we negotiating then if we are satisfied with the bill? 
What are we negotiating?  
This is a chamber of second sober thought.  
Give us something to think about.  
Honourable senators, listen carefully. 
That is the principle behind the bill.  
Canada is acting fully consistently within our trade obligations. 
There is no question on that as far as our position is concerned.  
We are trying to understand the government's position. 
I wish to know, is the principle of the bill non-negotiable?  
Honourable senators, imagine a situation in which the bill is approved. 
It will come into force, I presume, in four to six weeks. 
There have been many different versions of this bill.  
We have played by the rules. 
However, that course is not what has been suggested. 
They are exercising their influence.  
Under the trade laws, what is the extent of that retaliation? 
We can only be bullied so far. 
Let us get on with business and support this piece of legislation.  
Surely, that is a guarantee that no one can give.  
That is my first point.  
Is this not a serious presumption?  
If that question were posed to me, I would say "no."  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Therefore, the question must be addressed to the Leader of the Government.  
One assumes that it will proceed to committee next week. 
I would anticipate that the bill would be handled in the normal course of events. 
Honourable senators, I should like to have some clarification. 
Senator Murray asks whether we might pass this bill before Easter. 
In response to his question, he is told that there is no rush. 
Why is there no rush? 
There are negotiations ongoing, or which may start again. 
What are those negotiations about? 
These negotiations are occurring behind closed doors. 
Statement of Minister of Finance- Inquiry-Debate Continued 
That, in effect, amounts to a surtax on workers and companies. 
I say that because it applies to a special group. 
Not everyone pays EI premiums. 
Farmers and self-employed business people do not pay EI premiums. 
That tax, as a progressive tax, treats Canadians differently. 
As well, those who pay EI premiums are treated differently. 
This is not a good thing for the country. 
This is something which has been talked about for a number of years. 
Ottawa is well aware of the potential risk, the OECD stated.  
He asked: "Can you blame them?"  
He said that when the government is too greedy, people find other solutions.  
It's a big and growing problem. 
Good people are leaving the country. 
He has spoken about real estate taxes. 
He appealed that assessment. 
Large corporation and capital taxes cost him $1.1 million. 
It is no wonder that businesses are leaving the country.  
In the 1970s, people wanted to leave Great Britain. 
I do not blame these people for moving from Canada. 
They are doing so because it costs them millions of dollars extra to live here. 
It is not that they do not want to live here. 
People are having a difficult time. 
Why is it considered a high income? 
TSN has a greater cultural influence on this country than the CBC does. 
They broadcast junior games, they broadcast university games. 
They - not the CBC - give us culture. 
Junior hockey could never get on the CBC, but it is on TSN. 
Frankly, honourable senators, I do not think any Canadian will miss the CBC.  
Hon. John B. Stewart :
They add up to three.  
Let me start with a relatively minor one. 
Honourable senators, the savings rate in the United States is twice ours. 
Let me go to my second question, honourable senators.  
Let us stick to the federal taxes. 
For example, will the honourable senator get rid of equalization? 
I am from Nova Scotia; we rely greatly on equalization. 
That is to go, presumably, as well as assistance for post-secondary education. 
I shall stop with those three. 
What is the other side? 
I also thought there could be great reductions in the civil service. 
It goes into peoples' pockets. 
Is that the implication of your trickle-down argument?  
People are voting with their feet. 
They are leaving the country. 
That is a concern for parliamentarians, for parents, and for people throughout the country. 
Why are people leaving the country? 
I do not believe so. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable Senator Stewart, we are getting into a debate. 
Honourable senators, I have one further question.  
Inevitably in that situation there will be difficulty. 
I did not hear my honourable friend mention that point. 
However, in his analysis, he ought to take into consideration that very serious point.  
By the kind consideration of the Senate, I was given a little more time. 
I could have addressed all of these problems.  
I am not an economist. 
The province of Manitoba, which has lower taxes, gained 20,000 jobs. 
Hon. Pierre De Bane :
That movement occurs in both directions.  
He suggested that the honourable senator's province does not benefit from equalization payments. 
There are other values that make our society stick together.  
I love this country, and that is why I am speaking here today. 
I do not wish to disassemble the country. 
However, I think a little differently. 
Liberals seem to speak as if the money belongs to the government. 
It is most unfair.  
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
My honourable friend is quite happy with that. 
Honourable senators, I missed all of that. 
Senator Taylor, we have to go west soon.  
Hon. Jean-Maurice Simard :
If only he were right.  
Never before have federal budgets lacked transparency as this one does. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted honourable senators?  
Demographic conditions are not expected to improve significantly in the near future.  
What might such roadblocks be?  
The primary roadblock to economic growth and development is the tax system. 
The tax system is unfriendly to risk taking. 
The first place to look is the role of inflation on the tax system. 
Even low rates of inflation provide the federal government with large sums every year. 
This lack of full indexation is a veritable gold mine for the federal government. 
While this is true, the government fails to tell the whole story. 
I have researched this issue thoroughly. 
A witness to his inquiry said it all: 
The government is wrong when it says that ... workers become dependent on Unemployment Insurance. 
Together we can find such solutions.  
This government has failed to do that. 
It has imposed an enormous burden on the Atlantic region through its deficit cutting measures. 
In a sense, the Minister of Finance has become the ultimate bureaucrat. 
In effect, they spend money because they have the money to spend.  
This year he is doing the same. 
Instead, it is their impact on the budget's bottom line that matters most. 
These one-time measures average more than $5 billion per year. 
Yes, this government has made choices all right.  
By nature, state budgets are political documents. 
Chronic indebtedness is, fortunately, a thing of the past. 
On motion of Senator Carstairs, for Senator Graham, debate adjourned.  
Report of Foreign Affairs Committee on Study-Inquiry-Debate Continued 
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
We have another speaker who would like to speak to it. 
I should like to have the order stand in the name of Senator Andreychuk.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Subject to the deletion of those two paragraphs, I move the motion.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, March 23, 1999, at 2 p.m.
