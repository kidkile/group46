GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
CANADA CUSTOMS AND REVENUE AGENCY ACT 
It is very difficult to get out of the situation. 
The risk of bodily harm or even death approaches certainty as time goes on.  
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
The third report of our committee was entitled ``Enforcing Canada's Pollution Laws:
The Public Interest Must Come First''. 
There were 24 recommendations. 
These are the highlights of some of the recommendations.  
This is most crucial because pollution affects our communities, our health and our families. 
This is a most crucial recommendation that challenges this government to consider.  
These environmental laws are most crucial for the future health of our children.  
We see the financial well-being of this country. 
We see an exuberant amount of surpluses in programs that previously were in deficit. 
In context we have the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. 
That is our bill of rights. 
All these issues deal with every constituency in this country. 
These regional offices play an important role. 
The Fraser is a major river system. 
The cuts have a definite impact on enforcement. 
Vacant positions are not being filled, existing workloads and work expectations are insurmountable.  
We must direct these resources to where they are needed. 
Poor information supplied to the committee by the department is a major highlight. 
We are still waiting for information from the department that was requested by our committee. 
To date it has not materialized. 
No on really knows how bad the situation is. 
No details are brought out on the enforcement versus compliance promotion and other activities. 
We must make sure enforcement of this law is taking place. 
By 1996 the situation deteriorated. 
This government continues to promote voluntary measures. 
In that area there was rampant disease and marine pollution. 
Existing resources have been cut back. 
The expectations have increased and this report is a major highlight. 
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I move: 
That the House do now proceed to the orders of the day.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
It is a significant chunk of public revenue.  
We do not expect these people to be disadvantaged in terms of their compensation. 
They are accountable to performance. 
If they do not perform they can be dismissed. 
What about the judges? 
No, they are not. 
What do we say to these people? 
We say they are not accountable. 
They make bizarre decisions some of the time. 
It shows a completely contorted sense of priorities on the part of the government.  
There is a definition of spouse in the act, as there should be. 
Once again, compensation must be linked to accountability.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That is not appropriate. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Police officers make headlines by saving lives.  
Officers work every day in dangerous circumstances. 
There are two problems with this. 
I would like to comment on Motion No. 1 and the rationale behind the motion. 
Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That seems to have escaped the attention of all of the opposition parties. 
In particular, attention should be given to the initiative to create unified family courts. 
I see that the hon. member for London West is in the House. 
Judges live in communities. 
We look for privileges for parliamentarians so they can speak freely. 
We also look for an independent judiciary. 
Reformers are playing with a very serious concept here. 
Judicial independence is more important than almost any other principle of democracy. 
It should be nurtured. 
It should not be attacked in an irresponsible and ill-informed manner. 
I would suggest that that is what we are hearing today.  
For those reasons, I will be opposing Motion No. 1 and voting against it. 
I am very happy to be able to support Bill C-37. 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the motion put forward by the deputy whip of the government. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Clearly, clause 5 does not make sense. 
It makes no sense at all. 
We simply cannot afford it. 
It is a question of choices and priorities. 
There is more than the salary involved.  
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
This is the highest court of the land. 
Whatever needs to be said needs to be said here. 
We are superior to the Supreme Court of Canada. 
More and more people in this country are losing faith in the judicial system. 
Do these judges deserve a pay raise? 
How ironic it is.  
Members of parliament are not appointed for life. 
We certainly do need term limits on judges.  
We heard today that the current process is very patronage based. 
That is normally how someone gets to the bench. 
Personally I applaud the attorney general for Manitoba for his intervention. 
I believe that judges need to reflect the mosaic of the province. 
I would hope the Minister of Justice would agree with my opinion.  
The government should not be concentrating its efforts on pay raises for judges. 
The title is ``Victim recompense law passes''.  
This is a good example that governments do care about the victims of their country. 
I will send a copy of this news item to the Minister of Justice.  
The people of this country have waited for a long time for things to change. 
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
Clause 5 has to do with pay increases for judges. 
A few minutes ago in the debate the member for Windsor-St. 
In connection with the comments made by the member for Windsor-St. 
It is time to address a major problem.  
In North Vancouver the RCMP looks after our policing. 
Then to get them put in jail is a tremendously difficult thing to do.  
But of course nobody could give out their names. 
What did the judge do? 
This is absolutely ridiculous and outrageous. 
Instead, it was almost a flippant comment for him to make.  
This is the sort of comment that brings judges into disrepute. 
Otherwise they are just not going to do anything.  
He knew a friend of his was going to be released at a certain date. 
He was recaptured within a short time. 
But he had already escaped numerous times from correctional facilities.  
So there is no additional time. 
It is free time. 
Escaping from prison means nothing. 
They get it free. 
Try it again, please.  
I think that is a reasonable approach. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is the House ready for the question.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The question is on Motion No. 1. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The division on Motion No. 1 stands deferred.  
The House will now proceed to the consideration of Motion No. 2. 
A committee referred to in subsection (6.1) 
For the purpose of subsection (6.2), 
That is authorized by section 26(2) of the bill.  
Parliament is given no opportunity or authority to respond to the report. 
Why do we want this? 
This is at a time when so many families are struggling.  
Why are we going to tax them more? 
Because judges need a raise and of course we need a raise. 
It is wrong because it is not fair.  
It is absolutely wrong. 
We are going to receive that. 
By the force of law determined by the majority over there. 
There is something wrong with this. 
One in five children are reported to be living in poverty. 
What does that say about the families they come from? 
This bill is going to take more from them.  
It is reprehensible what we are doing to the people of Canada. 
We are not protecting their rights when we do these kinds of things. 
That is not right. 
It is not fair. 
It is reprehensible and should be reconsidered.  
I will go back and say it is wrong. 
We are caught in the middle of this, all of us. 
It is not right.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
It is a very sensible amendment.  
I wonder why the government members do not recognize them and amend them. 
This motion would allow that to happen. 
Time and time again this government has contributed to the declining role of parliamentarians. 
We have seen this most recently at the hands of judicial activism. 
That happens every day of the week.  
That is up to legislators and we should have the courage to do it''. 
I think we all agree with that statement. 
He made a very wise and good statement. 
This kind of an amendment would help make these things possible.  
It comes down to one question. 
They are beginning to run the country.  
The highest court of the land is here. 
The courts constantly make an end run around the democratic process. 
They do that all the time. 
Then they tell all members of their particular party how they are to vote. 
They had better vote that way because if they do not they will be punished. 
What kind of representation is that?  
Recently I made a new friend in Airdrie, Alberta. 
The gentleman is in his elderly years and is a veteran of World War II. 
I have a medal of bravery. 
I would like to give you these two medals to take back to the government. 
The undemocratic processes that go on are not what I fought for''. 
He is demanding that we change things.  
Dictatorship should end, starting with these kinds of measures. 
Things should be brought before us to scrutinize. 
Things should be brought into this place to let us debate the definition of spouse. 
Let them be the ones who make decisions in this regard. 
We should remember they are the ones who pay the bills.  
Canada is the greatest country in the world. 
It could be the greatest democracy in the world, but we are not a democracy. 
We are a dictatorship. 
Let us change it and let us change it today.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
I want to set things straight. 
Clause 6 creates the Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission. 
Paragraph (4) refers to the possibility of initiating inquiries at the minister's request.  
Paragraph (6) states as follows: 
A committee referred to in subsection (6.1) 
This is the important part. 
All members of parliament are elected to represent the constituents in their respective ridings. 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rose yesterday to speak to Motion No. 1. 
Therefore the motion put forward by my colleague from Crowfoot is very important. 
I ask all members to take a careful look at it. 
The same rationale applies to me as well. 
Those same arguments apply to me.  
What greater accountability is there than that?  
As members know, today this is under scrutiny.  
Another question regards where the laws of the nation are made. 
They have to follow the law. 
They have to interpret the law. 
They do not have to read into something when it is not there. 
The responsibility of a creating a concise law belongs to this Chamber.  
We know what its point of view is. 
Its point of view is to spend money, keep the elite happy.  
The Constitution guarantees judiciary independence. 
We are not infringing on judiciary independence. 
We are extremely proud of the fact that the judiciary is independent in this nation. 
Nevertheless there still has to be accountability. 
Nevertheless the judiciary represents also the views of society. 
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
There is a terrific backlog in our courts across the nation. 
I rather doubt it.  
It does not make sense and it is not fair.  
My goodness, how good they were to them. 
I want to spend a few moments to discuss that commission in some detail. 
Eventually the Minister of Justice is to table a copy of the commission's report.  
The commission will consist of three members appointed by the governor in council. 
In effect, governor in council appointments are code language for patronage appointments. 
There is more opportunity for patronage.  
That type of enlightened thinking is not present in this bill. 
Canadians will be unimpressed with this legislation. 
There are better things for us to do in this parliament.  
Instead they tinker around the edges of it. 
Does that not make sense? 
Is that not democracy in action?  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
They do not cry ``no''; they cry ``no way''.  
We need to follow the advice of this motion. 
The word ``orders'' is used. 
The tribunals are telling us what definition such terms as spouse and marriage will take. 
Democracy is wavering on some of these issues and it is wavering badly.  
I want to talk about my constituents. 
Did they get retroactive pay?  
Up near the top of the list was our court system. 
But what are they saying? 
This bill, as the amendment says, should go back to committee. 
The government should have no fear of sending it back. 
I do not care whether the session is almost over. 
The people will say ``The government has done it again''.  
It may take them 10 years to get back to normal.  
I beg the House to support this motion. 
I think the judges can live on $140,000 without due concern. 
I do not think our justice system is going to fall to pieces. 
This is a good motion and I beg everyone to support it.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to partake in the debate today. 
It also calls for the review process to kick in. 
Then, of course, it will be further examined in the other Chamber.  
I can assure members that there are many problems within our justice system. 
I feel it is important to have that on the record.  
The motion itself, I will indicate quite clearly, the Conservative Party supports. 
We are supportive in principle. 
A positive suggestion has been put forward. 
We are supportive of this amendment. 
Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
There is not unanimous consent.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
I have been very concerned about the tendency for this to occur. 
That commission put out a report. 
The report from that independent body was completely ignored by the government. 
That should not occur.  
I may sound repetitive but I cannot express it enough. 
I do not think Canadians are aware of what is happening. 
We have often asked questions about semi-judicial committees and boards. 
The motion makes a whole lot of sense. 
Whenever that happens Canadians become suspect and often with very good reason. 
We see it in the parliamentary system. 
I could go on and on. 
We should encourage them to enter into what is happening in the House.  
I would like to see support by all members of the House. 
We could review issues in a House committee and the House committee could make suggestions. 
Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. 
As a result it seems to me that this is a redundant section. 
The point is that it is already referred to us. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
That is at the discretion of the government. 
The report need not be tabled at committee. 
What are they trying to hide? 
I submit that no damage would be done. 
That is why the government is opposing it.  
This was followed of course by the government.  
I really wonder why the government is opposing this. 
Let us not be mistaken. 
They sit on the bench and legislate from the bench. 
We ought not to isolate judges. 
Do you know something, Mr. Speaker? 
Let us not prejudge the wisdom of the public. 
What did he do? 
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
Does anyone think they will be objective in their deliberations? 
The real issue is not about a pay increase for judges. 
How many people in my own riding would support this pay increase? 
I do not think too many would. 
For years we have talked about the Young Offenders Act. 
There are many components to a justice system. 
My colleagues speaking on this subject indicated that politicians are included. 
I agree, politicians are part of the problem. 
Perhaps they are the problem. 
The government has to be more accountable for this current situation. 
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
Is that not amusing, that one is an interference and one is not?  
It issued it as an order to the government. 
Theoretically the government does not actually have to obey the order. 
It could say we are certainly not going to take orders from the judges. 
It is unfortunate that as usual the government will not accept any of them. 
It will overrule all of them. 
It is time we took action in this place to correct the problems. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
It deals with the issue of accountability. 
That is where this amendment is going. 
That is what this amendment accomplishes. 
I do not see the problem with that.  
Those are the facts.  
They crack the whip as they do in the House of Commons. 
What would they think about this piece of legislation?  
The money has to come from somewhere. 
Where will it come from? 
I see my time has expired. 
I always I get interrupted by question period.  
Mr. Carmen Provenzano (Sault Ste. Marie, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Reform offers a fresh alternative. 
The hon. member for Davenport 
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
This act of cruelty demoralized an entire people. 
Ms. Colleen Beaumier (Brampton West-Mississauga, Lib.):
Have we forgotten that Nelson Mandela was also in prison? 
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this might be entitled a tale of two resumes.  
Canada continues to welcome to its shores in excess of 200,000 people annually. 
I recently received two resumes from one individual. 
He has a certificate in sanitation, safety and hygiene.  
Canada cannot continue to waste its human capital.  
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
They serve it well.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, Senator Cogger has been convicted of the offence of unlawfully using his influence. 
Canadian are tired of this political ineffectiveness and corruption.  
This senator's actions serve as another disappointing example. 
Do the right thing. 
An election can be held without constitutional amendment. 
It is happening this fall in Alberta.  
If he refuses to resign the Senate should send him out.  
Patronage pork is out. 
Let Canadians pick an elected Senate. 
REFORM PARTY OF CANADA 
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
I find the Bloc Quebecois' association with them offensive.  
THE ATLANTIC GROUNDFISH STRATEGY 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
First, TAGS is being wound up prematurely, a year earlier than promised. 
Their callous treatment of the people of Atlantic Canada will not soon be forgotten.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
OPERATION ENFANT SOLEIL TELETHON 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
I will do as promised tomorrow morning. 
REFORM PARTY OF CANADA 
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
So they represent two sides of the same dubious coin.  
Lucien Bouchard said ``I do not view the Reform Party as an adversary''. 
That is the truth. 
Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Fishing resorts, charter operations and communities are very concerned. 
The hold ups are political. 
INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION OF INVENTIONS 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, this year, the 26th International Exhibition of Inventions was held in Geneva.  
Its more than 100,000 visitors came from all over the world. 
JARDIBAC of Nicolet was awarded the industrial design award. 
Congratulations to all of these prize winners.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Officials are meeting in order to explore a whole range of options.  
That is the way we think work is properly done.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We have people looking carefully at all the options. 
Why will he not let that work go on?  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
I would rather see the work done properly.  
When we have that information we will then make a decision. 
That is the responsible way of approaching this.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
It was really breaking news for the member, I suppose.  
The reality is that all the options are being examined. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Some of them came there saying they were uncertain if they could afford that. 
Why has be betrayed these victims again?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there were extensive discussions with the airlines. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, of course the president of Air Canada would express some reservation. 
He is a businessman and likes to get everything he wants. 
However, we in government have to take a balanced view. 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
We also gave five code sharing preferences, which is good for Air Canada.  
We have said that we would review it in a year. 
We have said that Taiwan will probably be given within the year. 
What more does Air Canada want?  
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
We have said that it is going to be continually reviewed. 
Certainly within the year there will be further changes.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Is the minister not sending the message that sexual harassment will indeed be tolerated?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, absolutely not. 
We are taking action on this. 
We have put in place the mechanisms. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
We know the military justice system simply has not protected women. 
They have been victimized again and again.  
Why should women trust a military justice system that has consistently failed them?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Is the minister out in his own field of dreams?  
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Canadians want to reduce overlap and duplication.  
She does not know what she is talking about. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Revenue Canada comprises one-quarter of the entire public service. 
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let me quote the Manitoba finance minister. 
So we support this concept fully''. 
The hon. member for Calgary Northeast.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
There is something wrong with this picture. 
My question is for the defence minister. 
Why were these sexual assault cases not treated seriously in the first place?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Not all of these cases were known.  
We have also put harassment advisers in place. 
We are about to put an ombudsman in place. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
It is not good enough to say that all the safeguards are in place. 
They will not work on their own.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
The hon. member of the opposition would rather we get rid of the victims. 
We would rather get rid of the perpetrators.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
As a result, more and more Canadian passengers must transit through the United States.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
That plan is working quite well. 
It will do very much better as a result of these changes.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
This is simple enough and the minister ought to understand it.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
It will also do the same for Canadian Airlines. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
At least these followed the rules of providing public disclosure. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
It is an alliance between the Inuit and this company in the north. 
A renewal of the contract is possible at some point in time.  
Any company that wants to make a proposition is welcome to do so. 
Perhaps for the edification of the House of Commons I should finish the quote. 
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
The minister is refusing to provide clear answers.  
Sometimes he says one thing, sometimes another. 
In short, he contradicts himself.  
It is very difficult for the Chair to hear the questions that are being put. 
We are losing time.  
My question is very simple:
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
Will these four measures be part of the future program? 
In short, I would like him to act before July 31.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the package we are preparing contains a number of options. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
I support it but I am also in favour of open disclosure.  
Speaking of open disclosure, the information commissioner tabled his last report today. 
Let me ask the Prime Minister about the information he is giving. 
Is he proud of his badge of honour?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am in the House of Commons three or four times a week. 
I am always here to reply to questions. 
It is not my fault if the opposition is all mixed up.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
My question, however, is to the foreign affairs minister.  
Bilateral arrangements are required with any recipient countries. 
Signing onto the international non-proliferation rules is required. 
International inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency is required.  
Anybody who wants to do business with Canada must adhere to those requirements.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the conflict in Kosovo is worsening daily.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of International Trade.  
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her very insightful question.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Does he deny that 124 employees in St. John's lost their jobs? 
The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am always amazed by the exaggerations of the member across the aisle.  
The example used was BPS. 
The member said that 124 workers had not been paid a thing. 
He asked ``Where has the million gone?''  
When we realized there were difficulties, we corrected the situation immediately.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
How many strikes does there have to be before he is out?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
There seem to be a lot of problems in that little family in the corner.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
He obviously has not done it on the hepatitis C issue.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We are prepared to do so as quickly as we possibly can. 
We understand their position, but we are talking to them.  
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
If the committee proposes amendments, that is good.  
The rest of us in the House will consider them when the bill is reported.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
What kind of game is the Minister of Transport playing?  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Route 175 was not raised at that meeting. 
Obviously the minister for Quebec has some interest in Route 175.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Why the flip-flop? 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is an interesting question. 
As already announced, next Monday and Tuesday are allotted days. 
There is more work to be done. 
I would hope to be able to adjourn by June 19 if all goes well.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
What seems to matter is whether it is legal or illegal. 
We will not be supporting this bill. 
ERNST ZUNDEL PRESS CONFERENCE 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I want to reiterate the comments made by my colleagues. 
I am anxious to hear the response from the government House leader.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Is the House ready for the question?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
I was unavoidably committed elsewhere on that day. 
I appreciate that decision, particularly on the part of the government.  
Bill C-26 will accomplish three distinctly different objectives. 
This brings me to the third item which Bill C-26 accomplishes.  
The production of those products or commodities is on the increase all across western Canada. 
Under the present system there is a certain competitiveness. 
Under this new system they will not have that option. 
They will not have that freedom of choice.  
That option is available to the producer. 
I do not think I will hold my breath. 
In some ways there is a trend here. 
I am sure that it is bringing it forward with the best of intentions. 
Let us look at what we had to give up to get this plan.  
It is like a tax in that sense. 
If I recall correctly they were supported by all the parties. 
Some of them were technical in nature. 
They cannot opt out as it were. 
They cannot do that. 
It is taken off anyway. 
A lot of concern about that was expressed by farmers.  
As well motions were put forward by the other parties. 
What we heard really came down to two main contentions with respect to the legislation.  
They were concerned that like the GST it would be foisted on them. 
They were also concerned about the lack of freedom of choice. 
We brought forward a number of amendments at report stage to address this last issue. 
The government will not amend or improve the legislation. 
Shame on the government. 
We cannot support it.  
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
I will not, therefore, try to get involved.  
Is the House ready for the question?  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The solicitor general has now arrived. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the consent of the House. 
You are to be commended.  
Public safety is my priority. 
In my view that is exactly what has been achieved.  
It has also withstood constitutional challenge.  
This means better public safety for all Canadians.  
The benefits of such a system are clear. 
It is the government's view that Bill C-3 is fundamentally sound.  
Mr. Speaker, the member for Sydney-Victoria has a plane to catch. 
We would be prepared to switch the order of speakers.  
Is there unanimous consent that we proceed in this way?  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the members.  
Many members participated in that and many expert witnesses came before the committee. 
Many of us on the committee learned a great deal. 
Many groups had an interest in this legislation.  
Many members in this House put forward amendments to the bill. 
We cannot forget that the DNA databank is a tool of investigation. 
My comments on that are well known.  
I acknowledge the many witnesses who came before the committee. 
We have struck a bill. 
It may not be the best but it is one that my party can support. 
That is always a difficult balance. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
I have some concerns about this bill.  
DNA identification is that kind of tool.  
Therefore the Reform Party cannot support this inadequate piece of legislation. 
The murders must be committed separately. 
Bill C-3 provides a dangerous and unnecessary exemption. 
The safety of society seems to be a secondary issue to this government. 
This amendment was recommended by the Canadian Police Association.  
That authority is contained within the Criminal Code now. 
Why would he not deal with that? 
The invasion of privacy has taken place. 
We already have that in the criminal code. 
What is the difference?  
There are blood banks in clinics. 
Those samples are there for at least a period time. 
I do not know how long banks hold them. 
Why is there no evidence of that happening?  
These people are telling us different through their legal opinions. 
There is no evidence that has ever been done. 
This is very important. 
Debate is on the amendment.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Let us imagine for an instant the scope of information contained in the genetic index. 
However, they identify not only the individual, but the individual's family as well. 
I think that is a shame.  
What are they afraid of? 
I find this most unfortunate.  
I am convinced that those who speak after me will refer to this as well.  
Once again, I must repeat how disappointed I am.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
It was very important that the process did not grind to a halt. 
There is a flaw, a fly in the ointment so to speak. 
That fly is a significant one. 
This is a golden opportunity. 
That is, there was a legal opinion rendered by the Canadian Police Association. 
In fact it would surprise me if it happened any other way. 
We all know there are dissenting opinions constantly. 
Constantly there are juxtaposed positions taken by those involved in the criminal justice system. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
It is not a point of order.  
Beauchesne's citation 806 states: 
A majority of members of a special, legislative, or standing committee constitutes a quorum. 
They were down to between eight and six, and a quorum is nine. 
Standing Orders 118(1) states- 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
It is a matter to be settled with the committee.  
Madam Speaker, I know you have ruled on this. 
If you do not wish to indulge in it, I would like to call quorum.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I now see a quorum. 
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The question is on the amendment. 
Chair read text of amendment to House ] 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there agreement to proceed as such?  
(The sitting of the House was suspended at 4.57 p.m.) 
(The House resumed at 5.02 p.m.) 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
FISHERS BILL OF RIGHTS 
This sends out a certain signal to the fisheries community. 
Fisheries from coast to coast are in desperate straits. 
What they need is some protection. 
What we have to do is consult with the fishermen. 
We have allowed foreign overfishing for years. 
As a result we have a fishery in Atlantic Canada that is almost broke. 
Now we have a fisheries on the east coast that is virtually in collapse.  
That has never happened.  
It was a program basically invented in Ottawa. 
Again, I am not blaming any government. 
It was invented by bureaucrats and administered by bureaucrats. 
From the very beginning there was no consultation with fishermen.  
The result was well known by fishermen at that time as to what would happen. 
I remember the story of a Canadian in New York. 
The New Yorker said ``you must be Canadian''. 
Is that not what we have done internationally?  
The former fisheries minister, Mr. Crosbie, was very congratulatory as well. 
We might debate whether the outcome of that was successful. 
At least the international community heard us. 
That is what we have to do.  
Some of this is absolutely outrageous.  
This year he caught $40,000 worth of fish, gross. 
He paid $1,400 for the CSST and $2,400 for other expenses.  
That is 25% of the boat payment. 
He said he cannot accept that.  
Who in this House could accept that? 
I thank the House for waiting for me to arrive. 
I know the previous debate collapsed a bit early. 
I am looking forward to hearing from the hon. member for South Shore.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
We talk to the people in the fishery. 
We know the people in the fishery. 
It is a tremendous resource.  
That resource is no longer there. 
That resource has declined. 
He did not want to point the finger at anyone. 
I do not think I am willing to do that either. 
There is no fish to catch. 
There are all kinds of restrictions against fishing. 
After that they had to buy it back.  
They pay for their provisions. 
They pay for their diesel. 
They pay for their onboard catch monitoring. 
They pay for any ITQ transferring they do. 
The people who tried to work were penalized. 
That is the best thing that can be said about it.  
We move on to the situation these people are still in with diminishing fish stocks. 
We have a few fish left. 
We are a long way from having a successful fishery. 
Shacking is a term fishermen use for throwing fish overboard. 
It is a very dismal situation these people find themselves in. 
These rivers are under stress. 
No longer are estuary fisheries allowed at the mouth of rivers. 
Mature salmon can no longer be kept. 
The aboriginal fishery takes male grilse out of the fish way for its allotment. 
We have more pressure now. 
We have complete devastation in the fishery. 
The point is that the lobster fishery needs a much more serious, increased effort. 
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
I am disappointed and concerned about the opposition members walking out. 
Let me deal with the bill. 
I know that is not the member's intent. 
That is what this government is trying to do with its various efforts.  
That is what they need.  
We are already seeing some benefits from some of the actions the government has taken.  
Whether we like it or not, no legislation is really going to change the reality. 
It could drive fisheries management to a standstill.  
I will tell the House of the five principles that guide the government. 
First, the fishery must be environmentally sustainable. 
Second, it must be economically viable. 
Third, it must balance harvest capacity with the available resource. 
Fifth, our fishing industry must be internationally competitive.  
This government is moving forward on those principles. 
Conservation is a key priority. 
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
The witnesses who appeared before the committee this afternoon were there at my request. 
Unfortunately, that is not the case. 
It is fortunate that Bill C-62 died in the last parliament.  
Reality does not always reflect common sense. 
This is what happened. 
That is why the public right to fish is a written right. 
The minister does not have the right to decide who gets the fish. 
Clause 5 proposes items on compensation. 
What is needed in all government activity is transparency. 
They will rarely feel the need to continue to fight the results.  
I fully support the intent of Bill C-302. 
However, there are some minor changes that I would like to see. 
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
We have not seen it yet.  
This is very interesting.  
Allowing fishers to take part in preserving fish stocks is very intelligent. 
I imagine the member is referring to native fishing. 
Personally, I think it makes good sense to be informed.  
Let us look at native fishing. 
It has to be done systematically.  
I think that warrants compensation.  
My concern is that we end up with nothing. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Even to have to discuss this bill is incredible. 
I bet it consulted big time on that. 
But when it comes to fisheries matters, there is no consultation at all.  
Number four, pit one region against another. 
Number two, put policies in place without consultation with those closest to the industry. 
That is exactly what is happening.  
The territory of Nunavut has two million square kilometres. 
Guess how many enforcement officers are up there. 
For two million square kilometres, there are two. 
It is unbelievable where this government puts its priorities.  
I definitely agree with him on that.  
There is talk about a crisis with the salmon on the west coast. 
What is the common theme of all these three? 
This department is completely out of control. 
It has no future. 
A good example of that is the so-called post-TAGS review.  
It is absolutely incredible.  
As we know, Atlantic salmon is in deep trouble. 
Obviously DFO does not listen to the fishermen and plant workers.  
We have a classic example of Ms. Velma McCall. 
She used to work for the Sport Fishing Institute. 
What happens a year later? 
This woman is now the ministerial assistant for the DFO on the west coast.  
Tom Bird used to work for DFO. 
Guess who he works for now? 
The Sport Fishing Institute. 
It goes on and on. 
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I support the bill. 
The fishermen banded together. 
He is a former minister of fisheries and he is very well respected. 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
Such an edifying demonstration of good management of public funds! 
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
What is of major concern is the possible future rates of climate change. 
We cannot wait decades before taking action.  
The hon. member has raised a particular point on a particular issue. 
We cannot afford at this time to pursue all options. 
We had to make difficult choices in this process. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Canadians want and demand action on issues concerning the environment. 
All of this could be very devastating for Canada and all Canadians.  
It needs to ensure that partnerships are well defined. 
The federal government should continue to defend the interests of all Canadians. 
It should lead us into the new millennium with vision and judgement.  
What are we doing to secure our environment for future generations?  
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):
In fact it is the only way to proceed.  
Our recent budget will help us do this. 
I am sorry, the hon. member's time has expired. 
The hon. member for Frontenac-Megantic.  
BC MINE IN BLACK LAKE 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
What will the minister do with the money not used? 
The minister should read the recent column by Michel Vastel on the subject. 
The minister is totally out of touch with reality. 
He should step out of his limousine. 
He has never worked for minimum wage. 
The Minister of Human Resources Development has done absolutely nothing. 
What will he do?  
I put the question again:
He has no respect for the working class. 
He has no courage. 
He refused to meet Andre Laliberte and Charles Lacroix. 
He sent his parliamentary secretary.  
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
We are very much in tune with the needs of workers. 
As the hon. member knows it is the duty of the parliamentary secretary. 
(The House adjourned at 6.22 p.m.)
