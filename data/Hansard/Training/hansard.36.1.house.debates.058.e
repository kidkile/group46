BILL S-4-SPEAKER'S RULING 
This is explained at page 712 where it is stated: 
To further quote from Erskine May, it is stated at page 717: 
MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT OF EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
We feel that should not be appropriate any more.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I was unavoidably delayed in getting here this morning. 
Is there unanimous consent to revert to presentation of reports from committees?  
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I suggest that all questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Shall all questions stand?  
CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ACT 
BILL C-4-TIME ALLOCATION MOTION 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.) moved: 
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
I think of what my electorate thinks of this kind of procedure. 
It is so disgusting and so despicable. 
This is such a disgusting act. 
The government members do this and then say they believe in democracy.  
There are three aspects of Bill C-4 that are undemocratic. 
Let us talk briefly about this bill in the time we have. 
Let us first talk about the supposed elections it refers to. 
They should be electing the president and the members of this organization. 
In Chile and Argentina senators are elected to their senates. 
Most countries in the world have elections. 
This is an undemocratic act and we should make that public. 
The editorial discusses the disposal of bases. 
This letter is an insult to the intelligence of the farming community. 
This letter talks about how democratic this board will be. 
It talks about the real power of the farmer. 
It talks about complete accessibility. 
This is an insult to the people of the farming community.  
What are they covering up?  
What kind of prices are they getting? 
They say that will destroy competition. 
This is about democracy. 
That is not the issue. 
The issue is the abuse that is going on. 
We should be able to access the information. 
It should be opened up so the auditor general can ensure accountability.  
Rumours are created because of this sort of thing. 
What are the people in the Canadian Wheat Board being paid? 
What kind of bonuses do they get at the end of the year? 
What kind of perks do they get? 
I want to speak about competition. 
We never see anybody coming to sell it''.  
The Canadian Wheat Board is blowing the marketing of grain. 
It needs to be subject to the scrutiny of its membership, the farmers.  
That is a pretty scary thought. 
What about feed barley? 
Will those crops be included? 
A farmer has to decide what he should grow. 
A farmer has to decide what kind of fertilizers he should use. 
He has to decide when to spray and what to spray. 
He has to decide when to swath and when to harvest. 
The most important thing is the marketing of the product he produces. 
Those people should be accountable. 
How much do they get paid? 
How aggressive are they? 
He has a right, as a farmer, to know those answers.  
We need to know we are getting the highest price possible. 
I hear the words accessibility and accountability. 
That is really what it comes down to.  
We can look back to when this board was formed. 
I do not think we are talking about that. 
The issue of whether we should have it is not the question. 
The question concerns accountability. 
It needs to be open to the auditor general. 
It needs to be open to access to information. 
The people affected by this need to have access to it.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
The government has used its majority to gag us.  
This is not peanuts. 
I would invite you, Mr. Speaker, to pay careful attention, because this is important. 
Motion No. 20 reads as follows: 
What does that mean exactly? 
The company of Deloitte and Touche will do the audit. 
The accounting firm will audit only the statement of income and outgo. 
You know how it works. 
Let us take the sales figure of $7 billion. 
Funds could be misappropriated.  
Take Senator Andrew Thompson, for example. 
He was a good Liberal who headed up the Ontario Liberal Party. 
He was appointed to the Senate by a Liberal government. 
Today, he has fallen from favour. 
But the Constitution tells us he was appointed until age 75. 
We are stuck with him. 
That was a Liberal appointment.  
I can certainly live with that. 
This motion makes sense. 
I cannot see why the Liberals will reject it. 
It reads, in part: 
Again, all this is not very transparent.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
This is yet another example of this rush to judgment. 
I want to zero in during my remarks this morning on the contingency funds. 
For us this proposal is perhaps the worst feature of Bill C-4.  
That is a total of $27 per tonne marketed.  
The minister responsible for the wheat board has been able to achieve the almost impossible. 
It seemed to be unthinkable at the time but the impossible has been achieve.  
Rather it will significantly weaken the Canadian Wheat Board.  
Particularly abysmal was the performance of the member for Saskatoon-Humboldt. 
Western Canadian wheat growers have a policy that I do not agree with. 
They have a lengthy paper on duel marketing. 
They are the ideological soul mates of many Reformers. 
That is the logic behind it. 
I have alluded to that. 
It is in Group No. 5 as well.  
Before I close I want to refer to one of the amendments before us. 
Now it is suggesting that we should do it as an order of business.  
Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, Lib.):
Politics are alive and well in the Chamber. 
Growers have been happy with the Canadian Wheat Board. 
It has been one of the most successful bodies in the country.  
The Reform Party is guilty of twisting the facts. 
Who would represent some of those groups? 
The growers cannot decide themselves who should represent those groups.  
The Reform Party wants a voluntary wheat board. 
It wants its cake and to eat it too. 
I know this hard working member has raised the concerns of these growers. 
Yet how do we address them? 
There are programs in place to help these people.  
They want the best of all of this. 
The members of the Reform Party want the auditor general. 
They tell us that this auditing company does not give them a transparent report.  
All they do is check the numbers.  
They check the numbers. 
The majority of the growers are satisfied with the status quo. 
They have faith in the Canadian Wheat Board.  
What is wrong with that?  
What is wrong with that.  
This would not help their constituents.  
They will have the power to do what they want to do. 
They will have total control. 
They have the majority.  
Everybody wants to say that they are representative of the groups. 
There has to be an umbrella to cover all of these groups.  
We have to have control over a product like this. 
The member from the NDP said that all parties are against this bill. 
The member also said it was for various reasons. 
They are not all in support of the Reform policy and the Reform amendments. 
I would like to bring attention to that.  
I believe the NDP voted with its brothers too. 
We should not listen to the producers. 
We should go by a paid radio announcement. 
I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter. 
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
I will repeat that, the very best price it can possibly get.  
Could it be they do not really want it? 
Do we not have a stake in our own marketing? 
They are being discriminated against. 
People from all political stripes can identify with that one. 
The board must be accountable to those farmers for that performance.  
Put their interests first.  
This change in the object or purpose of the act resulted in three consequential amendments.  
Motion No. 45 would insert a sunset clause. 
Why can he not look at the wheat board?  
This is another accountability measure. 
Their jobs are in the balance. 
Is the House ready for the question?  
The House will now proceed to the debate on the motions in Group No. 6. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP) moved: 
````period'' means a crop year'' 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC) moved: 
That Bill C-4, in Clause 22, be amended 
(a) by replacing line 36 on page 16 with the following: 
If producers of any grain sold and,'' 
(b) by replacing line 12 on page 17 with the following: 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP) moved: 
He said that the majority of growers are satisfied with the status quo.  
It is unfortunate the government does not respect this contribution. 
This amendment provides voluntary opportunity for risk management. 
The option would work in this manner. 
Under this proposal every farmer would have an equal opportunity to participate. 
No one hits the market highs all the time. 
This amendment embodies the true spirit of compromise. 
Producers are willing to give it a try. 
Members of this House should ensure they get that opportunity.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Amendment 36 concerns the federal government guarantees.  
Motion No. 39 is our other amendment regarding cash buying. 
Who is opposed to cash buying? 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
That is not what the speakers before me or after me have said. 
Those corporations did not wither and blow away into the wind. 
That is all we are saying. 
They can and should compete on the open market. 
Its head is stuck firmly in the sand and firmly with a monopoly situation. 
My motion speaks specifically to that. 
It is a nice little segue into what is going to happen into the future. 
Not all the producers, and I accept that, necessarily want to have that choice. 
They then could pool their grain. 
Fair competition is fair for everybody. 
Let it have that ability. 
Do not simply have a monopoly for two crops.  
I would like to speak to NDP Motion No. 39. 
What is that saying? 
It is sooner than that. 
It is going to be used domestically and only here in Canada for feed.  
This is self-explanatory.  
I have talked to the people who have oats. 
They say they would not want to go back into that system.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
This is not rubbish at all. 
There were over 39 hours in committee. 
This bill is not about rocket science. 
This bill is fundamentally about democracy and the governance of special purpose bodies. 
I think the number of hours of debate in this place alone have been sufficient.  
Indeed we are allowing the opposition parties to put forth amendments. 
There has been substantial debate. 
How could it be more democratic?  
Indeed the government has listened to the farmers in western Canada. 
This has been an extremely democratic process. 
That is exactly what this bill attempts to do. 
This is one of the most democratic processes I have ever seen in government.  
I cannot imagine why the Reform Party would want that to happen.  
We have several of those bodies. 
We recently had a debate about changes to the ports legislation. 
That is exactly what this bill will accomplish.  
For those reasons we clearly cannot support these amendments.  
Again, why would we not want to offer those alternative means?  
They would also allow the board to better manage its own risk. 
We believe that would do exactly that.  
That is one of the reasons flexibility is so important. 
It is a bit of the just in time mentality we see in business today. 
These modern changes will help them respond to those issues. 
It is not rubbish. 
The gentleman opposite says it is. 
It is not because we did not hear them. 
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
Today another mythical character roams the Canadian plains. 
He also knows where they park their trucks.  
Farmers are self-employed only in the eyes of the tax man. 
It is none of your business what we get for it''.  
The notion of commercial confidentiality may have some validity on current negotiations. 
But why is the government so opposed to releasing historic information? 
We know the Liberals love to brag. 
How can directors act freely if they are bound by secrecy? 
In fact the Canadian Wheat Board will become a target in international trade negotiations.  
This is the sort of thing we have been advocating all along.  
That is absolute rubbish. 
We have never advocated that. 
We have always advocated a dual marketing system. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
Here too, the appointments were very dubious.  
The opposition parties have brought in several motions, highly constructive suggestions for the most part. 
I have just been doing the math, for the fun of it. 
Let us face it, they are the ones in power today. 
The trust of grain producers must be restored at all costs. 
In that sense, it is an improvement. 
People were told ``We are sending you there''.  
It would now be a good thing to change things, restore the producers' trust.  
If he does not do a good job, he will be replaced the next time.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien:
Or Mrs. Y, of course.  
The problem is with the position of chairperson.  
This is not to say we necessarily approve of the number 10 for elected directors. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
We have had the wheat board now for roughly 60 years in this country. 
Our party is firmly behind the wheat board. 
What is the option? 
That's what farmers are saying.  
The farmers are not saying that. 
The Reform Party says it believes in democracy and a referenda. 
There was a referendum on that issue. 
What kind of extremism is that? 
What does the member for Wild Rose say about that? 
Why does he not go wild on that one? 
That is what the Reform Party is saying.  
The members of the Reform Party are getting very excited. 
I am afraid they are going to start rushing me. 
It is about time they were called to task on that.  
There was a referendum on that as it pertains to barley. 
The Reform Party lost that referendum. 
They pretended it did not exist. 
They do not listen to their constituents. 
In fact some of them should be recalled on this issue.  
The wheat board is a very important institution. 
The wheat board sells about $6 billion a year of grain. 
The profits are returned to the farmers, not to private investors. 
The wheat board is accountable. 
Let us look at who funds the Reform Party. 
He contributes to the Reform Party. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
As a result, he does not stay on the subject.  
He has some minutes remaining in his speech.  
They want a strong Canadian Wheat Board. 
They want Parliament to support that Canadian Wheat Board. 
The Reform Party will destroy the Canadian Wheat Board. 
So I say to them, why do they not listen to their constituents? 
Why do they not listen to what people are saying? 
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
He fled to an urban riding to seek re-election. 
What did he care about the farmers? 
He wanted to go to the city so he could get himself another job.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order and it is a legitimate one. 
The member from the Reform Party is geographically challenged. 
The riding of Qu'Appelle is one-half rural and one-half in the city.  
That is the philosophy of communism where the state is in control of everything. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
There are times when members get carried away. 
I would like to ask the member to withdraw that. 
I never have been. 
I would like him to withdraw that comment.  
Mr. Speaker, they ask what corruptness. 
Who could we expect in advance to support the government on this oppressive bill? 
None other than the New Democratic Party members. 
The only type of authority they understand is a state authority.  
That is not the style or the philosophy of the NDP. 
It is unfortunate that he did and we have him back in the House.  
The Liberals have put forward an oppressive bill. 
What are the Liberals trying to hide by putting in a bill like this? 
It comes up all the time when I think of the Canadian Wheat Board.  
Have we got some more here? 
We could go on and on. 
I should have a thesaurus here. 
We could have a lot of fun here today.  
The Reform Party supports the freedom of choice for farmers. 
If they can do it themselves, then we want to let them.  
I rest my case. 
It cannot be supported in this House.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
It is the best grain marketing organization in the world. 
Producers support the wheat board. 
It has ensured stability in their interest. 
These remarks only prove that Reform members are capable of writing for the tabloids. 
These remarks are extremist rhetoric and we have listened to a whole lot of it. 
The producers, however, do not want to throw the baby out with the bath water. 
They want the Canadian Wheat Board. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC) moved: 
That Bill C-4 be amended by deleting Clause 26.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP) moved: 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ) moved: 
``Access to Information Act 
It is absolutely despicable. 
There are hardly any Liberal members in the House. 
The government knows it. 
He should be in the NDP caucus. 
As a past president of the National Farmers Union we know where his thinking is. 
He wants more control, just as the hon. member from Regina just said. 
Are they listening over there? 
They are still there.  
I spoke on Monday. 
That is the reality of what has happened. 
They do not want to hear from western Canadian farmers.  
The thing that unifies it is the inclusion clause. 
That is the one thing that unified all these groups under a common umbrella. 
They said no, we certainly do not want that. 
And what happened at that meeting?  
Those organizations walked out in complete disgust. 
We are not going to vote on that until next Monday evening. 
It is because of the arrogant attitude of ministers like that.  
What happened at this meeting? 
The majority of those groups walked out in complete disgust. 
Unfortunately my time has expired. 
I would like to go on for considerable length discussing this, but that's life.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, just an observation at the outset. 
We have been dealing with these groups of amendments for several days. 
Reform has the thing through. 
It is a sham and a shame.  
That is democracy in its truest form.  
Only then would a vote occur.  
I just want to run through its demands. 
I do not think he mentioned all of them. 
I just want to make sure we get them all in. 
What other bona fide farm organizations belong to this unholy coalition? 
The Winnipeg Commodity Exchange. 
I do not think I heard the member make reference to the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange. 
Let the farmers decide. 
That is why we support the inclusion clause.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
I will describe a typical farm in western Canadian. 
We are talking about a significant business.  
The bill is a recipe for disaster for western Canada.  
Who would then market the grain? 
One of the biggest marketers would be the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool. 
I lived in Saskatchewan before I moved to Manitoba. 
There was a lot support for Sask Pool. 
It was the largest grain marketing co-op. 
It could compete against the wheat board. 
It could compete against Cargill, UGG and ADM. 
At that point the farmer would have the choice. 
I read from a report: 
It knows a deregulated market for marketing grain is coming down the pipes. 
Everybody in the House should know it by now. 
There is enough information around. 
Maybe this straitjacket will only last until the next election, with any luck.  
I would like to speak for a moment to price discovery. 
I will use canola as an example. 
They have a choice. 
They have to decide when they market canola how they will do it.  
What am I talking about? 
They need to maximize the profits they can make for their farms.  
They do not want a true price discovery mechanism to be in place. 
It is their pocketbooks we are talking about. 
I do not support Bill C-4. 
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
They suggest that we should be listening and doing nothing else.  
They want clear questions, clear statements and clear answers. 
Perhaps these members, when they see fit, might apologize for the comments. 
Literally they have been grandstanding. 
They have been creating anarchy on the western plains. 
They should be ashamed of themselves. 
I quote the word rabid. 
They are classifying wheat board supporters.  
I would like to give the House a dictionary definition of the word rabid. 
Is that the kind of language we expect to hear in the House of Parliament? 
The definition continues: ``unreasoning; headstrong; fanatical-affected with rabies''. 
That is what they have branded the producers of the CWB. 
They have branded them as rabid supporters. 
The answer is yes, absolutely yes.  
I would like to give my colleagues across the floor a little definition of democracy. 
Democracy is 50% of the vote, gentlemen. 
The grain producers have 66% elected representatives on the wheat board. 
That is a vast majority. 
Two-thirds of the directors will be directly voted in by the wheat producers. 
So their myth is set aside. 
The farmers will have control.  
I suggest the Reform Party should be ashamed of itself.  
I would like to speak to the farmers' involvement. 
This has been ongoing for many months. 
Not my Reform colleagues. 
They withdrew all their amendments at committee. 
I would like to take a minute and go through this chronology. 
Twelve days of public hearings were held in Winnipeg. 
The panel travelled across the country and it heard what the farmers want. 
This bill will do a good job for the Canadian wheat producer.  
I will read some notes I have made as I have gone along. 
I would encourage my Reform colleagues to listen for a change. 
The facts are out. 
It is a good bill for Canadian wheat farmers and now they know the facts.  
I see it is two minutes to the hour of two. 
I am going to recognize the hon. member for Brandon-Souris. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
I know they will do that.  
We are dealing with group 7, the amendments that have been tabled. 
This section is the one I have the most concern with. 
However, the inclusion clause is the clause that scares the living daylights out of me. 
I should tell you why. 
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
The greatest enthusiasm will be exhibited by the children in the schools in my riding. 
Congratulations to tomorrow's leaders for showing their patriotism toward the flag. 
Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay-Okanagan, Ref.):
In fact he is arriving home today.  
I welcome Robyn Marie Locke-Hinke to her new home in Canada. 
She is one very lucky little girl.  
CITIZENSHIP AND HERITAGE WEEK 
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Ms. Milojevic's work exemplifies the humanitarian and generous spirit of Canadians.  
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
We encourage it to do so. 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
Such an expert opinion is worth its weight in gold. 
CITIZENSHIP AND HERITAGE WEEK 
Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
The highlight of the evening was the swearing in of Ms. Kim Fouk. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):
This year Tu B'Shvat is much more than just a celebration of Arbour Day. 
Canadians salute 50 years of democracy. 
JACQUES CHIRAC'S STATEMENT 
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
They often use the example of other countries to prove their point.  
France is one country indivisible. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Who is this agent for accountability? 
Who is this new found defender of the public interest? 
Who is this model of excellence? 
Mrs. Claudette Bradshaw (Moncton, Lib.):
They have made me aware of their views and are quite concerned about this issue.  
The government has always given precedence to the option of a negotiated settlement. 
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
Ms. Colleen Beaumier (Brampton West-Mississauga, Lib.):
All are welcome to attend.  
I welcome the hon. Wei Jingsheng.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
They found their Mr. Fixit in Ottawa in Russell MacLellan.  
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
The apology is not lip service. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, what is going on at the Department of Canadian Heritage? 
It has lost its rudder. 
However, Easter and Christmas were excluded.  
The heritage department answer: an act of union. 
I just have one question. 
What kind of information is it disseminating?  
TRIBUTE TO SISTER THEODORA BERNIER 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
Sister Theodora retired on October 30, 1995. 
That is what we will do tomorrow. 
Happy birthday, Sister Theodora.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let us be very clear. 
We will continue on that vein.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
What is his explanation for the vanishing surplus?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Tomorrow what will it be?  
For us it is very clear. 
The hon. member for Calgary Northeast.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
The Canadian forces lacks automated chemical and biological detectors. 
This minister has had two years to correct the situation. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is adequate protection. 
They are already properly trained. 
They will be inoculated. 
They will have all the equipment necessary.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
This document goes on to say: 
Adequate equipment is not expected until the year 2000.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
I think he said the document was about two years old. 
That is about where his thinking is.  
Our people have the best equipment. 
They will be as best protected as they can be.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Here, as in France, the rule of law must prevail.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
His remarks, if they are to be quoted fairly, should be quoted in full.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.  
Mr. Speaker, if this is a trick question it is not very difficult.  
International law permits the unilateral elimination of any colonial vestige. 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Does he agree with these words, yes or no?  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
No wonder young people are worried about their future. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, 48,000 fewer jobs for young people. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We have decided to work with them. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence. 
This is a very serious situation in Iraq and we have many unanswered questions.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there will be inoculations. 
It is expected that the first of the inoculations will take place at that time. 
There will also be antibiotics that will be put on board. 
Nevertheless every precaution is being taken.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Between the two they will have the desired effect. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Mr.Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I again ask a question of the Prime Minister.  
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
I would like to congratulate Mr. Rebagliati for his fantastic performance.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
According to the explanatory notes, Bill C-28 will correct this situation.  
My question is for the Minister of Finance. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The minister acted very responsibly. 
I have absolute confidence in the finance minister's integrity and honesty.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, let us be clear. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we welcome the member's second question in four months. 
It was I who requested the committee to look into the MAI. 
It was the committee that made a report. 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
That is exactly what we are talking about with the MAI.  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
I am not sure what the member's complaint is. 
We have engaged the Canadian public in a national debate. 
We want more debate and more information. 
The question that should be asked is what is the Reform Party doing. 
How many briefings has he had across the country? 
Has the Reform Party used opposition day motions? 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
He tabled the report this morning. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
As a government, we promised five reports and five there will be. 
I think that this report contains some information of great importance for us.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, meanwhile, the unemployed are starving.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
He knows that is not true. 
I will permit the minister to answer that question.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
We tried to interfere with the- 
The hon. member for Saanich-Gulf Islands.  
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, let me tell the minister a few facts.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
What is he trying to do? 
Is he trying to deny Canadian- 
The hon. member for Laurentides.  
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
This is one more argument in favour of a diplomatic solution.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
The hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine.  
Ms. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
That could be done under the Privacy and Access to Information legislation.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
Why not tell us first? 
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
If there is no exemption, there is no signature to the MAI.  
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
Am I hearing the minister correctly?  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
It is not true that they will have some protection. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
It is a series of inoculations. 
The protection starts with the very first one and builds with subsequent inoculations. 
They also have the ability to seal off the ship if there is any exposure.  
There is lots of protection.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
For hon. members to suggest otherwise is scaremongering. 
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member's question is a very important one. 
Both indicated that was their intention.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
It looks simply like damage control.  
When will the investigator report to Parliament, not to the minister?  
Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Trade.  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
We want to submit the case to the WTO at the right time.  
The French government has now promised to send a representative next month. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
Anthrax is a biological weapons agent. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the risk is low for the HMCS Toronto in the gulf. 
It is not true what hon. members are saying about these inoculations. 
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.  
Their funds have been reduced considerably over the last number of years.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
We are going to release it as soon as possible.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Tomorrow will be an opposition day.  
Mr. Speaker, I would like to designate next Wednesday as an allotted day.  
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
There is no further business to be announced on that issue at this time.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
I would hope, my colleagues, that in future this would not occur. 
I would hope this would not occur again.  
CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ACT 
The hon. member for Brandon-Souris had the floor. 
My colleague, you have eight minutes left in your remarks.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that leniency. 
Let me give some names.  
That comes specifically from the canola processors. 
That is not scaremongering, it is fact.  
The flax producers also came before the committee. 
They do not want flax put in as an opportunity of inclusion into the legislation. 
Get it out of the legislation''.  
The oats producers also came forward. 
In fact oats used to be a commodity under the Canadian Wheat Board. 
It was a single desk seller. 
We do not want it. 
The producers do not want it. 
That organization is the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange. 
The Winnipeg Commodity Exchange deals in canola futures. 
There are no more other answers.  
Do not leave the inclusion clause in. 
It is putting fear into the marketplace. 
Just having it in there is a very scary situation.  
The inclusion clause must be taken out of this legislation.  
Mr. David Iftody (Provencher, Lib.):
My ancestors came here as farmers. 
They were clearing the land as grain farmers. 
That is the background to some of the comments I want to make on this. 
We have not talked about that.  
I think that is significant.  
They need those guarantees. 
They need that insurance. 
They seek that insurance. 
It is provided through instruments of the Government of Canada.  
Yet we have opposition to that. 
I find that really puzzling and troubling. 
This is a historic moment.  
They will get that vote and they will become a board member. 
How can anyone argue against that?  
He argued for it in the House of Commons. 
They did not want the charter. 
I find that puzzling indeed.  
There has been some discussion about the inclusion clause. 
I too have some concerns about it. 
Do we want to be beholden to them? 
I do not argue that we do not need changes to the wheat board. 
We need some fundamental changes to the wheat board. 
It must be responsive to Canadian farmers. 
Ultimately it would hurt farmers.  
I do have some concerns with the inclusion clause. 
I share some of the views of my colleague from Brandon-Souris. 
I appreciate his views. 
I too met with a number of people to discuss this.  
I met with canola growers. 
They said they would support the bill.  
I am still waiting for the letter. 
I was hoping to have received it today. 
I think there is still some area for discussion here. 
I think it is inconceivable. 
The member was asking those rhetorical questions. 
I think very unlikely. 
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
I like to participate in miracles. 
I am glad to have this opportunity to speak.  
I live on a dairy farm. 
I want to at least give the government a bit of credit for being consistent. 
This means that a particular grain product is either in or out. 
What kind of choice is that? 
The plebiscite charade has left farmers more frustrated than ever.  
We saw that in the latest of Quebec's never ending referenda. 
The ability of the directors to represent the farmers who elected them is in doubt. 
How can the directors act freely if they are bound by this secrecy?  
That is because the agriculture minister and the finance minister would.  
Bill C-4 is binding on the provinces. 
This was not done and the Liberals charged ahead on their own. 
The message from the federal government clearly says ``Forget it. 
We are in charge here''.  
Is this the best the Liberals could come up with? 
How much more does the government want?  
What has the government done? 
In one word, nothing. 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
It is absolutely shameful the Liberals have done this. 
It was shameful that Mulroney used closure as much as he did. 
But guess what happens when the Liberals are in power? 
They up the ante and even use it more often.  
I think we need a bit of history about this debate. 
We are not growing potatoes in Prince Edward Island. 
I respect the choice that they want to make.  
They want to market their own grain. 
What is the debate all about? 
I believe it should be about a matter of choice. 
A lot of people came to Canada, farmed and opened up the west. 
What were they coming here for? 
They were coming for new opportunity. 
What does that tell us?  
It is a failed policy in Europe. 
Why would it not be a failed policy here?  
I think his former campaign manager was the chair.  
The evidence from farmers was compelling. 
He never even met with the panel. 
What kind of government do we have? 
A monopoly situation, state controlled. 
What did we hear from the farmers who attended the hearings? 
I heard that they wanted choice. 
They have high input costs. 
They need to know what prices are for their product. 
Modern farmers are now growing crops which the board does not handle. 
The special panel made a report which the minister did not like. 
Then he instituted Bill C-72.  
Then the agriculture committee travelled across the country and listened to farmers. 
The member for Malpeque was a member of that committee. 
I attended many of those hearings as well. 
Farmers were saying that they wanted choice. 
Leave it as it is''. 
There were the growing number of people who were making presentations. 
Crops were included that were not previously under the board: flax, rye, canola and peas. 
Farmers are not happy. 
They will not accept this.  
I suggest it is the Liberal government that needs to maintain control. 
I suggest the Liberals are faltering. 
On the other side for farmers, what do we have? 
Farmers cannot do it themselves. 
Supposedly they are not smart enough, I guess.  
So what kind of a piece of legislation do we have here? 
It just does not make sense.  
Why does it not include potatoes? 
Why does it not include Ontario? 
It is absolutely shameful and it should be withdrawn.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Sadly, their yelling is based on scare tactics and misinformation. 
The fact is I did not author the inclusion clause. 
That is who authored the inclusion clause. 
He said he was at some hearings. 
It gives them the choice of another option in terms of marketing. 
That is what farmers demanded during our committee hearings.  
What was this instrument that they had such great faith in? 
As a result of this, I studied that extensively. 
In fact, it has been very open. 
I have not seen that come forward yet. 
It is one of the most open annual reports of any organization. 
Why do they not all support Bill C-4?  
They all support the inclusion clause. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
I used to work for the National Citizens Coalition. 
They faced thousands of dollars in fines. 
However, they support a monopoly which is state sanctioned.  
It is not just Andy McMechan. 
There are other farmers out there who have had their properties seized. 
It boils down to free choice. 
But they had no other option. 
They were put in jail and faced fines. 
It is unbelievable that we have that going on in this country. 
Otherwise they will have to go back to face their electorate in the next election.  
A government never asks for power unless it intends to exercise it. 
It intends to expand this monopoly beyond wheat and take it to these other grains. 
They owe it to them to stand up and stand for freedom on this.  
They should be allowed to have dissenting opinions.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
There was a study by another one of Canada's most prominent agricultural economists. 
Why would Reformers be opposed to that? 
Sixty-three per cent support the board.  
Yet that is what the Reform Party is doing.  
It is at least extremism if not craziness.  
You are absolutely wrong.  
Madam Speaker, the hon. member says I am absolutely wrong. 
Let us get to the question of inclusion. 
They have also made crazy statements about this. 
Why do they get in that state? 
Because they just do not want the wheat board.  
They talked about dual marketing. 
Because their ideology does not like it. 
Canadian farmers will continue to support the wheat board. 
We have to make sure the Liberal government continues to support the Canadian Wheat Board.  
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
They have failed to confuse those who would try to follow in those particular paths.  
However, this House will not do that. 
It has an unfair trading advantage.  
Put this into perspective. 
That just does not seem to make sense, quite frankly.  
I wonder exactly what is the intent. 
This is clearly not the case. 
That is in Bill C-4.  
That is in Bill C-4.  
That is in Bill C-4.  
That is in Bill C-4.  
That is in Bill C-4.  
The seventh recommendation was to allow for the assignment of negotiable producer certificates. 
That is in Bill C-4.  
That is in Bill C-4.  
Bill C-4 follows that recommendation very closely. 
There would be a chairperson of the board. 
The panel recommended that the first members of the board of directors should be appointed.  
That change in Bill C-4 has been well received.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I hope the farmers in my riding are watching today. 
I have news for that group of people across the way. 
In my riding the farmers lead me. 
I am here to give their voice. 
They do not want it. 
There are a lot of things about it that they do not like. 
After all, that is who we are talking about: western farmers. 
One member made an interesting comment. 
I would love to see the response.  
Let us consider the opting out clause. 
During those years farmers flourished. 
Another farmer is being arrested because he tried to sell his grain. 
I was at Andy McMechan's trial and I was at Bill Cairns' trial. 
I watched them being chained and shackled and taken off to jail. 
At the same time I saw a violent offender being given community service. 
Not only that but I saw the farmers get consecutive sentencing. 
I have been trying to get consecutive sentencing in the House for a long time. 
Clifford Olson murdered 11 people and he got one life sentence. 
It belongs to somebody else. 
They want the option.  
They do not want it to become open.  
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
Shame on those Tories across the way''.  
That is what was said by Liberals and today we have closure on this bill.  
How appropriate that is for this occasion today.  
This is an abuse of the process of the House''. 
That is exactly what is now being done by the Liberal government this afternoon.  
They can make choices for themselves. 
This legislation will not bring about that voluntary participation in the Canadian Wheat Board. 
Farmers will not have that freedom to choose, to exercise their mature adult will. 
This bill, as the minister knows, gives farmers no options of that sort.  
They want that choice. 
It is not a controversy that will simply go away. 
The inclusion clauses in the bill leave no room for compromise. 
This means that a grain is either in or out. 
Farmers are more frustrated than ever. 
That is not enough. 
That my friends is not a wise choice. 
It is not a choice for farmers across our country.  
I agree with the Bloc member's motion. 
It is a good one. 
I am for recycling but not in this regard. 
We need some reformed legislation.  
We need reformed legislation.  
That will be a sad day.  
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
They do not explain why this board cannot be completely elected. 
But this amendment prescribes certain limits. 
This is not a case of leaping in and out on a whim. 
The days of government paternalism are gone. 
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
It pertains to the member for North Vancouver.  
I wish to withdraw a comment I made in respect to his comment on that.  
I wanted to get that on the record at this time.  
It undermines the Canadian Wheat Board as we know it. 
First, the bill proposes a cash buying option. 
In our view this will destroy a fundamental pillar of the wheat board. 
It will undermine farmers' confidence in it. 
My constituency of Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre has a significant number of farmers. 
They are squeezed right now with input costs. 
They have fuel cost crunches for spring seeding. 
They have fertilizer cost crunches for their inputs affecting this coming season. 
Literally billions and billions of dollars have been hived off. 
The railways are now saying that they are not sustainable on their own.  
They are all gone. 
Farmers will never forget that.  
The Liberal government will continue to appoint the chief executive officer. 
The board knows what is going on and the CEO reports to the board.  
The government has made it a political issue. 
I do not think farmers will be very happy about that.  
We support many parts of the bill. 
Agribusiness and the Reform Party are a bit concerned about this matter. 
The Reform Party embraced the referendum principle. 
One of the fundamental principles of Reformers is that they believe in referenda. 
We have a bit of a problem. 
One Reform member used to work for the National Citizens' Coalition. 
I challenge the member to name 10 citizens.  
I will name a few citizens who belong to this organization:
Its chief executive officer is Mr. Harper, former Reform member of Parliament from Calgary. 
That is one example but there are other significant examples. 
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
All through the last parliament we had closure, closure, closure. 
The Liberal government has set a record for closure. 
Here we are in the last 20 minutes of debate on an important bill. 
And what is happening? 
The government is moving closure on a very controversial bill. 
When we look at the schedule we must ask ourselves what is the rush. 
For the people in the real world it is boring and frustrating. 
What are we doing? 
They are quite happy for anybody to come here. 
We are having our time cut short. 
There was no discussion about how that should be organized.  
That was exactly what was happening to those barley farmers. 
What sort of way is that for a civilized country to conduct itself?  
It is a socialist way.  
It is a socialist way, as one of my colleagues said. 
Instead of that, we are faced with closure.  
These are things people want us to be talking about. 
That is a list of all the bills we are going to be looking at. 
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
That is what the proposed changes in Bill C-4 actually provide for. 
The proposed changes would modernize the governance of the CWB. 
The answer is yes. 
That was another question asked. 
In addition, the CWB has the public policy responsibilities. 
The CWB does seek to obtain the best prices possible. 
In fact, it is a matter of policy.  
This would be preferable to taking a legalistic approach.  
Why does the CWB need to establish a contingency fund? 
What would this money be used for? 
These are more questions which have been asked.  
I am a farmer. 
I know how important that last statement is.  
It would be less than the related benefits to farmers. 
How it is set up will be the responsibility of the board.  
Why can the Auditor General of Canada not examine the CWB's books? 
It would become a mixed enterprise. 
The proposed changes in Bill C-4 are balance and fair. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
I want to speak briefly on both of those. 
It is an issue of the right to speak for others.  
Some of my colleagues are wheat farmers. 
This bill is really about the rights of farmers.  
Members are now rating me. 
At least I got a one and someone gave me a one and a half. 
I want to talk about law and order.  
Must that be the Liberal way?  
I want to draw an analogy here. 
In my community a fellow by the name of Darren Ursel raped a young lady. 
You do feel remorseful. 
And you were tender at times''. 
Listen to what is happening in this country. 
That says very little for a government. 
This bill continues a monopoly that has existed for some time. 
We will get outvoted in this House of Commons because there is a majority government. 
For those farmers out there we know why we get their support. 
It is very wrong.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
The Liberals have the power and we concede that. 
They won the election. 
They have the majority of the seats. 
But it is unfortunate that they are misguided in their evaluation. 
Unfortunately it is based on incorrect data.  
It is a question of asking is there a will to solve the problem. 
The majority of the farmers want the wheat board. 
That is what we are here representing. 
There is a majority, we believe, that want the wheat board. 
I spoke on another part of this bill the other day. 
I will repeat what I said then. 
That would happen to be the one with the best price.  
I am not saying they are not qualified to speak to this. 
I am going to right now incite a riot. 
ACCESS TO INFORMATION ACT 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
I have some experience with respect to access to information. 
There is a provision of general application in the Criminal Code. 
Section 126 of the Criminal Code states: 
The section 126 offence carries a maximum penalty of two years. 
This is not what Bill C-208 proposes. 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
The affairs of government are often done in complete secrecy.  
I will speak about that in a moment and give some specific examples.  
However, that has not been the case. 
The Somalia inquiry is one example. 
We have talked about that for a long time. 
This is an example with which I am more familiar. 
We want to know what he is hiding from the Canadian public.  
That is what he said, that he would be breaking the law.  
That is what he is hiding behind. 
Yes, it sounds pretty reasonable. 
Lo and behold, the environment is being destroyed by the offshore trawlers. 
It is well documented. 
Our resources are being depleted. 
Yet this minister refuses to disclose the reports.  
Yet we have a minister who wants to offer information in confidence. 
It not only wants it, it has a right to it.  
Yes, the minister has offered an in camera session. 
The Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans is now drafting a report. 
We are about to table the report. 
It is in its final stages. 
The information is overwhelming with respect to the offshore fishery. 
I think that will be well noted. 
That is why we are after this. 
We are after this for the interests of Canadians and fishermen. 
Nobody has a personal private agenda, which we have been accused of. 
I have another example. 
Again this has to do completely with access to information. 
She was promised a report last December by senior officials of the department. 
They will not release it. 
To date, she has not received this information. 
It is an absolute disgrace.  
It is five years later and the minister will not release the information. 
She still does not have it. 
It is an absolute disgrace.  
Taxpayers want this information. 
It is access to information. 
We have seen incidents where they have been shredded or have gone missing. 
Those are just a few examples. 
It would provide sanctions against persons who destroy or falsify government records.  
I have just given two examples of this. 
Shamefully he will not give us the information. 
Now we have an act that is giving the minister discretion.  
It states that the minister may. 
At least this bill will ensure the information is not destroyed. 
I hope all my colleagues are listening. 
We should ensure that the safeguard of this information is fundamental. 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
It is high time that we, as parliamentarians, take action before it is too late. 
I therefore urge all parliamentarians to support Bill C-208.  
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
I begin by commending my colleague, the member for Brampton West-Mississauga. 
From that experience I know that no piece of legislation is ever perfect. 
My colleague has brought forward an important issue. 
We know there have some problems. 
That is what this piece of legislation is about. 
It proposes that an infraction be added to the existing act.  
I believe these are problems. 
I do not think it should matter who is asking for the information. 
I also believe that timeliness is very important. 
I am also very strong on the protection of individual and personal privacy. 
It is a value that I hold dear and that I believe in. 
Nothing in this world or in the House is ever clearly black and white. 
She had left the country on holiday for a few weeks. 
When she returned she was a good citizen and filled in the customs form.  
That is a correct policy. 
I believe it was appropriate for that information to be shared between departments.  
Under the existing Criminal Code offences are defined by three categories. 
Then there is the hybrid offence.  
In this piece of legislation the member has chosen the indictable offence route. 
There should be an offence for the destruction of documents. 
I compliment my colleague.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
He has shown leadership. 
Bill C-216 is long overdue. 
Repeatedly in the House the issue has come up. 
In fact it has been debated ad nauseam. 
But have we found any changes? 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would like some clarification. 
Could I have some clarification as it is not really germane to Bill C-208?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
We will continue the debate on Bill C-208.  
Access to information should also be occurring in a timely fashion. 
In fact repeated stonewalling takes place time and time again.  
I will mention one particularly egregious situation within the ministry of aboriginal affairs. 
Who pays the price, I would venture to say, to protect some people? 
Who pays the price for the failure to investigate these situations? 
This process is an injustice to the people who need the answers. 
It is an injustice to this House and the Canadian public.  
The government will win by adopting Bill C-208. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to take part in this important debate.  
This caucus agrees with the sentiments expressed in the bill.  
This is clearly intolerable in our democracy.  
This is the intention of the bill as we understand it.  
But there certainly have been incidents.  
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
This gives us access to it.  
I was really concerned about that because recently I tried to access information. 
I tried to use the services of the ethics commissioner. 
He said ``I am here at the pleasure of the Prime Minister''. 
Anyway, back to Bill C-208. 
It is the shortest bill I have ever seen. 
The point is very simple. 
Bill C-208 provides that deterrent, that enforcement tool. 
This is very timely. 
Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
I have a bit of concern for what the hon. member for Cumberland-Colchester said. 
He made a few calls. 
Unfortunately the hon. member did not dig far enough.  
Section 126 often carries a maximum penalty of two years. 
That is not what my colleague's bill proposes. 
Summary conviction offences carry the lightest penalties and indictable offences carry the heaviest. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
But the fact is this is not about highways. 
This is about specific federal-provincial agreements.  
The management committee will be responsible for administration and management of this agreement. 
That changes all the ratios. 
That was before the end of March last year. 
This year they have projected to spend another $5.7 million. 
The provincial minister says the money did not go to pay for the highway. 
He says the highway is not paid for. 
There is $38 million disappeared. 
The feds say it went to build the road. 
He is a member of the management committee. 
There are only two on it. 
All decisions must be unanimous and in writing.  
So, if $38 million is going to go somewhere- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The time has expired. 
The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport.  
Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
The province of Nova Scotia is the responsible authority for this project. 
As I stated earlier, the government's only involvement- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member for Calgary-Nose Hill.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Harrigan and his team have provided a comprehensive and forthright report. 
It contains no praise for the government. 
Virtually none of that was accomplished. 
We are not giving any meaningful assistance. 
Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
On this score TAGS has been successful. 
For instance, it confirms that we cannot have a one size fits all solution. 
As I said, the report gives the government a useful basis for discussion. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.42 p.m.)
