The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
The regiment being investigated was the Royal 22nd. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I am sure it is not a cover-up. 
Hon. James F. Kelleher :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I do not recall the specific article to which my honourable friend refers. 
Hon. James F. Kelleher :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
The announcement tells us that there is a benefit package enclosed.  
I suppose that would be offshore, overseas. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I would need to seek more information for him on that.

Thereafter, the bill was passed on third reading.  
I believe these amendments also enhance the bill.  
Honourable senators, I believe that these amendments have improved this provision.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
The amendments that speak to the Criminal Code are precise and particular. 
The amendment corrected that. 
With those remarks, honourable senators, I endorse the comments made by Senator Lewis. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
The Senate need not have any hesitation. 
Look at what is being done at the present time. 
I hope that honourable senators will not back off from taking the initiative. 
I am looking at Senator Cohen, and I could mention others. 
Man for man, woman for woman, we are way ahead of the House of Commons. 
Why should we hesitate to say it? 
Why should we be afraid to stand up at this time? 
We have to take the initiative.  
Bill to Amend-Report of Committee Adopted 
Many of the amendments proposed are administrative in nature. 
The bill was reported with three amendments:
Honourable senators, I thank the Honourable Senator Bacon for her remarks on the report. 
The original act also required a three-year review of the law. 
Here are some of the commissioner's observations: 
The facts speak for themselves. 
Last fall, our Senate committee was presented with the reality:
Deaths from big trucks were more than double that number, standing at 578. 
Another report gave us a different perspective. 
We heard that they do take the common sense approach. 
I am not suggesting that this board should investigate every trucking accident on the highways. 
As the U.S. agency does, it could be selective. 
I find that puzzling on two counts:
Transport Canada tells us that road safety in Canada is a shared responsibility. 
Perhaps it could make recommendations about commercial carriers. 
Very fortunately, no one was injured. 
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration 
Eighteenth Report of Committee Adopted 
Honourable senators, I move the adoption of this report.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Summer is fast approaching. 
The pictures require refurbishing, and that will be done this summer.  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Veterans Health Care Services 
Interim Report of Social Affairs, Science and Technology Committee Adopted 
Hon. Philippe Deane Gigantes :
Honourable senators, I move the adoption of the report.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Regrettably for these individuals and their families, there has been no closure. 
Senator Moore's proposal is to ensure that this will not occur in the future. 
He is urging the provinces and the territories to pass such laws.  
Hon. Wilfred P. Moore :
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
I believe that this is a most important matter. 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Canada-Japan Inter-Parliamentary Group 
Sixth Annual Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum, Seoul, Korea-Inquiry-Debate Concluded 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
We were not disappointed. 
Fax to fax will never replace face to face.  
Canada is well positioned to participate in this type of investment opportunity. 
We have the skill and the capital. 
Canada has already made important economic gains in this region. 
Today, Korea is Canada's sixth largest trading partner. 
In 1995, two-way trade reached $6 billion. 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
If no other senator wishes to speak, this inquiry is considered debated.  
Legalization of Industrial Hemp Cultivation 
She has provided a valuable service to Canadian farmers.  
In my home province of Manitoba, hemp was both grown and milled. 
In that regard, a recent article in The Financial Post stated: 
Hemp is on the cusp of becoming a big business in Canada.... 
Companies like Giorgio Armani, Ralph Lauren and Adidas are using hemp.  
Its Latin name means, literally, "the useful plant." 
Nothing flies without good research and development. 
I congratulate Senator Milne and all the other senators who supported her initiative.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Effect of Federal Policies on Coastal Communities-Inquiry-Debate Concluded 
Hon. Pat Carney rose pursuant to notice of April 30, 1998: 
We want a West Coast solution. 
We still have fish. 
The Pacific salmon fishery is a sunrise industry. 
In order to work, this program must address and correct three basic issues.  
This forced fishermen to buy additional rights to fish. 
We are not talking about transitional funds. 
We are talking about real work for real people.  
This shows that the fishery has to be managed closer to the region.  
Personally, I have long advocated joint management of the fishery. 
It can also be done in the fishery in British Columbia.  
The dilemma of the coastal communities is illustrated in the fate of the fuel docks. 
When that goes, so goes the neighbourhood. 
The demise of the fish stocks will have a tremendous impact on the whole coast. 
Any federal aid package must address this fact. 
Fortier called our position, "...valid, justified, reasonable and practical." 
More than our fair share is at stake. 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
If no other senator wishes to speak, this inquiry is considered debated.  
Proclamation of Day of Recognition-Motion Adopted 
Hon. Bill Rompkey , pursuant to notice of May 5, 1998, moved: 
Indeed, we are still serving in peace-keeping missions in Bosnia. 
We have been in every peace-keeping mission since 1948. 
That is indeed a record of achievement of which Canadian can be proud.  
Not only have we served abroad, we have served at home. 
They served with distinction. 
However, those "SAR techs," as they are called, are the jewel of the Canadian Forces. 
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
The armed forces have gone through some very trying times. 
As a result of these trying times, people have recognized their real value. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
I could request that debate be adjourned, but that might very well be misinterpreted.  
I was a member of the military police in Winnipeg.  
I am sure Senator Carstairs knows what I am talking about. 
These are not the most exciting places in Canada. 
The first is the disbanding of the Airborne Regiment. 
I believe that could have been done differently. 
I was not chairman of the Liberal caucus of Quebec then. 
In fact, I was not in the caucus. 
This excellent initiative will at least boost the morale of our troops. 
Honourable senators, we must think of the little people. 
The little people are in a state of moroseness. 
After 13 years of service, he will receive almost the same salary as a senator. 
I have no objection to that. 
They see it, they suffer and they are in a bad state.  
Everyone is happy when the forces are at hand to help when necessary. 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2:00 p.m.
