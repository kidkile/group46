Monday, October 26, 1998 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
FISHERS' BILL OF RIGHTS 
Mr. Charles Hubbard (Miramichi, Lib.):
In Canada, of course, we have our own human rights legislation. 
They too might need to have their rights protected. 
I have certain concerns with the bill in terms of this group of people. 
I know that fisher people are a very important part of our economy. 
We are looking at alternate species. 
We have to be concerned with what our responsibilities are.  
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
The bill describes a bill of rights for fishermen. 
This is good for two reasons. 
It is an attempt to bring accountability to the bureaucracy.  
There is nothing to say that the fishermen's representations have to be heeded. 
Nor does it give any meaningful decision making power to those affected. 
There is a prohibition against any decisions being made until all the hearings are exhausted. 
However this is not set out in the bill. 
These clauses are probably unconstitutional. 
There are very good areas within the bill but there are also areas of concern.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
From their own successes and mistakes people have learned about fishing. 
Fishers have been taught by their parents and by their communities as a whole. 
This peril is responsible for the unbelievable event of entire fish stocks being wiped out. 
This danger is the federal government's mishandling of fisheries issues.  
Certainly not the Department of Fisheries and Oceans bureaucrats living in Ottawa.  
It is a crime. 
There are over 40,000 fishers out of work. 
The government has spent over $3.4 billion in income support.  
Fishers should be consulted about fish stocks. 
The people in my riding who make their living from the sea are not millionaires. 
How did the government respond? 
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
I listened with great interest to the hon. member who just concluded. 
How can anyone be against that consultation and involvement process?  
I commend my colleague for bringing forward this fishers bill of rights. 
It is a step in the right direction.  
I want to speak for a moment about the public right to fish. 
He talked about five fish a day and so many people in a boat.  
We cannot get in our boats and go out and fish any more. 
He basically has given us three days to fish for our food fishery.  
We get three days. 
Why should we not be allowed to fish for 68 days for a food fishery. 
It is the same fish. 
They swim around the globe.  
Yes, they swim around the globe.  
How can anyone argue against it? 
I support the bill. 
We will have greater fish resources for the future. 
What future is there for people? 
This has been forced upon people because there is no employment.  
The Government of Canada mismanaged our fish resources. 
It has to take responsibility. 
Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam, Lib.):
It is unnecessary for many reasons.  
It would bring fisheries management in Canada to a standstill.  
The bill is impractical for another reason, its potential cost to the taxpayers. 
This could create a huge financial obligation for the government. 
Where does the hon. member think this money would come from? 
Now is not the time to be incurring substantial obligations.  
Consider the double bind that this would create for the minister and his officials. 
The wording is so vague as to be open to multiple interpretations.  
What exactly does this mean? 
The bill does not say.  
The bill is both unnecessary and unworkable. 
It is not just Canada that has seen the consequences of overfishing. 
This government is putting those policies in place. 
It will provide a binding and compulsory settlement for fishing disputes among states.  
I urge the House to reject this bill.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
The public right knows neither left nor right.  
It has stood the test of time. 
That equality of access deserves careful tending in a fast changing world.  
All members of the public are equally entitled to access.  
This ancient right has stood the test of time and is very much alive today. 
It guarantees the public right of access in public waters. 
In the 1866 legal opinion the solicitor general states: 
They are its trustee, its guarantor.  
Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):
I do not believe so. 
Let me explain why.  
Let us first take a look at what the honourable member wants to achieve. 
The government has listened.  
The bill before the House today is unnecessary. 
Let me give an example of why this approach is impractical.  
How would that situation have been handled under this bill? 
What condition would the stocks have been in by then?  
Those with a stake in the fishery should be consulted and they are. 
The minister of fisheries is the member of cabinet responsible for fisheries. 
Change is happening and not just in the case of groundfish. 
This consultation is continuing. 
If there are no fish there can be no fishers. 
The bill before the House does nothing for conservation. 
From a drafting perspective this bill is vague. 
That is very clear. 
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
Never has the need been as great as it is this day. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I must now interrupt the hon. member. 
ALLOTTED DAY-EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE 
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC) moved: 
I will share my time with the hon. member for Burin-St. 
They still count toward eligibility and duration.  
We do not know the fate of this valuable program.  
It does not belong to the Liberal cabinet.  
We have argued for cuts in EI premiums. 
Make no mistake, it is a serious problem that must be fixed''.  
The member for Hillsborough was of this opinion: ``The solution will work. 
This change gives claimants the best of both worlds. 
I doubt there are many who would argue that reforms were not needed''.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
But it is not on November 15 that people will start suffering. 
Could this not be pointed out to the minister? 
I am looking for arguments that would convince him. 
I would like to hear what the member for Madawaska-Restigouche thinks could be done. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question.  
Yes, there are only three weeks left before the end of this project. 
This reform affected a number of regions in Canada, and the poorest Canadians were affected.  
Obviously, we are referring to education. 
Today we see that only three weeks are left before the end of this project. 
The employment insurance reform was a mistake from the outset. 
The government made these changes only a few weeks before the election. 
CANADA CUSTOMS AND REVENUE AGENCY ACT 
BILL C-43-NOTICE OF TIME ALLOCATION 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
ALLOTTED DAY-EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE 
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
Adjustment programs and projects have been very positive. 
I go on record as saying that adjustment programs have been very positive. 
It is very important.  
I know Atlantic Canada best. 
Ridings such as Burin-St. 
They rely very heavily on an adjustment program. 
They are very positive for those people. 
They know the impact of this program. 
My colleague introduced his motion very well. 
He explained the criteria of the projects very well. 
I go on record as supporting the motion. 
I appeal to the minister. 
I respect and appreciate that.  
We have about three weeks left. 
I hope we will get the minister's evaluation very soon. 
It comes down to which one the minister chooses. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The amendment is in order. 
Debate is on the amendment.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I always enjoy listening to the member for Burin-St. 
I am not really surprised.  
He talked very much in general terms. 
Could the member for Burin-St. 
Is it the bundling or is it the excluding?  
On a serious note I did say that it was a positive initiative. 
They have been positive adjustment programs. 
Consequently the EI rate keeps up and they get a higher benefit. 
That is the positive. 
Those are the specifics.  
I can tell the parliamentary secretary that in Burin-St. 
It is beneficial to them and their families.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Sackville-Eastern Shore.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I put on the desk of the member for Burin-St. 
I would like the member to comment. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his comment and question.  
It is obvious what people in those situations must do. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
So far, the new EI program is having some success. 
We decided to test two types of adjustment projects. 
The collection of data is now being completed. 
We take this commitment very seriously.  
We remain open to resolving problems that arise, like shorts weeks. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
These comments were not made by separatists. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
Mr. Speaker, thank you for giving me the opportunity to reply- 
Mr. Speaker, I was not done with my comments. 
It is the minister who made some kind of claim. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I understand, but five minutes are allocated for two questions and two replies.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
He wants us to pay- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It is not only for the Atlantic provinces. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
The collection of data is being completed. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It is a very grey area. 
I would feel much more comfortable if we did not get into that grey area. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
It is a big program. 
We have spent somewhere in the range of $230 million so far on the program. 
Now we are in a situation where the program is coming to an end. 
My colleagues across the way are arguing that it is a good program. 
Others like me are saying we just do not know. 
We do not have any evidence. 
I want to talk about the need for fundamental reform of employment insurance. 
Let us let them set the benefits and set the premiums.  
He talked about experience rating which has substantial merit. 
This would then create disincentive to lay people off.  
There is a real positive incentive to keep people on.  
I really believe it is time to look at that.  
I also want to talk about the other big employment insurance problem we have today. 
I am talking here about workers and employers.  
I submit that money does not belong to the government. 
I condemn this government for talking about taking that money.  
Five hundred dollars a year per employee going back to a small business is helpful. 
Why do we not just be fair? 
What is wrong with that? 
Why do we not just give people back the money we have taken from them? 
We also know businesses and labour agree with this. 
He had no answer.  
Why does it pay interest if it is just to itself? 
Is the government paying interest to itself? 
I do not think so. 
It belongs to workers and to employers. 
Therefore, the government has a moral obligation to give that money back.  
Government members cannot continue to say ``We are going to have a debate. 
That is so fundamentally wrong.  
It points to the increasing arrogance that we see from this government. 
It points to a very ugly trend that we see in this government. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Madam Speaker, I too come from a riding that is very hard hit by unemployment. 
I see the negative impact and the ramifications that high unemployment has.  
I see this as just another problem that is created by this whole system.  
He cannot have it both ways.  
I do not think it has worked that way.  
We need a new program to create jobs. 
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I listened intently to the member's debate. 
He thinks this is a bad thing. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
No one in the government had anticipated it. 
Without the pilot project, he would receive $198 a week. 
This is not a huge salary. 
It is already happening. 
That is what we want to say in today's motion. 
They say there is a $20 billion surplus in the fund. 
This is a situation that needs to be remedied. 
This pilot project has been in place for two years. 
We are three weeks away from the end of the pilot project. 
He is unable to give us an answer.  
It is this sort of attitude and behaviour I find unacceptable.  
Behind this motion is the question of dignity. 
Its impact is felt in Montreal, in the west and throughout Canada.  
This evening we will have to decide whether the plan will continue. 
These two decisions will have to be made at the end of the day. 
All members in this House will have to vote. 
We cannot tell if it is really effective, but we do know a few things''.  
We also know that it helps low income workers. 
Seasonal workers are the ones who are affected the most. 
The middle class is disappearing.  
It is over the EI system that the federal government has the greatest control. 
The provinces are not necessarily the ones that should act on this. 
Do you know what dignity means? 
He cannot tell us anything. 
The federal government has a tool available to it. 
I invite all members to give this some thought before they vote. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
We would much rather debate the EI Act and argue for its reform. 
It is clearly dysfunctional and broken.  
It is pretty straightforward. 
We approve of other designated uses. 
It simply is not true.  
In actual fact the minister is taking things out of context. 
Clearly the system is dysfunctional and broken. 
It is no wonder there is a huge surplus. 
Some people argue we should be spending it on health and social programs. 
Some of the premiers of the provinces are even saying that. 
It is almost incomprehensible. 
Shear perversity is what I call it. 
Fortunately that idea has not caught on in any meaningful way.  
What could be more simple? 
The money is deducted from our paycheques every week. 
They will spend the money in the community. 
Another point has not come up. 
As a journeyman carpenter I served my time as an apprentice. 
It will actually get worse in the next year. 
It used to be $63,000 a year. 
However they still have three months without earnings. 
That $39,000 a year is not a huge amount of money. 
They are in a very high tax bracket. 
They do not get to keep the whole $39,000.  
Otherwise they will find some other kind of work, leave town or move. 
It is as simple as that.  
In actual fact I think they have been hoodwinked. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I thank the member for his remarks. 
He is quite right.  
Representing unemployed people in the province of Quebec should be a huge priority for him. 
We want the EI fund to be unique and fully separate from general revenues. 
It is something on which we should keep the pressure. 
The general public understands why this is necessary. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Madam Speaker, the question is for the member for Winnipeg Centre.  
This motion is not about some type of giveaway. 
I would like to qualify a few statistics and take the fishery as an example. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The time has run out. 
The hon. member for Winnipeg Centre on a quick response.  
I wish it went much further in calling for substantial EI reform. 
Then I think they would get unanimity on the opposition side.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
A gentleman had flown in from Newfoundland. 
One of my colleagues from Nova Scotia started to speak about the fishermen. 
Let me say this. 
The shipyard was going full blast. 
Do we have a national shipbuilding policy now? 
There has to be some compassion on the government side. 
The government has to start thinking about those people. 
It really hurts when I men come to my office. 
Our amendments were rejected by the Liberal majority in the Senate.  
Pilot projects were launched to look into addressing the ``small weeks issue''.  
These people do not need programs that cut them off at the knees. 
They are people who want to work.  
That is why we have proposed the motion we are debating today. 
Good public policy encourages work, self-sufficiency, fairness and dignity. 
He has said as much. 
That money belongs to Canadian workers and their employers. 
I said ``Dear, it is because of the taxes you have to pay. 
It is because of what they have done to you''.  
We are really concerned. 
We are concerned about what is happening with the EI fund. 
I hope the government does not fire him. 
I urge this government to recognize the mistakes that are there. 
Reach out to those people who need help. 
Do not hurt them any more. 
The government is taking away their dignity. 
We want to give them their dignity back. 
Do not make them plead.  
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
The way she talked about them made it sound like they were about the highest. 
Madam Speaker, this is a national issue, not a provincial issue.  
All our people want is their dignity. 
I am asking members to speak to the minister. 
I am asking members to speak out for our people. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I compliment the member for Saint John on her remarks. 
She made some excellent points.  
Madam Speaker, we have already taken a stand. 
This commission should dictate how that surplus is used. 
We all agree on this side of the House. 
I am just waiting for that side of the House to agree as well.  
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, let me remind the member for Saint John about a little history. 
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
I am convinced he would not get a very positive reaction.  
I want to take a minute to talk about this, because it is important. 
We must put the 1974-1984 period in its proper perspective.  
During that period, the Liberals increased the debt from $18 billion to $200 billion. 
The important thing here is the rate of increase. 
Under the Liberals, the debt grew elevenfold in a decade. 
Under the Conservatives, it increased twofold over a period of nine years. 
The GST also helped the government reduce the deficit. 
They always voted against them. 
I am definitely not about to go on a guilt trip here. 
It is most certainly a structural measure for the families of this country. 
But the government does not seem to want to take it seriously. 
There are serious problems of poverty in our country.  
While I am on the topic, I would like to make another point. 
Right now, none of these items are on the government's agenda.  
Today, a motion was proposed to help the poorest of the poor in our country. 
It would at least enable us to ensure the survival of the poorest families.  
He is having a really hard time convincing himself to visit the maritimes. 
We know about that. 
Politicians have to choose. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We will have the full five minutes for questions and comments after question period.  
TASTE OF THE DANFORTH FESTIVAL 
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
That is giving something back to the community.  
Bravo to the organizers of the Taste of the Danforth Festival. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
KIDS FROM THE VALLEY 
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
Kids from the Valley are no strangers to the House. 
Last month they performed for all members of parliament at Kingsmere. 
The member for Saint John showed she is really fast on her feet.  
They are true ambassadors of Canadian culture.  
They are truly Canada's ambassadors.  
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
The program will be administered by Canada Economic Development. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
This show is a valuable forum for young Canadians to assert themselves.  
NATIONAL BLOCK PARENT WEEK 
Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard-La Prairie, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this week is National Block Parent Week. 
This year marks the 30th anniversary of the block parent program in Canada.  
Public safety is one of the government's highest priorities. 
This organization deserves our recognition and support. 
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, October is UNICEF Month.  
A little money goes a long way. 
Just $5 will supply school workbooks for 80 children.  
This Saturday help UNICEF continue its positive work around the world.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
October is Mi'kmaq History Month. 
COMMUNITY FUTURES DEVELOPMENT CORPORATIONS 
Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma-Manitoulin, Lib.):
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, today I would like to raise awareness about EB. 
To date there is no cure for EB.  
Many EB sufferers excel at work and in the classroom.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
Also, it was 25 years ago that Quebec opened its general delegation in Tokyo.  
Mr. John Maloney (Erie-Lincoln, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the message is clear. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
I hope he chooses fairness.  
FONDS DE SOLIDARITE DES TRAVAILLEURS DU QUEBEC 
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
I will indicate some changes that have been made during the last years. 
The list is long.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, what is a good option is certainly the improvement of the federation.  
I have cited federal spending powers. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Edmonton North.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
This is a marginal issue. 
This is a marginal problem. 
If they went too far, people will see. 
I hope he did. 
I don't know. 
Jean Carle will testify. 
Could someone over there please tell us what in the world this means?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
This whole commission has been tainted. 
The students and the RCMP say that they no longer trust the process. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
The public complaints commission is the appropriate organization or agency in which to take action. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. Minister for Intergovernmental Affairs.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
If everything is so rosy, why are they not signing?  
Their only desire is to break it up.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my supplementary is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.  
Which position will he be explaining to voters?  
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister never said that everything has been sorted out. 
The Prime Minister wants to move forward and improve the federation.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
It has delayed the proceedings. 
It has attacked the chair of the public complaints panel. 
Now it has filed five exemption certificates to suppress relevant documentary evidence.  
Is that not the real truth?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
It would be inexcusable and we will not do it.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the solicitor general has made my point exactly. 
If we cannot get the documents we cannot get the truth.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
They are below the United States.  
We reduced those premiums by $1.5 billion in the last mandate.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The only issue is, when will the Tories get their research right?  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I would ask the hon. member for Kootenay-Columbia to withdraw that assertion.  
Mr. Speaker, out of respect for the Chair, I withdraw that statement.  
The solicitor general knows that. 
That statement was incorrect.  
When is this government going to get to the truth through an independent judicial inquiry?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is quite the contrary. 
Counsel to the commission has access to the information. 
It is that simple.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
The solicitor general does not know what is going on. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member is absolutely wrong. 
That is how it is done.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
Why is the money not getting to those who really need it?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
These are real people with real problems and they demand real change. 
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
Where is the forensic audit that we and grassroots natives have been calling for?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
We tried that at the turn of the century and it has not worked. 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
The one really responsible for health cuts is the Prime Minister of Canada''?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we increased transfers. 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
They did not want to sell it to Ottawa's wheat board. 
Now they are faced with going to jail.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. Minister of Natural Resources and Minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board.  
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the minister of agriculture.  
What does he plan to do to address this problem?  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Which one should we believe?  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Let me try again with this minister.  
I asked her who was right, the member or she. 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
They presented a report which indicated very specifically what the costs would be. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Let me say that it is not true what the hon. member has said. 
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Divide and conquer, that is what the government's constitutional strategy is, in a nutshell.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
The most, yes, but the most damage.  
Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, Lib.):

Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Our Prime Minister has said nothing. 
Why has the Prime Minister not spoken out?  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member raises a very important and a very serious question.  
The government is committed to working with law enforcement officials in the United States. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the projected number of immigrants each year is a planning target.

We expect to meet the target- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Medicine Hat.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is just the opposite I am afraid. 
I do not hear those questions coming from the hon. member at all.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
The Prime Minister claims that everything is settled. 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):

Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
My question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
I can assure him that is not the intention of the government.

Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
I would also like to advise the Liberal government that- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We are presenting petitions. 
We are not in debate. 
Mr. Speaker, I move that all questions stand.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have a point of order. 
We have been waiting for almost a year for an answer. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it agreed that the remaining questions stand?  
ALLOTTED DAY-EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE 
The House resumed consideration of the motion; and of the amendment.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
I would nevertheless like to ask the member a question. 
He knows that we support the Conservative Party motion. 
I agree with our colleague's comments. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
I also point out a little recognition. 
We saw that there was a problem in terms of short weeks. 
Some of the earlier speeches concern me. 
The hon. member is flatly wrong. 
That was not the intention of the EI act. 
The intention was that every hour would count.  
So far the results have been encouraging. 
Together their benefits have increased by about $19 per week.  
These projects are well received and effective. 
However, they are slated to expire next month, which brings us to the following questions. 
Do we extend the pilot projects? 
The bottom line in both pilot projects is the same. 
The benefit levels for EI participants are the same under both projects. 
However, today may not be the day to make that decision. 
There were a lot of changes in terms of the EI legislation. 
We cannot just come to a quick, hasty fix. 
When we came in we had to reconfigure, change and improve upon those quick fixes.  
We need to take some time. 
We need to be very careful and cautious. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the question of the hon. member for Frontenac-Megantic. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
However, one of his comments greatly disturbs me. 
Where is the compassion from the government there?  
Is the result that the divisor was 12 or 14? 
Is that the reason the employment insurance is so low? 
I do not know because I do not have the full details of the case.  
I can tell him that we are working in other areas. 
Those areas we have to grapple with as well. 
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
She was responding to a question of mine. 
These are very important aspects. 
Therefore in small ways they are better off not working at all than working.  
That is what the average Canadian would like to do. 
The government is trying to deal with this issue. 
However the order today simply talks about extending it, enshrining it. 
We have not had the time to evaluate that program. 
This is something that is hard for people to measure. 
Obviously the minister has realized there is a problem. 
It is an unintended one. 
Clearly there are some objectives we are trying to seek.  
Some people look at the value of our dollar. 
Sometimes the value of our dollar is underpinned somewhat with the labour productivity factor. 
This is the way international currency equates productivity. 
My riding of Durham has a tremendous impact from the automotive sector and others. 
They want to find the up ramp to the workforce.  
The small weeks provision attempts to address the issue. 
Invariably tax cuts are assumed somehow to be benefits for the wealthy. 
They cannot get out of that cycle of low income.  
It would help them increase their disposable income. 
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
Madam Speaker, I was listening with great attention to the member for Durham. 
I have a clarification on a reference he made to the member for Saint John. 
Ontario constitutes about 40% of the Canadian economy. 
The statistics speak for themselves. 
The statistics will bear this out.  
There is no account.  
Madam Speaker, you cannot suck and blow at the same time.  
So the coffee is cooking. 
Realize that for what he is saying. 
It is not something we believe in. 
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
I would like to talk to a few points which cause our party some concern. 
The Liberal member opposite talked about accountability. 
I believe the motion focuses on the wrong subject. 
We should be talking about what it takes to create jobs. 
Let us get these people back to work again.  
There was a bountiful harvest back then sometimes. 
It was the Atlantic provinces and the maritimes. 
That was a tragedy. 
The focus of the government should be jobs, jobs, jobs. 
They should be provided with low tax levels. 
The focus is wrong here. 
That is where we should be focusing our attention. 
There will exist approximately $22 billion in the EI surplus. 
I am not saying that money is there. 
The finance minister is not hearing anything about that. 
In times like this that is atrocious.  
This is just a farce. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am hoping that we could hear from his colleague.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member still has 49 seconds left in his speech.  
Probably I should wrap up.  
Let me get back to my main point. 
Although the motion may be an apple pie motion, it is premature. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, this will not take long. 
Is that what he is suggesting?  
That is how to build a buoyant economy. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
As a matter of fact what we have here is regional inequality. 
It favours one part of the country over another. 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
It sounds like a good idea.  
There has been a $230 million increase in expenses because of this change. 
This is clearly a program that is needed.  
We do not have the answers to those questions.  
This is a fundamental issue that is at play. 
My concern is that there has been absolutely no evaluation. 
Is this actually reaching the target? 
Are we encouraging people to continue to work? 
Are we achieving our goals? 
If not, shut it down and come up with something better. 
What do we have today? 
We have a motion that says ``Keep it going. 
Keep spending the money. 
Somebody is collecting the money, therefore, it must be working''.  
A third party evaluation of the money spent. 
If it does it is very slow.  
If in fact they are, then perhaps we can improve on it.  
As my hon. colleague said, why just Atlantic Canada? 
Why not other parts of Canada? 
In my own riding there are people who are unemployed. 
We do not question these things when we do not properly evaluate these programs. 
But again, is this so unusual? 
It is not really being treated as a benefit program for workers. 
Yet we do not see it happening.  
I have in my riding the Canadian Restaurant and Foodservices Association. 
Those people lobby me and talk to me on a regular basis. 
This is an industry that employs many young people. 
It is their first step into the workplace. 
I would suggest that it is not. 
That is really what is needed. 
We do not need more in the way of strengthened social programs. 
I am not the only one saying this. 
It has marginalized thousands of workers and even helped destroy our fish. 
It has not been good for Atlantic Canada by any measure. 
Mr. Charles Hubbard (Miramichi, Lib.):
It is one of the facts in the House.  
I have a question for the hon. member. 
I appreciate his sincerity in trying to deal with these issues. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the question. 
I can tell members that there is seasonal work in my province. 
There is seasonal work in my riding. 
I think the premise of his question is incorrect.  
It could be beneficial. 
We are not necessarily against it. 
That is the crux of it.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
He asked the entire chamber of commerce that question at its luncheon meeting. 
Nobody could give an answer. 
There was no answer. 
That was the finance minister asking the chamber of commerce that question. 
The hon. member mentioned Fred McMahon. 
He was also there for that meeting.  
However, study after study shows that if we reduce payroll taxes people hire more people.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with a colleague.  
Two methods of calculating benefits were tested. 
The first one was to bundle small weeks and the second one, to exclude them.  
It is important to remember this. 
What were the results of these pilot projects? 
Overall, these preliminary results are encouraging.  
To do otherwise would be to act hastily.  
In particular, it wanted to encourage Canadians to accept the work that was available. 
During this debate, much reference has been made to the beneficiaries to unemployed ratio. 
Nevertheless, the government does not have all the answers.  
We must work together to find solutions. 
That is not a solution.  
Fortunately, the economic picture is improving in Canada. 
We are achieving some success in our efforts to lower the country's unemployment rate. 
Clearly, we are making headway. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
The Liberals are making it up as they go along. 
I would ask my colleague opposite to get moving. 
This is affecting employees and employers. 
We are only too aware of the system's impact. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her question. 
I believe it is now around 10%.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Middlesex, Lib.):
It should be quite evident that a reform of this magnitude would require certain adjustments.  
In this regard the government has conducted a study on the BU ratio. 
In that regard, the evidence strongly suggests that EI is meeting its objective.  
We are addressing the needs of those individuals through a number of EI related initiatives. 
At the same time let us be realistic. 
EI is not a panacea. 
The goal after all is to help unemployed Canadians get back to work.  
That is why we have other measures that I have mentioned.  
Our goal is inclusive. 
As well, we have taken steps that directly address child poverty. 
The government is monitoring the system carefully. 
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
I would much rather be talking about that today. 
The way to create jobs in Canada is to reduce taxes. 
What do we do with these people, these regions? 
This pilot project helps them considerably.  
The hon. member talked about fiscal measures that have been put in place. 
Was it the cut to transfer payments? 
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his intervention. 
Does the member not think these employment strategies are good strategies for these people?  
They are not working.  
How do you know?  
Why is the employment rate so high?  
Not all regions of Canada.  
I agree with the member. 
There is no doubt about it. 
We have to target those regions. 
The member is right on.  
This is the first year through. 
We have to address them. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
I suggest to the member his statistics do not tell the whole story.  
His party is putting together the study. 
How can that happen?  
We will see it this year.  
The Americans are by far the best off of the industrialized countries at the moment. 
There is no doubt about that. 
We are not trying to oversell that. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
As we know such pilot projects are being tried out in 29 regions. 
We also know that they will come to an end on November 15. 
The Bloc Quebecois supports the Conservative Party's motion. 
I would like to give a concrete example. 
I will show how this lady is penalized.  
So, she is penalized.  
It depends on the regional unemployment rate.  
There are other situations that are just absurd. 
The EI fund surplus is another irritant. 
The government is always carrying out studies. 
What does the government do? 
Today, we agree with the small weeks. 
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I thank the Bloc Quebecois member for her comments. 
I understand what she said. 
Today's motion is justified. 
This is very clear. 
They told me ``No, do not worry, it is not what you think''. 
We are hurting our workers.  
Madam Speaker, I thank my New Democratic Party colleague for her remarks. 
There has been no change in the reform. 
The matter is being studied. 
Several thousands of people are on welfare. 
This reform is unfair and the eligibility criteria are too restrictive.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
This situation has been strongly criticized throughout Quebec and Canada. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
We have in fact been calling for essentially the same thing for quite some time. 
Unfortunately, once again, the government has refused to deal with it. 
The opposition has therefore been obliged to use an opposition day. 
I will first explain what the small weeks adjustment projects are. 
This is due to the new way benefits are calculated.  
I think these figures are self-explanatory. 
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Madam Speaker, once again I would like to thank my colleague from the Bloc.  
I receive calls from people concerning their cheques. 
I have worked more than 20 weeks, but it only calculated six weeks. 
My cheque is only for $60 a week; I cannot live on that. 
I think it made a mistake''. 
I told her no, it did not make a mistake. 
I even received calls from people getting $32 a week.  
Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Beausejour-Petitcodiac for her questions. 
Her questions are always well founded.  
I remember last week's debate on APEC. 
Yes indeed we are getting calls at the office. 
I think this must be said loud and clear.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Employers must pay their share to the EI fund. 
All businesses must pay. 
It is not only the employees who pay. 
I would like my colleague to comment on that.  
Mr. Speaker, this is the whole issue of the surpluses. 
For us, that is unacceptable. 
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
They are indulging in nothing more than verbal turpitude. 
We on the government side do not look upon unemployment favourably. 
He has a small vision of the country. 
Everyone knows that it is an isolationist party. 
I know my hon. colleague opposite is a business person. 
I believe that is their mandate.  
It is easy to say what one is going to do. 
We have actually done it. 
We have the lowest unemployment rate now in about eight years.  
I am a business person besides. 
I see what goes on here on occasion. 
Let us face reality. 
That is one of the reasons we have the lowest unemployment. 
He has already told me that he is a hockey player. 
I believe he is skating on thin ice on this one. 
I know the fourth party, the NDP, is very concerned about the unemployment picture. 
Its members are very eloquent spokespersons in that regard. 
However I disagree with them. 
I do not believe that we should have generations and generations of people on unemployment. 
I would like to see these people get job retraining and upgrading. 
The NDP agrees with the Liberal Party in the area of job retraining.  
We look after our students. 
Everyone would like to see a reduction, but at what expense? 
The finance minister has clearly indicated that we are a caring, compassionate country. 
We will reach out to all sectors of the population to try to help them.  
Some people think employment insurance is a fund but it is not. 
I was not here in 1986. 
We have managed that fund remarkably well. 
I know the member for Medicine Hat likes to get involved in Shakespeare. 
Alfred Lord Tennyson said: 
That is what the Liberal Party of Canada will do. 
We will strive to find resolutions to the unemployment issue. 
We will seek the solutions in good Liberal policies. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, we are talking about a serious matter today. 
This is no time for fooling around.  
This is no joking matter. 
We are talking about salaries of $20,000 or $25,000 a year. 
Does he think that government members are not serious minded? 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I saw the member getting upset just a minute ago. 
They sit there and are happy about it and so proud that they managed. 
I can manage my finances very well at home. 
I can be very proud that I have money in the bank. 
This is not just a seasonal worker problem. 
I do not understand it.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Make it plain to everybody but make it plain through the Chair.  
We have managed that fund very well. 
We are doing a remarkable job. 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke for his eloquent comments. 
I think they were most interesting.  
The hon. member's motion specifically addresses the small weeks adjustment projects. 
I think that is very important. 
I do not have a problem with the small weeks adjustment projects per se. 
Employment insurance is an important part of our social safety net. 
The reform of the EI system has benefited many people. 
EI is now more accessible to women. 
Today very few people stay at the same job for more than 10 years. 
This is why small weeks adjustment projects can be so beneficial. 
That does not seem very fair to me.  
However, we cannot access this project. 
In practice they have only been developed in certain regions of the country.  
It is the Canadian way to help others in need. 
Charity and community spirit are two identifying features of our national psyche.  
It is very sad that the Bloc Quebecois responds by laughing and mocking.  
I would like to see them continue, but nationally as well as regionally. 
This is a problem that needs to be addressed.  
Our social safety net is a big reason why. 
Canadians look out for one another in times of need. 
That is what being Canadian is all about.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
The hon. member spoke about poverty. 
These people clean fire trucks, hoses, etc., on a volunteer basis. 
When they fight a fire, they are paid $14 or $15 per hour. 
Is this what we mean by poverty?  
This government is taxing poor people to death in order to lower its deficit. 
Quebec derives many things from Canada because it is a Canadian province. 
It willingly take everything from us. 
They do not represent all of Canada here. 
They should be representing provincially if that is what they believe. 
But they do not believe that. 
They take everything from Canada- 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That is a point of debate and both sides have their oars in the water. 
We have a minute and a bit left for questions and comments.  
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, sometimes it is unfortunate that we are limited in time. 
That is exactly what he said.  
Reformers do not want to lift people up. 
They do not want to help their fellow human beings.  
The Reform Party says that it wants us to be fiscally responsible. 
Nineteen billion dollars should be fiscally responsible, should it not?  
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Unemployment insurance is always a subject of sadness for us.  
We have not forgotten it.  
There is a lot of sadness. 
She ended up with just about nothing.  
More and more people are living in poverty. 
It's a community problem''. 
He is not the one getting calls to his office. 
I am sure he is never there. 
Very proud of themselves they are, those Liberals. 
The only ones who should be proud are the workers. 
They are the ones who paid off the deficit. 
What was the outcome of that? 
We know the source of the problems. 
They have been right in front of me for over a year. 
That is the problem.  
There was one in a store in Bouctouche last week. 
We used to have a program that had been established to share the wealth. 
Now we have another problem. 
Some children go to school hungry. 
Their parents are poor. 
We do not find a poor child if his parents are not poor.  
The government brags about that fact it has created many jobs. 
We do not hear about those things.  
We do not hear about the women who were penalized. 
A distinction must be made.  
And what about women who are no longer eligible for maternity benefits? 
Before the reform, they had to work 300 hours to be eligible. 
Now, they have to work 700 hours. 
What is good for women in that program? 
Some of them no longer qualify. 
Nowadays, they must contribute, but they do not qualify. 
The same goes for health care workers.  
In other regions, it is divided by 18. 
And then the benefits will be calculated over 26 weeks.  
I would be ashamed if I had approved a decision that caused so much misery. 
The members opposite never talk about this. 
No, because most of them are rich. 
They know nothing about being hungry. 
They need to learn what it is to be hungry.  
I want to talk about Albert county. 
They are down to 18 weeks for the benefit period. 
I have workers who will be out of employment insurance in January. 
Those are the workers who qualified. 
We have proved to the minister a number of times that he is wrong. 
His arguments do not stand up. 
He needs to change it. 
It is making mistakes that are costing lives. 
How many people are committing suicide because of their difficulties?  
Someone explain that to me. 
It is armed robbery. 
It is time to wake up. 
There is a lot of legislation out there. 
We have to wake up and show the Liberals that this cannot continue. 
There is just too much poverty.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
There is a message in there for the Liberal majority. 
This member defeated Dominic LeBlanc, the son of the Governor General of Canada. 
Mr. Speaker, I agree that we should be clear. 
Some people work part time all winter long. 
These people work during the winter when they get a chance. 
If the pilot project disappears, these people will be penalized. 
It is the only thing it can think of.  
Some employers have come to realize this. 
We are told to wait for the reports, to wait for the studies. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
It appears that this motion at the outset seems to be an act of desperation. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We need a decision within three weeks. 
This is where things should be debated, in the House right here in Ottawa.  
I want to talk about the Reform Party for just a moment. 
They want to take that money from workers and employers.  
I am from Atlantic Canada and it is not a basket case. 
The fact is we have some very serious problems. 
Atlantic Canada is not a basket case.  
The entire chamber of commerce was silent. 
They could not do it. 
We never hear Reform Party members talk about reports or objective concerns from labour. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Canso is the birthplace of the modern era fishing industry. 
I say this out of respect for our First Nations fishermen. 
The minister's trite answer at that time was ``The fish come first''.  
They want to advance their cause. 
Did he have the courage to meet with them face to face? 
Again his answer was no.  
Pat Fougere is absolutely right.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
However, this is not just a Nova Scotia phenomenon. 
The traditional offshore fleet also shared in the quota increases.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
In particular, he said, and I quote: 
Two and a half billion dollars were set aside for the millennium scholarships. 
Quebec's share is thus some $600 million. 
At the same time, transfers to the provinces were cut.  
There are also loans that are provided based on financial need.  
As for the Canadian system, it provided loans only. 
This has created a much higher debt load for Canadian students. 
He has no demands for Ottawa. 
Besides, the Prime Minister told him so very clearly.  
My allied in Quebec, Mr. Charest, tells me he needs nothing.'' 
That is a problem we face.  
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour, Lib.):
The Government of Canada recognizes that education is a matter of provincial jurisdiction. 
That is why we introduced the millennium scholarships. 
This makes good sense for students, for the provinces and for Canada.  
Jean Monty, the president of the foundation, is a well respected and responsible individual. 
The millennium scholarships are not about jurisdiction. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.28 p.m.)
