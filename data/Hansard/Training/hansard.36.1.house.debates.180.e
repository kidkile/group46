The House met at 10 a.m. 
WAR VETERANS ALLOWANCE ACT 
Mr. Bob Wood (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):
A bit of background is in order. 
In 1944 the Department of Veterans Affairs was born. 
We have talked to veterans and veterans organizations and they have responded.  
Their medical needs are changing. 
Frankly, this is unchartered territory. 
This is an omnibus bill, covering a cross-section of current legislation.  
The amendments to this bill will remove this bar. 
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
Veterans do not readily stand in the queue for a government cheque. 
I will canvass the principal claims. 
Bill C-61 addresses recognition of war veterans status. 
Equivalency of prisoner of war benefits is also implicitly addressed.  
The valour and sacrifice of our merchant navy veterans are well known. 
Members of our Canadian merchant navy were vital suppliers to the war effort. 
None were compelled to sail but most did. 
There are several reasons given for this discriminatory treatment at war's end. 
Many of these issues are not new. 
Mr. Maurice Godin (Chateauguay, BQ):
This bill will correct certain anomalies and has the support of the Bloc Quebecois. 
Their losses were proportionately higher than those of all the other military forces.  
The government played an active role in the evolution of the situation. 
A Canadian interdepartmental merchant navy commission was established. 
We had the third largest merchant navy in the world.  
We would not have succeeded in landing on the coasts of Sicily and Italy''. 
Their precious cargoes made them immediate targets for the Axis powers. 
Slower replenishment vessels trailed behind and were torpedoed. 
Merchant ships were not equipped for serious fighting.  
This was what the merchant marine was up against during the war.  
The ships on the outside were the easiest targets. 
When under attack and heavily damaged, they were left to their own devices. 
They knew they were likely to die. 
Fortunately, some did anyway.  
Canada did not, however, consider them veterans. 
Newspapers ran headlines reading ``Merchant marine veterans demand soldier status''. 
This is why Bill C-61 is not complete.  
Let me give you some examples of discrimination. 
They denied that merchant seamen were bound by their enlistment contracts. 
They were thrown in prison, if they were absent without permission.  
They were easy prey in the submarine war.  
The authorities denied that they had sailed under admiralty orders.  
The authorities denied they paid income tax.  
The Canadian Corps of Commissionaires was not open to the merchant marine until 1989.  
Most of the demands made at that time have never been dealt with.  
And then there is the whole miserable history of the Hal Banks period. 
Justice Norris described the outcome of his acts as ``industrial death''. 
They were subjected to brutal treatment. 
I think this circus has been going on long enough. 
I will recognize the hon. member for Halifax West now. 
CANADIAN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ACT 
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
The act is now being revised in committee. 
We live in times of greater internationalization of environmental policies. 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
Occasionally we hear from a judge with a finger on the pulse of the community. 
Home invasions have become epidemic in British Columbia. 
Primary targets are the elderly but entire families have also been terrorized. 
Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Middlesex, Lib.):
Perth-Middlesex is a microcosm of all Canada. 
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):
Volunteer members of our communities help young people. 
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Monday, February 15, is election day in Nunavut. 
The Nunavut election is not party based. 
In fact the new government will be a consensus one.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, February 13, will be the end of an era. 
Nothing is as intrinsically Canadian as hockey. 
Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau, Lib.):
Canadians know that our nation's diversity is our nation's strength. 
Our heritage is a binding force that unites all Canadians.  
Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga Centre, Lib.):
Some of the money will support a project known as 30 St. Lawrence. 
Another project that will benefit from the donation is Dixon Hall, an established community agency. 
Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
They want to tell them that they cannot be bought with their own money. 
They want to show them how high taxes are hurting small business. 
Aye, there's the rub.  
Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, next Monday is flag day.  
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
We cannot afford to let these urgent needs go unmet. 
Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):
As well maintenance and preservation work where necessary will be carried out. 
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
The employment insurance program is a good example.  
This situation is absolutely intolerable. 
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Many of the people in our communities have already given up and moved out.  
They also expressed their feelings stating that the federal government and-

50TH ANNIVERSARY OF ASBESTOS STRIKE 
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, today marks the anniversary of an important date in Quebec's history.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
The hon. member for Prince George-Peace River.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Pay more taxes, get less health care and other services.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
That shows what our priority is. 
I ask the hon. member to wait for our budget on Tuesday.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Our priority has been a balanced approach, unlike that of Reform. 
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Not surprisingly, it has not told us where.  
Now Reform has done them $1 billion better. 
They are perfect soulmates.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food.  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
The minister has been given clear recommendations by the advisory committee. 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not know exactly what she means. 
If the interpretation was right, she said unofficial patronage. 
Maybe she would want to clarify it, if she has a supplementary question.  
I appointed an arm's length independent advisory body to make the selections. 
Those selections have been made and there are 68 pilot projects going on across Canada.  
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health.  
There will be a budget on Tuesday, in four days. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, yesterday the minister blamed the provinces. 
His friend Mike Harris is blaming the hospitals. 
Is the minister saying that he cannot cut that cheque on Tuesday? 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We are not going to do that. 
We are going to take a balanced approach. 
We are going to make sure that medicare is there for the long term.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the government's dirty little secret is out. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
The hon. member for Kings-Hants.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this last Tuesday was my aunt's funeral.  
We as a family are offended by that.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Our commitment is clear. 
We have made clear that health care for us is a priority. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
They may spend the coming days trying to unite the right. 
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Finance. 
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this still is speculation. 
I would encourage the hon. member to wait another four days.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
The only hospital there is overcrowded.  
Even stretchers were full. 
Why does the health minister not care about the patients- 
The hon. Minister of Health.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, what is important is for governments to work together. 
We are going to put our money where our mouth is.  
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
They will once again talk about jobs and dignity. 
Will we see the minister in New Richmond tomorrow?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the minister could come, even without an invitation.  
We realize that the minister is very busy. 
The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The Bloc is living in the seventies and saying ``give us unemployment''.  
The hon. member for West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we had this debate in the House. 
Obviously the Reform Party was not listening. 
This is before the appeal court. 
Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay-Boundary-Okanagan, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the debate was not about perverts. 
I think that is a misuse of what took place in the courts. 
The law is the law of the land still in Alberta and elsewhere in Canada. 
I repeat that there is an appeal. 
It will take place April 26 and 27, and we are intervening. 
We respect the law. 
Unlike the opposition we do respect the due process of law.  
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Health. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we will have to wait for next Tuesday's budget.  
CANADA MORTGAGE AND HOUSING CORPORATION 
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
If the province of Ontario would have participated in RRAP we would have had more.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
If the member puts that forward, I will do it.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
The name of the financial manager was Jesse Primeau. 
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
This is heritage week. 
That was native housing in the past. 
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, Canadians are living in squalid conditions. 
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
We are aware of the situation. 
We are going to continue to- 
The hon. member for Saint John.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
The hon. parliamentary secretary.  
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Only a very small percentage of people had any reactions to it at all.  
Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, Lib.):
What is Canada doing about this problem of child abuse?  
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
The government has had since 1993 to negotiate a new union settlement.  
Mr. Speaker, we are in the process of negotiating with the union. 
Eighty percent of them have accepted it. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
The hon. member for Sackville-Eastern Shore.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, one truth is definitely out there. 
Next week the strike will escalate clear across the country.  
I will permit him to answer the question.  
Mr. Speaker, regional rates of pay are there for a good reason. 
They have been there for a long time. 
They are what should be the rule and we will keep them.  
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
We have fleet capacity in addition to buy out of licences.  
We revised the rules back in 1997, 18 months ago. 
Mr. John Maloney (Erie-Lincoln, Lib.):
Our aboriginal peoples are in dire need of adequate, affordable and safe housing. 
Why is this ministry not doing more for aboriginal Canadians?  
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
It goes beyond the question of providing housing for aboriginal people. 
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
That is in fact what we do.  
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
They said it was not the money, that it was the principle of the thing.  
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is again for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
We did look into the issue of vessel size. 
It is a complex problem. 
So the safety issue tends to equalize.  
It is a complex issue.

WAR VETERANS ALLOWANCE ACT 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
It is a very important aspect of this bill. 
Why then are the merchant marines not receiving equal treatment in terms of compensation?  
The Liberal government has a choice. 
But what happened to Canadian merchant mariners upon their return to Canada? 
In Canada they returned to virtually no support. 
This discrimination weighed heavily on so many merchant marine veterans. 
This payment was promised just this past December.  
We figure [the federal government] is waiting for us to die of old age''.  
The U.S.A. has recently negotiated an enviable settlement from the German government. 
All hail to our soldiers, our airmen, our tars, 
Who in these dark days are the victims of War, 
All hail to these heroes who flash on the screen, 
But what of the men of the Merchant Marine?  
No halo, no glimmer, just duty that's all, 
Day in and day out through the heat or a squall 
Grit, courage, endurance and bearing serene, 
These are the men of the Merchant Marine.  
How much do we need them, these sons of the sea, 
Without their devotion, how could we be free?  
For one vital cog in the great machine 
Is filled by the men of the Merchant Marine.  
And so if the cares of these days dark and clear, 
Weigh down your spirits and cause you to fear, 
Remember the hardships and dangers unseen, 
And pray for the men of the Merchant Marine.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
However, many things were left out for them over the years.  
All that at that time would total $30,590.  
As members know, many of them were here on the Hill on a hunger strike. 
When he arrived he was asked for his service number. 
Is is possible to do this? 
All of us know the number of lives lost. 
One in eight of our merchant navy men lost their lives.  
Those were the boats the Germans wanted to torpedo. 
Those were the boats the Germans wanted to get. 
It is time for us to take the necessary steps to completely make them equal. 
What about in 1939? 
They were not equal in those days.  
Nobody seems to know.  
These surpluses have ranged anywhere from $20 million to $154 million. 
We received this information from the Public Accounts of Canada. 
The money was there and it is still there today.  
The minister has put out a book called Valour at Sea which is beautiful. 
Our merchant navy men did that. 
This letter, as I have stated, was sent by our Minister of Veterans Affairs.  
The Canadian merchant navy was considered to be the fourth arm of the armed forces. 
These men were some of the bravest. 
These men know what it was like. 
Mr. Speaker, they lived it for you and for me. 
It is time to act on behalf of our veterans. 
I know many of our veterans and their widows want to see it passed. 
We should not be partisan when it comes to our veterans.  
The government and the House did the right thing.  
A lady came to see me. 
Her husband, a veteran, had died. 
She thought that we would be paying to bury him. 
They thought that she had too much money. 
She had $6,000.  
I looked at all of her expenses again. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Are there any questions or comments on the member's speech? 
I think there are. 
The hon. member for South Shore.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
During World War II we captured prisoners of war. 
They knew what boats were going out in convoy. 
He was a military policeman stationed in St. John's, Newfoundland. 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member from Nova Scotia is absolutely correct.  
He was commenting about his father in Newfoundland. 
That is exactly what they were. 
That is the reason for it.  
Is the House ready for the question?  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
I declare the motion carried.  
I do not think so. 
The Liberals do not see it quite that way. 
They have not allowed their ethics code to see the light of day.  
Is there any reason? 
I can think of only one. 
Maybe they would like to know. 
Maybe they would like to hold them accountable. 
Is that not a strange concept?  
That is just the order of the day. 
This is the kind of thing we simply have to change in the House. 
This is what Reformers came to Ottawa to do. 
Any of the evil going on is all within the country club members.  
So far the Liberals have been unwilling to fulfil this very basic and straightforward request. 
We have asked them in the House. 
We have asked them in committees. 
We have asked them at every possible opportunity. 
The answer has always been no. 
If there is one we could not see it anyway.  
These guidelines have never been made public. 
They are locked away inside the Prime Minister's desk. 
The Liberals have swallowed the key. 
It is clearly written. 
I do not envy Liberals in that task. 
We are certainly treading on taboo ground when we request a code of ethics. 
That is the ground we came here to Ottawa to shake up. 
Now Reformers are demanding in parliament that the code be released at long last. 
Let us see them show their colours.  
This government does not want taxpayers to know what is going on. 
The Liberals do not want taxpayers to know that.  
Canadians want to know. 
Is that not what democracy is all about?  
Canadians are tired of being held in the dark. 
What is the Liberal version of ethics? 
Why are Canadians not allowed to see the ethics code? 
How are government members and especially cabinet ministers supposed to operating? 
Are they not supposed to be telling us all this stuff? 
How are Canadians to know?  
How are they ever to know? 
We just have to look in the newspapers. 
Will they ever get that chance? 
Not as long as this government is in power. 
This motion is all about ethics, openness and transparency. 
That is what is known as open government. 
That is what they want.  
Mr. Gar Knutson (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
First, the hon. member said that we Liberals despise Reformers. 
I actually have a great deal of respect for this motion. 
I commend the member for bringing this motion forward. 
However, I do not agree with it. 
Yes, I look forward to the next election and the election after that. 
Once elected, this government acted decisively to deliver on its commitment. 
We have put in place many initiatives. 
All lobbyists now have to reveal more about their projects. 
The code is a public document and is available to the public. 
For example, members of parliament now have greater influence in the legislative process. 
The prime minister provides personal advice on a wide range of government issues. 
Some things in government need to be kept secret. 
The heart of the Canadian system of government centres around collective responsibility. 
In conclusion, we are proud of our record on integrity in the government. 
We have made integrity a cornerstone of our government. 
I therefore call on all hon. members to oppose this motion.  
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Now we know this point has been settled.  
Two of these guidelines are now known to the public. 
This guideline extends to ministerial staff as well. 
Obviously, many criticisms and comments may be made about these guidelines for the ministers. 
Here are a few.  
The government must be transparent. 
The Prime Minister is not prepared to release these guidelines. 
What are you going to do? 
Will you explain these rules? 
What are the consequences?''  
At this point, the Prime Minister would be obliged to provide an accounting. 
Transparency in such cases is vital. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this motion. 
This document is available. 
No one would disagree with that. 
It is a very important principle.  
It appoints an ethics counsellor. 
It does not put the ethics counsellor in an independent position. 
This is very important. 
We look at the APEC affair and what happened there. 
It is important that independence be there in a very real and meaningful way. 
Another section of the code talks about various permissible activities under the code. 
Another example of the same sort of thing comes from the military. 
The ombudsman is certainly not independent. 
That person is accountable to the minister. 
That is one of the biggest things we found in the ombudsman business. 
It is this fear of the unknown that people are concerned about. 
Because there is not openness and accountability it leads to problems.  
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
The Liberal's red book in the 1993 election stated: 
It was not developed in consultation with the other political parties. 
The Prime Minister makes the decisions about the enforcement of ethics.  
I would like to review the troubling revelations that have recently come to light.  
These loans were to be applied to a 24 room addition to the hotel. 
The expansion plans were expected to total $1.2 million. 
I know he will want to follow the rules in that regard.  
Who is Yvon Duhaime and what qualified his company to obtain so much cash? 
Duhaime has since claimed the expansion to be a profitable success.  
Will the Prime Minister answer questions on this matter? 
Can the ethics counsellor investigate? 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
It is two different things.  
They have stated so. 
That reporting is in secret. 
That is what my hon. friend from Prince George has in his motion. 
That is what Canadians want. 
None other than the defence minister, a member of cabinet. 
That is the real guts of this motion. 
This is what Canadians want.  
In the life of this parliament we have seen what is happening. 
What does the government do? 
It orders in a whole troop of lawyers. 
There is a growing trend. 
Who topped the list? 
(The House adjourned at 1.43 p.m.)
