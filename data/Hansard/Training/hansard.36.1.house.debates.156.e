EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 156 
Friday, November 20, 1998 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
This work began in the spring of 1998. 
It is anticipated that the first meeting will be held early in the new year.  
The first E stands for elimination. 
Another would allow him to control the opening of new crossings on high speed lines.  
The third E stands for enforcement. 
Finally, the fourth E stands for education. 
This program has the ongoing support of all stakeholders.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Do I smell a whiff of prorogation in the air?  
There were stakeholders who were extremely upset about it but they were not heard. 
It means different things to different people. 
The question then becomes one of what level of safety we are prepared to accept.  
The Railway Safety Act is a relatively new piece of legislation. 
Occurrences of train collisions on main tracks have increased by 44%.  
There is some good news. 
These systems will have to be vetted and approved by the minister. 
I sincerely hope that the rumour is true.  
Specifically, municipalities expressed concerns over potential liability. 
Although the proposed amendments appear to be good ones, the bill is highly technical. 
I want to hear from the stakeholders in committee before passing judgment. 
I do hope that we will be given the time to do that.  
Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne-Blainville, BQ ):
I will come to that later.  
I will start with a brief summary of the objectives of this bill. 
We fully support the objective of this bill. 
I am talking about train whistles. 
It states, and I quote: 
( a ) the area meets the requirements prescribed for the purposes of this section; and 
This way, my fellow citizens will be able to sleep more soundly in the future.  
The existing legislation states: 
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
That is why the testimony of the witnesses will be particularly important.  
The bill does many things. 
There are others who may miss it. 
Maybe we will hear from witnesses in that regard before the committee.  
We know there are problems in terms of fitness. 
This is of particular concern to us.  
If a railway company is in business its objective is to meet the bottom line. 
That is not always consistent with the public good. 
This is something that we understand in the New Democratic Party. 
The role of government is to ensure, protect and enhance the public good. 
That is not necessarily the role of a private corporation. 
We believe it is important that other stakeholders be consulted.  
We have not given up the fight in that regard. 
It is my hope that the bill will have some relevance. 
What is lacking is passenger rail service.  
Therefore I offer our conditional support at this stage.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
It should be noted that this is an ongoing process. 
This great national work does not come without some unfortunate costs. 
He has brought that issue to the House and has dealt with it very effectively.  
I would like to deal with rail safety. 
We are pleased to have both main railway lines.  
I speak obviously of the transportation necessity of moving commodities and products throughout western Canada. 
The number one commodity without question is grain. 
We export the major portion of grain that is being produced right now. 
We get it to ports by rail transportation.  
Again, rail transportation is that vital link. 
Also, municipalities will now have some input. 
In this instance the municipality did pass a resolution. 
That is very positive.  
The hon. member for Cumberland-Colchester from the Progressive Conservative Party will bring them forward. 
In some cases they have also abdicated their responsibility in other areas. 
This legislation, however, is of safety. 
This legislation will help them do that with the assistance of the minister's office.  
The minister has said that safety is his number one priority. 
In committee there will be some changes suggested by members of the opposition. 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Chlorine is carried in great abundance across this land on our rail system. 
They are carrying dangerous chemicals. 
It is a very serious safety concern.  
I am sure members would agree that is extremely important for fire departments. 
They were completely unaware because there was no labelling system. 
Rail safety is critical to all of us. 
So we need to address safety from that point of view.  
Whistle blowing is interesting. 
I have heard members talk about that. 
It is called Highway 403.  
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
For his efforts Ryan will receive a You Made a Difference Award.  
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, today is UN Universal Children's Day. 
I ask the government has this changed?  
Justice has not been served. 
Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):
Without this support their efforts would not have been realized.  
Once again, congratulations on a job well done. 
All of Canada is proud of them.  
EDUCATION AND ADVANCED RESEARCH 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
Our children are our most precious resource. 
They will determine the future of this country. 
The hon. member for Yorkton-Melville.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mrs. Claudette Bradshaw (Moncton-Riverview-Dieppe, Lib.):
Several events will take place across Canada to mark National Child Day. 
Our children are our most valuable resource. 
They will help determine the future of our country. 
The government is very committed to helping children.  
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
Why not have the political backbone and admit it up front. 
The goals that Canada agreed to in Kyoto are unrealistic and unachievable- 
The hon. member for Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik.  
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the PQ has a very unusual conception of the referendum debate. 
A future referendum would be a winning referendum only for the PQ. 
This is a strange way to preserve democracy.  
This is a dangerous approach that smacks of intellectual fraud, of contempt for Quebeckers.  
It is hard to be more biased than the PQ. 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
The hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN QUEBEC 
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
A bit of an outlandish trick.  
I have greater faith in the Quebec Liberal Party's improving the Canadian federation. 
Lucien Bouchard does not know what else to do, but hold referendums.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
The program is called Transition to Employment.  
The program requires that all of its members are alcohol and drug free.  
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, thank you for giving me permission to finish my statement.  
The House stood in silence ] 
Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Quebec East, BQ):
The Minister of Canadian Heritage should recognize their strength and give them real support. 
The hon. member for Prince Albert.  
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
How was this allowed to happen? 
Today many Indian people are reporting instances of mismanagement on reserves. 
Poor health, substandard housing and social dysfunction are endemic. 
Canada's aboriginals and indeed all Canadians deserve no less.  
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
SOLICITOR GENERAL OF CANADA 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, newspapers from coast to coast scream for the solicitor general to resign. 
The only person who finds his behaviour acceptable is the Prime Minister. 
When did the Prime Minister's ethics sink this low?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
He has said that he continues to support the solicitor general.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, only the government continues to defend the solicitor general.  
I think the language is getting just a bit too strong.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
I have a question for the government. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
He has a very weak case. 
He knows it and the country will know it.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Thanks again for that vote of confidence.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, demagogy is certainly not the Deputy Prime Minister's strong suit.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
She may have already replaced everybody on the front benches in this matter.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the solicitor general is on the political equivalent of life support. 
My question is a very simple one. 
How much longer is this going to last?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, we did indeed hear the Prime Minister defending the solicitor general this morning. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, not in the least, absolutely not.  
I reject the hon. member's assumptions on this matter. 
So we should let the commission do its job.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
The die is cast. 
What remains is for the deed to be done. 
Even members of the other caucus admit that there are problems. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
It cannot choose to ask a question in that regard. 
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Apparently ministerial responsibility has also gone missing.  
What is more important than ethics?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
The fact remains that the solicitor general's word has now been contradicted. 
He did in fact discuss sensitive government business in a public place.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
The Prime Minister will be back in the country on Saturday evening.  
He has already spoken about this matter in China. 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
I do not know why one would want to pick one editorial over another. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
All levels of government, along with businesses, must help us.  
The hon. member for Rosemont has the floor.  
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
It is the consensus among young people and the minister should realize that.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Is the only winning referendum one that is won by the PQ? 
Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay-Boundary-Okanagan, Ref.):
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the solicitor general is the top law enforcement officer in the country. 
When is he going to resign?  
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
I refuse to answer this question in this fashion.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
The minister had obviously put in the wrong tape.  
I would therefore like to ask him the same question again. 
Why was he denied this responsibility?  
I would like to take this opportunity to explain further what social union is.  
Quebeckers' view of it may be an abstract one. 
I shall define it very simply. 
We invented it, along with our fellow Canadians.  
The hon. member for Temiscaminque.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, Quebeckers will soon be settling that debate.  
Mr. Speaker, one thing must be made clear. 
If the matter is a social one, a minister with a social mandate is sent. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, let me quote from page 91 of the Liberal red book: 
This is not a headline from today's papers. 
This is right from the Liberal red book.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
I presume in that endorsation he also includes the entire red book. 
Thanks for the endorsation. 
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
The fact is that the government is caught like a rat in a trap.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
We had a duty to raise the concerns that had been expressed regarding that decision.  
And this is how the decision will be made. 
The Canadian Olympic Association is an independent body and we respect its decisions.  
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, today is national child day. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
This sounds like democracy in a banana republic to me.  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister says he wants to talk about social policy. 
Canada used to meet that standard but not any more.  
Does he agree with his wife? 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am surprised the hon. member would frame her question in that way. 
They have independent existences and independent ideas connected with their jobs.  
The hon. member should be ashamed of her antediluvian 19th century question.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
We have a serious problem.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
I will give a direct answer.  
We will confirm that when the budget comes.  
I ask my hon. friend to go back and take some training on gender sensitivity. 
She needs it and so does her party.  
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT BANK OF CANADA 
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
I do not tell it what to do or how to do it. 
We established its mandate in accordance with an act of parliament. 
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
This will probably put Eyeland Optical out of business.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
We do not do it that way.  
The bank operates as an independent commercial entity. 
I am aware of the situation the member has raised. 
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Minister of Health.  
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Safety is always a priority for Health Canada.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
My question is simple. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Gerard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
The hon. member for Sydney-Victoria.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, production has resumed in that operation. 
I commend the United Mine Workers of America for their constructive participation in that. 
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
They have that availability.  
PUBLIC SERVICE ALLIANCE OF CANADA 
Mr. Ian Murray (Lanark-Carleton, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the President of the Treasury Board.  
This is an extraordinarily important achievement.  
This agreement is to be ratified between December 6 and 16. 
We will be able to pay the amounts within a few weeks after the ratification.  
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we are well aware that politics and perceptions are what people see. 
How far are the Liberals prepared to let the rot in that barrel expand? 
When are they going to get rid of the solicitor general?  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
What a great country, Mr. Speaker. 
If you wait long enough you too can be acting Prime Minister.  
That is the issue that really is germane here. 
AID TO VICTIMS OF HURRICANE MITCH 
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
The Prime Minister must show compassion in view of this tragedy.  
We have announced that $9 million has been set aside for emergency humanitarian assistance. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
This opens the door to American style corporate hospitals in this country.  
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
We are also involved in the transport of humanitarian aid to the Honduras and Nicaragua.  
The Minister of National Defence will travel to Honduras on Sunday. 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
I missed that, I am sorry. 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
The petitioners call on parliament to ban the use of the gasoline additive MMT.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
It is a petition that has been taken by the residents of that co-operative. 
With great respect, I present this petition to the House on behalf of those residents.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):
I present it on their behalf.  
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
This crossing was disturbing an entire neighbourhood.  
I come from Mississauga. 
The future of rail I hope is not dead in this country. 
It is very important that we take a serious look at issues surrounding safety.  
The bullet train in Japan, the Shinkansen, operates through the entire country. 
The same thing could occur in the area of rail. 
I believe opposition parties are supportive of this. 
There were a number of amendments.  
I referred to the unprotected crossings. 
I think it is great to have this bill here. 
It is about time. 
Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay-Boundary-Okanagan, Ref.):
The Liberals are killing the economy in this country. 
We will help to move it to committee. 
We will support this bill. 
Our critic said that this morning. 
We will deal with it openly and honestly when it gets to committee.  
I am not going to continue. 
We want it to be credible and we want to be able to support it. 
Is the House ready for the question?  
The question is on the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mr. Speaker, perhaps we could call it 2.30 p.m. 
Is it agreed that we call it 2.30 p.m.?  
(The House adjourned at 12.25 p.m.)
