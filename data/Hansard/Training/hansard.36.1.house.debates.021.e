EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 21 
Monday, October 27, 1997 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP) moved: 
When the Europeans first came here they arrived on that coastline. 
There are those on the island who think perhaps we should return to those days. 
In approximately 1889 it became the gateway to Newfoundland. 
That pattern has been repeated for 100 years. 
We can still see the remnants of battalions. 
Despite that the people of the town are resolute. 
They have continued to thrive. 
Some of the businesses have been there for 100 years. 
They are family businesses. 
One bank remains committed to the town. 
There is tremendous uncertainty in that town today. 
The reason for the uncertainty is many fold. 
That kind of uncertainty spreads throughout the entire island. 
The responses continue to be somewhat vague. 
I could illustrate that by reading an example into the record.  
Rumours-cause much stress for the employees of Marine Atlantic. 
The response was anything but clear. 
However the matter of privatization was not clear.  
The date on it was some time after the letter to the minister. 
He went on to state something that was important: 
Any proposed relocation will, however, be based on commercial considerations- 
I was not in the town of North Sydney. 
They talked about the impact on their families. 
Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
The company has also done an excellent job for many years. 
Marine Atlantic employees are to be commended for their efforts. 
These have had a significant impact on the operations of Marine Atlantic.  
Future provision of the coastal service is under study by the province.  
Under this agreement the federal subsidy will be eliminated in three years.  
That is a significant savings to the taxpayer. 
The government will continue to regulate ferries for safety. 
Marine Atlantic has been able to achieve significant savings for the taxpayer. 
Subsidies have been reduced even as service has been maintained. 
We are therefore happy to support the private member's motion: 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
I congratulate my colleague from Sydney-Victoria for raising the issue today.  
Also, as has been mentioned, the federal government has a constitutional obligation. 
The big headline is even worse, ``Yarmouth-A dead area, according to a lobbyist''. 
Sometimes as some job opportunities are lost, others open up. 
I received a comment from a lady who was pretty pointed about things. 
They just do things and walk away from the consequences''. 
That is certainly not the case. 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
Its services are highly appropriate, highly competent, and very secure. 
It was very very well maintained.  
As we all know, the maritimes are facing a very difficult period.  
This is not the time to question a winning formula. 
The service is a good reliable one that provides obvious local benefits. 
More attention should be paid to it. 
We must not become dogmatic. 
We therefore readily agree with this motion. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
We now have reports that Nav Canada wants to lay off 1,000 workers. 
Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there unanimous consent?  
(The sitting of the House was suspended at 11.50 a.m.) 
The House resumed at 12 p.m. 
That the Committee have the power to hear witnesses via video conferencing; 
That the Committee present its final report no later than December 5, 1997; 
Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak to this motion.  
He is in transit and has not arrived. 
This consensus was confirmed by a referendum. 
Our children are basically our future. 
That is the challenge facing us. 
How do the people of Newfoundland want their school system to be organized? 
This is a fundamental point. 
The fact of the matter is that Newfoundland always had a unique school system. 
I invite my colleagues to support the motion before us.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
I note that he used the word reform numerous times in a positive vein. 
The word here is consistently. 
We agree with that.  
The first is the test of democratic consent. 
Second is the test of the rule of law. 
It is this broader right that many parents would like to see safeguarded.  
Finally, a word on amending the motion to make it better. 
This we find particularly objectionable.  
My colleagues will elaborate further on this position in debate.  
That the motion be amended: 
The Test of Democratic Consent, 
2. The Test of the Canadian National Interest, and 
By deleting the words: ``and seven Members of the Senate'' in the second paragraph; 
By deleting the words ``Senate and'' in the ninth paragraph; 
By deleting all the words in the last paragraph.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Chair will take the amendment under advisement for a few minutes. 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
What is at issue in the first instance? 
Section 17 provides for and guarantees the denominational status of the school system in Newfoundland. 
There will be a number of advantages. 
One is the modernization of their facilities. 
The Government of Newfoundland decided to hold a second referendum. 
The Liberals seem to forget that consultations did take place. 
Let us go back to the case of Newfoundland. 
In democracy, it is important to recognize the wish of the majority. 
And that is what they did.  
But why create a committee? 
There is the question. 
So this committee is a bit of a sham. 
What is meant by Canada's interests? 
We know very well where it is headed with that. 
Now, he is defining new criteria. 
He is even questioning the support he could provide. 
But where is the sense of democracy? 
They have spoken in full knowledge of the issues at stake.  
Something else was said, which I feel obliged to explain here. 
There is always this notion constantly going around in Ottawa: the clarity of the questions. 
The questions are not clear''. 
That is just what happens when there is a referendum. 
The no side here is not the only one to do it. 
There are lessons to be drawn from this. 
Newfoundland defined its own democratic exercise.  
Here again, this was a wise course of action.  
Once again, there are interesting precedents in the case of Newfoundland.  
There is an issue that they have to deal with here. 
It is a funny business. 
They have a double challenge. 
Imagine if we were to redefine power in Canada. 
Liberals will say: ``Lucien Bouchard will never sign the Constitution''. 
The Liberals must live with this. 
This is where we stand now. 
Since my time is almost up, I will move on to another issue. 
They will form a committee with members of Parliament.  
Our senators are no great source of pride.  
I will end with this. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
There are a lot of conflicting values, conflicting priorities. 
I know the government does not seem to be inclined to do that. 
Just a little bit of history. 
I asked myself this question.  
I have to ask that question. 
Perhaps there is an explanation for it.  
The response of the provincial government was ``You are exercising these rights in the courts. 
You are getting in the way of our implementation. 
That is another concern the committee should look at in its deliberations.  
I listened very carefully to my Bloc colleague. 
I do not accept the equivalency of these two amendments.  
I do not think that is something we can accept.  
Having said all these things, we look forward to the deliberations of the committee. 
Some parties have been making it since 1933. 
It was a party called the CCF, a predecessor of the NDP. 
This is really embarrassing.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for our colleague from Manitoba.  
I would like him to clarify that for my benefit.  
Mr. Speaker, it must be Monday. 
I thought I made it perfectly clear. 
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
In any such battle the minority will lose by definition.  
He kept it short. 
Earlier this spring all schools in Newfoundland underwent a school designation process. 
And it was very much his own referendum. 
The Canadian Constitution as well provides for the freedom of religion. 
Term 17 has been amended twice already.  
They are a minority. 
Should we now one year later be eliminating that right and that choice altogether? 
I am very concerned about this. 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
I would appreciate it if he could explain it to me.  
But there is a fundamental problem. 
There is a basic contradiction here.  
People in general, I am convinced, are in favour of minority rights. 
Quebec is a fine example, with its anglophone minority. 
How can the two debates be mixed? 
People have asked me that question on a number of occasions. 
That is not the whole case in Newfoundland.  
I do not think so. 
In this instance these groups have not been consulted. 
That is a grave concern. 
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
I assure you we will be taking a very active role in committee.  
They are the ones that first and foremost must be considered.  
The referendum was held quickly and in the middle of the summer. 
The result did get the objective that the government wanted at the time. 
A lot of people did not vote. 
No one would ever be elected. 
We have to take that into account.  
Newfoundland has many schools. 
My district has 800 students and 30 computers. 
That did not happen overnight. 
It simply will not happen. 
It did not happen that way. 
The Government of Newfoundland deserves a significant amount of blame for the confusion. 
The Newfoundland system is in significant need of help.  
Newfoundland is always at the wrong end of every scale. 
That is really what the whole reform business is all about. 
It is about how we get a better school system. 
For the benefit of all Newfoundlanders, it has to work. 
Many of them are in my riding. 
However, they cannot contribute unless they have the tools so to do. 
It is most unfortunate that we have to come this route to get it. 
We will make the decisions and live with them as best we can. 
At least we can do it that way.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Yet a few years back the same question was asked of the people of Newfoundland.  
Madam Speaker, there are several reasons for it. 
Partly it was the summer. 
The other part is that we are just so sick and tired of it.  
It has been an ongoing debate in Newfoundland. 
People just got tired of it. 
So let us get on with the reform.  
A lot of people have just said that it is going to happen anyway. 
Let us just do it and have it over with.  
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. member a couple of questions.  
I wonder if the hon. member would address that for me.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
I did make several observations that are perhaps worth repeating. 
It does not bind other parties.  
It has no legal implications for other provinces.  
I said I would comment on what the Leader of the Opposition has proposed. 
I know the Leader of the Opposition is opposed to a non-elective legislative chamber. 
He undertook to have discussions and consultations with them. 
I think that was an important undertaking. 
That is an astonishing figure for referenda. 
That is an astonishingly high percentage. 
I think their role has been constructive and useful. 
I do not see that we would be justified in rejecting it.  
Are there any other matters here? 
I think he has acted in good faith on that. 
I think there has been a great deal of thought given to this by Newfoundland. 
The premier has responded well. 
I will be voting for this measure. 
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
He has been quoted in all Canadian faculties of law.  
Could he be influenced by the Reform Party in this regard? 
I would like him to be a bit more specific.  
He is looking for an answer.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. member a very decided question. 
It is a question which I believe is fundamental to human rights.  
It being 2 p.m., we will now proceed to Statements by Members.  
Mr. Guy Saint-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
An important vestige of Canada's war history is now preserved.  
The veterans of Canada applaud his efforts.  
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):
Canadians are proud of David Shannon's accomplishments.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Jacques, all of Quebec is proud of you. 
You stuck to your race for the championship with your usual tenacity. 
Bravo, Jacques, and thank you for this championship.  
INUIT AND ABORIGINAL ART 
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
Much work still remains in promoting authentic Inuit and aboriginal art. 
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
This can be a win-win issue.  
It takes imagination and determination. 
In Canada we have a lot of both.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
He is the first Canadian to win this great honour. 
He was a formidable driver, as his son is now.  
Congratulations to Jacques Villeneuve, the new world champion.  
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville, Lib.):
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
The government is shirking its responsibilities. 
It refuses to initiate a national highway program. 
It refuses to return a reasonable share of the excise fuel tax. 
This highway receives no federal funding''.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Too many writers and journalists have been jailed and murdered. 
Too many innocent Kurds have been jailed, murdered and tortured. 
Now is the time for peace and reconciliation.  
Mr. Carmen Provenzano (Sault Ste. Marie, Lib.):
Canada has a proud military tradition but it too often goes unrecognized. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Speaker, Canada has another hero today. 
His name is Arthur Lee. 
REFORM PARTY OF CANADA 
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
I was and am excited at this prospect. 
Often I disagree with my colleagues in opposition. 
Recently I have become disillusioned at the actions of the Reform Party. 
Exploiting people's tragedy only hurts the victims.  
Canadians will not take it any more. 
The Reform Party and their leader should be ashamed.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
The process is the same. 
A few heads of state get together in a room. 
They agree to some emission deal. 
This approach did not work for Mulroney on the Constitution. 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
We do this with respect in our negotiating process.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
When are you going to start standing up for- 
My colleagues, I invite you please to address your remarks to the Chair.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Why does the minister not take that approach in that sequence? 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
I oppose a gas tax. 
I oppose an energy tax. 
I oppose an environment tax. 
I even hate the GST.  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Yes, environmental taxes even may be part of the equation if they are dedicated''.  
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
The Bloc Quebecois opposed the request.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
The committee is doing its work and we will await the results.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
Nova Scotia's premier is back in Ottawa. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, they may actually get somewhere in this pre-election flurry.  
He now admits that the BST is hurting Nova Scotians. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The hon. member for Sherbrooke.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
What they want to know is what the government is going to do. 
It is their livelihood that is at stake.  
Can I suggest something constructive to the government and to the Deputy Prime Minister? 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
They have undertaken an extensive consultation. 
We want to know how far they have been able to come with recommendations. 
It will depend on where they are at. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Then she can take that deal to Kyoto and see if they will sign it.  
Whose side is she on, Kyoto's or Canada's?  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
That is absolutely backwards.  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
We are there representing the best interests of Canada. 
Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
But we think it's better to be safe than sorry''.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this government has a troubling history of ignoring good science. 
The hon. Minister of the Environment.  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
MINISTER OF INTERGOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS 
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.  
Please excuse my English; it won't be very long.  
Do you know how many groups in the world give themselves collective identity? 
Experts say that it is between three thousand and five thousand. 
There are not two hundred states in the United Nations. 
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs says exactly the same thing we are saying.  
I don't want this wrong idea to win in my country''.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Who could blame him?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The hon. member simply has a- 
The hon. member for Repentigny.  
CANADIAN INTERNATIONAL TRADE TRIBUNAL 
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Secretary of State for Latin America and Africa. 
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Etobicoke-Lakeshore for her serious question.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
So what are Canadians supposed to do? 
Are they supposed to eat a little less every month to save some money? 
Are they supposed to skip their mortgage payments, maybe take the kids out of hockey?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The fact of the matter is the net worth of Canadian households is up. 
The hon. member for Medicine Hat.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
For many people this is no laughing matter. 
He has ruled out substantial tax relief in the short run.  
Where are they going to get the money?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is an important debate for Canadians.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That is precisely the difference between ourselves and the Reform Party. 
The hon. member for Kamloops.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I could not agree with the Minister of Finance more. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Perhaps we should have.  
There is one thing that we will do. 
We are going to invest in the things they want.  
We are going to protect the basic social fabric and the values- 
The hon. member for Cumberland-Colchester.  
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport. 
In fact, it did not provide that. 
They are getting paid it. 
They are not putting it in. 
My question for the Minister of Transport is- 
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
The hon. Minister of Transport.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, unlike the member's question, I will give an non-convoluted answer. 
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
The government has obviously only just received it. 
We are in the process of reviewing all of its recommendations, some 46 in total.  
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
The Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The member will understand that the financial consequences for the government would be considerably greater.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  
The hon. government House leader.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
There is no effort at all to suppress the views of scientists. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Canadians should all be proud of what was accomplished. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
They do a terrific job in saving lives. 
They know the kind of equipment they need. 
They know the kind of aircraft they have in addition to helicopters. 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member talks about not making it partisan. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
In fact last week the situation deteriorated and then came back.  
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Trade.  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Second, it is to uphold the standards and laws of one's own country. 
CANADIAN INTERNATIONAL TRADE TRIBUNAL 
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the tribunal sets its own rules. 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Of course not, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Will the minister guarantee the full support of her provincial counterparts? 
If so, does a strategy to implement the- 
The hon. Minister of the Environment.  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the amendment.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
I am happy to add to them.  
The situation in Canada is different from that in the United States. 
I think we can resume the position as follows.  
That is a political choice of the province. 
There is no constitutional barrier to that.  
The matter essentially is that there are no constitutional fetters. 
It is a matter of the political choice of the electors and their elected representatives.  
For that reason I thank the hon. member for aiding the cause of enlightenment.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Is it under section 93?  
Mr. Speaker, the only constitutional protections that exist are under section 93 as such. 
The only formal constitutional guarantees are in section 93.  
It is essentially a matter of the political will. 
Essentially 100% of these parents are also taxpayers. 
They pay into the education pot. 
It is within the free will of the provincial legislatures to make these arrangements. 
I would say he should go directly to the provincial legislature. 
The problems are not constitutional. 
They are matters of political choice.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Of the 384,734 voters on the list 52% of them cast ballots. 
The result was that 54.8% said yes. 
They felt that there should be some changes to term 17.  
In June 1996 the House of Commons passed the motion. 
In Vancouver, Surrey and Richmond, each city has a school board. 
I would think that perhaps it makes some sense for that to have happened.  
In 1996 the Senate voted to amend the resolution. 
In July 1997 Mr. Justice Leo Barry granted an injunction.  
In September 1997 Newfoundland put another question to its people which was very clear:
Does the change have the consensus of the population? 
The second test is whether they are legally able to do that. 
Is it going to protect the minority populations that will be affected by it? 
Is it going to be a precedent when dealing with constitutional issues down the road? 
That is a question we will have to set our minds to. 
The committee must report back by December 5. 
The Terms of Union of Newfoundland are part of the Constitution of Canada. 
The amendment would not have eliminated all single denominational schools. 
The Government of Newfoundland filed an appeal, but did not pursue the matter. 
In addition, the House of Assembly gave the unanimous approval on September 5. 
The proposal carried in 47 of Newfoundland's 48 electoral districts.  
However, the amendment will not take religion out of the schools. 
The Government of Canada believes the amendment is justified. 
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the hon. Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.  
Mr. Speaker, I am not sure what issue he is talking about. 
I do not find the question to be precise enough.  
I am sorry, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Speaker, I understand the question.  
Section 43 applies, so it is a bilateral amendment. 
Is that the point? 
By no means does section 93 have anything to do with this. 
It is section 17.  
It is section 17, not section 93.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
The two issues are different from a procedural point of view.  
My question to the minister is this:
The people have spoken. 
Mr. Speaker, first of all, the member is quite right. 
In the case of the Government of Canada, there are two principles. 
First, is the proposed amendment good for the province in question? 
That is why there must be a parliamentary committee.  
When no one will speak with them, they worry even more. 
Almost everything there is to say has been said. 
How does the government think we are going to reach different conclusions? 
Mr. Speaker, it is not paternalism in the least, it is federalism. 
The democratic federations are evidence of this.  
We, the Canadian Parliament, have the responsibility of looking at what has occurred. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
But a parliament must also, unquestionably, respect citizens' wishes. 
Mr. Speaker, this is an extremely hypothetical example.  
Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):
Otherwise, everything would be topsy turvey.  
So the provinces should be telling the central government what to do. 
They must tell the central government: ``We are transferring jurisdictions over to you''. 
There is a will that was clearly expressed.  
The same is happening with the Quebec resolution. 
Sometimes the truth is hard to take.  
What do we hear in these committees? 
This is a fine kettle of fish. 
Conduct a poll and hold a referendum. 
You will see what the public thinks. 
In Quebec, 92% are in favour of abolishing that institution. 
I believe it was the Bertrand government which made a pact with the Quebec Senate. 
It stopped appointing new senators and told those who were there ``Go home. 
After all, you only come here for that pay cheque''. 
They were absolutely useless. 
This is a cancer we must get rid of.  
It told them where to go and it held another referendum. 
What does the federal government do? 
And bang, the government finds itself forced to respect that desire.  
They were a majority when these provinces came into being.  
How nice it would be if French speaking Canadians could say the same.  
The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs seems to like committees a lot. 
Things have been that bad for some French speaking Canadians. 
We have been talking about that. 
Some of them are treated that way. 
Therefore, this committee should be as short-lived as possible. 
Rather than dealing with these things, it keeps on talking about the Constitution. 
It is the world gone topsy turvey. 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
I do not understand the logic of these people. 
I would like to know whether my colleague from Richelieu understands it. 
Mr. Speaker, I wish I had a clear answer to give my hon. colleague. 
I share the concerns of the hon. member for Trois-Rivieres.  
He mentioned the dinosaurs-oops, sorry-the senators. 
By opening an eye.'' 
It is odd, but it describes them well.  
That takes the cake. 
Two referenda were held in Newfoundland. 
That is still not enough. 
It only works one way.  
It is a one-way democracy.  
So, why set up committees? 
I would like to emphasize a couple of points.  
I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Louis.  
It would be unfair not to challenge them.  
He alleges that it is content with that position. 
It has done so with great power, great conviction and great pride.  
It will enjoy the privileges and rights of its own school board. 
That is something which is very specific and unique to the francophone community. 
The francophone community also enjoys its own newspaper. 
In the riding of the hon. member for Burin-St. 
George's there is a francophone community that flourishes. 
It is very much alive. 
It is very much alive and very proud. 
They are very much willing to participate in strengthening their culture. 
I salute the francophone community of Newfoundland and Labrador.  
The current debate is on the amendment to term 17. 
In this House we enjoy certain privileges, one being the privilege of debate. 
It is important that we take into consideration all parliamentarians' points of views. 
In saying that, I take into consideration some great members of the other place.  
I am not prepared to say that his role was in the least bit insignificant. 
Quite frankly it was very significant. 
The people in my riding as well as those in the riding of Burin-St. 
George's understand that. 
I support the amendments fully. 
I will give a specific example.  
In my province there are approximately 1,100 to 1,200 communities. 
Every community has a school. 
Some communities with small population levels have a number of schools.  
That is exactly what happened.  
That is a fundamental right. 
That is just a simple point I would like to add to the debate.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I have a comment before my question. 
That is not the question. 
It is very honest and it is very straightforward. 
I have absolutely no problem with it at all.  
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
How are their interests not prejudicially affected?  
I would caution that term 17 is a fundamentally unique amendment. 
It is part of the terms of the union between Canada and Newfoundland. 
We are changing that term and section 93 does not apply.  
Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):
I am a francophone, I speak only French and I sit here. 
Could he get elected?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, first of all, I think this is a crucial debate. 
I think that is the question before us today.  
Meanwhile, what did we hear from the hon. member for Richelieu?  
It is all rubbish and nonsense.  
That is the tone of this debate.  
That is precisely why we need parliamentary commissions. 
That is why we need parliamentary commissions here.  
Let us recall the debates that went on about term 17- 
A lot of us said ``Let's be careful. 
Let's use extreme caution when you talk about constitutional amendments''. 
That is not what we did. 
We pushed it through quickly. 
Of course we need reform in the school system. 
Let's take more time''. 
Yet somehow we trivialize constitutional amendments. 
We take them for granted. 
If a majority here or a majority there decides, then it must be right.  
That is why we need those parliamentary commissions. 
The majority will always rule.  
That is the point I want to make today. 
That is the spirit. 
They cannot tolerate another opinion. 
I will suggest that the public will judge from the debate here where extremism is. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Things have not really changed. 
Now, I have a question for the hon. member. 
I am anxious to hear our colleague's answer.  
This is how it is done in every committee. 
The decision rests with us here.  
Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):
What he is saying makes no sense.  
I voted in the National Assembly according to my conscience. 
Most of the time, I voted for my party. 
I also voted against it many times. 
I have done so here. 
I will continue to do so. 
I will vote according to my conscience. 
I will do so whenever my conscience demands it. 
If that bothers the member for Richelieu, too bad.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
I am really appalled that has happened here. 
And I said thank God for that.  
Just take a look at our young people and the pressures they are under today. 
The peer pressure in our society today is unbelievable. 
We know this country was built on good Christian values. 
We have respect for all cultures. 
Just take a look at us right here. 
What is going to happen in the school system?  
If we leave them alone in the system they probably will.  
I look at the young people who are lost in my own city. 
They need to have church influences. 
I have never heard tell of this before. 
That is a very serious situation.  
I am very concerned, just like the hon. Kevin Barry is, and many other people. 
I am in favour, as we are here, of having a committee. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
However, that being said, democratic consent was sought on this issue.  
As a result, it was very difficult to determine which people would act as scrutineers.  
Nonetheless, the people of Newfoundland have spoken. 
I would like to propose the following. 
This question was asked today within our caucus. 
Politics was involved, as we stated, concerning scrutineers.  
There is no place in the world in which we would let that happen.  
There has to be a better system. 
Perhaps the system suggested by the hon. member is the better system.  
The provincial Liberal government wants to close the denominational schools. 
I fought to keep them. 
We had only one girls Catholic school and one boys Catholic school. 
It is a boys and girls Catholic school now. 
We also have one Evangelical school. 
That is all we have, but the government wants to close them too.  
I am really worried about the direction in which we are going. 
I have to say that what they are proposing is wrong. 
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
However, we had reservations about that process. 
During that time two royal commissions have studied the issue. 
Clearly this is a very important issue. 
Therefore, we neither support nor oppose church run or non-denominational schools for Newfoundland. 
Was the referendum process fair? 
And was the referendum question unbiased? 
Free votes have been few and far between. 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
I want to put a few comments out for thought. 
I, too, believe in the democratic process. 
I recognize how important education is to all of our children. 
We need to provide the best possible education we can for our children.  
This comes close to home for me. 
The taxpayers are given the option of choosing where their tax dollars go. 
They have some choices for their children. 
By doing so, they hold the school boards and the schools accountable.  
I believe in the democratic process. 
We need to look beyond December 5. 
I believe that good effort has been made for democratic consent.  
The test not put forward has been the test of the rule of law. 
It should have a a test for the rule of law.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Reform Party. 
Mr. Speaker, the referendum was well advertised. 
It was well known that it was being conducted. 
The low numbers of turnout are just that.  
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
It would possibly improve the system.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to pursue that question further. 
Mr. Speaker, I would consider that to be a hypothetical situation. 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
A dollar value should not be placed on the voucher. 
It is to provide a service. 
It would make the schools or institutions very competitive. 
Again it is such an important issue.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
In it he wrote: 
Removing constitutional rights from a minority is a serious undertaking. 
That would be to make judgments and that is not my purpose.  
What I do know is that the other place did hold hearings. 
Members of the other place travelled to St. John's. 
The Senate wrote an outstanding report. 
The chair was Senator Sharon Carstairs.  
It is back before us again.  
If we are going to do something, we should do it well. 
If we are going to amend our Constitution, we should do it right. 
It is their right and our duty.  
The other place does more than provide sober second thought. 
The other place provides expertise. 
What we are speaking of is amending Canada's Constitution. 
This is serious business. 
He spoke in defence of minority rights in Manitoba. 
Does this Prime Minister understand what Laurier understood?  
The Newfoundland terms of union are enshrined in the Canadian Constitution. 
Premier Tobin appears to no longer respect those terms. 
Some would say that minorities constitute the margins of society. 
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
This morning my leader gave an outstanding speech on this matter in the House. 
We would do well to listen to the cautions that he raised.  
He suggested three things. 
I would first like to take a look at the test of democratic consent. 
He asked questions about that. 
I have a lot of problems with the whole process.  
The first point that he asked us to look at was this.  
The first point read: 
The second point read: 
The next point read: 
It is wrong for the government to involve itself in the debate in that manner.  
The next point read: 
Mr. Flynn went on to note: 
I could not agree more with what Mr. Flynn noted in this talk.  
It is important to address that issue. 
That statement puts a heavy burden on the government. 
It must reflect carefully on its responsibility.  
This Parliament has responsibility to protect minority denominational education. 
It cannot simply allow the Constitution to be changed in that manner.  
A series of questions have to be asked here. 
Who will educate my children? 
That is a key question. 
Who will be responsible for educating my children? 
Who will be ultimately responsible for educating that child? 
I think that is wrong. 
You and I know that quite well, Mr. Speaker. 
In the province of British Columbia that can happen and that bothers me greatly. 
In Newfoundland's current system there is choice within the community. 
One can pick a Catholic school, a Pentecostal school or one of the unified schools. 
I think that choice should be expanded.  
It bothers me greatly to see the legislation before the House. 
I feel somewhat awkward raising the issue. 
I do not want someone asking who this guy thinks he is. 
I could cite example after example, which I will do. 
It bothers me that is true.  
I think that is absolutely outrageous. 
It bothers me greatly to think that could happen in this country. 
Michael Enright is the host who took over from Peter Gzowski.  
It is absolutely unbelievable that statement was made, and yet it happened.  
CBC does not mention that.  
The CBC did that. 
I know it happened. 
You know it happened. 
Everybody knows that happened, but there is an issue here that seems to be forgotten. 
That is reflected in this bill. 
That is what this bill is about. 
It undermines that very right. 
That is why it is wrong.  
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
For many years governments in that province have set the curriculum. 
What do these groups want to protect? 
They have not been standing in the way of reform. 
That is a bit of a prelude.  
Was the question a fair one? 
The question fails to address the real issue. 
It is my belief that this was not a fairly worded question. 
As a result they voted in favour of a prior question stated.  
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend for that comment. 
The whole issue goes beyond simply a referendum. 
That is a key issue. 
The government cannot treat this matter lightly. 
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
We also know that within the legislative assembly it was a unanimous vote. 
I believe that is the appropriate course of action.  
Yes, I have talked to people from Newfoundland on this matter.  
Why that is I do not know. 
What I do know is that the referendum was not fair.  
By the way, the first referendum was most appalling. 
That again is appalling. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
It wants to decide everything under the sun by referendum. 
However, that does not mean that we can run roughshod over minority rights. 
That does not mean that it should be a sloppy question. 
That was never the intent.  
In other words, was the question fair? 
Was adequate notice given? 
Yet there were some problems. 
People said it was not that clear. 
It was not all that it should have been. 
Maybe it did not pass the rule of law.  
That is why we have put these three amendments today. 
Let us examine the whole thing. 
That is why it is in this motion. 
By all means send it to committee and let us examine it. 
We do not reject it outright, but we want to examine it in its entirety.  
We also want to make sure that the rule of law has been followed. 
What have we done here?''  
Four or five bills have been introduced in the Senate. 
We find that offensive.  
We would also like to see a free vote on this. 
I am sure the committee will take that into account. 
I can guarantee that it will not be unanimous in this place. 
We cannot be all powerful and all knowing. 
We are not the great and wonderful Oz. 
We are people who bring different points of view to the discussion. 
A referendum does not solve all problems. 
This amendment is supposed to do all of those things. 
I believe it will do it very well.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a tough question for my hon. colleague. 
What about this provision? 
What about the Senate? 
What is its role? 
How can it be improved? 
What about the number of seats? 
Should certain provinces have a veto?  
It was a wonderful thing to openly discuss that without any fear. 
It was a good process. 
Those were the days.  
Why were there two referenda? 
We were promised that the first one would be the referendum to end it all. 
Everything was done properly. 
Why then did we need the second referendum? 
That is the question that should be asked in committee. 
I wonder why that is. 
I am not from Newfoundland, so I do not know. 
I would like to travel there to find out. 
Was there a problem with the process? 
Perhaps everyone is happy with it. 
That is why the question was raised on this side of the House. 
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to make two points relating to my friend's comments. 
I think it would be very difficult to put a value on it. 
It is the notion of a free vote on this matter. 
That is very important. 
The issue must be a free vote. 
We must insist on a free vote. 
We should not be hiding behind a party whip.  
Mr. Speaker, the observations of my colleague from Delta are right. 
I just hate to come right out and say it. 
We have had three of them now. 
You give us a billion dollars and we'll shut up''. 
Pretty soon we question even something like this referendum result. 
It is speculation on my part but I do wonder. 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Has the member on his feet spoken to this this afternoon?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Has the other member on his feet spoken to this today?  
Only three times, Mr. Speaker. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Chair recognizes on debate the member for Saanich-Gulf Islands.  
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I just want to make one observation. 
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
I hope others on this side would too. 
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
It is a perfectly simple question yet he is sitting in his seat.  
The whip for the Reform Party has asked for a free vote on this matter. 
There are some differences here. 
I think we should expect the same of the government party.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
They can refer to Hansard and get an adequate response.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(Divisions deemed demanded and deferred) 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
There is not unanimous consent.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I just want clarification from the whip. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Chair would ask the chief government whip to reintroduce the request.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
I would like to point out the fundamental reason for asking that question.  
I can say that it did. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport.  
Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my short answer to the hon. member for Mississauga West would be yes. 
The constituents in his riding, in Mississauga and the greater Toronto area, can rest comfortably. 
There will be no unilateral changes to the night flight hours.  
May I give some detail to the hon. member. 
The department does not intend to change these restrictions at this time.  
CLOSING OF THE BC MINE 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
If the minister cannot go to Thetford, the Thetford workers will come to him. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member. 
The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Veterans Affairs has the floor.  
Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):
These workers have not returned to work at the mine.  
One is using targeted wage subsidies. 
LAW OF THE SEA 
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
The government has committed in the red book to ratify. 
Unfortunately he did not have time to complete his answer. 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
The Canadian government remains committed to the ratification of the convention. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House adjourned at 6.39 p.m.)
