GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
PERSONAL INFORMATION PROTECTION AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS ACT 
(Motions deemed adopted, bill read the first time and printed) 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Many of us hope that it will be stalled for good.  
Mr. Speaker, I would ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
CANADA CUSTOMS AND REVENUE AGENCY ACT 
The genesis of this bill is quite simple. 
It is built on five simple facts about tax collection. 
I would like to discuss those facts quite briefly. 
Flowing from those facts are five clear principles. 
Fact number two is equally easy. 
This leads to fact number three. 
Fact number four is the logical corollary of the other facts. 
Fact number five is that there are two ways to improve the tax system. 
Those are the facts and the realities on which our tax system is built. 
The principles and values are very simple. 
Canadians want service and fairness. 
They want to work in partnership. 
It will be a vital component of our democratic parliamentary system.  
We have listened attentively and responded fully.  
Questions are often asked in the House of the minister. 
These vital principles must and will remain paramount. 
It underpins all our programs and services.  
Notwithstanding an excellent record, we can and must do more. 
I should point out that provincial participation will be completely voluntary. 
This will provide for sensitivity to provincial and regional concerns. 
The members will be appointed by the governor in council. 
That is simply too long. 
More and more transactions are taking place through electronic commerce. 
Canadians want their system to be user friendly and transparent. 
At the end of my speech, we will introduce an amendment to this legislation.  
The Bloc Quebecois and myself are totally opposed to this bill. 
At the time, the government had defined a number of objectives for the agency. 
Let me begin with the third one. 
The provinces are very unenthusiastic about the establishment of such an agency. 
Quebec, for one, is formally opposed. 
The minister now wants to look after it at the provincial level.  
That is not a very good explanation.  
First, I do not believe the agency will produce the promised savings. 
Will his annual salary be up in the millions? 
Those are questions that need to be asked.  
The agency has already cost the taxpayer a fair bit. 
I will give you an example. 
The minister would be told what to do.  
The agency's status would upset this balance. 
Sixth, the agency would pose a threat to taxpayers' privacy. 
We share those concerns.  
What do the experts and the business sector think of this agency? 
I share Mr. Desautels' concerns.  
One has to wonder. 
This is, as the spokesperson for RCMP pointed out, an abdication of political power. 
We have a number of examples of that pattern. 
And let us not forget Nav Canada, which cost millions of dollars. 
Will these job cuts jeopardize the safety of airline personnel? 
That is one concern we have regarding Nav Canada. 
It is highly improper.  
That is what I am asking.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
I wish to congratulate the minister. 
If the minister is lucky it will be passed by the end of the century.  
I do wish to congratulate the minister on finally managing to bring it before us.  
It has taken the government two and a half years to flesh it out. 
This was quoted by the minister in his speech.  
Clearly that will not be the case. 
When we listen to the provinces what do we hear? 
The Minister of National Revenue has been criss-crossing the country over the past year. 
However, sorely the minister's efforts have produced no proof. 
We can look further at the other provinces. 
It is an awesome power. 
All too often this coercive power is abused. 
Let me remind the minister of the case of Ms. Janice Collingridge of Calgary. 
Ms. Collingridge is a severely handicapped quadriplegic who is unable to speak. 
This is what happens when the enormous power of tax collection is abused.  
Mrs. Ethier was disabled and unable to dress her upper body without assistance. 
In other words, she was seriously disabled. 
The problems he was facing pushed him to the brink of suicide.  
Finally, I raise the case of Suzanne and John Thiessen of Manitoba. 
Let me be clear. 
It has no statutory authority. 
Government officials would be obligated to inform taxpayers in cases of overpayment.  
This is not a completely novel idea. 
It seems that that is the objective of this government. 
It is goose plucking and trying to do so in the most efficient way possible. 
However, the reality is that Canadians are overtaxed. 
We want to see tax relief and fundamental tax reform. 
I call upon the government and this minister to start moving in that direction.

CANADA CUSTOMS AND REVENUE AGENCY ACT 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
It is a bill to establish a taxation agency. 
That is the purpose of the bill before the House today.  
The minister spoke this morning. 
I want to review those very briefly. 
Maybe the minister will get up and correct that.  
The provinces see this as an intrusion into their field of jurisdiction. 
The minister tells us to be patient. 
We can be patient but in the long run we are all dead. 
How long does he want us to be patient? 
He tells us to trust him. 
The Quebec government certainly sees this as an intrusion into provincial jurisdiction. 
Quebec is not talking about ceding more power to a federal agency. 
If we want to make this country work, we need co-operative federalism.  
This is really the most major privatization this government has carried out. 
It is quasi-privatization. 
There has been a lot of talk about uniting the right. 
I think the right is pretty much united. 
It sits across the way. 
It is the Liberal Government of Canada.  
That is a lot of rubbish.  
Now that it is in government it is extremely conservative. 
That is the historical position of the Liberal Party of Canada. 
I am concerned about that as well.  
I also wanted to mention some of the concerns about business itself. 
What were the results of that study? 
What is the government's reply to that? 
That is my third concern. 
That has been the practice in this country.  
It will be more of a private sector orientation.  
What about the salaries of the CEO and senior executives? 
This will be an additional cost.  
I wonder about all these things in terms of accountability. 
Accountability has gone away from this place. 
I am concerned about the size of the agency itself. 
It would be like a mega tax man, like a Frankenstein.  
People are concerned about that. 
The IRS, by the way, is still a government department in the United States. 
The IRS is not an agency in the United States. 
I have another concern. 
There is a member on the backbench hanging his head in shame; he is crying. 
However the GST is still there. 
Why has the GST not disappeared? 
It is a promise the Liberals made and it is still there.  
Mr. Tobin in Newfoundland, Nova Scotia- 
They will put pressure on the provinces to agree to harmonize the tax. 
The first is provincial opposition. 
Saskatchewan and British Columbia are unlikely to sign on. 
Why would we have this agency, which is supposed to be a federal-provincial agency?  
That is a concern to most members of the House.  
The Reform Party may agree with that. 
It does not really like government. It does not really like the public sector. 
Another reason I want to mention is the lack of accountability. 
Those are our major concerns as a party. 
They talk to their constituents. 
They listen to the people. 
They talk to people. 
They will not be able to vote that way. 
This should not be a confidence vote. 
There is no reason it should be a confidence vote. 
It does not go to the heart of government policy. 
It does not go to the heart of a government budget. 
I am glad the Reformers agree with that.  
I close by making an appeal to the minister across the way. 
It is a very important issue. 
The collection of taxes is a fundamental issue in democracy. 
It is the prerogative of the state. 
The role of the state is to collect taxes. 
I do not want to see that happen.  
Let us have a free vote. 
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Canadians have said that they want governments to work together. 
Canadians recognize that we are overgoverned. 
We already collect a lot of their taxes. 
The hon. member for the NDP talked about the auditor general's report. 
Small businesses know the paper burden they have to go through. 
They know about overlap and duplication. 
They are asking the government to respond.  
There is only one taxpayer in the country. 
They do not want a different system of tax collection in every province. 
They want a single window approach. 
They want to reduce paperwork. 
They want to make sure there is less burden on the business people. 
We want an organization that can respond to the new needs.  
We have electronic commerce now. Someone can sell a good from Quebec into British Columbia. 
How are we to respond to changes? 
The hon. member talked about co-operative federalism. 
This is in co-operation with the provinces. 
It is really about creating new options.  
I have had meetings with ministers of finance across the country. 
We are a trading nation. 
We need to ensure that we are efficient. 
If we are efficient we can be more competitive in the new global economy. 
This is about reaching a new vision. 
This is about working together. 
Ontario has said no. 
Quebec has said no. 
I can see why some provinces might not want to agree. 
It is difficult to get unanimous consent of all provinces. 
Ontario and Quebec alone represent two-thirds of the population. 
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal:
They have been saying they want to play a role in the agency. 
We are responding to the provinces. 
They want to see what the final wording is. 
They want to make sure they know exactly what they are getting.  
I have had very good meetings with ministers of finance across the country. 
We have the bill before the House today. 
We have a fair number of details. 
We have the bill here in the House at second reading. 
This is what he is saying to the House. 
I wonder if he can table some information to document that fact.  
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal:
He supports the concept.  
We have media scanners and so on. 
What I am concerned about is where is the beef. 
They have seen the bill. 
They have seen the principles of the bill. 
They have seen the details of the law. 
Where are these letters? 
I am afraid the time for questions and comments has expired.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
The minister said there is only one taxpayer. 
You can offload a lot of things but you cannot really offload leadership. 
That is what this government has tried to do.  
Revenue Canada is the largest government department. 
At various times of the year it has between 40,000 and 46,000 employees. 
That is a very big if at this juncture. 
Ontario is looking to attain greater authority over its tax levers. 
Some of the provinces feel this agency may ultimately lead to less. 
Another issue is privacy. 
This House is a good check and balance on this government department of Revenue Canada.  
I hear a member opposite speaking of a gallbladder attack. 
That is the level of impact.  
It is extremely frightening to Canadians.  
Our public service I suggest is at an all time low in terms of morale. 
The provinces are not really interested in having a new agency.  
Ontario is looking at increased powers for collecting its own taxes.  
The power of authority or information on individual Canadians is going to be extremely concentrated. 
Yes, there are reforms that are necessary. 
Therefore it may be arguably a step in the wrong direction.  
I believe that the hon. member is happy with that comparison.  
I agree with my hon. colleague from the Reform Party. 
I should not criticize the government for having adopted sound Conservative polices. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
The hon. member spoke about the need for tax reform. 
Mr. Speaker, how many hours do I have for this response?  
I thank the hon. member for his question.  
That is perverse in a country where we are competing globally. 
I call it the Pavlovian nature of the tax code.  
It is very important to let businesses and individuals make their own decisions. 
I think that would be a step in the right direction. 
I also believe that consumption taxes are less destructive.  
We can use a tax code to do that.  
The recommendations are fairly sound on a business level. 
Ms. Beth Phinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
That is what Canadians expect from governments. 
That is what Canadians expect from elected officials.  
The true measure of success for the new agency will be in its operations. 
Canadians have told us what they want. 
They want to deal with a more client oriented tax and customs administration. 
Our generation is one that often embraces technology as a panacea for any operational challenge. 
The most important of these principles and values are trust and honesty. 
It is also important that complete and transparent information be provided to those we serve.  
The minister has consulted widely with Revenue Canada's employees. 
These hardworking public servants are decent taxpaying citizens like the rest of us. 
They see the importance of simplicity and flexibility. 
And they want their own worth to be recognized, appreciated and respected.  
Acting on these human expectations will be the true breakthrough for the new agency.  
It is the agency that will negotiate directly with its unions.  
Why should the agency not negotiate with its unions? 
They will be able to act firsthand on those wishes and concerns.  
I will point out something else that is very important. 
Revenue Canada will not be privatized. 
Employees will continue as public servants. 
Each of these important issues is on the table for discussion. 
They want a staffing system with fewer rules. 
They want a gender neutral classification system. 
They want fewer occupational groups and levels. 
They want greater emphasis placed on transferable skills and past performance. 
They want a simple, quick and fair system of recourse.  
The agency structure that we propose will allow us to accommodate these demands. 
That is not only a matter of staffing. 
They will remain public servants during and after the transition. 
They will remain public servants during and after the transition.  
This is not an effort to downsize the department. 
This is not the intention and has never been the intention. 
The public servants who work at Revenue Canada are very practical people. 
They deal with real life situations every day of their working lives. 
They know what Canadians want.  
They know that Canadians want even more effective and efficient service. 
They know Canadians want streamlining of administration. 
They know that Canadians want tax compliance to be easier and less costly. 
They know that the public interest must always come first. 
They know governments must reduce overlap and duplication. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I was interested to hear the hon. member's remarks. 
I would ask the hon. member two questions. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. critic of the official opposition. 
I have a lot of respect for this member. 
However he is not the only expert on tax. 
There are many other experts on tax who agree with the agency.  
I would like to make more comments about the bill. 
Some of them are using the services right now. 
The bill has changed a lot in the last two years. 
It is because we listened. 
The minister has listened. 
We have changed the set-up of the bill. 
This is where we are now more accountable. 
This practice is already being used by some provinces.  
I think it would be logical to wait until the agency is an agency. 
She also spoke at length about efficiencies and cost savings.  
Perhaps the member could clear that up for me.  
He may have a limited view of what Canadians are expecting.  
There is a lot of flexibility within the agency. 
We have not seen it yet because it is not there yet.  
It is at the committee that we will correct these points.  
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
We are talking today about Revenue Canada. 
We want to be constructive when legislation appears to be moving in the right direction. 
Revenue Canada serves over 20 million taxpayers. 
In the United States revenue is collected by the IRS, the Internal Revenue Service. 
Without the co-operative taxpayer our country fails as an economic unit. 
Canadians do not want to be bullied around, especially not by the tax collector. 
Government institutions should not be feared.  
I believe that is a laudable statement. 
The problem is does it ever get delivered.  
Now all he has to do is put it in black and white. 
We have to design a system that is self-correcting and that works. 
Canadians want some guarantee. 
That keeps the business in operation. 
Maybe we should apply that kind of standard to the taxpayer. 
The last thing taxpayers want is to be harassed by Revenue Canada.  
There have been instances where the best interest of the public has not been met. 
What did the document say about taxpayers? 
But where is the protection and the assurance for balance? 
Where is the guarantee? 
Where are the mechanisms to ensure that the rules are going to be followed?  
Reform is committed to standing up for the taxpayer, the man on the street. 
What about the employees of Revenue Canada? 
Their morale is likely very low at this point. 
They do not know what is going to happen to them. 
We must speak for them also.  
What does the union say? 
I have this interesting quote: 
Caught in the middle are public sector workers.  
Deep-rooted structures and present day policies have combined to deepen the crisis. 
Morale in the federal public service is at an all-time low. 
Union negotiations have broken off. 
I could go on and on. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
The minister spoke about the need for a taxpayer bill of rights. 
The government has not responded positively to this initiative. 
In his view, why would that be? 
But there is an inherent arrogance that we know best. 
I bring the example of one very exasperated taxpayer. 
Where is this fellow to go?  
That is what the government needs to follow. 
It needs to listen to the people and respond to that agenda.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Rather than fixing what is there, it is talking about setting up a new entity. 
I am not sure the logic follows.  
The government is selling this on the grounds of some promised efficiency gains. 
Are we really going to see these efficiency gains? 
That is a good question. 
I am not saying that the status quo is the answer. 
It certainly is not.  
I will allude to one situation. 
These people feel there might be repercussions if the details are brought out.  
His company had been through a number of mergers and different purchases.  
People are still required to track on the old one and on the new one. 
There is a convoluted set of rules surrounding it. 
They continued to try to hit the mark and satisfy Revenue Canada.  
He was told ``We do not have a fax number here''. 
I am not casting aspersions on these individuals. 
It is not easy.  
They have worked hard. 
They are a very diligent couple. 
They started a few small businesses. 
Yes, they had some professional help.  
This couple started these small ventures. 
One day they were contacted by the tax department which advised them they had not. 
We can imagine what this did to this small businessman. 
Suppliers were not getting paid. 
Customer relations were jeopardized. 
It was a tragic situation. 
Revenue Canada released the accounts and everything carried on. 
At this point in time they are attempting to resolve the situation.  
The bottom line is that the account should not have been locked up. 
They took this $1,000 and spent it. 
To add to that story, they were not the only ones. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
I began working in depth with the tax act in 1977. 
At that time the tax act was not too thick. 
We now have an act that is literally a stack. 
It is impossible for anyone to completely understand it.  
After that time I noticed that taxpayers were given the benefit of the doubt. 
They were treated much more fairly overall. 
There was less of them being considered guilty before their case was even heard.  
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
They were prompt and efficient and they got to the bottom of the matter. 
They dealt with it in a fair and equitable manner.  
These changes are real changes. 
They are also significant. 
The government is listening. 
Eight design teams were created. 
We met with thousands of Canadians, singly or in groups. 
My colleagues should be commending the government on this initiative. 
It will provide the agency with the flexibility to better carry out its mandate.  
The Minister of Revenue will continue to be responsible for the agency. 
In fact this has been mentioned many times.  
It has an extremely efficient operation. 
It has the necessary flexibility. 
It can move ahead. 
It has been identified as one of the best agencies in the world.  
We are giving this agency the flexibility to carry out its duties. 
All those are extremely important elements. 
We should give a rousing endorsement to what is before us today. 
I want to conclude by saying- 
My colleagues, are clapping on the other side and they are endorsing the proposal. 
That is what I hear.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
He talks about this being a historic moment. 
Yet this government is consulting. 
Why did it not wait until it at least got the agreement of the provinces? 
Right now we have zero.  
He talked about Statistics Canada being the envy of the world. 
One would have to live in Ottawa to think that. 
Mr. Speaker, frankly it is true. 
It is a challenge for me.  
I am not the one who said it. 
I would say that Statistics Canada has done nothing intrusive.  
In response to the member's question, consultations are ongoing. 
He wanted my opinion. 
Those who are not onboard will be onboard sooner or later.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
The hon. member does not think StatsCan is intrusive. 
Apparently he thinks it is a model for Revenue Canada. 
Let me suggest there is one slight difference. 
Those are extraordinary powers which are all too often abused.  
It was thrown out by the tax court.  
The member is complaining about a specific case. 
I cannot comment on a specific case.  
It is not an easy job collecting taxes. 
How would anyone like it? 
Tax and debt, everybody wants to run away from them.  
It is a fact of life and the gentleman had better get used to it. 
We have to have taxes. 
Mr. John O'Reilly (Haliburton-Victoria-Brock, Lib.):
They are well informed and he always goes into great depth.  
Mr. Speaker, sometimes the public service is an easy target. 
These people are like all of us, with one exception. 
I pay tribute to each one of them, particularly those behind the telephone. 
They handle them in an efficient and positive manner. 
They deal with millions of forms. 
They are bound to make mistakes. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
The government is, once again, about to abdicate its responsibilities.  
That agency is directly accountable to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. 
But the minister does not answer our questions. 
He too hides behind the agency to shirk his responsibilities. 
Yet, our questions are simple. 
How many sheep were identified as being infected with scrapie? 
Where are these infected animals? 
How does the agency diagnose the disease? 
What are the criteria used to determine whether or not the sheep must be destroyed? 
What is the agency's budget for research? 
What stage has the agency reached in its work? 
We have no idea. 
What is currently going on in Quebec is unacceptable.  
There is a 60% difference between the forecasts and the actual figures. 
Do you know any business that would keep such an incompetent accountant? 
In the private sector, this sort of misappropriation would mean a trip to court.  
This government is prepared to do anything to satisfy its need to centralize. 
The Liberals consider simplification synonymous with duplication and harmonization to them means meddling. 
And what about the executives of this new agency? 
Who will foot the bill for this? 
No. And whom is this agency going to be answerable to? 
I can see it already. 
Imagine an embarrassing question about the operations of the agency. 
As it is now almost 2 p.m., I must interrupt the hon. member. 
It will be his turn. 
INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DYSLEXIA 
Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):
For these Canadians dyslexia presents an enormous struggle. 
Dyslexia can occur at any level of intellectual ability. 
It can be alleviated by specialist teaching and committed learning.  
Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):
Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):
This day also heralds the coming year, 1999, as the international year of older persons.  
The theme for this celebration is Canada, a society for all ages. 
I know firsthand what a vital, energetic role seniors play in our communities. 
GM PLANT IN BOISBRIAND 
Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne-Blainville, BQ):
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Environmental illness is a real problem. 
On behalf of my colleagues, I say to them good luck.  
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale, Lib.):
They are just putting on a show with no real substance.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Today we wear pink ribbons. 
The colour of the ribbon symbolizes hope for a cure. 
We must continue to work at finding a cure. 
The hope for a cure fuels the search for answers. 
The hon. member for Pierrefonds-Dollard.  
THE LATE PAULINE JULIEN 
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
While we knew she was very ill, her death caught us all by surprise. 
Pauline Julien was a greatly admired performing artist. 
Everyone in Quebec mourns her loss. 
We share their pain and sorrow over the loss of this great lady.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in Canada. 
Its toll is frightening.  
October is breast cancer awareness month. 
The statistics speak for themselves. 
This Sunday, October 4, cities and towns across Canada will host Run for a Cure. 
We need participation by all Canadians to conquer this dreaded disease.  
The hon. member for Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle.  
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
INTERNATIONAL DAY OF OLDER PERSONS 
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, today is the International Day of Older Persons. 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
They claim the hunt is an expression of cultural self-determination. 
It is time for leadership. 
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
In other words, a political solution that will restore peace.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
This would be a disaster for western Canadian farmers. 
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
The people of Nunavut are very concerned with environmental issues. 
The hon. member for Rimouski-Mitis.  
THE LATE PAULINE JULIEN 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Superintendent of Financial Institutions today categorically denied that allegation.  
I would like to read from the superintendent's statement yesterday: 
That is Mr. Dussault. 
Not by the Minister of Finance, nor by any other Minister. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Let me again quote from the superintendent's statement of yesterday: 
Mr. Hafeman, who is replacing Mr. Dussault is a competent, experienced actuary- 
Then he goes on to say that the superintendent- 
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Somalia, an embarrassment: shred the documents. 
Krever, an embarrassment: take him to court. 
Students, an embarrassment: use the pepper spray. 
EI fund surplus, an embarrassment: steal it. 
Now this actuary, an embarrassment: fire him.  
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this is a very serious matter. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Second, let us understand what the superintendent has done. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
It could be someone else.  
Are we going to see that report?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is simply nonsense. 
First, Mr. Hafeman worked under Mr. Dussault.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, this morning the Canadian dollar is in free fall. 
The Prime Minister, however, continues to say all is well.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is clear that we live in a volatile world. 
The meeting of the Commonwealth countries has just concluded. 
There is no doubt that Canada will be affected.  
That is what counts most.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
For the fourth consecutive month, the indicators are dropping.  
The Prime Minister, however, says everything is fine. 
The king is happy.  
That represents $500 million a month.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let us look at what the Bloc is asking. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
So, I put the question to him:
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The Bloc's position is absolutely ludicrous.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is also for the Minister of Finance.  
Yet by the minister's own admission there is a storm coming. 
There is an economic downturn. 
There is a lot of anxiety in the country.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
It is for that reason we have been prudent. 
Thank heaven we have done that.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We will do all this within the context of our financial resources.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
It is clear that the current minister has no clout at the cabinet level.  
Mr. Bob Wood (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, hunger strikes are regrettable. 
We are talking about the health and welfare of several Canadian veterans. 
The hon. leader of the Conservative Party.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
These men are still on a hunger strike. 
The minister does not care for these veterans. 
Mr. Bob Wood (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):
She is quite right. 
The hon. member for Saanich-Gulf Islands.  
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I asked him why he had asked not to be the chair of the committee. 
He said it was for personal reasons.  
The hon. member for Saanich-Gulf Islands.  
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
I ask the hon. member to withdraw those last few words.  
Mr. Speaker, my question is- 
I asked the hon. member to withdraw those last few words.  
Mr. Speaker, yes I will withdraw them. 
I am sorry, I did not hear you.  
The member will go directly to his question.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I invite Reform to do it on a daily basis. 
It can say that for everyone on this side.  
The member was a great chairman of the committee. 
He has done a great job. 
He is a great friend of mine. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the secretary of state responsible for regional development.  
Will Ottawa pay up, and pay up now? 
They certainly went to great lengths to keep things quiet.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Since 1996, we have invested more than $1 billion.  
We also intervened in a number of- 
We are having a tough time hearing the answer. 
The hon. secretary of state has the floor.  
I find this sad and I hope Quebeckers will come up with a solution- 
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. secretary of state. 
The hon. member for Edmonton North.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the government has obeyed the law, number one. 
Number two, we are in a very volatile economic situation. 
We have to proceed with caution. 
We must do that taking into account the international situation. 
To do otherwise would be irresponsible.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
That is volatile and that is irresponsible.  
Why does the finance minister have to resort to these scare tactics? 
What good is the fear factor?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member ought to get her facts right. 
That is clearly not what I said. 
The hon. member knows full well that is not what I said. 
Is the Reform Party prepared to accept the consequences of its choices?  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.  
The hon. Minister of Industry has the floor.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
We have created a sector in Montreal, in Canada that is tops in the world. 
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
He wants to spend it. 
The minister knows full well that payroll taxes kill jobs. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
It is the time to stay the course and we intend to do so. 
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That is the Reform Party's program.  
Why are they swallowing themselves whole at this point? 
We do not buy that.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We are complying with the Employment Insurance Act. 
We do comply with the Employment Insurance Act. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for that question.  
Water is of prime importance to this country. 
Canada stands opposed to bulk water exports. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
This member is someone who looks at the sick and thinks they should get cash. 
We look at those who are sick and think they should get care.  
Let me give an example.  
We say that should- 
The hon. member for Macleod.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
This individual does not want this health minister. 
That is what he wants.  
Why does he not do that?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
I say that is wrong. 
That is why we on this side of the House want treatment. 
We want care, not cash. 
He is wrong and he knows it.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Minister of Finance. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I think the time has come for a direct answer. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have already answered the question. 
There will be full public hearings. 
The opposition I am sure can have opposition days. 
The opposition will be able to participate if it chooses.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Speaker, we know the facts about the firing of Bernard Dussault. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I would like to correct the member with respect to the program he mentioned. 
It was a program that was requested by my department, human resources. 
It has nothing to do with the Department of Finance. 
It has nothing to do with the Department of Finance.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Dussault objected and he was fired. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Palmer has denied those allegations categorically.  
The hon. member for Durham.  
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the industry minister. 
Many of these people fear that their personal information will be misused.  
What is the minister doing to protect these citizens of Canada?  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
We are one of the first countries to do so. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
We have seen the Prime Minister's lawyers stonewalling. 
We have seen cabinet ministers covering up. 
We have seen government MPs whipped into submission in committees.  
Democracy in this country is truly in trouble. 
The hon. Solicitor General.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
We have never heard from the opposition before on this. 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
Twenty of these women are in parliament today.  
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
What role did he play in this entire affair?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
That was signed by Mr. Mulroney.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
That number is 1-800-387-9816.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
That is surely very important for the economy.  
Next Monday shall be an allotted day. 
We will continue with this list on Wednesday and Thursday. 
CANADA CUSTOMS AND REVENUE AGENCY ACT 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member for Lotbiniere had eight and a half minutes remaining in his speech.  
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
I would rather not think about it.  
At any rate, this new bill is doomed to fail. 
That shows how ridiculous this whole idea is. 
Quebec and Ontario categorically refused to consider using the agency. 
The users, but at what cost?  
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
Why, therefore, is there not just one tax collection agency?  
We also wish to point out that this fundamental attitude is not new in Canada. 
Revenue Canada also administers the national child benefit.  
This last criterion reflects an important aspect of these agreements. 
They are service contracts. 
Initially, a good number of the provinces adopted a wait-and-see attitude. 
They wanted to see the agency fully operational before giving unconditional support. 
In fact, participation in the agency's activities is optional. 
The purpose of the agency is to provide a platform that would help the provinces. 
The agency will not appropriate provincial powers.  
That decision is made by each individual province.  
This will apply to Quebec, as well as to other provinces.  
I do hope that all members will support this initiative.  
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Revenue Canada already employs between 40,000 and 46,000 permanent and temporary employees. 
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Madam Speaker, my question pertains to privatization. 
In Saskatchewan where I come from we have experienced privatization in spades. 
People spit that word out. 
This is not a bill about privatization. 
Those discussions have gone very well. 
We have the database and we are capable of doing this.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I have two questions for my hon. colleague.  
First of all he mentioned the streamlining of this agency. 
The hon. member also mentioned the handling of highly confidential information. 
How can that be so?  
Madam Speaker, I thank the member for the question.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
This is a very significant bill that the House is debating today. 
From the public point of view this is also a very significant issue. 
From that point of view this bill is very important.  
I come from a municipal background. 
This is something we should be seriously concerned about.  
The NDP believes very strongly in a strong federal government. 
It leaves us open to all kinds of abuses. 
I hold that responsibility for my constituents. 
There are also some very serious concerns around issues to do with personal privacy. 
I know that others as well have raised this as a concern.  
We were told that there will be less overlap. 
We were told that there will be increased participation by the provinces.  
I doubt that there will be greater savings. 
So far it has not provided answers to the questions that have been raised.  
We will lose the sense of accountability.  
Now there are other provinces particularly in western Canada that are expressing concerns. 
We look at that kind of measure along the lines of privatization. 
Privatization and user fees go hand in hand.  
This brings me to my next concern, the massive privatization of Revenue Canada. 
Something like 40,000 workers are involved. 
They have the real experience of what makes a department work.  
We should consider their arguments. 
We are not in favour of privatization. 
They should be accountable to the House of Commons. 
It was a resounding failure in the maritimes. 
Within the financial community there has been debate about this bill. 
This was raised in the auditor general's report of December 1997. 
That is a very good question. 
How will we be provided with that assurance? 
We also have comments from other people. 
It is not on the national news at night. 
Nevertheless, it is a significant proposal. 
It has been a long time in the works. 
It is a proposal that has gone wrong. 
For us that means saying no to privatization. 
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Perhaps I can correct her.  
First of all, moving to the agency is creating a vehicle for options. 
It is about creating new options for Canadians as well.  
Let me give the hon. member a good example. 
That is about working together for the benefit of Canadians.  
It does not force the provinces to do anything. 
In fact, it includes them.  
Clearly the legislation says that each province will be able to nominate. 
The bill surely talks about accountability. 
I know many members have quoted the auditor general. 
The auditor general's quote was referring to the old model. 
The member talked about user fees. 
It is simply not true. 
That is totally erroneous.  
We are in the business of tax administration. 
In terms of the quote from Mr. Krishna, he was referring to the former model. 
What we are talking about is opportunity. 
What we are talking about is bringing the federal and provincial governments together. 
Canadians want us to work in co-operation. 
That is what the agency is all about. 
It is creating a new vehicle for us to work together in co-operation.  
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his comments. 
That does not appear to be evident. 
What does that mean?  
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
Does it affect individuals?  
In my opinion, the yardstick is our constituents, individuals. 
We also heard that savings would be made. 
But on whose backs will these savings be made?  
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to follow the previous speaker. 
The sections of the Income Tax Act will be the same. 
Canada has the best revenue collection in the world. 
They get a refund or they submit their taxes. 
Nobody comes pounding on the door. 
People in this country are responsible. 
Under this legislation we are not in a transition to some private company. 
They pay taxes to different levels of government. 
It is another step, another potential choice.  
There has to be accountability. 
They will be approved at the federal level. 
That is in the bill.  
It will be a new approach to public service management. 
Are we the only people in the world who have dreamed up this scheme? 
It will go through the scrutiny and there will be further input. 
There has been a process.  
That is just not true. 
I attended some of the meetings. 
Maybe we have to look for further advice. 
There is the private sector advisory committee. 
It has and will continue to give advice, and we will listen.  
I think that is an important point, especially for our employees.  
Let us be clear once and for all. 
The agency is not about downsizing. 
There is no hidden agenda. 
It is about service. 
Every member of the department will be transferred to the agency.  
That is part of the myth.  
It is not about laying off employees. 
It represents a new start. 
It is a change. 
But Revenue Canada needs change because the world is changing. 
That is a fact.  
They are not the same from one province to another. 
There is the potential to simplify it. 
Are there user fees? 
Is cost recovery available if a province uses some of our systems? 
Cost recovery is not a user fee. 
They are two different things.  
Let us think about some of the other myths I have heard today.  
This will benefit management at the expense of the employees. 
I do not think so. 
In fact I know that is not true.  
They will concentrate less on process and more on results.  
The system will also benefit employees in a number of ways. 
What is wrong with that? 
The federal government will remain firmly in control.  
There will be access in exactly the same manner that we have today. 
That is far different than open. 
Consent forms are needed. 
The Minister of National Revenue will retain all current authorities he has under the act. 
The broader interest of the cabinet will continue to be fully protected. 
So where is this idea of privatization? 
It certainly does not go hand in hand with what I have just stated. 
Where is the personal privacy issue being jeopardized? 
Personal privacy will not, should not, and will never be privatized knowingly. 
It is not communicated. 
The barriers are there.  
We have rules governing confidentiality of information. 
We have rules governing access of private information. 
We have rules governing fairness. 
These powers are limited by the authority given in the tax and customs legislation. 
The system is in its evolution. 
We have a framework on which we can build. 
We have a system that may in time create a less complex environment. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
I thought we lived in a federation. 
I believe very strongly in co-operative federalism. 
It is a fair question.  
But the structure is there. 
That is already status quo. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
We can all agree with that. 
This government has been looking at it with the provinces for over 18 months. 
The government will not get those agreements even once the act is in place.  
The provinces want to run their own business. 
The government has had a consultative process. 
The government says that it is listening. 
This is not consultation. 
We want this process to stop. 
We are not engaged''.  
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I would have three brief comments to make.  
So what is the advantage?  
None, so what is the point?  
The Minister of National Revenue will be responsible for the agency. 
The minister would actually be going through this person. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for his question. 
It is a good question.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to answer the question.  
I believe our workers already understand the principle. 
It is a system of due process.  
It goes through the different processes available to the Canadian taxpayer. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
We do not really believe that. 
Several provinces have already indicated they do not support the legislation. 
How are their concerns to be heard in that place?  
What do they have at the present time? 
That is some of the background I wanted to set. 
Few people would admit to being happy to pay taxes. 
Everyone should pay taxes justly owed. 
Some may ask why a taxpayer's bill of rights. 
In these circumstances penalties and interest otherwise payable must be waived.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the hon. member for Prince Albert on his remarks.  
The hon. member spoke about the need for greater accountability. 
Mr. Speaker, I have had bad experiences. 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Liberal members are also welcome to have them.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
She said we need better service. 
Service has a connotation of servant. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague. 
Leadership starts at the top in that chair over there. 
They have forgotten their faces and names.  
Talk about arrogance of servanthood. 
Servanthood is something that is demonstrated at the top. 
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for my Reform Party colleague.  
I would like to hear my hon. colleague's comments on this.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for the question about democratic control.  
As to political friends, we all know the record of this government. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
That is a very important aspect. 
What is happening is that a government department is becoming a government agency. 
It will operate under the authority of the Financial Administration Act. 
I think it is an area of concern to Canadians whenever they hear user fees.  
Program results will have to be monitored, including, most important to Canadians, levels of service.  
I hope all hon. members will support conceptually the principles being offered here.  
It is a subject of debate. 
I would pose this as a rhetorical question.  
As all hon. members know, senators do not have constituency offices across the country. 
I am not sure whether it is really possible. 
Those are some of my thoughts.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We will go now to questions and comments. 
We are talking about this bill. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Too often it is a power that is abused. 
Mr. Speaker, it is an interesting point. 
We do have laws in Canada, tax laws and other laws. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
The public servants described the position in which they found themselves. 
That is my question.  
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
The Public Service Commission is responsible for the staffing process. 
We live in a world that is competitive at many levels. 
We live in a world that is changing. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I understand where the member is coming from.  
Many provinces have provided input. 
The member opposite will be able to provide input. 
There is always room to make improvements. 
That is why we are here debating the bill. 
We are here to look at the legislation as well as other things. 
It is not a one way street. 
One cannot just sit over there and oppose everything. 
One has to be constructive from time to time. 
That is what committees are for.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
I heard his speech this morning, in which he presented a whole series of arguments. 
My colleague's arguments were well founded.  
I want to focus on the words ``more effectively and cost efficiently''. 
I think everyone agrees on ``cost efficiently''. 
The more it brings in, the more it is in the public interest.  
However, I have a few questions about the ``more effectively''. 
The understanding is more effectively than at present. 
I am told there are about 18,000. 
There is a message in this. 
The government has presented this as its first objective.  
I do not wish to worry people needlessly. 
They are all worried about this. 
They wonder what might happen to them. 
Behind it all lies the fear of being shunted aside. 
The key words in this are ``working in conjunction with the provinces''. 
The concept of ``co-operation'' is understood. 
Generally, the purpose is harmonization.  
But what is actually happening? 
In this regard, Quebec wants to keep its powers and its responsibilities.  
But once bitten, twice shy. 
This objective no doubt remains. 
Members remember the famous millennium scholarship fund. 
The same is not true for the government. 
However, we are still in the federal system. 
They often consult the Constitution. 
I too have read it. 
We know about the Constitution.  
I also know its history and the facts surrounding it. 
However, I will have the opportunity- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The House resumed from June 1 consideration of the motion.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member for Prince George-Peace River has six minutes remaining.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, how did I manage that? 
I have never spoken to this bill.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I would ask the hon. member to start the debate right away. 
In the meantime the clerk will check the records for the last session.  
Motion No. 318 states: 
That is how we need to look at this motion. 
The intent is clear. 
That is the policy of the Reform Party. 
How unfair is the present system? 
How many charities are we talking about? 
I must have spoken on this issue previously. 
I thank the Chair for the correction.  
This motion is votable. 
I urge all members of the House to do exactly that.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to support this motion put forward by my hon. colleague.  
The definition of a charity needs some work. 
The growth simply is not there. 
I support that principle. 
I want to flag a concern at this point. 
We think it is appropriate to re-examine this whole issue. 
They do not join these organizations to go on fundraising activities.  
I think this is a step forward. 
I think it is a step in the right direction. 
I want to talk a bit about the simplicity of the matter. 
It is a big business. 
It is a $4 billion business annually. 
We are talking about a considerable amount of money relatively speaking. 
It is with enthusiasm that we support the motion. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to participate in the debate on Motion No. 318. 
The current tax regime was put into place in consultation with the charity industry.  
That is a good thing.  
These measures are very important. 
It is important to see that take place.  
It has made a real difference.  
That is important to note.  
In that we all benefit.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
That is the problem that the motion is attempting to address.  
This is a bit of a cop-out in terms of the motion before us. 
Any motion should clearly define exactly what it is going to do, for obvious reasons.  
There is complete transparency in the process. 
A speaker from my party debated this issue a few months back. 
I think my Quebec colleague would agree with me. 
The line up would be endless if we changed the system significantly. 
There is a danger in a wholesale change of the system. 
If the Canadian tax code were laid here next to me, it would dwarf me. 
It is much taller than my six foot two inches.  
Our Canadian tax code is overly complex. 
I certainly have been using one for years. 
It goes right back to the word complexity.  
This is interesting and quite humourous. 
The efforts of the member have to be commended. 
This goes beyond partisan politics. 
We do not want to see that end. 
We want to see that enhanced.  
That would be a good thing. 
The organizations that deliver services best are usually the ones in our backyards. 
We commend the member. 
We are prepared to support the motion. 
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
To say these are not important is nonsense. 
We cannot diminish it.  
That is a lot of money. 
They employ approximately a million people. 
We are not talking about an insignificant sector of our country.  
What would it be without those services that are given freely and generously by Canadians? 
However, there was no community based care. 
I am aware that more people can give more money to charities. 
However, how many people have it in their ability to contribute 75% of their income?  
This is why we see charities resorting to bingos and lotteries. 
We know that needs to happen. 
Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):
Let us give those charitable donations more of a tax break than they currently get''.  
Then I looked at the proposal. 
The bells started going off. 
I began to think ``What is it they want to do?'' 
That is exactly what they want to do''.  
Why do we not look at the mirror image of what they are proposing? 
I will tell this to my constituents because it is important. 
Let us say that Stan Keyes received a $100,000 donation to his political campaign. 
That is very generous. 
I would appreciate it. 
Even the members of the Reform Party are puzzled by this. 
Does that not make sense?

That is the complainant. 
This is not me speaking; this is the judge speaking. 
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
I will read from the English text.  
What do paragraphs 24.1(3)( a ), ( b ) and ( c ) say? 
(b) to administer oaths;
