GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Gar Knutson (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Vaughan-King-Aurora, Lib.):
FAMILY FARM COST OF PRODUCTION PROTECTION ACT 
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to table two petitions.  
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
Mr. Raymond Lavigne (Verdun-Saint-Henri, Lib.):
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
What these people are calling for is that the Senate of Canada be abolished. 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib):
The Inuit find the housing conditions in Nunavik extremely distressing. 
They consider the situation totally intolerable. 
Mr. Gar Knutson (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1999 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I would like to briefly summarize some of the bill's highlights. 
The bill also addresses first nations taxation issues. 
There are also measures involving the administration of taxation. 
Certainly this exchange of information helps ensure amounts owed are indeed paid.  
The amendments, many of which are technical, confirm some existing practices. 
The 1999 budget again confirms that the era of deficit financing is over. 
We will continue to deliver balanced budgets or better.  
The third pillar of our strategy tax relief is very clear. 
We have demonstrated a three front strategy over the last number of budgets. 
We will continue with that approach. 
It is clear that many benefits will result from Bill C-71. 
I urge my hon. colleagues to pass this legislation without delay.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
It has to do with the issue of productivity. 
I do not think it makes Canada more productive. 
I do not think it helps us improve our standard of living. 
The question is how do we improve our productivity? 
How do we get to become a more productive nation? 
Among them is a good education system. 
We do put a lot of money into it. 
That makes sense to me. 
There has been some progress made in that way over the last many years.  
Sadly we still have all kinds of internal trade barriers in Canada between provinces. 
We still have many internal trade barriers.  
We also have a tremendous amount of regulation in Canada. 
Every year we produce hundreds of regulations. 
Sadly we still have to contend with that. 
This government has not done a good job of eliminating burdensome regulation.  
There are probably other factors as well that I have not mentioned.  
This was an issue that was debated a bit yesterday as well.  
We see this all the time.  
Yesterday we had all kinds of people appear before us. 
We hear that over and over again. 
It employs 76,000 people, many of whom are in Canada. 
It is doing wonderful things. 
For obvious reasons these companies do not want to alienate government. 
It speaks volumes when a company like Nortel speaks up. 
However, it is not just Nortel. 
My goodness, we had Mr. Desmarais speaking out. 
He has very close connections with the Prime Minister. 
We had Mr. Pattison speaking out. 
This is not me speaking. 
That is the first point I want to make.  
We also heard yesterday from someone who is involved in the biotech field. 
That is what motivates a lot of these people. 
There is more wealth being created. 
They were having to fill those positions with very junior people. 
This is an extraordinarily serious problem and it obviously impacts our productivity. 
He gave a speech on this in February.  
My hon. friend across the way is piping up. 
I am sure he is a little embarrassed about that. 
It was his industry minister who did it. 
I am simply pointing this out. 
What did the government do in Bill C-71? 
It talked about lowering taxes. 
What did it do in the budget overall? 
It talked about lowering taxes. 
The government talks about $16 billion in tax relief over three years. 
They do not have a choice. 
That is a payroll tax. 
Overall, the point is that the tax burden continues to grow. 
It is not our data; it is the government's data.  
We can forget about what the government tells us about taxes going down. 
I mentioned brain drain a minute ago. 
If it will stem brain drain it will help our productivity.  
There are a couple of ways it does that. 
There would be a better return on investment. 
That is the rough definition of what improving productivity means. 
The evidence is very clear. 
Ultimately everybody was better off. 
The government even brought in more revenue. 
How can that be a bad thing? 
It is a very good thing.  
That is a good point. 
I am glad my Liberal colleague from Toronto made that point. 
Certainly members on this side agree with it.  
It simply does not lower taxes enough. 
It does not deal with things like regulation. 
That is absolutely wrong. 
Basically for every $2 it took out it put about $1 back in.  
By anyone's definition that is a shell game. 
It is not a question of improving health care. 
We also have to point out that this is only a stopgap. 
I do not want the American system. 
There are many things about the American system that are horrible. 
I do not like a lot of what the American system is about. 
That does not mean that we cannot improve the Canadian system. 
There are many things wrong with the Canadian system.  
It is not serving the public well.  
There are ways to do it. 
It did that by allowing a public-private system for eye surgery, for instance. 
It punished the Government of Alberta by cutting back the transfers to Alberta. 
That was a huge mistake. 
Maybe we want to go to the Brazil system next.  
My friend across the way is yelling at me. 
That is what I ask him. 
We on this side would do that by cutting taxes. 
That is just a beginning. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
By comparison, Quebec will get $900 million.  
They are all on an equal footing''. 
That is not the issue. 
Clearly, Quebec has to do more. 
But the federal government must do its part as well. 
A journalist once told me we were playing the same old tape. 
The situation has not changed in 30 years. 
The federal government is systematically discriminating against Quebec. 
I will give some illustrations, because this is so important. 
That is 4 percentage points short. 
That difference means jobs, and poverty as well. 
Looking at federal government capital investments, again Quebec is not being treated fairly. 
Once again, that difference means jobs, construction jobs. 
Federal subsidies to businesses shrink every year as well. 
Only 18% of federal funding to Canadian business goes to businesses in Quebec. 
We get 14% of the money for research and development.  
No one can tell me that this does not have an impact. 
It has a definite impact on the relative competitiveness of Quebec and Ontario. 
The number one province in that respect is Ontario. 
Do members know how many jobs this means per year?  
This is a lot of jobs.  
I hear a member from Ontario. 
I would rather not reply. 
It would drop by 1.2 points. 
They are being denied a share of the taxes they pay.  
We are not asking for more than our share. 
This is not something dreamt up by sovereignists or the Bloc Quebecois. 
The Bloc Quebecois was formed in June 1991. 
This situation has been going on for 25 years. 
We did not make up these figures. 
They are federal figures from Statistics Canada. 
They are not made up.  
They have not done so. 
They prefer to laugh in our faces.  
They find that funny.  
We will work very hard at it, though''.  
They do nothing of the kind. 
They are a bunch of do-nothings. 
Ontario got all the structural investment.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would ask you to note that there is no quorum. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Charlevoix has called for quorum. 
We do not have quorum.  
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We now have quorum.  
That is how the Minister of Finance and this government operate.  
Quebec should be concerned. 
Better yet, these investments would have all sorts of direct and indirect effects.  
This should also concern Quebecers.  
There are also things that are not included in this bill. 
But there are others.  
There is one, for instance, that has existed since 1986. 
Every year, their assets go down. 
So does their disposable income. 
Measures like these are what is impoverishing people. 
But they do not show. 
This is not small change. 
We are not equipped to keep the taxation level that high. 
I have often called him lazy, and I think he is. 
Now he is developing a bit of an interest in taxes. 
Taxpayers have had it. 
The tax system must be changed''.  
The federal government could have indexed them long ago. 
It contains some interesting proposals''. 
He said that in the House.  
We figured we had not wasted our time. 
He congratulated the Bloc Quebecois for its two reports on taxation. 
Since then, what has the minister done? 
Why was the release of the report postponed? 
Because there was not much in it. 
Moreover, it even contained measures that were detrimental to the growth of businesses. 
One can understand why the tabling of the Mintz report was delayed. 
It sure sounds promising.  
Yes indeed, it must be careful. 
In fact, this is a very important issue for the Bloc Quebecois. 
We were the only party to table such a bill.  
It is not true that the government has no money. 
The government has money coming out its ears. 
It keeps this very quiet, and certainly does not put it in writing. 
As well, he took $7 billion from the employment insurance fund. 
It is unacceptable to do the same with the pension funds. 
The figure for the last fiscal year was $15 billion.  
The reaction may well be ``Oh those predictions, oh those economists''. 
Certainly, economists do have their shortcomings, but they also have positive qualities.  
One of the good qualities of economists, sometimes, ourselves included, is to be cautious. 
This is not something I am inventing.  
They double over, they twist themselves in knots, they roll around on the carpet.  
And yet it is not all that funny. 
Six months later, our exact predictions had come true.  
He literally and systematically hides the truth of the figures.  
He could have done all that. 
The minister could have done all that. 
If one's actions are based on lies, one cannot do these things.  
There are no longer any reliable figures in the minister's budget. 
So, the minister could have done a lot. 
He could have done more to help children living in poverty. 
People are poorer than before, children as well.  
He knows that child poverty has increased. 
And that is truly shameful.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
I will try to categorize my view of this budget and the government. 
I will use two or three examples to start with. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I would admonish the hon. member for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys in that regard.  
Mr. Speaker, I accept that admonishment, which is probably well placed. 
The worst case scenario concerns the young people of Canada. 
The people who have been paying into the system do not qualify. 
I say this is theft. 
I am not going to say that an individual should be charged. 
That is one example.  
Whether this is technically theft I do not know. 
I suppose lawyers could argue this for some weeks. 
That is the one point I want to start off with. 
The millionaires in Canada do not have to wait and see. 
They got a nice tax break. 
That is not much for a millionaire, but $8,000 is $8,000. 
No, there was nothing for them.  
There is something wrong with this picture.  
I could go on to talk about a number of points. 
There is a very clear school of economics at work. 
The short answer is no.  
The government says it is going to restore funding to health care. 
To my Liberal funds opposite I say that is true. 
We are almost at the year 2000. 
The answer is clearly no. 
This is a bit of a shell game. 
It is playing a very minor role.  
What about all those Canadians who are looking for work? 
Did they see initiatives in this budget that will give them some encouragement? 
What about the homeless people? 
What about the people who are struggling to get their family into a decent home? 
They have to rent because they simply cannot afford it. 
The housing market is priced out of their limits.  
I will not even talk about first nations accommodations. 
Again there was nothing in this budget. 
We are supposed to be fulfilling the Kyoto protocol. 
We have a whole set of programs.  
Where the hell have we been for the last 10 years? 
It is not as though we need to find new solutions. 
We have all kinds of solutions.  
It is not as though we do not know what to do. 
We need some cash or we need some incentive. 
We need some direction and some leadership. 
I do not want to go on too long because it gets very depressing.  
``We will eliminate the GST if you elect Liberals''. 
The Liberals were elected and they did not do it. 
It was very disappointing. 
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
I have been listening to this speech and I am really impressed. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the hon. member for Portage-Lisgar requesting a quorum call?  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:
Mr. Speaker, that is what I am calling for.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We have a quorum.  
Perhaps we can say one represents a group.  
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal:
The important people are here. 
I know he listens to every word I say.  
Anything to do with primary resources is pretty light in this budget.  
Restoring the funding for health care was not there. 
It was a bit of a shell game. 
Those tax breaks were intended to provide an incentive for certain people to do things. 
We have identified that some people need to be bribed into activity. 
They tend to be wealthy people. 
He graduated from that university. 
He knows trickle down economics probably better than most people I have ever met. 
The trickling has to stop. 
We are almost drowning. 
The trickle down theme seems to have been introduced into this budget.  
I have to identify two or three of the more general things that were missed. 
What was in this budget that would lend itself to support education? 
Was there a break on tuition fees? 
What are we talking about here? 
What is going on? 
That is what is so frustrating. 
I suspect people listening to this will reflect that frustration. 
I know students certainly do.  
I challenge my friend the parliamentary secretary and I hope he will respond to this. 
Why not as a government be bold and say ``We believe in education. 
What can we do as the federal government?'' 
Wipe out tuition fees. 
My friend implies that this is some kind of a pie in the sky thought. 
How much would that cost? 
We have the money. 
It would cost the federal government about $3 billion. 
There is a $3 billion slush fund. 
It is called a contingency fund for special occasions. 
A cheer would go up across the country if they were to say that. 
Who would say it was a rotten idea? 
Most OECD countries have done it years and years ago.  
Let us get out there and say we will do something completely different. 
However, what would we do? 
We must come to grips with the forces of globalization and rapid technological change. 
The federal government has to provide leadership on these issues.  
Unfortunately there is a growing gap between those who have and those who have not. 
We are at a crossroads as we enter the 21st century. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I sat and listened attentively to the hon. member. 
One was the $8 billion over a period of time. 
I understand Manitoba is drawing down its portion as quickly as it can. 
It can do so over a three year period. 
In terms of trickle down economics, I am certainly familiar with the theory. 
We targeted our tax cuts initially. 
We took 600,000 Canadians off the tax rolls at the low end.  
We targeted our approach to those at the lower end of the income scale.  
Madam Speaker, there he goes, the Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance making sense again. 
However he is correct on that point.  
He gets by, to be fair. 
He had to fill out his income tax forms. 
He ended up paying a few hundred dollars in income tax.  
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to say a few words in this debate. 
When I think about the country many words come to mind. 
The issue of poverty is a very difficult one, as we are all aware. 
We do not have to be afraid of the future. 
In a few short weeks we will be entering the new decade. 
Mr. Broadbent went on to explain how the cycle of poverty works. 
Ed Broadbent said that back in 1989.  
This quote is truly the most interesting quote of all. 
In speaking to that motion, he said: 
That is the real tragedy. 
They will never get there because they will never get up to the starting line. 
In fact the number of Canada's poor has increased and their condition has worsened.  
Poverty statistics are debatable and very controversial, especially in Canada. 
Most of them are very accurate. 
There are hundreds of statistics on poverty in Canada. 
That is not the case.  
With these numbers we can see that there is a major poverty problem in Canada. 
Children are some of the most vulnerable people in our society. 
They are helpless and are innocent victims of their environment and their socioeconomic condition. 
Children are dependent upon parents. 
It is a very real problem.  
It is a national disgrace. 
It is hard to imagine.  
Women are struck very heavily by poverty, especially single mothers. 
Who are you hearing it from?  
That is a damning statistic. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
He made a very compelling speech.  
For example, I think of the high employment insurance premiums. 
I think of the very high unemployment rate. 
We have worked very hard. 
I used to be the chairman of the Waterloo Regional Police. 
There are justice and economic issues. 
Measures need to be put in place in a co-operative way.  
As an investment it will ensure that we save $7 dollars later.  
I could not agree more. 
They certainly have not.  
Since 1984 the problem has become more acute.  
Employment programs have been all but eliminated. 
Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to what the member opposite had to say. 
The one thing about it is yes, Canada is a great place to live. 
Studies show that Canada is the greatest place to live.  
It was in power for nine years. 
Were there any food banks during the years when the Mulroney government was in power?  
Mr. Speaker, the problem is quite clear. 
Yes it is very important to have a balanced budget. 
We all know that. 
However, the government has not done that. 
Families needed that money. 
Yes, we have balanced the budget, but at what cost? 
We have balanced the budget on the backs of the poor. 
We have balanced the budget on the backs of the working poor. 
The government has to come to grips with that.  
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
In other words, these were half truths.  
The reality is something else. 
Francophones have always occupied their rightful place in Canada. 
They have proudly kept their language and their culture. 
The Bloc, and the sovereignists, are falling into the trap of paranoia. 
In fact, sovereignists lack perspective and have a selective memory. 
Our economic and budget choice was actually an easy one to make. 
It was committed to a balanced budget.  
Last year, this amount dropped to 27 cents.  
The cheques were emblazoned with the fleur de lys.  
In conclusion, my message is one of optimism. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We have a lot of other priorities at the moment.  
The essential issue is taxes. 
I would like the opinion of my colleague from Beauce on that. 
We cannot afford to just say ``Wait for the next budget''. 
They have nothing left of their pay cheques. 
We are also going to look at the taxation system''. 
They know it is a key to reviving the economy.  
Something must be done. 
We must not say ``Wait for the next budget''. 
Administrative corrections need to be made. 
It is nothing complicated.  
I would like to have his opinion on the taxation system.  
But, we must be cautious. 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
This is the third time that I rise to speak to this bill. 
I have been a small businessman and an accountant. 
This started with the Conservative government. 
Why is their take-home pay going down? 
With all of these things they just cannot seem to make ends meet. 
Now we see a new debate going on. 
Businesses have finally started speaking out. 
They are saying that enough is enough. 
We hear Nortel talking about losing the brightest people in Canada. 
We spend money to train them and then we lose them to other countries.  
They will do that and we will lose them.  
Let us talk about that for a little while.  
Now the Liberal government is coming up with a band-aid solution. 
I will talk about the University of Calgary for example. 
I have seen how competitive Canadians are. 
We can rise to the challenge. 
What is curtailing us? 
More and more Canadians are leaving.  
On Monday I pointed to an example which I will repeat today. 
I visited an institution in Toronto where they are teaching high tech to students. 
In committee yesterday the Minister for International Trade sent his message out to the government. 
I hope the minister is listening to this. 
His chain was yanked. 
When will they work toward it?  
The cost of education is rising. 
I have repeated this many times in this House. 
And what is happening? 
Where is your leader?  
Let us talk about taxes for a change.  
We have a problem with education. 
Post-secondary education is a problem. 
Small business people are facing problems. 
CPP premiums have gone up. 
Of course the government claims it has reduced the EI. 
In the overall taxation problem people do not see any hope.  
The auditor general has stated that the underground economy has increased. 
I do not agree with the underground economy. 
When the government provides services we have to pay for those services. 
Why is there an underground economy? 
That is why there is an underground economy.  
Ours is a voluntary system. 
We are supposed to declare what we earn. 
This is what is happening. 
Over the past years the trust has been broken.  
Mothers at home have not been recognized. 
Again the government said it would study this issue.  
I do not see the logic.  
It is a choice they have made. 
One choice is not better than the other. 
They both have the same objective of raising good Canadian citizens. 
Let us talk about health care. 
I said on Monday that a constituent had phoned me. 
She said that she was afraid of what was going to happen with health care. 
She did not see that this government had addressed this issue. 
What does this do? 
This is the second province to do that. 
They want to get those taxes.  
It is for those who earn high incomes. 
Do not give me indigestion.  
I will give the hon. member some tablets for his indigestion.  
Now it is time to stop.  
Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Middlesex, Lib.):
It was about 90% hot air, nothing on target.  
Education is a provincial responsibility. 
The provinces spend the money, they set the costs. 
That is who is responsible. 
We give them money but we do not float it all.  
On the deficit, who got to the deficit? 
This government put money against the debt. 
The government has put money against the surplus. 
Let the stay at home mothers and the working mothers make that decision. 
Give them tax relief.  
It will be a laugh if they ever make it to government. 
We will continue to bring down the mountain of debt. 
We did not put it there. 
It was created over a number of years. 
Slowly we will bring it down. 
This is an exaggeration by the Reform Party. 
I cannot believe it.  
That is exactly it. 
There is no government that would take that on. 
All tax policies say that we should not borrow to give a tax break.  
Mr. Speaker, talk about the hot air that just blew over from the other corner. 
He just stood to ask anything. 
He did not say a single word about what I was talking about.  
He talked about deficit reduction. 
It was cleaned up by high taxes.  
He talked about the Ontario Conservatives borrowing money. 
Let me tell him this. 
Do that over there and then we will talk about it.  
He talked about being praised around the world. 
Where is this hot air coming from?  
He talked about giving mothers a choice. 
Yes, we should give them a choice. 
But the government's tax system has created no choice for them. 
We know where this hot air is coming from.  
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
Have Liberal governments in the past ever borrowed money? 
Has he heard those figures?  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for asking that question. 
It is a good question.  
Where did this deficit come from? 
Was it not started by a Liberal government? 
It initiated this business of deficit spending and the Tories followed. 
It started over there. 
Now the Conservative governments are bringing in legislation to stop deficit spending.  
My colleague talked about Canadians borrowing money. 
I forgot that point. 
He is absolutely right. 
The tax burden on Canadians is pretty high.  
Let me cite some statistics. 
And I will give them statistics, not hot air. 
The statistics are very simple. 
Let us talk about facts.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
I am well aware of the great influence you have on the House. 
I accept your leadership without question. 
If I had had the opportunity I would even have voted for you.  
This being said, we now have to deal with less pleasant issues. 
I would ask government members to pay attention. 
We have many complaints about the budget.  
I want to stress again how important it is to vigorously fight poverty. 
It is a quirk of scheduling. 
It was not planned, it just happened that way. 
I therefore feel all the more comfortable talking about this issue.  
This idea is gathering a fair amount of support.  
I have some support from the Progressive Conservative Party. 
I have some support from the New Democratic Party. 
It sets no quotas. 
It simply requires banks to become involved in the community.  
Banks can get involved in underprivileged communities in a variety of ways. 
It has to do with the multiplier theory.  
Naturally, consumers are better informed when they have to make choices.  
I think members of the House are very sensitive to the issue of poverty.  
What are we talking about when we speak of poverty? 
We all know we need a whole range of measures.  
As members know, Quebec has no choice but to become a country. 
There was a similar case regarding financial services. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
On a point of order, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We do have a responsibility to be relevant when speaking to the bill. 
I would ask the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve to keep that in mind.  
Mr. Speaker, the parliamentary secretary may have had trouble concentrating. 
I remind him that we are talking about poverty here. 
We are talking about the budget. 
My colleague's remark is totally uncalled for. 
He should remain seated and steer clear of such irrelevant comments.  
Let me give the House some examples. 
We have to realize that. 
First, there is the millennium scholarship fund. 
And yet, that is what they are getting ready to do.  
So, they will be involved in a process of lifelong learning. 
However, it is not up to the federal government to give that money directly.  
Did the federal government listen? 
I could go on and on. 
I will address the whole issue of the Youth Employment Strategy. 
This program is ill-conceived. 
It does not make sense. 
The federal government's interference in this area is now a well-known fact.  
Canadian institutes for health research have been established. 
Members know that Montreal is a hub in the tourist industry.  
Would you be so kind as to call them to order?  
However, all I am asking them is to pay attention a bit.  
What did the federal government do and what did it not do? 
Fortunately, there is the Bloc Quebecois. 
Mr. Raymond Lavigne (Verdun-Saint-Henri, Lib.):
He wants us to help him in his riding. 
I am totally confused.  
It does not make any sense.  
Students in Quebec have trouble repaying their loans. 
We want to help them because their own government is not. 
Bloc members say ``Give us the money. 
We will manage it''. 
Why are they not doing it? 
They do it after we offer.  
It is always the same thing. 
It seems obvious to me.  
The Government of Quebec is the most generous government. 
It has been administering a loan and scholarship program since 1966.  
These organizations need money. 
It is ill conceived. 
It does not meet the needs of these community groups. 
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it has been an interesting morning listening to the debate. 
We know we are debating Bill C-71, the budget implementation act. 
The public is not being fooled. 
Nurses are on strike. 
Nurses are demanding that they get some more help. 
It is the same for doctors. 
This is despite mounting pressure from Canadians to lower taxes.  
Do you put your tax cuts on your VISA or MasterCard?  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:
I see my hon. friends across the way are listening and I appreciate that. 
That is the only way we will get a few things done.  
I was always under the impression that it was all due to the Liberal government. 
In fact they are all over the map. 
Last year it went $3 billion over budget. 
This year it is about $7.6 billion. 
There is no better example than the agriculture sector. 
Everyone is familiar with the- 
We will now proceed to Statements by Members.  
GRANVILLE ISLAND PUBLIC MARKET 
Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam, Lib.):
Granville Island Public Market opened on June 12, 1979. 
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
He began studying medicine in 1920. 
It is an honour for- 
The hon. member for London-Fanshawe.  
SPEECH AND HEARING AWARENESS MONTH 
Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Fanshawe, Lib.):
An estimated one in ten Canadians is deaf or has some degree of hearing loss. 
Those most likely to be afflicted are seniors. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
THE LATE ALLAN WRIGHT 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
His brother Kelly was killed in action.  
He is truly a Canadian hero.  
Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Middlesex, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, reservists have always played an important role in the Canadian forces. 
The hon. member for Trois-Rivieres.  
SAINTE-URSULE SECONDARY SCHOOL 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the winds of change are blowing strongly across Britain today.  
These legislatures will bring government closure to the people they serve. 
Congratulations to Scotland, Wales and Great Britain. 
There are lessons for our Prime Minister to be learned from Mr. Blair. 
Well, Mr. Prime Minister, the times they are a changin'.  
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
In 1992 the Reform Party reported that it had 132,000 members. 
Today it only has 65,000, half that number.  
I could not disagree more. 
And the fewer Reformers there are, the better Canada is.  
SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS MONTH 
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, May is Sexual Assault Awareness Month. 
Sexual assault is a uniquely gendered crime. 
Overwhelmingly it is women who experience this violence. 
Sexual assault is a serious crime and must be stopped. 
It has serious economic and political costs for women. 
Canadian women are tired of platitudes from this government. 
They want action and they want it now. 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, May is Multiple Sclerosis Month. 
It was a wonderful sight.  
I will be in the Burlington Mall helping a terrific team. 
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
ALLERGY-ASTHMA AWARENESS MONTH 
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
More than six million Canadians suffer from allergies and asthma. 
In many cases, these conditions can be life-threatening.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Tax him hard, till he looks sad.  
Go ahead and tax the man.  
Tax his dog and hired hand; 
Tax his bed, tax his quilt; 
Tax his pig, tax his pen, 
Tax his flocks, tax his hen; 
Tax his corn, tax his wheat, 
Tax his wagon, tax its squeak; 
Tax his wife, tax his boy, 
Tax whatever gives him joy; 
Tax the man who works for him, 
'Fore his paycheque gets too thin.  
Tax his truck and all its rattles; 
Tax his stock and tax his cash; 
Tax him double if he's rash; 
Tax his light, tax his power, 
Tax his payroll by the hour; 
If he's making more than rent, 
Add another five percent; 
Tax whate'er he has to sell, 
If he hollers-tax his yell.  
For the finance minister.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the Leader of the Opposition for asking this question.  
Our role is not defined as yet. 
It is a very good sign of progress. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I do not know of any quid pro quo for them to sign. 
They are determined, like other countries of the G-8, to have a diplomatic solution. 
And they did not ask a price for that. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the answer is yes.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
That will inevitably mean committing a sizeable Canadian military contingent to the region. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Our soldiers are already overtasked and they are overworked in Bosnia.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there are no plans to do that in the immediate future. 
Is the member talking about taking somebody directly from Bosnia to Kosovo? 
No, we are not looking at that prospect at all.  
We have taken all of that into consideration. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The President of Mexico will not be in Mexico City when Mr. Bouchard is there. 
This is a rational enough explanation. 
It was he who raised the problem, not I. 
Divine providence probably informed him, not the Canadian government.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
The question is whether or not the embassy passed on the message.  
The Right Hon. Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we had a well established protocol for this.  
If they want a protocol, they should start respecting it.  
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, in 1974, Robert Bourassa met with the King of Sweden. 
In 1975, Mr. Bourassa visited the Shah of Iran. 
In 1989, Mr. Bourassa was received by the German Chancellor. 
In 1992, Mr. Bourassa met with the British Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the president is not even there. 
So they are being humiliated.  
So why bother-emmerder-foreigners with our problems, instead of keeping them here- 
Is that parliamentary language?  
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I might quote Jean Lapierre, a former Bloc member.  
A former Liberal minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
Paul Arcand spoke of a winning condition. 
Lapierre's reply was:``There you are. 
There is no doubt about that. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
The auditor general does not report to the Prime Minister for good reason. 
My colleagues, I would ask you please to lower your voices.  
It prefers to operate behind closed doors.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
It is not in hiding. 
It is in the open. 
He explains how he manages the files and members can ask him questions. 
He will reply to questions. 
You can ask Mr. Wilson questions this afternoon.  
Please direct your answers and your questions to the chair.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
That was over five years ago and what do we have? 
Has the Prime Minister reviewed that code of conduct and will he support it?  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Perhaps she should check it out.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
In the past two months, two agreements have been signed-with Alberta and Ontario.  
Why did he wait two months to appoint a negotiator?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The hon. member for Richmond-Arthabaska.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
That makes no sense.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.  
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Why the double standard?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
I would prefer that we did not use words like ``emmerdant''.  
The example comes from the Prime Minister.  
The Right Hon. Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let us not get all worked up. 
Paul Arcand asked him ``Then, why are the Pequistes upset?'' 
The hon. member for Roberval.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I would appreciate it if the Prime Minister would explain his logic. 
We cannot accept that.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is very, very, very complicated. 
Mr. Zedillo is not in Mexico City. 
Therefore, it is the federal government's fault.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
The hon. member for Fraser Valley.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
In the Commission's view, these accusations are based on a misunderstanding. 
The hon. member for Fraser Valley.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, let me try this another way.  
The question is this. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, today, the Prime Minister is trying to change his story.  
He is saying that it is because the president was not there. 
But Quebec was prepared to change its date. 
The real reason is that Ottawa refused- 
We want to listen to the question. 
The leader of the Bloc Quebecois.  
Why did it then refuse to do the same thing for Premier Bouchard?  
Can he tell us how it is that this protocol has changed in two weeks?  
There are two stories.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this involves a trade mission to Mexico. 
We are being accused of not informing President Zedillo. 
He himself informed me that Mr. Bouchard was going to visit Mexico.  
They are trying to turn it into a huge scandal. 
But these are the same people who are always talking about respect for jurisdictions.  
They are clearly interfering in an area of federal jurisdiction- 
The leader of the Bloc Quebecois.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Kowtowing like Stephane Dion.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am extremely proud to be a French Canadian.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
The hon. member for Medicine Hat.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
I am very disappointed in him.  
My question is for the finance minister. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
What the conference board has done is to confirm exactly the policy of the government.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I invite the minister to kiss the Pope's ring.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
The Right Hon. Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the ministers of the G-8 countries have made considerable progress. 
In my opinion, having an agreement that includes the Russians is an extremely positive thing. 
There is also the matter of disarming the Kosovars who are involved in violence. 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
There are two main questions to examine around this issue. 
Is compassionate leave the best way to help? 
I have asked my officials to look into the matter.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a question about protecting public safety. 
There is more bungling by the solicitor general. 
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
This is a case of considerable concern. 
Correctional Services Canada has carried out an investigation. 
The RCMP is carrying out an investigation. 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Outside of that, the matter is under investigation. 
I am not in a position to comment any further.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. 
He has the authority. 
Why does he not do it?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
In fact the government has an extensive program to discourage young people from smoking. 
It is one that the government fully supports.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
As the member knows, two of the provinces are headed by governments of his party. 
All these issues can be dealt with.  
It is investing in the index.  
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
We are starting to tire of these unfounded allegations. 
Let them base their questions on facts and we will answer those facts.  
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
The province is there. 
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ): 
Member spoke in sign language as follows: ] 
The main reason for this according to broadcasters is a lack of financial resources.  
My question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her question. 
I will follow up on the member's request with the CRTC. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Will she tell us exactly what has been put on the negotiating table?  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
I think they understand that Canadian content is our main preoccupation.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
On Thursday we will return to Bill C-78.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
A collabo was a sympathizer of the Nazi regime in France, during World War II.  
That ruling was made on February 22, 1962. 
I would ask him who used them, and perhaps to think about it.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
The member for Bourassa is said to have used the word collabos. 
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am not afraid to call a spade a spade. 
Once it starts on one side, the other one follows. 
I would ask all members to be very judicious in their choice of words.  
Sometimes, even, members get very loud.  
I did not hear the words. 
Members were not named. 
We will let it sit there. 
I would encourage members to do that.  
BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1999 
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in the House. 
I will start my debate with a sentence that mentions Reform. 
I am sure my colleagues on the other side will listen.  
Instead we got foot-dragging and inaction.  
They went through the motions of listening to people in the industry. 
Then they came up with something nobody asked for.  
It is widely recognized as a failure. 
It is not bankable, it is not providing relief.  
They do not understand that the answer lies in their own record.  
This lack of foresight is so evident in our trade negotiations. 
That is why farmers will not vote Liberal. 
Farmers have no money left to tax. 
Unfortunately the current government seems unwilling or unable to meet this challenge. 
The impression is that he was a Liberal. 
Why was Christopher Columbus accused of being a Liberal? 
I remind taxpayers that an election is coming. 
Reform is on the move. 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
Consequently, provinces were also forced to make cuts. 
Some concerns have also been expressed regarding the increase in the estimates for national defence. 
There seems to be some inconsistency in what the government says.  
This new formula was to be established over a period of 5 years. 
This is totally unacceptable. 
The comparison is biased. 
They are comparing apples and oranges. 
It will be paid only once, this year.  
It is only an adjustment on amounts owed to Quebec in the last few years. 
Let us talk about the per capita question. 
I now wish to address the issue of health. 
And they are expected to be grateful for that.  
However, the government remained deaf to these requests.  
The rest were imposed on transfers to the provinces and on employment insurance.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That is their mission. 
The province of Quebec receives 34% of transfers from the federal government. 
He asked why we had moved to the equal per capita? 
We inherited a system which was a cap on cap. 
The member also talked about economic dependency. 
I will, however, be pleased to remind him of a number of things.  
What did these people do? 
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
The government claims that it gives a lot and that it is fair. 
As for us, we say that something is not working. 
I have a question for my colleague. 
What would the hon. member call such a situation?  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Matapedia-Matane for his excellent question.  
I would tend to call it blindness. 
This was my first point.  
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
We are having difficulty retaining our youth and our talent. 
These people are leaving Canada. 
Patriotism and pride are not enough to keep them. 
People are voting with their feet and with their moving vans. 
A person may well ask who are the beneficiaries of the high policy. 
It shows the effect of high taxes on Canadians.  
What are the Liberals calling this budget? 
We begin to see the effects this is having on individual Canadians.  
The Liberals will be putting back $11.5 billion over the next five years. 
They are taking three dollars from the system for every dollar they put back in. 
Let me give one example that happened to me recently. 
I had a request from a family who wanted to see me in my office. 
In came a young father, his wife and their little child. 
They are looking at possibly losing their car. 
If he loses his car, he loses his job.  
What was he complaining about? 
He was not complaining about the gross amount of his salary. 
We know there is nothing less than that in the account. 
These are nickels and dimes. 
The tax pain is causing the brain drain. 
It does this by driving away our youth and our talent. 
That is a sad reality. 
That results in a reduced tax base. 
Peter Foster in yesterday's Financial Post wrote: 
Does the Prime Minister not know this? 
Maybe he just does not care. 
We wonder what his answer would be. 
He seems to think that high taxes are part of the Canadian way of life. 
The tolerance threshold has been reached and surpassed this year. 
We are watching our youth and our talent go elsewhere.  
They are not only going south. 
They are going in other directions. 
The brain drain is not limited to youth. 
It is a serious problem that crosses generational boundaries.  
``When the government is too greedy'', he says, ``people find other solutions''.  
This poses a further, more immediate problem. 
The brain drain is neither a phenomenon of youth nor a minor issue. 
It is a symptom of stress and the predictable result of a bad tax system. 
He was not looking for better working conditions or a new place to go. 
He was not asking for a new hospital, a new office or new operating equipment. 
If one is to be motivated to avoid pain then one moves away from it. 
That is a base need of all people.  
It is the impact that taxes are having on services. 
We have to question their priorities.  
Whatever services they needed they could get in that town. 
I have to wonder what the net benefit will be of this. 
We all know laptops are more expensive.  
They will probably need a vehicle to drive. 
They will be paid overtime for travel. 
They will be on overtime for the rest of the week. 
They will have their hotel and meals bills paid. 
What kind of a saving is that going to be?  
Consequently, I think we are definitely paying more. 
We keep on paying more and we keep on getting less under this regime. 
It is so frustrating for the people in my riding. 
I had to say these things on their behalf because they have had it.  
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
The theory of responsible government is at the heart and soul of how democracy functions. 
Members of parliament are elected as democratic representatives of all constituents.  
What an absurdly unfair comment for such a business leader to make.  
We have taken 600,000 poor Canadians off the tax rolls altogether. 
The government has made reducing taxes a priority. 
It is just that we have been responsible about it.  
I am not begrudging those people what they have earned. 
That would be up to their shareholders. 
I merely mention it to keep things in perspective.  
Not a 26% increase.  
They know that the Government of Canada balanced the books. 
That is what the principle of responsibility is all about. 
That was the principal mandate on which we were elected. 
As a responsible government we must fulfill that mandate. 
That is responsible government in its traditional form.  
I suppose the Minister of Finance could have acted differently. 
He could have borrowed to pay for tax cuts. 
That is exactly what we have done.  
We must reduce the debt. 
We have no right to pass that debt untouched to our grandchildren. 
Debt reduction is structural and its benefits permanent. 
They point out that this is why Canada is a safe place to invest. 
They are right when they say that abroad. 
I would just like to hear them say it more often at home.  
We have balanced debt reduction with tax relief. 
Responsible government means balancing the interest of taxpayers with the interest of the common good. 
For all of us that is what the 1999 budget achieves.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, congratulations to the member opposite. 
I listened carefully to his speech.  
I am referring to Nortel. 
Would the hon. member care to comment?  
All of those conditions have been created with public support.  
There is no doubt in my mind. 
To not take care and reduce the debt somewhat would be irresponsible. 
I would not be prepared to support such a notion.  
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
That has hindered families from making ends meet. 
The issue of disposable income should be hard to argue. 
It takes food off the table and clothes off of kids' backs.  
Would the member like to comment on some of those issues?  
Mr. Speaker, I certainly would like to comment.  
If he did his homework he would have to agree with that. 
There is real tax relief in this budget after bracket creep, as he mentions.  
We should be serious about tackling that.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Forgive me, but I must interrupt the hon. member. 
Certainly in talking about the time to debate these issues, the more time the better. 
Earlier on, an hon. member discussed a figure from the past. 
I believe it was the fellow who discovered America, Columbus. 
What we have is more like Dr. Livingstone in Africa. 
In any event, we will talk about the jungle of taxation in this budget. 
I will touch on some of the highlights. 
The two do not seem to jive. 
The time to start reducing spending is not once the downturn comes. 
The time to start spending reductions is when we have a vibrant, strong economy. 
People ask me if it is a good budget for them or a poor budget. 
My advice to them is always very simple. 
That is the bottom line for the average Canadian. 
The figures being thrown around by the government often do not tell the whole story.  
I talked about how some of this budget money is used.  
I assessed it on behalf of my constituents. 
That is a very poor way. 
That is insufficient for such an important industry.  
Some will ask for ideas on where to find some of that money. 
As Canadians we spend a lot of money on it every year.  
I ranch and have a hired man. 
That adds an absolutely unnecessary cost on to a business.  
We are wasting money duplicating what is a provincial responsibility. 
They are doing the best job that can be done. 
The government should repriorize its spending.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
There is another price that this country pays for its high tax regime. 
Where do they seek opportunity? 
Where will they get paid more? 
Where will they get taxed less? 
Where can they have the best quality of life?  
It is plain and simple.  
The CFIB also indicated where the concerns of the younger generation have been missed. 
Now we are asking the younger generation to bear the burden of that debt. 
It is our moral obligation.  
There are other reasons for us to pay down the debt. 
We will always be threatened with high taxes. 
We need broad based tax reduction. 
I know people who are capable of lowering taxes. 
The government likes to take credit for balancing the budget. 
It has been quite an ordeal. 
It has been a 15-year work in progress. 
That is very clear.  
If it was so wrong, why has the government not changed it? 
The reason the government has not changed it is simply because it works.  
The government is not going to do anything. 
It is passing the burden of the problems to the provinces. 
There are some investments to be made. 
I want to highlight one priority, the student debt level. 
I am extremely concerned about that.  
However, the province of New Brunswick was getting less money. 
I find that to be a travesty.  
It should have provided Canadians with the broad based tax relief which they rightfully deserve. 
I am particularly concerned about rural health care. 
That is a shame.  
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to ask a question of the member. 
It is nice to see him in the House today, wound up like he is. 
He must be speaking from the heart.  
We have an accumulated debt in this country of $580 billion. 
If it says that it is paying down the debt, it is not.  
Should we use the GST money to do that? 
I would like him to explain what happened.  
I know that was the intent of my hon. friend from the environment committee.  
First we have to look at the GST, which is a tax itself. 
It was a good thing to do, according to this government. 
Otherwise, it would have changed it. 
The past government lowered the debt as a percentage of GDP.  
To be quite honest, more should have been done and more needed to be done. 
We have a moral obligation to do it. 
We have a reason to do it from a productivity perspective.  
I will be very pleased to answer any questions.  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
I remember it well.  
The Liberals continued on and ran it up to $580 billion. 
It was the Reform Party that came here and caused them to change.  
The member talks about the GST replacing a hidden tax. 
People do not like it. 
Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to respond to my hon. colleague's question. 
In 1987 the Reform Party was formed. 
There is a little bit of history. 
In 1984 the deficit was approximately $40 billion. 
In 1987 the deficit was around $17 billion or $21 billion. 
The government was headed in a much more prudent fiscal direction in that regard. 
That was the Progressive Conservative government of the day. 
I am very sad to say that.  
I want to talk about very serious issues. 
The partisanship is not important. 
That is what we want to do. 
We want to make that commitment.  
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
They have left a record debt and a record deficit.  
The hon. member used the example of Mike Harris. 
We have slashed spending on education and research. 
We have slashed the social programs. 
This one is a bit of a lame duck.  
Whoops, I guess the hon. member actually forgot that. 
Next time hopefully I will get a tougher question.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
If you would please indicate when 10 minutes are up.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It was in fact the Romanow government in Saskatchewan. 
It is really a lesson in underachievement. 
More than half of that $21.5 billion was in the health care funding. 
We heard it this afternoon. 
That is what they want us and Canadians to remember about the budget. 
It is a one time fix that leaves us no further ahead.  
We cannot count on the government. 
Will next year's budget just be another corporate affair?  
There has been some conversation in this debate about the previous prime minister. 
That is not what they are saying behind closed doors.  
Members may ask why this is happening. 
There is plenty of evidence around to suggest that it is already happening.  
These policies are callous and unacceptable. 
We simply do not buy that. 
We have talked to the retirees. 
We have talked to the current employees. 
That is a message the government is not interested in hearing whatsoever.  
This amounts to a mere 0.2% of our gross domestic product.  
In conclusion, we are very concerned about the direction the country is going in. 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to the hon. member. 
I know one of his concerns is agriculture. 
I have a question for him on this.  
There are some real concerns. 
Agriculture is now the seventh leading sector in Canada. 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I see it is coming close to the end of the day. 
That party always seems to be more in favour of regulation and programs. 
We are dealing with the Budget Implementation Act. 
Certainly there are areas where we need tax relief. 
It has never happened in the last 30 odd years. 
We do need that but we also need good social programs.  
I would say Canadians are a bit schizophrenic. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The vote is deferred.  
CANADA ENDANGERED SPECIES PROTECTION ACT 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Does the House give its unanimous consent?  
Mr. Speaker, perhaps we might start this debate by asking ourselves the following questions:
Why are we in this predicament? 
Why does Canada have some 300 species which have been identified as being at risk?  
The next question is:
How do we protect the living spaces of endangered species? 
It seems quite clear by now that they must be protected. 
How to proceed in the federal system is a difficult question to answer. 
The possible answer to that is mirror legislation, which would work in the following way:
This approach is necessary because species do not know the meaning of borders. 
Other countries are beginning to take note of our lack of progress on this front. 
This kind of legislation is now becoming very urgent. 
The Canadian public is certainly very keen. 
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
Before colonization, it had 29 species of fauna that were unique in the world. 
Today, only three remain. 
The other 26 have disappeared, including the legendary dodo.  
Three years ago I visited Mauritius where I was born. 
Without habitat and the ecosystem there are no species and species disappear. 
This is what has been happening. 
We have been destroying the habitats and the ecosystems. 
There are 300 species at risk in this wonderful country of Canada.  
This is why this bill is so precious to us. 
It gives us the ability to protect the habitat. 
The bill is clear. 
I will finish my speech with the same analogy I started with. 
They were innumerable on Round Island. 
We must stop it. 
It sends a message, and sets a model for us.  
I congratulate my colleague. 
This is my fondest wish.  
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
Wildlife is an intrinsic part of the Canadian identity. 
We depend on a healthy environment for food and raw materials. 
A vibrant ecosystem cleans our air, purifies our water and nourishes our farm lands.  
Despite my efforts I still have no answers.  
It is even given specific mention in our blue book. 
The United States endangered species act has been a complete failure. 
These individuals should be our first line of defence. 
It ignored stewardship initiatives in favour of government programs. 
The bill broadsides the rights of private property owners. 
This means working with landowners instead of working against them. 
It means including them in decisions affecting their lands. 
It means offering them compensation if their land is affected.  
Incentives can be used by the government to encourage and reward responsible stewardship practices. 
Science should be kept above politics by all means. 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
The purpose of this bill is to protect wildlife species at risk. 
Also, no person shall destroy its residence, its den or its nest. 
Those who contravene the act will face heavy fines and penalties.  
Bill C-441 directly threatens the provinces' jurisdiction in environmental matters. 
The Minister of the Environment still has discretionary power.  
The bill validates interference by federal government. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
I would like to thank the member for Davenport for an excellent bill. 
The bill before us reflects the hon. member's vision. 
Canadians have told the government to act. 
Since then, your government has abandoned this principle in two ways. 
This is a vision which has protection and recovery as its purpose. 
This is a specific reference to the role of citizens and communities.  
Throughout the interpretation section the definitions are good. 
Consultations with stakeholders are ensured. 
This means effective protection, prevention and recovery. 
The proposed recovery and management plans are based on realistic terms. 
They represent a conscientious approach that includes the necessity for public buy-in. 
There is a requirement for landowners' needs and concerns to be addressed and considered.  
On the international stage Canada is falling behind. 
The United States has had this legislation for 25 years. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
In 1992 Canada signed the International Convention on Biodiversity. 
Sadly, six years later we were without any legislation. 
It is soon to be seven years.  
They are Ontario, New Brunswick, Quebec and Manitoba.  
We wonder why it is taking so long. 
The solution is simple. 
Bill C-441 proves it can be done. 
It protected species on federal lands only. 
That was a tragedy. 
I know firsthand about lengthy review processes of a bill. 
We just endured six months of reviewing the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. 
Bill C-441 certainly does. 
Allow me to say it again. 
This is the approach the Canadian Nature Federation has taken. 
It will set a standard for the provinces to achieve.  
We also need to ensure that we are rewarding stewardship activities. 
It is far more effective than outright control of private property. 
It is something that should be included.  
The American law is strong but ineffective. 
We do not want the same thing to happen in Canada.  
I regret to interrupt the hon. member, but his time has expired.  
I should advise the House that when he speaks, he will close the debate.  
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
However the fact remains that birds and animals do not understand political jurisdictions.  
There are also animals that do not respect provincial boundaries.  
It seems we have a consensus that is rather encouraging. 
(The House adjourned at 6.30 p.m.)
