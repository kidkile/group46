EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 30 
Friday, November 7, 1997 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
Motion No. 1 will be debated and voted upon.  
Motions Nos. 2, 4 and 6 will be grouped for debate. 
Motions Nos. 3 and 5 will be grouped for debate. 
I shall now propose Motion No. 1 to the House.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC) moved: 
Time was certainly of the essence. 
Of all the witnesses, he made a statement which I found quite startling. 
That is not to say that his opinion could not be wrong. 
A great part of this country is spread out in rural areas. 
Police officers are often working out of one or two person detachments. 
I want to add to that the necessity of the resources. 
The resources have to go cheek and jowl with the ability to get these warrants. 
I would emphasize the remarks I made at the outset. 
This amendment is one that all members of the House should consider and support. 
I speak in favour of this amendment. 
Unfortunately, only one was received in committee. 
There was no discussion by the opposition on these motions. 
The deadline was imposed on us by the supreme court. 
It was not a deadline that we imposed on this House.  
Second, there was ample time. 
None of these motions was brought forward. 
The opposition members decided to bring them forward in the House.  
We do not know whether this will be declared unconstitutional. 
I think that is an assumption that should not have been made.  
The government is not able to support motion No. 1. 
This affects the very notion of practicability. 
That is why we have the Interpretation Act. 
The Interpretation Act already provides that the singular includes the plural. 
It would make the interpretation of other statutes more difficult and uncertain in the future.  
On Motion No 3, we are not able to support this motion either. 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
The ruling was made on May 22, 1997, in the middle of the electoral campaign. 
I will deal with the amendments in each group. 
I will speak very briefly on the first group, which includes Motion No. 1. 
The section, which is very clear, says the following: 
That is why we will oppose Motion No. 1 as presented.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
I thought there had been an understanding to dispose of this matter by today. 
Now it appears that technically speaking that was not the case. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The parliamentary secretary is getting a little ahead of us. 
At the moment, we are dealing with Group No. 1, Motion No. 1. 
We will go on to the next ones after that.  
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I declare the motion lost on division.  
(Motion No. 1 negatived) 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Motions Nos. 2, 4 and 6 will be grouped for debate.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC) moved: 
That Bill C-16, in Clause 3, be amended by 
(a) replacing line 27 on page 7 with the following: 
(b) replacing line 29 on page 7 with the following: 
(d) replacing line 36 on page 7 with the following: 
(b) replacing line 23 on page 8 with the following: 
``enter the dwelling house or houses for the purpose of ar-'' 
It gives the police more flexibility in their ability to investigate. 
It is a very straightforward amendment. 
I would be surprised if the government were not quick to embrace it.  
This was done after the fact.  
This causes me great concern.  
I put this amendment forward in all god faith and in all seriousness. 
I encourage hon. members of the House to look at it. 
I have tried to explain it in a very straightforward way. 
I am not looking for sympathy from the opposition members. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I will not speak more than a few moments. 
The Liberals had six months. 
They knew it was coming but they have left it to the 11th hour. 
I want to register my objection to the process here.  
We did not have the opportunity at committee to introduce a lot of these amendments. 
I support the amendments that are being made. 
The government is dismissing them at hand because they come from the opposition. 
I do not think that is acceptable. 
It is happening again and again.  
We could have done this months ago. 
That is not the case. 
There is precedent that there can be extensions. 
A request could have been made to the supreme court quite simply. 
That is my point of clarification.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
It is too broad and too vague. 
rejected by the courts as in the Feeney case. 
This is our only reason for opposing these three motions.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The division on Motion No. 2 stands deferred. 
Motions Nos. 3 and 5 will be grouped for debate.  
I rise on a point of order, Madam Speaker. I have two points. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I will now deal with the point of order raised by the other hon. member.  
The decision has been taken. 
Madam Speaker, I would also concur with the hon. member from the Bloc. 
Also, we would like to voice our objection to the ruling of the Chair.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
We are 10 minutes away from question period. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Let us get on with it. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
I happen to share the view that you heard differently than I heard. 
Perhaps they would have risen anyway. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
We shall proceed to Motion No. 3.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC) moved: 
``or a person with the following description (-),'' 
I am certainly prepared to agree to that suggestion by the parliamentary secretary.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, again members are challenging your ruling. 
I think there are some things going on this morning that are unacceptable.  
Look at what has happened during discussion of the previous motion. 
The government forced a vote and challenged the ruling. 
Now it is challenging it again.  
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is the House in agreement with the suggestions from the whip of the government?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
It being 11 a.m., we will now proceed to statements by members.  
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Burning coal is highly damaging to the environment and human health. 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
This is a community which has faced up to difficult times with great success. 
The citizens of Havelock are an example to us all. 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
Revenue Canada has a major taxation centre in Jonquiere. 
It is high time these employees get their due.  
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
The hon. member for Miramichi.  
Mr. Charles Hubbard (Miramichi, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is Veterans Week. 
Five days later he was the only surviving officer in the company. 
That August he was promoted to company commander. 
He returned to Canada with the North Shore regiment in 1946.  
The hon. member for Nanaimo-Alberni.  
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
My father was one of those men. 
No words can convey that to anyone.  
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Vaughan-King-Aurora, Lib.):
All across Canada we stop, we remember. 
Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma-Manitoulin, Lib.):
Future generations deserve our best efforts.  
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
But she laughs and sometimes she cries. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to draw the attention of the house to Project Loophole. 
The case is to be heard later this month.  
Choices is to be commended for pursuing this issue. 
It is no surprise really. 
The ordinary Canadian will be getting his or her CPP reduced and their public services- 
The hon. member for Brandon-Souris.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
However, for ordinary Canadians things just got a little rougher. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
We do not think there is an excuse for these numbers. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Who are Canadians to believe, the finance minister or his chief actuary?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
If further action is necessary it will be taken.  
We want to protect future generations. 
We want to make sure they have a safe and secure pension at reasonable cost. 
This is our commitment and we will achieve it.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.  
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
For once, does the government intend- 
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
When will the minister put an end to this scandalous misappropriation of public funds?  
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not share the opinions of my hon. colleague in the opposition.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Month to month fluctuations in employment estimates are not unusual. 
We have to look at the long term trend in employment over longer periods.  
We will continue to ensure that the employment numbers improve. 
The government is committed to that.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Just let these policies work''.  
These policies have been in place and they are not working. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Statistics Canada recently reported that the jobs are here. 
The help wanted index is going up. 
It is the highest it has been in seven years.  
The numbers will improve in the future. 
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the government which is in denial on unemployment. 
It continues to spout numbers.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
It is our intention to continue to do so. 
The hon. member for Sherbrooke.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
We have not been raising unemployment insurance premiums. 
We have been reducing them. 
No wonder they were destroyed.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the government is looking forward to the report of Judge Krever.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, those are very reassuring words.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is presuming response.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
I am quite prepared to do so. 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the countdown to Kyoto is on. 
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Reform has been exhibiting a severe weather fluctuation in this House. 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, there seems to be some confusion. 
What the Reform Party is demanding is what Canadians are demanding.  
Canadians want real solutions to the environment, not new taxes.  
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the question.  
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
We are also speaking with the other departments of government, namely revenue and finance. 
These departments are also involved in this issue.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
The question is out of order. 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
How many Liberal organizers does a region need in order to- 
The hon. member for Longueuil.  
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the President of the Treasury Board.  
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is addressed to the Minister of National Revenue.  
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
I assure Canadians that small business is very important. 
We all know it is small businesses that are generating the jobs in this economy. 
We are committed to small business, to ensuring that we help- 
The hon. member for Surrey Central.  
CANADIAN INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCY 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
What is the government afraid of, the watchdog- 
The hon. secretary of state.  
Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, CIDA has a very transparent open bidding system to award contracts.  
If the hon. member has other information, we invite him to come forward. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. secretary does not know that. 
CIDA's accountability, transparency, reputation and credibility are in question.  
Why does the minister refuse to use those auditors who are trained in Canada?  
Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific), Lib.):
The bidding system has been open and transparent.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is to the deputy prime minister.  
How can he say that?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we reject the premise of the hon. member's question.  
They are designed to respect the needs of women and people with families.  
We reject the approach of the Reform Party which wants to destroy that system.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, give me a break. 
No impact study has every been done. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Therefore, the concerns of my hon. friend have been taken into account. 
We believe they have been taken into account. 
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
The government has a major program under way to do that.  
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I certainly appreciate the sentiment of the hon. member. 
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
Albertans have led the way by electing their first senator in 1989.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Minister of Labour.  
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour, Lib.):
We are going to address many problems in this bill.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Every 17 minutes a sexual assault is committed somewhere in Canada. 
One in four women will be sexually abused at some point in her life. 
We are in the process of studying these proposals.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Farmers are seeking emergency relief.  
Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for the question.  
I am sure he will get an answer back from the minister of agriculture.  
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
Every year in Canada, it creates up to 10,000 full time, high quality jobs.  
This program provides assistance to 10,000 businesses. 
They come from 140 organizations across Canada. 
This program is especially designed for young people.  
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
Canadians were pretty shocked by that comment. 
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
We have already allocated $1.3 billion for settlement of this question. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
However at-sea conditions resulted in a very substantial reduction. 
It is a major matter of concern for the government. 
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
I congratulate all the parties involved because it was difficult. 
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
The medicare patchwork is becoming threadbare''. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
On a point of order, the hon. government whip, or, excuse me, Reform whip.  
One day, perhaps, Mr. Speaker. 
MEMBER FOR DEWDNEY-ALOUETTE 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
Amendments to the Constitution should never be passed without due consideration or in haste. 
We have come to the conclusion that the motion does not meet these requirements.  
Is the appropriate amending formula being used? 
Most witnesses we have heard therefore took it for granted.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Is the member reading the report or tabling the report? 
I think he is taking too long to table the report. 
He seems to be reading it.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. parliamentary secretary is correct. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their consent. 
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
We have agreed to report it without amendment.  
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):
Indeed for too long, in fact forever, Canadians have been shut out of this debate.  
They do not give a speech about it.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. parliamentary secretary is quite correct. 
Mr. Speaker, I will describe the bill.  
OBSERVANCE OF TWO MINUTES OF SILENCE ON REMEMBRANCE DAY ACT 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House to move the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House to move the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have three brief petitions to present today.  
The first one has to do with the family. 
LABELLING OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the second petition has to do with alcohol misuse.  
PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS COMPENSATION FUND 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
GOODS AND SERVICES TAX 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
We would certainly go on record as endorsing those three petitions. 
Perhaps I can ask the same of my hon. friend.  
They also ask Parliament to zero rate books, magazines and newspapers under the GST. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the second petition is a large one. 
I agree with their sentiment. 
They are asking Parliament to simply eliminate section 745.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I suggest that all questions be allowed to stand.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
On a point of order, the hon. chief government, the whip of the official opposition.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
None of us on this side of the House want to hold that up.  
That is what happens when this stuff is pushed through.  
I said as much in committee. 
I want to repeat it here again today. 
It is wrong, wrong, wrong. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
I too very much regret that we have to do what we are doing.  
I think this needs to be understood as an aberration. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Therefore the House has already expressed its desire to see this legislation proceed.  
The concerns of the hon. whip of the official opposition are noted.  
Accordingly, is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That is a very wise clarification. 
It is to revert to the motion as put by the whip.  
Is there unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
(Motion No. 2 negatived) 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I declare the motion defeated on division. 
I therefore declare Motions Nos. 4 and 6 defeated.  
Debate is on Motion No. 3. 
Resuming debate, the hon. member for Berthier-Montcalm.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I will be very brief. 
There will be a separate vote on these motions.  
So it is not necessary to give all those details. 
We will vote against Motion No. 3.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The question is on Motion No. 3.  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
(Motion No. 3 negatived) 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I declare the motion defeated on division.  
Resuming debate on Motion No. 5.  
Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
There is still judicial discretion. 
So there are sufficient safeguards in place.  
I do not want to speak at length. 
The proposed amendment is very straightforward. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The question is on Motion No. 5. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Chair, not hearing any nays, declares the motion carried.  
(Motion No. 5 agreed to) 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
When shall the bill be read the third time? 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of clarification. 
Are we presently engaging in debate on third reading?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It is in essence pro Canadian. 
I say this with a great deal of confidence. 
The protection of individual rights is also significant. 
What was the response from the traditional party leaders at the federal and provincial levels? 
The country is still here.  
I want to briefly touch on that symbolic recognition. 
I want to briefly discuss the precedent. 
This is truly tragic. 
That is exactly what did happen.  
We will visit that in due course. 
I think we remember them well. 
No province would ever use the notwithstanding clause. 
The political price of using it would be too great for any province. 
But of course they were wrong.  
Still, some negative fallout was incurred by the Quebec government on the issue. 
Actually the question is rhetorical because we all know the answer. 
No messy or unpalatable use of a notwithstanding clause. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Unanimous consent is denied.  
We want to proceed with national reconciliation. 
We believe the Calgary declaration is an important step in that direction.  
The first two clauses of the Calgary declaration are devoted to it.  
The principle of equality is at the heart of our identity. 
We are also in agreement with respect to the equality status of the provinces. 
There are not two or three types of status for provinces. 
In the Canadian federation, provinces have equal status. 
All provinces can exercise the same powers. 
Only Quebec has exercised its constitutional right to set up its own pension plan. 
The other provinces are covered by the Canada pension plan.  
Equalization is another example. 
That does not mean that inequalities are being created among the provinces. 
That will never be the policy of the Liberal Party of Canada.  
The government, however, rejects the one size fits all approach. 
Simply put, in no way.  
The Calgary declaration is not a constitutional amendment. 
It is a statement of principles. 
And whatever helps the cause will receive our support.  
This is why we support the Calgary declaration. 
I believe that is what Canadians believe.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
The signing did take place, however. 
If there is one area that comes under Quebec jurisdiction this is it. 
This is nothing new. 
Since 1982, we have had premiers in Quebec who were federalists and even Liberals. 
What were the five conditions?  
Second, guaranteeing a more prominent role regarding immigration.  
Third, allowing Quebec to participate in the appointment of supreme court justices.  
Fourth, limiting the federal government's spending power. 
We know what happened to the Meech Lake accord. 
English Canada felt Quebec was getting way too much. 
What became of the Charlottetown accord? 
Then there was the Calgary accord. 
The focus shifted to unique character. 
Distinct society was no longer of interest. 
This historic fact must be recognized. 
There must be recognition of the fact that Quebec forms a people. 
No, no and no.  
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Gradually, however, I realized that this is not exactly the case. 
This seems blatantly obvious to me.  
Let us take a normal family, an ordinary family. 
Certain collective rights must be defended. 
We are not asking for privileges. 
I was listening to my colleague from the government. 
Mr. Speaker, you are a reasonable man. 
Do you remember the Meech Lake accord in 1990? 
Our government was in power and Mr. Mulroney was the Prime Minister. 
God knows he cannot be blamed for working toward reconciliation.  
I believe this is the situation in which we find ourselves at the moment.  
What divides and separates us is very minor. 
A solution could be found very quickly. 
Yesterday, I talked to people from the education community. 
I ask Reformers to adopt a more comprehensive view of things. 
The worst enemies of the kind of partnership everyone wants are the extremists. 
I do not believe that. 
This is the great challenge facing Canada.  
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):
All democracies make constitutional changes from time to time. 
Let us do a little what if experiment together. 
This desire to affirm cultural and regional identities is seen around the world. 
I am proud to come from Ontario.  
We can harmonize it easily with the equality of status of the provinces.  
Equality of status must not be confused with uniform treatment. 
We have not become a tolerant country by accident. 
Our diversity is a strength and a defining characteristic of our country. 
We all know that Canada is a remarkable human success. 
We all must work hard each and every day to keep it united. 
Every one of us can play a role in that regard.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin-Middlesex-London, Lib.):
It was a great honour to be re-elected. 
They want some understanding that they can have a minimum of protection in the Constitution. 
I explained this to people in St. Thomas. 
If I go to an American movie, again, it is not a cultural issue. 
It is at that level that they feel they need some protection. 
They are after recognition, which the Calgary declaration does an adequate job of providing. 
It recognizes Quebec as being unique. 
For me, it is really about semantics. 
It really does not matter. 
That will basically give them the two anchors of any constitutional change. 
They need recognition and they also need a regional veto.  
It matters not to him that the people in Quebec want to speak French. 
He says that is a perfectly legitimate thing.  
We can all understand that. 
We are proud of our heritage. 
We are proud of what our ancestors did regardless of our ethnic backgrounds. 
In Quebec they feel particularly threatened and they want to see it protected. 
I think we should support that.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The time for Private Members' Business is at its end. 
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
Surely that is what part of this was all about.  
Equality certainly does not mean uniformity. 
No one in his right mind would think that. 
We in this country are a very diverse people. 
Sooner or later it will unravel and there will be no country at all. 
I was born a Canadian, I will die a Canadian.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House adjourned at 1.54 p.m.)
