EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 17 
Tuesday, October 21, 1997 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
The sooner we act on that the better.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
It is shameful and it is not right.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
The petitioners are very concerned about the pricing of gasoline in this country. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
This group of people are very concerned about the unity of our country. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
It has to deal with the issue of age of consent.  
I support their goal.  
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would like to apologize to the House. 
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Is there unanimous consent?  
There is no consent.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Is there unanimous consent?  
There is no consent.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP) moved: 
The motion has been read into the record. 
That is not only a national disgrace, it is a national tragedy.  
The use of fossil fuels would be reduced to protect our environment.  
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
I would like to ask her a couple of questions. 
Is it true that she indeed is quite wealthy? 
Mr. Speaker, I find the member's question truly astounding. 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
We should give credit where it is due. 
We have seen what happened in the province of Ontario from 1990 to 1995. 
I would ask the member to respond.  
The hon. member for Halifax for a brief reply.  
Let me say briefly two things.  
Yes it is true that Ontario was reeling. 
Mr. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Officially 9% of the Canadian population is unemployed. 
Our challenge is to figure out ways to put these people back to work.  
I will say at the outset that I am an optimist. 
We have an opportunity now. 
We have turned the corner in terms of the fiscal crisis in the country. 
This is the challenge and that is what we have to do.  
This is a national disgrace.  
But at least there was a plan, there was a goal and a timetable. 
We have this great inflation demon raising its head again. 
What the government is going to do is cool down the economy. 
It has already raised interest rates twice this year. 
This is extremely important.  
It did not have to happen. 
Instead we need more money spent on health and education. 
We have to restore transfers to the provinces in these important areas. 
We also need a sensible targeted tax cut.  
These are some of the things that need to be done.  
That is a way of creating jobs. 
Those are some things that can be done.  
We have a great opportunity. 
We have turned the page. 
Canadians want a strong government that tries to correct inequities. 
They want a strong government that supports social programs and social spending. 
Mr. Speaker, I have a series of questions for my colleague.  
He mentioned a number of proposals.  
I do not say that facetiously or tongue in cheek. 
Perhaps he would answer those questions.  
Mr. Speaker, I will take these questions very briefly in reverse order.  
Again the provincial government tried to backfill some of it.  
One reason for it is investment in social programs.  
Recently Saskatchewan is the first province in the country to balance its budget. 
That happened three or four years ago. 
Now I will go to the banks. 
I will make one final point. 
That would be a very positive thing for the government to do.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
When the government took office we had a deficit of $42 billion. 
In the last year we have been able to pay that down by $11 billion. 
In the first nine months of this year we have created 279,000 new jobs. 
This is the pay-off for what we have introduced.  
I am very sympathetic to NDPers when they talk about the need for jobs. 
They are telling us that we have to set targets. 
They cannot do retrofits. 
Are they talking about increased tax incentives for these funds?  
They talked about further tax cuts. 
They also said ``Let inflation go, just let it go. 
We do not have to worry about inflation''. 
How do we get high interest rates? 
By allowing inflation to go amok. 
We are never going to allow Canada to go that way again. 
We are going to keep interest rates low by managing the economy sensibly. 
We have looked at this. 
Do members know who the net losers would be? 
We are not unmindful of the need to keep fighting to get unemployment down. 
That is why we have taken recent measures. 
We are conscious of how that has to be done.  
We are criticized by the NDP in terms of culture. 
We are going to continue our responsible course. 
We are not going to inflate ourselves into joblessness and high interest rates. 
Let us finish the job.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Which province probably has the longest waiting list for hip surgeries? 
Saskatchewan. Which province has cut more beds per capita than any other province? 
The following statistics just came in. 
Already this year that highway has claimed seven lives unnecessarily. 
That same small stretch of untwinned highway has claimed 38 serious accidents. 
In Saskatchewan alone these are the facts and no one can get around it.  
I will leave that with hon. members. 
The minister has one minute to respond.  
I am not sure if that is parliamentary. 
It is a very polite word for lying. 
I wonder if you would check the record, Mr. Speaker- 
It is the one program we have that is universal.  
We will defend those principles in every way possible. 
Canadians do not have to worry about that. 
We are not a Reform government. 
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
The leader herself seemed a bit agitated. 
However, I make no apology for asking the question on behalf of my constituents.  
I am a great believer in not putting up with rumours that go around. 
I would rather go to the source and ask for actual information. 
That is what I did today.  
I am pleased that the member had a chance to put something on the record. 
I thank her very much for doing that.  
Why don't you apologize?  
I hear a member opposite saying that I should apologize. 
Let me make that very clear. 
I express in the House opinions from all sides of the spectrum. 
Those who were here in the last Parliament will know that. 
I see that as my duty.  
I think that is something that we really need to remember here. 
I did mention the NDP government in Ontario. 
There is a famous company in my area of the country. 
It is disguising what the truth is about fuel cells. 
It is only half the story.  
Yet no one asks the question. 
You can't have your cake and eat it too. 
It ends up creating jobs.  
Surely we do not need to change the rules. 
I think the credit unions are already trying to do that. 
They have managed to increase the number of jobs in health care tremendously. 
We could certainly benefit from the experiences of those countries.  
I realize my time has expired. 
I look forward to perhaps being part of questions and comments later in the day.  
Mr. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
The Devine government was a soulmate of the Reform party. 
That is sheer hypocrisy.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question.  
We saw the same thing happen with the Mulroney government. 
That is the reason the Reform party is here. 
Liberal-Tory, same old story. 
They were all the same. 
That is one of the reasons the Reform party came into being. 
We were the ones who made it fashionable to get government spending under control.  
I hear the Liberal members across praising what the government has achieved. 
Those same members a decade ago were saying exactly the opposite. 
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
When one has revenue coming in one knows what the revenues are. 
When one knows one's expenses one knows how to set realistic targets. 
It creates unemployment instead.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Today, the surplus is $12 billion. 
I believe, in this connection, this will be a worthwhile motion.  
In this connection, when the NDP states that it condemns the federal government for: 
The same sort of criticism has been made by the other provincial premiers.  
The current rate of unemployment in Canada is not acceptable. 
The Speech from the Throne was rather significant in this respect.  
However, we came to realize that this philosophy did not work at all.  
When it comes to the areas of health and education, the provinces are the experts. 
I hope that the government is listening to this motion.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, thank you for recognizing me so quickly.  
The same head cannot be counted twice. 
You can only count one person once.  
In fact, his is a clear example of the unacceptable disparity.  
Now the requirement is 910 hours. 
The difference between the two is 610 hours. 
You gave a specific example. 
That was the reason they set the kitchens up. 
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I am certainly pleased to speak on this issue.  
It is kind of like a time machine. 
In the 1997 election every single Liberal member of Parliament was defeated. 
All social aspects were hit. 
There is no strategy. 
There is no job training of any consistency to help people. 
It is not only unemployment but there are cuts to health care. 
We have band-aid solutions. 
They have bypassed the tendering system. 
There is patronage and favouritism. 
Forty people have died on that highway. 
Well, I do not think it is going to work.  
I believe it is false economy. 
It will create an interprovincial trade barrier. 
In my region all employment is done by small business. 
There are no large employers, no giant international corporations. 
It is all done by small business. 
The overcharge on employment insurance is costing jobs. 
There have been all sorts of delays. 
We cannot imagine the stress on this poor woman. 
We cannot imagine the frustration and the fear which this lady has. 
This just should not be.  
The doctor's report said ``Marjorie Newman is totally disabled and unable to work''. 
Here is another example which I find shocking. 
This case concerns Archie Black. 
He lives in a place called Shenimecas in my riding. 
I have known him all my life. 
He comes from a long line of dedicated, hard working people. 
He can no longer work. 
He wants to work. 
We cannot imagine the mental anguish and stress which have been placed on this man. 
All of these things indicate the philosophy of the Liberal government. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to the hon. member for Cumberland-Colchester. 
I would simply ask him to consider the evidence. 
Low interest rates and accelerating job opportunities. 
They embraced it again and in our part of the country they enhanced it. 
The low inflation policy was started by the Conservative government. 
That is a policy which was carried over. 
We started that and I am really proud of it.  
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or, NDP):
Today I rise in favour of the motion. 
These are the people of Bras d'Or.  
We fought for decades to make conditions better for the workers in our communities. 
And cope we did. 
We are not asking for special favours from the government. 
We have had many promises from the government. 
We had a promise that education would be made a priority. 
We were promised a fair deal on taxes. 
We were promised accessible health care. 
That is not something I am saying to inflame the members of the government. 
This is the human side of the government's action. 
It would create meaningful jobs in Canada.  
It would create meaningful jobs in Canada.  
It would create meaningful jobs in Canada.  
It would create meaningful jobs in Canada.  
It would create meaningful jobs in Canada.  
Support a national strategy for research treatment and prevention of AIDS. 
It would create meaningful jobs in Canada.  
What is it going to be? 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
I represent a riding which is not very well off. 
A lot of people are looking for government assistance and are on government assistance.  
However, the evidence is to the contrary. 
It is going to create jobs that are there but are not meaningful jobs.  
What is important for the economy is to reduce the deficit. 
I have business experience. 
That is where we will excel in the job training aspect by retraining our youth. 
It is not going to make a big dent in the unemployment rate. 
I share the view that we should bring the unemployment rate down. 
Our fundamental difference is that the NDP is asking for spending and we are not. 
We are asking for a climate to create jobs.  
My colleague is saying that they are not important jobs. 
That is the problem.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
In 1876 we had the first version of the Indian Act. 
This was not done with any consultation with the aboriginal peoples.  
The Indians are no longer lords of the Prairies.  
Five tribes with different languages compose the Indian population.  
The study of Indian languages is interesting and indicates their different characteristics.  
Father Hugonard relayed the words of Chief Piapot.  
Do not go there: and those berries were made for us. 
The white people were using our wood, our hay and killing game. 
Buffalo meat was replaced by bacon. 
It was this sick kind of belief that has resulted in the problems we have. 
Seasonal workers are abundant in our communities. 
That has not been the case for aboriginal people.  
We must remove all the hindrances, poverty, poor housing. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
It is the prospect of high inflation that pushes interest rates up.  
That is irresponsible government. 
These are not abstract achievements. 
The proof is clear and concrete.  
They have been below U.S. rates since February. 
That is performance which is unprecedented in Canada's post-war history.  
What makes this so important? 
People are buying new houses. 
That means plants being built and people being hired.  
Since the beginning of this year 279,000 new jobs have been created. 
That is the economic plan at work.  
The hon. member goes on to condemn this government about being obsessed with future inflation. 
Inflation takes time to build a head of steam. 
Hon. members talk about pain and suffering. 
In other words, we did not need to cut any government spending. 
There are some real problems with this myopic and partisan analysis.  
It is always hoped that we would do better. 
That is a real bottom line benefit to beating our targets.  
We recognize that unemployment remains tragically high and that we have to do more. 
It is a commitment of the government. 
It was an important part of the finance minister's update last week.  
It presents new challenges and responsibilities for government. 
That is what we are committed to do. 
That is the road we are constructing. 
That is the destination we will help Canadians reach. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
The Minister of Finance also lacks compassion. 
Over 200 workers would have been eligible under POWA. 
The program was not perfect of course, but it was a safety mechanism.  
People in the riding of Frontenac-Megantic want to see the minister. 
Strangely enough, he is no longer available. 
But now, it is impossible to talk to him. 
He is silent as the grave. 
The minister shows no sign of compassion toward these workers.  
He should visit the regions. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the question. 
I will repeat the answer for the benefit of the member. 
I hope I can be very clear.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Something considered undoable has been done. 
It is confidence built on hope and expectation. 
It is confidence built on solid performance and optimism.  
Canadians have waited a long time. 
Interest rates are at their lowest in historic terms. 
Housing starts and resales have rebounded. 
Consumer goods enjoy strong sales throughout the land. 
Business investments are surging. 
The negative psychology of even a few years ago is dissipating. 
In short, our economy is in remarkable shape. 
We need to ensure they will have the best opportunities available.  
Canada has such a huge potential, such a great future.  
Arm in arm we will move forward together. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I found the address just delivered rather exciting and interesting. 
The vision of Canada the gentleman portrayed is a very good one.  
I am sure he knows the minister very well and supports him.  
He makes quite a list here. 
I would like the hon. member to please address that question.  
Mr. Speaker, I want to first thank the member opposite for the question. 
I am very glad that he would make that point on my behalf. 
I was particularly interested in the question with respect to the infrastructure program. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to split my time with the member for Kelowna.  
I do not know how flower power is going to put people back to work. 
The sixties are over. 
Seniors in Kamloops or Burnaby would not be in favour of buying million dollar paintings. 
The party that some of these people voted for is. 
Then I look across to the Liberal benches. 
Once again I will lay out the problem and talk about the lack of solutions.  
For every single average working Canadian in the country it means $700. 
Economics 101 is that payroll taxes kill jobs. 
They talk about how they care, but they do not. 
They have a higher deficit. 
They have higher taxes. 
That is what will kill their opportunities when they go into the job market. 
The government fundamentally misunderstands what it is doing.  
People who were unemployed voted for the Liberals. 
Farmers in Saskatchewan voted for the NDP. 
This will not help unemployed fishers. 
It will not help farmers in Saskatchewan and it will not help seniors.  
How can they brag about a $10 billion tax?  
Only a Liberal could be proud of a record like that. 
Where is the fairness in that? 
I do not know.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That is a point of clarification for Canadians.  
The government members of the day made promises on the stumps back in 1966. 
That is according to their own numbers. 
The Fraser Institute puts it at a trillion dollars. 
Split the difference somewhere in between or cut it down the middle. 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
They are not saving up a rainy day slush fund. 
Liberals should open up their ears and pay attention. 
They should be telling this to the finance minister. 
They should be pleading with him on behalf of their constituents. 
They should be asking for a payroll tax cut. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
The motion demonstrates a deep concern about the shortcomings of the government.  
Unemployment is at an unreasonably high level and it has been sustained. 
Hopefully their children will have a better standard of living than what they enjoy.  
Under the current regime that is not likely to take place. 
Thirty-eight tax increases have now taken place.  
It is not primarily the natural resources although they help. 
What is it then that the government ought to be concerned about? 
It ought to be concerned about creating jobs. 
There is ample evidence that by increasing taxes the government is doing the exact opposite. 
In 1991 John Engler took power in the state of Michigan. 
That is something the government could be proud of.  
How did he achieve that? 
Since 1991 Engler has instituted 21 tax cuts. 
That is the exact opposite to what has happened in Canada. 
We have had 38 tax increases.  
There is ample evidence for that. 
Isn't it beautiful to cut taxes?  
How can that be done? 
They know where it ought to be spent. 
That ought to be our number one concern.  
I sympathize with the NDP when it says that we ought to create employment. 
Its solution is to give more money to these people through taxes. 
It would create dependent people. 
It would not solve anything.  
The money should be left in the hands of the people. 
They will spend it wisely. 
It would even make NDPers richer.  
He has ample evidence all around him to show that is the case.  
I have anecdotal evidence of my own. 
I want to put this into perspective. 
It is not good for Canada. 
Payroll taxes ought to be cut. 
That would be a solution to the unemployment problem.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
It is not their fault if they are not working. 
In the meantime, I will ask my colleague a question. 
That is where the problem lies. 
There were eleven children in my own family. 
We know what that is all about.  
What would the result be, if the Reform Party were in power? 
That is precisely what the Reform Party is all about. 
That is what we are all about. 
We want to create the environment so that people will be able to perform.  
I have never said that. 
I have never intimated it. 
I have never even suggested that. 
That is absolutely false. 
He should take it back immediately. 
Where there is a crisis that has to be addressed.  
What we are talking about are the long term solutions as well. 
We need both, not just one. 
We need a balanced approach. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am sharing my time with the member for Thornhill.  
Fiscal policy has to do with keeping accounts balanced. 
This is why the Soviet Union collapsed. 
You have to keep your house in order. 
I had occasion to test the Canadian public's opinion on this issue. 
Rockton is a little village community of 150 people. 
The fair has been going since 1853 and styles itself the Rockton World's Fair. 
It is among the top 10 fairs in Ontario. 
My riding is rural and suburban. 
Nearby is Hamilton which has principally urban people. 
An enormous mixture of people come to the Rockton fair.  
I always have a booth at the Rockton fair so people can meet the MP. 
If they have complaints they can make them directly to me. 
It expects to eliminate the deficit in the next year. 
I placed four jars on the table in front of my booth. 
I had another tin that said surplus. 
I said ``Pretend you are Paul Martin and this is $4 billion. 
They would hesitate here and there.  
Five hundred and twenty-five people took part in my poll. 
There were people from all over the region. 
I would like to give the results of the poll. 
The following day the numbers were similar: 341, 208, 160 and 126. 
The correct course of government is to get the debt down. 
Then there will be more money to spend on social spending. 
We, as Liberals, have to be very concerned in maintaining the social safety net. 
This is where we differ so enormously from the Reform. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
The member talks about the debt and the deficit. 
There are three major causes. 
The first cause, of course, is devastatingly high levels of unemployment. 
The second is interest rates. 
Historically, interest rates have been far too high. 
What do the Liberals have to say? 
They should heed the very thoughtful terms of this motion. 
Is this really revolutionary? 
That is what this motion says.  
The Liberal member says they have wrestled the deficit to the ground. 
The finance minister goes out and triumphantly says that the deficit is gone. 
Let us look at how we have arrived at this point.  
Has it been through equal sacrifice? 
Has it been through a sharing of the burden? 
Let us look at the casualties in the war against the deficit. 
They include the unemployed. 
Today approximately 40% are eligible.  
What has happened to the other Canadians, desperate people looking for work? 
What has happened to social assistance? 
The Liberal government has abolished the Canada assistance plan. 
National standards are gone entirely.  
Once again, poor people are casualties. 
Foreign aid has been shamefully cut. 
Aboriginal programs have also been casualties. 
Students have been casualties. 
An average graduating student carries a burden of something like $25,000.  
Research granting councils have been cut. 
Environmental programs have been cut savagely.  
This is certainly one government which has a heart and a conscience.  
The reality is the previous Conservative government overspent. 
The member opposite would create jobs out of a vacuum. 
It does not work that way. 
It just shows that we have our fiscal house in order, fiscal not monetary. 
Monetary has to do with funny money going across borders. 
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to participate in today's debate. 
There is more to do. 
We want people to have opportunities to maximize and achieve their potential. 
We want them to have the dignity of work. 
Where did this government begin? 
Where are we today as just announced by the finance minister? 
That is an incredible and enormous achievement. 
The assessment is not by those of us who sit in this House. 
It is not just by the Liberals. 
There are certain things that give us that competitive advantage. 
Those things are relatively new and some have been around for a while. 
They go hand in hand.  
This does not mean those jobs are not important. 
It means that government must tax in order to create jobs. 
Since 1993 we have seen over one million jobs created in this country. 
In this year alone 297,000 jobs have been created across the country. 
Of course it is not.  
Is that low enough? 
Canada will out perform all the G-7 nations. 
We are not there yet.  
They have tampered with medicare, killed medicare. 
If medicare is tampered with it kills jobs.  
That is the commitment of the government. 
There are two reasons. 
I shudder to think.  
In 1993 jobs were being lost, people were feeling insecure, people had no hope. 
Today Canadians are confident. 
It will be very difficult to respond to all of those demands.  
Canadians expect medicare to be preserved. 
That is my goal and the goal of the government. 
We want to create an opportunity for all in the country to prosper. 
It is misguided and irresponsible and out of touch with the realities of 1997.  
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Where is this wealth? 
It must be in the hands of those who control it. 
We are asking the government to stop.  
They should not have to do that. 
Let us stop putting the burden on the most vulnerable ones. 
It merely says: ``We are the best, we are the finest. 
We meet with world leaders. 
We go to Russia and bend over backwards''. 
Mr. Speaker, I will respond to my colleague in this way. 
Unemployment is still too high. 
Child poverty is a real issue. 
We will do it in a responsible way. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
They believe that what they say is true. 
I want to draw an analogy. 
In my youth I worked as a truck driver on the big rigs. 
I take the truck and phoned my boss and say I am doing fine. 
He says, ``Good, what time do you think you will get to Regina?'' 
I'm on the road. 
I'm going about 20 to 30 kilometres an hour but it is behind me.'' 
I keep on driving all day and the boss phones again. 
He says, ``Hey, you are supposed to go to Regina''. 
I tell him I will go a little faster.  
And these guys think they have- 
Perhaps the hon. member would like to respond.  
I heard no question. 
Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton, Lib.):
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
The competition bureau is also investigating.  
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, this week has been designated Amnesty International week.  
THE LATE SIMONE FLAHIFF 
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Simone was a challenging woman. 
She challenged all to be the best and applied the same standard to herself. 
Her crafts were legendary as was her cooking. 
Simone will be greatly missed by her son Terry, family and friends. 
Simone watched the daily question period and I know she is watching us today.  
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood-Assiniboine, Lib.):
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Many of these businesses relate to advances in computer and telecommunications technology. 
It is easier to sustain innovation and competitiveness. 
The government knows that the above is true. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
This universally significant initiative should be supported year round. 
A society with less violence is a desirable goal. 
We as parliamentarians should take a visible role in supporting initiatives such as this one. 
It is my hope that these students will leave Ottawa with a new and expanded- 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Our heartfelt thanks goes out to all these community association volunteers. 
Their commitment has not gone unnoticed and is very much appreciated.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
No, women are not persons in the full sense of the word under the government. 
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
This is a fine example of an initiative which is good for both countries.  
Projects such as this are a considerable boost for both nations.  
As a Manitoban I feel an added sense of pride.  
Ms. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
And now we begin to see what lurks beneath the surface.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
It is now read throughout the world every year on Remembrance Day. 
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
My question for the finance minister is simple. 
When will he lower taxes? 
By how much will he lower taxes? 
For whom will he lower taxes?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
As to the answer when, Mr. Speaker, we did it in the last budget. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Why does he do it? 
Because he is ashamed of his own policies.  
The minister professes his great concern for the average and low income families. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the leader of the Reform Party talks about misrepresentation.  
Fresh start is their program. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the finance minister is absolutely addicted to taxes. 
Here is his record. 
When is he going to reach bottom? 
When is he going to get the monkey off his back? 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The deficit has not been eliminated. 
We have already begun to reduce taxes, $2 billion over three years.  
The Reform Party refuses to do it until the deficit is eliminated. 
Who is addicted to taxes? 
It is the Reform Party.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
That is taxes, not revenue growth.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
MINISTER OF INTERGOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
It does not want to become involved in our internal disputes.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the minister said: ``The French government will speak for itself''. 
It does not need the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs to speak for it.  
Mr. Speaker, I can only repeat what I said. 
The French government has no intention of becoming mixed up in our internal disputes.  
It is up to us to reach agreement. 
This agreement would be good for Quebeckers. 
There is no need to play politics.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.  
This is very feasible. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my next question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Will he establish accessibility as a national standard in education?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have heard of selective hearing but that beats all.  
Good education is the key to good jobs in this country. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
That is following the normal procedure.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
CANADIAN INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCY 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
It seems the more you give, the more you get.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
She is again abusing the privileges and structure of this House. 
It is just more Reform rubbish.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the minister talks about rubbish. 
Let us look at a little of this rubbish, shall we?  
I do not think so. 
Is it just a heck of a coincidence or is it rubbish?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
MINISTER OF INTERGOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
That is what the minister said.  
How could the minister say such a thing? 
What did he base this statement on?  
The agreement must be in harmony with the France-Canada accord. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
How could he say such a thing on CBC television?  
I think French government policy is one of non-interference and non-indifference. 
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this is ridiculous. 
The minister said the provinces had to be on side. 
Clearly they have to be on side.  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Finance. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is precisely what we have done. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, it is really unbelievable. 
He is pulling the wool over the public's eyes. 
I question the intellectual integrity of this minister.  
No question, no answer. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
To this end, we have indeed put together a plan of action. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
We must be wary of creating myths regarding immigration in Canada.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Since we took over, contributions have been lowered. 
But one has to look at all of the government's financial statements.  
Mr. Ian Murray (Lanark-Carleton, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Revenue.  
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Small business is creating jobs.  
We also introduced quarterly payroll deductions. 
Instead of monthly they will be quarterly. 
This will help reduce paperwork, overlap and duplication.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
What kind of a parole system is he running?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
It is motivated by public interest, the interest of public safety.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
He is responsible for what happens.  
Enough of this nonsense. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
I am accountable to them. 
I am accountable for the National Parole Board. 
It is operating in the interests of public safety.  
It is in the interest of public safety.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Why the double standard?  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I want to return to the Somalia affair.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Fowler said he was not ready to testify. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
He has so indicated in the past, contrary to what the hon. member has said.  
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
However the government refuses to lift a finger.  
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Lieutenant-Colonel McCrae has given a great deal to Canada and the world. 
Canadians are very proud of him.  
CLOSURE OF BC MINE 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
I am sorry to interrupt the honourable member. 
The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development now has the floor.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
NavCanada is responsible for those repairs.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, safety is the top priority of Transport Canada. 
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
In rural New Brunswick we call it potato fertilizer.  
Recently the auditor general said the use of credit cards has increased tenfold. 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of International Trade.  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
There is also a meeting scheduled for the end of October.  
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.  
Sex offender Gordon Mathieson walked out of court without getting any jail time. 
He received what is called a conditional sentence. 
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise today on a question of privilege.  
Citation 116 of Beauchesne's sixth edition states: 
I would like the article brought to me.  
It strikes to the very heart of what we do as MPs in this House.  
Further to this, Beauchesne's citation 33 states: 
It ought to be of concern to each one of us.  
I quote citation 114(2) of Beauchesne's: 
Therefore I would like to make the following motion.  
But at least at this point it would seem to be an administrative matter.  
I am not allowed any input as a private member. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I do have information that is new and relevant to this specific issue.  
This is a very serious charge.  
Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation 2 states: 
These traditions are part of what formulate our rules and practices. 
I refer you to Joseph Maingot's Parliamentary Privilege in Canada , page 192: 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I only want to comment briefly. 
We will be dealing with precisely the services in question.  
It could assist the committee in its deliberations. 
I would like to thank him for bringing up the point. 
I do not want to rule on it right now. 
I want to let this sit at this point for now. 
Mr. Speaker, do I have to put the motion?  
No, you do not put the motion now. 
We will hold that in abeyance.  
The hon. member for Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre. 
Is this another point of privilege?  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
The deficit for the past fiscal year will be about $9 billion.  
I would, however, add something to this estimate. 
That was eight months ago.  
His predictions were terrible, way out of line. 
Again on Sunday evening, I was with the president of the forecasting firm Informetrica. 
Everything pointed to a deficit of between $10 and $12 billion.  
He took it out of the pockets of the poor. 
These are the minister's own figures.  
This assistance is a sham. 
Ninety-three cents on every dollar.  
So we are not talking about peanuts. 
That is what the Minister of Finance has done. 
He has had others do the work. 
How did he do this? 
High premium rates slow sustainable and meaningful job creation. 
There is reference to child poverty. 
The incidence of child poverty was 14.5% in 1989. 
That is the only explanation there is.  
This year, only 41% were. 
Because the rules were tightened up. 
Once again, the one responsible is the Minister of Finance. 
The motion tabled by the NDP also deals with the monetary policy. 
Go ahead, raise interest rates. 
The minister agrees with this policy. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member for Tobique-Mactaquac, on a point of order.  
Madam Speaker, I do not think we have a quorum.  
There are only 15 members present.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
There is no quorum. 
And the bells having rung: 
Madam Speaker, I find it unfortunate that you interrupted- 
Such a fine speech, as my hon. colleague said. 
He keeps saying to Gordon Thiessen, the governor of the Bank of Canada: ``Go ahead. 
That is a recipe for jeopardizing economic recovery.  
Participation levels are lower than ever. 
A minimum of 2% inflation was mentioned. 
They have completely lost sight of this. 
They are obsessed with inflation. 
It is cruel to do what they are doing. 
This has to change. 
Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering-Ajax-Uxbridge, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you on your appointment.  
I must say that our economy is in full recovery. 
I would say that 90% of them are not relevant.  
Our colleague is saying that we are hauling out things that are old hat. 
That is because the members across the way do not understand. 
He is empowered by the Constitution. 
He can give signals. 
This party has a communications problem.  
This is a first. 
That is simply not the case. 
I must repeat my question to the hon. member once again, in this context. 
Will he eventually figure that out?  
That it is, instead, doing everything to keep them on the sidelines? 
It is his government. 
The figures have not changed in two years. 
If anything, they might be going up. 
Can he figure that out? 
Will the member realize this at some point?  
It is not so difficult to understand. 
Can he read the newspapers? 
Last week, Canadian economists were unanimous. 
Two months later, he has changed his mind.  
This seems to me to be a matter of common sense. 
The people across the way should find out the facts, instead of talking nonsense.  
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and Youth), Lib.):
It is a partnership.  
We intend to continue to build on those opportunities.  
I am not prone to brush problems under the carpet and forget about them. 
I am one who is honest about the progress that has been made.  
Partnership is the key to success. 
This has been cited time and time again.  
The Government of Canada will also create a Canada-wide mentorship program. 
But we cannot do that alone. 
Everyone deserves an opportunity. 
Everyone deserves a chance to do the best he or she can. 
Young people do not want a handout. 
They want a hand up.  
When the youth unemployment numbers are analysed, two trends appear. 
They are in danger of being left behind in today's economy. 
Providing access to post-secondary education is a central goal for this administration and government. 
After five months of being in government we pulled together a strategy. 
We have been building incrementally. 
We understand there is not one quick fix. 
We understand that what we have done is not enough. 
Our commitment is longer than one effort to deal with this issue. 
Other measures have followed.  
In February of this year we introduced the new youth employment strategy. 
However we cannot just measure the success of the programs quantitatively. 
We must look at them qualitatively as well. 
They are not asking for freebies. 
That is just one section of the program. 
We understand they need the counselling, they need the assistance and they need the support. 
That is what we have made available to them.  
Our Internet site has been visited more than 66,000 times since it was introduced.  
These young people are becoming a part of that by participating in this program. 
Despite these accomplishments, this government has no intention of resting on its laurels. 
We share the concerns with hon. members of the opposition parties. 
We understand and share the concerns of our provincial partners. 
I am pleased to tell hon. members that we are seeing signs of improvement. 
Our exports and international trade are at record levels. 
We do not pretend that government creates jobs. 
That is not what we are all about. 
We understand that we have to create the climate. 
In just the past seven months, 292,700 jobs have been created. 
We see it as an investment. 
It is something we share in. 
We all have children and children whom we know and care about. 
I invite them to work with us. 
Take for instance the Ottawa-Carleton area. 
There is Covenant House in Toronto for young people.  
The Canadian Paediatric Society is interested in doing something about street youth. 
We still have a future in this country. 
We are a new country which is building. 
The majority of the young people in that area are under the age of 25.  
We must work together to deal with this problem.  
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I welcome the NDP's motion. 
My colleague spoke about summer jobs for students. 
That is not what young people want.  
What young people want is permanent jobs. 
All young people in Quebec want a job to be able to survive.  
They do not have a job.  
It is shocking to say that things are going well. 
It is so much hot air. 
Look at young people who are unemployed. 
It is said they are better educated than before and that is true. 
That is my first point.  
What are we to do with these people this winter? 
It looks as if it could be a cold, long winter.  
All our colleagues across the way seem quite pleased. 
They lack compassion, to a certain extent. 
They come to us and ask: ``What can we do?''  
The people across the way should ask themselves the question. 
What will these workers do? 
They will get income security. 
People back home are very proud to work and to work hard. 
Don't come and tell me that they are lazy.  
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to respond to the hon. member.  
I talked about partnership. 
Have we done enough. 
No, we have not done enough. 
But we are attempting to do a number of things.  
The hon. member said students do not want summer jobs. 
That is not the case. 
We have doubled the amount of money for young people. 
Talk to any young people coming out of university or high school. 
Not only do they want permanent jobs, but they want summer employment. 
The hon. member talked about seasonal workers. 
I understand and I sympathize. 
They are now in that position as a province. 
They have a labour market agreement of $8 billion.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I would like to split my time with my colleague for Vancouver East.  
That was what he said in Acadie-Bathurst. 
I will tell you another thing my predecessor said.  
That is the gift from our predecessor. 
My predecessor was not the only one, however, to talk like that. 
What are they doing? 
Let us have a look at the figures. 
If you figure you work 40 hours a week, that means $1,000 a month. 
This is what they have to realize.  
If we have a look today, what do we see? 
We are told that if taxes are cut jobs will be created. 
Where did that take us? 
We can take a look at what happened with the banks. 
The banks are making millions and millions of dollars in profits. 
They are not creating jobs, they are laying people off. 
This is what is happening.  
Just imagine the number who will starve to death.  
They expect me to do a lot for them because they are living in poverty. 
We have worked all our lives. 
This kind of testimony is painful. 
I can feel what these people feel. 
I can certainly speak for our region.  
They would travel to the other end of the country to find work. 
They are hard working people.  
What do our regions need? 
What is required to help New Brunswick's economy? 
What is required to help Newfoundland's economy? 
What is required to help Nova Scotia's economy? 
These economies need real jobs. 
This is the only way we can create jobs back home.  
Never will Chrysler come to our province. 
Meanwhile, what do we do with human resources? 
Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering-Ajax-Uxbridge, Lib.):
I must therefore ask the hon. member a question. 
Madam Speaker, I will be pleased to reply to my hon. colleague. 
That is very similar to the remarks my predecessor used to make. 
We cannot go ice fishing for cod in winter. 
That is not how fish is caught in the Atlantic ocean. 
That is the problem we are facing in our region. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
It was not a huge crowd. 
They wanted to speak out. 
The finance minister spoke about the state of the economy. 
He gave himself and the government a nice pat on the back. 
The motion before the House today addresses this question.  
Why do we still have $17 billion in deferred taxes? 
It has failed on every ground to address the real crisis of unemployment. 
It has failed to address growing poverty. 
I would like to address one particular aspect which concerns young people. 
At this time almost 500,000 young people are unemployed. 
It is very difficult to find full-time work.  
We hear the Liberals say they are committed to youth. 
Is it any wonder that tuition fees have gone up 45% since 1993. 
Under the Liberal plan what is happening? 
Our young people are graduating into poverty. 
The government has to restore funding to post-secondary education.  
Young people cannot wait until the year 2000.  
They do not need a scholarship program. 
It has to embark on a program of fair taxation. 
This motion brings back a sense of reality to the House. 
To have 1.4 million Canadians unemployed is absolutely unacceptable. 
It is a national disgrace and it is a crisis. 
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
How do these companies avoid paying taxes? 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question. 
It is something which he has raised with me before. 
It is something which has not been taken up by the Reform Party.  
Time and again we hear we have to tighten our belts. 
If there were loopholes they would have to be taken away. 
When it comes to businesses those loopholes still exist.  
That is the issue.  
Those are issues which should be raised by the government and by the Reform Party. 
I challenge them to do that.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The message came through loud and clear.  
Our focus must continue to be on education. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the question. 
That is an issue this government has not addressed.  
That is the effect of what the government is doing.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
Let it be said that this member for Winnipeg North-St. 
We appreciate that Canadians renewed their confidence and trust in this government last June. 
This deficit reduction should be known. 
We can do no less for our youth.  
Good government does not stop at its economic and fiscal success. 
It is a government able to exercise its obligations. 
We also firmly believe that a balanced approach is the way to go. 
Why do I say this? 
Allow me to quote at some length from one provincial NDP premier. 
We are not going to derail this train. 
I hope the federal NDP is not about to condemn their provincial counterpart. 
If the quote so far is not enough, may I continue?  
Now there is no magic well where the money came from. 
Mr. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
There is not a proper balance between the two wings.  
Is that why they are going around in circles?  
They are flying around in circles, Mr. Speaker. 
What we need to do is correct that imbalance. 
I want to ask the member one specific question. 
He did not really mention interest rates. 
They say inflation is becoming a problem. 
What advice does the member have for the Minister of Finance. 
I know the member is independent minded. 
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his kind words. 
We have to look at the total picture. 
The hon. member would admit that short term interest rates have somewhat increased. 
Of course, we wish it had not happened. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I cannot let this go by.  
Admittedly the deficit is now smaller. 
That cannot be denied.  
However, we are still borrowing. 
The debt is bigger now than it was when the government took office. 
It is growing this year. 
Interest payments are still going up. 
Thank goodness for low interest rates, otherwise we would be in deep trouble.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:
It is only projected to be balanced by the year 1998-99. 
My optimism tells me that it may be sooner.  
That would not be the right approach.  
Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):
The motion goes to great lengths to cover many aspects of government policy. 
I am not going to address everything in the motion today. 
It was a very successful program. 
In contrast let us look at the NDP platform. 
While it has commendable objectives, the cost is irresponsible. 
Obviously the NDP does not.  
It was created by overspending.  
The more you overspend the more the associated interest costs.  
To remain competitive in a global market we must innovate.  
We continue to address the financial needs of small business and entrepreneurs. 
This fund is helping Atlantic Canadians to capitalize on their entrepreneurial spirit.  
However, the NDP platform pales in comparison. 
Canada would not remain competitive for very long. 
These cities rank much higher than major centres across the country. 
We lowered interest rates by wrestling our spending under control. 
We introduced programs which will support key sectors of our economy. 
In short, we restored confidence in Canada and regained our economic sovereignty. 
Neither I nor my party is satisfied with this situation.  
The answer is clear. 
Canadians want programs that work. 
Canadians want a government that works, and the government they want is a Liberal government. 
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Madam Speaker, the hon. member for Hillsborough talked about what the Liberals want. 
He said that Liberals want long term jobs.  
It is interesting to hear that is what the Liberals want. 
Their desires and their actions are two different things.  
That bill was supported by Liberal members, by Reform members and by Bloc members. 
The only party which opposed it was the NDP. 
Bill S-9 did a number of things. 
It is going to flow south. 
I am writing to you about an issue that is of concern to me. 
The price of going to university is getting outrageous. 
Here is the point: 
Let me add to what the member said. 
There is no doubt tuition fees are going up. 
I know there is an awful cost to going to university today. 
We are doing very well in this regard.  
Students are accepting it. 
They come to my office. 
I know the member gets letters from people who are having problems. 
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
It includes some of the hardest working people in the country. 
I fully realize they would expect nothing less from their member of Parliament.  
The people of Tobique-Mactaquac are a proud people. 
It is a privilege to sit in the House on their behalf. 
I will make every effort to represent them to the best of my ability.  
This week we are celebrating National Business Week. 
The other 51 weeks it is choking us to death in taxes.  
In 1996 Canadian businesses shut down in record numbers. 
I am also a businessman. 
I own and operate a little convenience store and I sell gasoline. 
Now I sell on an average 300 litres a day. 
Now I have one. 
Is this what the government calls job creation?  
Government cannot create jobs. 
The only cut the government made wasted a lot of money.  
Government does not come first. 
The people we represent come first. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I have a quick comment for the Conservative member. 
Now for some reason they are talking against the HST. 
Clearly it has a tremendously deleterious effect on the economy. 
There is no doubt about it. 
The member has said that his own experience shows that. 
What is their intention?  
First of all, Madam Speaker, I am not on the government side. 
I am on the opposition side. 
I am just like one of them. 
On a roll of masking tape, I would pay 11%.  
The GST was a good tax.  
Talking about the HST, this government felt that the HST was not a good tax. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I have just a couple of points for the Conservative member. 
I thank him for his support of the NDP motion. 
I do believe the government can create jobs.  
A prime example is our post office. 
There would be thousands of jobs created right there.  
Another area where they can create jobs is in regulation. 
The state of Oregon from my understanding has no self-serve gas stations. 
I asked the manager. 
It is the companies that will create the jobs, not the government.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
We have also waited four years to participate in debate in this House. 
Business is a living thing and we control it. 
From that climate industry will grow and industry will create jobs.  
I hesitate to call this good government. 
Infrastructure is one path that leads to jobs. 
What in the world is the matter with this government? 
Who has been burned?  
Let us start with the youth of Canada. 
It was a tough and difficult speech to deliver. 
Job prospects for Canada's youth are terrible. 
We have co-operative education programs. 
We have mentor programs. 
It is too little, too late and there is not enough of it. 
It is the tip of the iceberg. 
It is not enough.  
That is a very real problem.  
They lost 120-some armed forces personnel who contributed to the economy of that town. 
We have done nothing about it. 
We allow the Europeans to catch all the fish they want.  
In return they create employment. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
I wonder what the member for South Shore has to say about that?  
Mr. Speaker, I have a couple of things to say about that.  
His party does not change economic policy or the bank rates in this country. 
That did not happen overnight. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
It means absolutely diddly-squat if you do not have a job.  
I wish you would get this through your head. 
It means absolutely nothing- 
I remind hon. members that they should address all remarks to the Chair. 
We do not want members going to nose.  
Mr. Speaker, I apologize. 
We can put more money back into the economy by cutting payroll taxes. 
We have said it. 
We have been preaching it. 
We will say it one more time.  
Mr. Guy Saint-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Durham.  
Today, I wish to address the motion tabled by the NDP. 
Today, the opposite is true.  
I would like to paint you a picture. 
We have heard the Bloc members speaking numerous times today about federal transfer payments. 
What exactly are federal transfer payments in Canada?  
Let us make an important distinction right away. 
That is important: the provinces may use them however they see fit.  
Equalization payments have not, however, always been affected by federal transfer payment reductions.  
It goes without saying- 
My dear colleague, I believe your earphone is up close to the microphone. 
You should put it in the desk. 
Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:
I am brand new in the House of Commons, I have just arrived.  
This may appear odd but it is true. 
However, the amounts are the same. 
This is the history of federal transfers.  
The other day they were talking about health care. 
I would like to say something. 
When it comes to job creation, what is the role of the government? 
Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:
The government plays a large and critical role in Abitibi-Temiscamingue. 
Where do they come from? 
I will tell you. 
They come either from Desjardins investments, or from the FTQ. 
I never understood the story. 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
He said something earlier on about transfers to the provinces. 
I would like to remind him of this. 
There was a huge fuss connected to transfer payments. 
Allow me to say that this is totally false. 
Now, the figure is barely $11 billion. 
He referred a great deal to equalization payments- 
Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:
It is based on the fiscal capacity of each province. 
Equalization has not always been affected by cuts in federal transfer payments''.  
He never mentions it. 
His riding of Temiscamingue benefits from what the federal government provides. 
I do not have a lot left, but this pamphlet from- 
The hon. member for Halifax West.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
The message in the motion is very simple. 
The federal government has failed miserably in dealing with the real problem. 
Our motion is very clear on that point.  
When I campaigned during the federal election I spoke to one of my constituents. 
It was interesting because, again, a speaker on the other side- 
The hon. member for Durham.  
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to enter this debate.  
The previous intervener talked about dinosaurs. 
We had to deal with the deficit and debt problems. 
These are some of the basic fundamentals of economics which create jobs. 
In the last nine months 297,000 new jobs have been created. 
Why is it difficult to set targets, as the motion entertains? 
It is a very difficult problem to solve because it is always changing.  
One part of this motion deals specifically with education, which I find interesting. 
The Conference Board of Canada recently issued a report. 
I suggest the members of the NDP take some time to read it. 
Domestic testing confirms these disappointing results.  
What is being said here? 
It is saying that increased spending does not necessarily get results. 
That is the highest in the world. 
The NDP members say that we are not doing enough. 
You've done a wonderful job.  
The government has committed to spending more in the area of post-secondary education.  
At the same time, we are not really getting a lot of positive results. 
It is very important that we start putting more stress in these areas.  
These are some of the positive ways that governments can be part of that.  
It is a travesty of our system.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
(The House divided on the motion, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the motion lost.  
The House will now proceed to the taking of several deferred recorded divisions.  
ALLOTTED DAY-FUNDING OF POLITICAL PARTIES 
Mr. Speaker, the members of the Bloc Quebecois vote in favour of the amendment.  
Mr. Speaker, I do not believe the House has heard the question yet.  
I asked permission from the House to dispense. 
I did not hear a nay and that is why I dispensed with the reading.  
Mr. Speaker, I would like the motion to be read.  
Colleagues, there is not unanimous consent to proceed the way we had started out.  
Mr. Speaker, if I may clarify the matter. 
I wanted the motion read. 
The motion reads as follows: 
And the amendment reads as follows:

See list under Division No. 013 ]

The House resumed from October 10 consideration of the motion.  
The question is on the motion.  
There is one member who is absent. 
He will not be recorded, the hon. member for Thunder Bay-Nipigon.  
Mr. Speaker, members of the Bloc Quebecois will be voting in favour of this motion.  
Mr. Speaker, we will be voting no on this motion.  
Can I understand the logic behind that proposal?  
How does the member for York South-Weston vote?  
The hon. member on a point of clarification.  
We are moving it from first reading right to committee stage. 
Technically speaking, the debate on this particular motion is over.

(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
If the Minister of Justice does not know it, Canadians do. 
This is not a right convicted murderers should have.  
There is no justification in the world for a hearing like this to take place. 
It only underscores the need for the immediate abolition of section 745. 
Although it was lessened, this was the intent of the changes that were made. 
This faint hope clause still exists in its present form. 
Let us live up to the intent of the life sentence. 
Let us put truth in sentencing. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.  
Section 745.6 was intended for exceptional cases.  
We are not going to stop only with the focus on section 745. 
(The House adjourned at 7:46 p.m.)
