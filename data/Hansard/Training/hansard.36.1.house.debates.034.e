COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
SMALL BUSINESS LOANS ACT 
ANTI-PERSONNEL MINES CONVENTION IMPLEMENTATION ACT 
CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ACT 
It is aimed to better protect our children from potential abuse.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Does the hon. member have the consent of the House to put the motion?  
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mr. Speaker, on a point of order.  
Mr. Speaker, I received unanimous consent to introduce the motion.  
Unanimous consent was given to introduce the motion. 
The motion was defeated.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
REQUEST FOR EMERGENCY DEBATE 
Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay-Okanagan, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I wish to ask for some guidance. 
Perhaps at a later time that would be the case.  
On a point of order, the hon. member for Calgary Southeast.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Let me go through the whole thing. 
My understanding is that this is what happened.  
At that point I heard no one dissenting. 
Therefore the hon. member had the right to put the motion.  
When the hon. member put the motion I again sought unanimous consent. 
There was not unanimous consent at that time. 
If anyone dissents then that dies right there.  
I, as the Speaker, made this error. 
I invite hon. members to take it from there. 
I will deal with this the way it should have been dealt with.  
The hon. member has sought unanimous consent to put the motion. 
That is where we were at. 
That was where the error occurred.  
I did have unanimous consent to put the motion. 
I am proceeding from that point.  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I declare the motion carried.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I wonder about the process here. 
I wonder what precedent has been set today because of the Bloc.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on the same point of order or similar point of order. 
It has happened a number of times.  
That simply was not so. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member's intervention has been noted. 
The matter has been dealt with, in the opinion of the Chair.  
We will now proceed to orders of the day.  
CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ACT 
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
Producers in my constituency feel strongly about that and would wish to support it.  
Farmers will continue to fight for choices and options. 
That would be a real change.  
There was a tremendous loss in revenue to the western Canadian producer. 
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
The member for Athabasca seems to be referring to me. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Chair and the House stands corrected.  
My apologies for that error, Mr. Speaker. 
I think that is an important point to make.  
I have to understand the limited choice the government had when they chose.  
Our intention is not smoke and mirrors. 
It is certainly honourable.  
Mr. Jerry Pickard (Kent-Essex, Lib.):
There is absolutely no question that Ontario produces a tremendous amount of grain. 
The farmers will hold two thirds of that majority. 
The Canadian Wheat Board is going to be more flexible. 
It has the support of the majority of western farmers. 
It is our fifth largest exporter and our largest net earner for foreign exchange. 
It is very important to the Canadian economy.  
The Canadian Wheat Board has been rated as number one in the world.  
The Government of Canada believes that it is worth preserving.  
I am very pleased with the principles put forth in the bill. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I believe the hon. member should table them immediately.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Chair will consult with the table officers.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not even know where to start. 
Nobody would deny that. 
We know that will happen. 
Those ladies and gentlemen should come out to talk to the farmers. 
They should try it some time.  
I would bet on that. 
I bet you did your best to maximize profits in your business. 
If you did not then you were doing a poor job.  
That is good common sense.  
What kind of situation is that? 
Let us take a look at it a little further. 
Some people in some of these regions- 
All of sudden there are no Liberals in the House at all. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the appropriate thing would be to call for a quorum.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We have a quorum call.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I was talking about maximizing profits, which is what the preamble is all about. 
It is only common sense. 
Anybody with the brain of a fish could say that makes sense.  
They actually broke the law; nobody is denying that. 
They were trying to maximize their profits.  
They could go broke. 
They were trying to provide for the livelihood of their families. 
Nobody wants to go under. 
One court case amazed me. 
Later he was apprehended and convicted. 
He received a sentence of community service. 
He was taken away in shackles and chains.  
I have been screaming at the government for ages about consecutive sentences. 
Clifford Olson should not be serving one life sentence; he should be serving eleven. 
We finally got a consecutive sentencing. 
That is the wisdom of the justice system.  
It is absolutely ridiculous. 
Why are they being targeted as the ones who cannot? 
They are asking for that opportunity. 
They are not asking to scrap the wheat board. 
That is common sense.  
Guess why he chose the place? 
It was because he was maximizing his profits. 
It was the best price.  
We had choices all over.  
That was fairly nice. 
The government is asking farmers in the western prairies to continue the same process. 
Bill C-4 does not change anything. 
They are the ones that sweat hard. 
They are the ones who put the seed in the ground. 
They are the ones who try to chase the hail clouds away. 
It is their crop.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Interest in the bill is growing and growing and growing every week.  
The hon. member for Yorkton-Melville emphasized the use of the word maximizing. 
We will talk about that later.  
That is what a lawyer for the Canadian Wheat Board had to say. 
We only found out about that just a few days ago. 
I would like to read a few statements from that annual report. 
We all know what is going to happen.  
That is before World War II. 
Who paid that price? 
The Canadian Wheat Board is doing exactly the same thing today.  
That is a terrible shame, and it exists today.  
We out west are tired of that attitude. 
We are fed up.  
I know what the hon. member said. 
Do not be fooled. 
Not one principle is embedded in this new act. 
They predetermined what the act was going to be. 
They went through the phoney stage of talking to people. 
The big bad government controls it.  
It is a terrible shame. 
I beg them to read the bill and not to support it.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
I would like to argue that point very vigorously. 
This is a very necessary amendment. 
About six weeks ago- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We do not seem to be getting the French translation. 
Could we confirm that we are getting the French translation, please.  
Perhaps if the member resumes we can try it again.  
I will backtrack just a bit. 
This is supposed to be our board, but it has no obligation to serve us.  
Thanks to the brilliance of this government we now have no postal service. 
I have a pretty good handle on how they feel.  
That is the Ottawa way.  
However, for barley they want dual marketing.  
You listen up over there, you one Liberal.  
I wish the hon. member for Wild Rose would quit heckling. 
He is throwing me off.  
There is nothing substantive- 
The most changes in its history.  
The CEO is a government appointee. 
This is pseudo-democracy. 
This is a Soviet type of democracy, if I may use the term loosely.  
However, it was the political criminals who were nailed to the wall. 
I think the hon. member should take that into consideration. 
It is very easy to explain if one stops and thinks about it.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Producers have survived tough economic times because of the wheat board. 
I urge the government to work in that direction.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
That was their crime. 
That is why we see the disparity of treatment in this country. 
I started out by saying that I thought this was a free country. 
We even have in this country egg police and milk police.  
What a threat to our national security that would be.  
The only thing that we do not have is pork police. 
This is not marijuana or heroin or cocaine. 
We are talking about grain. 
What does the government do? 
It takes the people and treats them like that.  
They want the government to control all aspects of our lives. 
There are also the gun police- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the fact of the matter is that it was not the Liberal Party. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Chair thanks the hon. member for that point of clarification. 
Resuming debate, the hon. member for Skeena. 
We all remember the trainload of rotten eggs.  
There is going to be a time when this is no longer tolerated. 
I cannot say how that will come about. 
I cannot say when it will come about. 
With that, I will conclude my remarks and thank the House for its indulgence.  
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
They want change that is going to impact the farmers' lives.  
It is very paternalistic in its approach.  
These farmers are treated in the worst way, worse even than criminals, by far. 
That is a question that is continuously raised. 
We have to treat them in a fair and equal way.  
Anyway, the people of Dauphin-Swan River feel that this is not fair. 
It is not fair to treat people in this manner.  
We have lost that vision over the last 60 years. 
That port is totally underutilized.  
Yet, over the last 60 years this port has been totally neglected. 
Today we live in the 1990s.  
It is all about accountability. 
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
Our input costs are rising. 
As a result, farm returns are now non-existent. 
Interprovincial trade and access to these markets is not there for us.  
The hon. member from Manitoba talked about using the port of Churchill. 
That is a major point. 
No one is accountable. 
This clause certainly protects the board over the producers it serves.  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
Yet farmers in Ontario can operate differently. 
And I thought it was a free country.  
The minister knows it but the minister will not say it. 
All he wants to do is to entrench that little monopoly.  
The legislation prevents him from doing that. 
Yet it is a monopoly that is protected by the government.  
The minister will have a majority on the board. 
I think about the people who have stood up for democratic rights in Canada. 
Is that so bad? 
It is ludicrous that any government should take this dictatorial attitude today. 
I know that they have backed off a little on committing. 
Rather than ``shall'' indemnify, it is ``may'' indemnify. 
To me that is not a reversal. 
They are left with a sentence and the cost of their own defence. 
Let us hope we do not. 
Let us hope the government does not get there either.  
We can get no information out of this organization. 
This government is doing nothing about it in a free and democratic society. 
I emphasize in irons. 
He was a rather violent offender.  
Did he get caned?  
These were non-violent people. 
We have seen all kinds of demonstrations on the west coast and elsewhere.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the bill. 
I have some personal knowledge of the operation of the Canadian Wheat Board. 
There was no government to government financing involved. 
It was cash on the barrel head.  
The Canadian Wheat Board would not supply the product. 
They not only lost several cash deals. 
They lost the sale, period. 
The purchase went to another country.  
Certainly that is not the case with the Canadian Wheat Board. 
We are talking about the livelihood of western Canadian grain farmers. 
We are talking about the livelihood of families. 
We are talking about the buoyancy of the economy in the prairie provinces. 
They depend on good markets for their product.  
This has to do with rights. 
Is that too much to ask?  
Bill C-4 takes away that right. 
It does not care how big their farm loans are. 
It does not care how many kids they have to educate. 
It does not care how many mouths they have to feed.  
That is what it is telling prairie farmers by way of the bill. 
That is simply unacceptable. 
The member sits and represents the government on this line of thought. 
This is simply one more example of that.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I have a copy of that export licence and I would like to table it.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member wishes to deposit this paper.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We are debating a matter of very grave importance to the people of western Canada. 
We are debating legislation over which people can go to jail.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Madam Speaker, we do not have a quorum.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
We now have a quorum.  
In my region, no one denies the pertinence of this. 
There can be some very good years and also some very bad years. 
In Quebec, oilseeds represent a promising market. 
So things should not be mixed up. 
It would perhaps be better to do so something about this now. 
There is no such provision in this bill.  
There is no such provision in the legislation.  
The terms and conditions for electing directors are set by the government. 
All in all, this is a bill which had to be introduced. 
The government made some efforts, but not enough.  
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
It is important to me for a number of reasons.  
I represent the constituency of Saskatoon-Humboldt which has a significant rural portion.  
The opposition is from many angles. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
I thought that we were still discussing Motion No. 1. 
I would encourage the debate to go in that direction.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I would suggest that the Liberals are truly number one at doling out parliamentary pork.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
This member is far off base in terms of talking about Motion No. 1. 
He should be talking about what the motion is about. 
What does this have to do with Motion No.1?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. parliamentary secretary has a very good point. 
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member will then be relevant.  
Mr. Speaker, that is fair enough. 
They have ensured their control over the organization of the Canadian Wheat Board. 
That is the fear and the concern of western Canadian farmers.  
Yet the Liberals are determined in their desire to be able to do that. 
As I stated earlier, it is for one reason. 
It is so they can continue with their political patronage appointments. 
That comes as no surprise.  
Bill C-4 does not propose to do that.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:
Do you mean there is another wheat board?  
There are lots of them.  
I hope that his efforts in this area will continue. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We will now proceed to Group No. 2. 
This group contains Motions Nos. 2, 31 and 41.  
That Bill C-4 be amended by deleting Clause 2. 
That Bill C-4 be amended by deleting Clause 8. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC) moved: 
That Bill C-4 be amended by deleting Clause 24.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
However, we will try to work our way through them.  
Group No. 2 consists of three amendments. 
Motion No. 41 was put forward by my hon. colleague from the Progressive Conservative Party.  
The official opposition believes quite strongly that this is undemocratic. 
This particular clause further entrenches the inequity and the inequality of the Canadian Wheat Board. 
It has to do with removing all the references to the contingency fund. 
It is a major concern. 
We need to pass that and remove any reference to the contingency fund. 
How much time do I have, Mr. Speaker? 
The hon. member from the governing party said ``too much''. 
That is why we went through the charade- 
On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
The member is not on the topic.  
I am being very relevant to the main issue at stake here. 
I will briefly address Motion No. 41 put forward by my hon. colleague. 
The motion would delete the exclusion clause from the bill. 
We run into a problem here. 
Hon. members from the opposition responded by saying that was fine.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
I promise not to be boring. 
I hope that will please the Chair.  
I will clarify a couple of points. 
It is very important to recognize that. 
The legislation as put forward does not allow that to happen. 
It is simply a regurgitation of the existing legislation with some minor amendments.  
I did not see that happen in committee. 
The witnesses were in effect wasting their breath in speaking to us. 
It would have been nicer if we had listened and taken their concerns under advisement.  
It is important for Canadians to understand what it is all about.  
There are three pillars to the Canadian Wheat Board. 
The first pillar is that of pooling. 
That is not being dealt with in this amendment. 
The second pillar of the Canadian Wheat Board is monopoly. 
We will get into that as well at a later date when considering other amendments.  
We do not know that yet. 
That will be struck by the board. 
Guarantees could be funded out of a contingency fund. 
It will still be accountable to the minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board. 
That makes sense corporately and has to be done.  
My amendment speaks to the exclusion clause. 
In Bill C-72, the predecessor bill, inclusion was never mentioned. 
Now it is in this bill. 
It was not a good answer.  
The motion has been put forward to get rid of exclusion. 
The motion should pass. 
We will deal with inclusion when that motion is being debated.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, thank you for giving me the floor so promptly.  
This meant a considerable waste of money.  
One of the reasons is as follows. 
That is my question. 
Does the Prime Minister not have confidence in him?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans on a point of order.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien:
So he gave it to the Minister of Natural Resources.  
In the West it appears to be Touche Ross & Co. 
I made some calculations. 
That is a substantial amount. 
A 1% error would cost $600 million. 
That is quite a lot of money. 
You will tell me that I am exaggerating. 
I agree, 1% is too high. 
That is $6 million. 
Then we could rub Liberals' noses in it.  
This brings me to the appointments in question. 
On a point of order.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien:
I only have two minutes to go.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Bourassa.  
What Canadians want to hear is his position on- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien:
I will not name him out of respect for his children. 
The fellow will earn $500,000 for doing nothing. 
This is coming out of our pockets.  
In my riding, I hear about these appointments all the time. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The member for Bourassa on a point of order.  
Mr. Speaker, you know what I am good at. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien:
No wonder the government- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien:
The member for Saint-Maurice, the Prime Minister, is not inherently devious.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sorry, but the hon. member's time has expired.  
Resuming debate with the hon. member for Simcoe-Grey.  
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to address remarks by two members opposite.  
I listened to my Reform colleagues. 
I listened to the witnesses and I listened to Conservative colleagues. 
What was best for the farmers was inclusion. 
That is what is best for the farmers. 
That is why it stands.  
To insult the minister of agriculture completely unacceptable. 
Those types of statements are completely unacceptable in this House.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member would also know that is not a point of order. 
They too should be completely ashamed of the tactics they use. 
I suggest they reflect on their actions.  
Again, the member should be extremely ashamed of himself.  
He received completely detailed and very acceptable answers. 
The Canadian Wheat Board is good for farmers. 
On that note, I request a answer from the member for Brandon-Souris. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
That is particularly true of some of the speeches that have been coming forward.  
Obviously a move like that would totally cripple the Canadian Wheat Board. 
We certainly would oppose any reference to an opting out provision.  
In other words, the Canadian Wheat Board would stand or fall on its own.  
We are not supportive of that. 
We certainly reject the idea of a contingency fund.  
What do you know about farming?  
I represent some farmers. 
I thought I heard a lot of chatter. 
I know the difference between Motion No. 2 and Motion No. 5.  
In conclusion, it would be a democratic decision, including a vote. 
There is certainly nothing wrong with that. 
Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
It will depend on the decisions made by the board of directors.  
People from the Reform Party always have real difficulty in listening to facts.  
It depends on what the board of directors does. 
Surely the board of directors should have as much flexibility as possible.  
What is the exclusion clause about?  
It has the same principle as the inclusion clause. 
It sets down a set of rules for orderly procedures. 
It does not want any rules or procedures.  
The exclusion clause sets out a procedure. 
The inclusion clause does exactly the same thing.  
The bill is seeking orderliness, a set procedure. 
It is all up in the air. 
The bill addresses that issue.  
It is the same thing with inclusion. 
What rules are there to add a grain to the board? 
There are no rules. 
That is what the bill is about.  
I know that members of the Reform Party have trouble with facts. 
They have trouble with information. 
A whole lot of hollering from a bunch of yahoos.  
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Ontario has its own wheat board. 
Many Albertans, quite frankly, want to have that same type of board. 
That is the first amendment.  
The third amendment in this group was presented by the Conservatives. 
It was also presented by Reform. 
Try to figure how that relates to the other two. 
I am very concerned about the groupings.  
The president should be hired and fired by an elected board of directors. 
That is the situation we should have within the wheat board. 
What those board members did will help them. 
At least they will have the person they chose to run the board. 
But there will probably be interference from this patronage appointment. 
That is the reason we have put forth our amendments in this grouping. 
Under this legislation that position requires appointment by the minister. 
In a nutshell that is what is included in this group.  
I will discuss the amendment related to inclusion and exclusion. 
The second is the Manitoba Canola Growers Association. 
We were polling on different issues. 
I know that in my constituency farmers do not support the inclusion clause. 
They do not support this wheat board monopoly in any way.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That is a point of debate.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
It wants some major amendments to this legislation before it will be put in place.  
It does not support this legislation as it is. 
In fact, even the wheat board advisory committee is strongly against. 
It does not even support it, if you can believe it.  
He is the only one. 
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
I would ask you to ask the member to withdraw, please.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Lac-Saint-Louis is quite correct. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It is the context and use of the words which make them unparliamentary. 
I could go on and on.  
These are corporations which are funded by us, the taxpayers. 
I have here a few questions. 
CN received $16 million in compensation for this.  
This unnecessary spending adds up to almost $50 million.  
What purpose will it serve? 
This pointless spending will cost 12 Thunder Bay employees their jobs. 
To put it plainly, the government is robbing Peter to pay Paul.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point or order. 
The hon. member is talking about transportation policy. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The parliamentary secretary is accurate. 
This makes no sense, I cannot understand it. 
Maybe that is the reason. 
I cannot understand it.  
I will stop here, even before the minute you gave me is over.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The member for Selkirk-Interlake has a point of order.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Saint-Eustache-Sainte-Therese has one minute remaining.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
I would like to challenge some of the statements that have been made.  
I cannot comprehend why hon. members would object to that. 
Ontario, for example, runs its board completely by itself. 
That just does not make sense.  
Another thing I want to comment on for a few minutes is the contingency fund. 
Why would we want to put money into a fund that we cannot control? 
That seems to be plainly ridiculous.  
There is no way to make the contingency fund pay. 
It does not make sense.  
Every member on that side said no way. 
They did not want accountability.  
It is not worth putting a match to it. 
It is very interesting.  
I flew back to Ottawa in August to do some work. 
I picked up the Hill Times , and what did I see? 
How many western farmers read the Hill Times ? 
Can you believe that, Mr. Speaker? 
I cannot believe it.  
It being 2 p.m., we will now proceed to Statements by Members.  
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
As a consequence economic prosperity is being fostered in B.C. and across this country.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Each province agreed that removing internal trade barriers would benefit that province. 
Yet this government has done little to complete the agreement. 
One deadline after another has been missed.  
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton, Lib.):
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
Canada's efforts in these areas leave much to be desired. 
In 1998, Canadian international assistance will be at its lowest level since the 1960s.  
Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, November is Diabetes Awareness Month. 
Some of the leading diabetes research still takes place in Canada. 
The Juvenile Diabetes Foundation deserves our support.  
FESTIVAL OF NORTHERN LIGHTS 
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
In many cases the troubles families find themselves in are no fault of their own. 
This situation does not need to exist nor should it exist.  
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
But those days are now behind him. 
Two years ago he started writing a book.  
MINISTER OF INTERGOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
I join with my colleagues in congratulating all those who are celebrating their birthdays today.  
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
The hon. member for Churchill.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the following are the words of Ila Bussidor: 
I dream of an eagle 
Forever coming to me with messages of strength 
Always in friendship and kindness.  
I touch the great sacred bird of spirit.  
He cares for me, each time I vision him.  
He lets me carry him.  
He gives me his sacred feathers.  
I am not afraid of him.  
I believe he is my guardian.  
The spirits of my father and mother 
Beside me in my times of pain.  
Night spirits are the spirits of the dead.  
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to draw attention to National Child Day. 
Their breakfast is often not enough to satisfy their hunger.  
These children will remember tomorrow what you do for them today.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the parties are talking at this time through negotiations. 
Now we hope that the parties will find a solution. 
This has always been the position that this government has preferred.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
This government claims to be concerned about the economy. 
This strike will cost businesses millions of dollars. 
It cripples the direct marketing industry at the worst time of the year. 
It hurts the economy.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
That may be its position, but it is not ours.  
The union has the prerogative to go on strike. 
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister upholds the right to strike. 
The hon. Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay-Okanagan, Ref.):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the collective bargaining system has worked well in this country.  
The strike is only a few hours old.  
Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay-Okanagan, Ref.):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
What we must do is follow the law. 
This government is letting the process work.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
The same cannot be said of her and that is the problem.  
The Minister of Canadian Heritage.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
The hon. member for Halifax.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Banks have registered record profits over the past five years. 
It is easy for the banks to strangle their customers. 
This government does not require them to publish the figures that could explain such charges.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Bank service charges are user fees. 
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Why is she changing her mind?  
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it was rather clear, I think. 
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The legislation requires that we review the regulations in 1997. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
This government writes the law. 
My question is for the labour minister. 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, what this government wants is a collective agreement. 
Both parties are at the table. 
Let us not be making statements that will hurt the negotiations.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Let us look at who is hurting here. 
The Canadian public is hurting.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Cardigan, Lib.):
We have both sides at the table. 
They want to come up with a collective agreement. 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my supplementary is for the Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, Canadians have lost access to the postal system. 
The Minister of Labour says that he supports the collective bargaining process. 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Let us let them do their negotiating.  
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
When will the minister take some action and restore the postal service?  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
My hon. colleague talks about businesses under the federal jurisdiction. 
It is a good system. 
The collective bargaining system has served us well in this country for years. 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
This is something that is in his bailiwick, let him mind his own business.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
However, there is no denying that there is an urban congestion problem.  
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the Environment.  
Mr. Speaker, the hon. gentleman's information is factually incorrect. 
The hon. gentleman should catch up with the facts.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
The minister tells us to have confidence in the collective bargaining process at Canada Post. 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
The collective bargaining system has served us well over the last many years.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
That is what encourages both sides not to co-operate.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
It has been updated periodically. 
The process has served us well for years. 
The collective bargaining process has worked well. 
Please let it work.  
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade.  
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
This strike will cost Canadian businesses about $40 million a day.  
When will the government legislate them back to work?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
In that way the government has reacted very well.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Canada Post is at the table with the union. 
Canada Post has a mandate to negotiate. 
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
That is telephone service.  
Since 1992 some local phone rates have increased by over 100%. 
Thousands of homes are without phones because the rates have gone through the roof. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is a very good question. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have been through this many, many times. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am deeply concerned at the suggestion the hon. member has just made.  
Mr. Guy Saint-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
The Francophonie has elected its first Secretary General, Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali. 
The hon. member for West Kootenay-Okanagan.  
Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay-Okanagan, Ref.):
Collective bargaining has four parts: negotiate, conciliate, mediate and a settlement mechanism. 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
I want to see a collective agreement. 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have been quite consistent. 
They are evaluating that particular complaint and will decide whether or not to investigate.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
I will take it under advisement and report back to him.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
My question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
Does she think that the federal government should develop national standards in these areas?  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Waterloo-Wellington for his question. 
I know that in his past life he had a particular interest in heritage.  
The statistics he quoted are of concern to all of us. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, a million Canadians who want jobs cannot find them. 
This strike will cost Canadians millions of dollars.  
Is this what the government and the Minister of Labour call fair?  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, clearly the seal hunt is being directed according to law.  
The facts are that the total allowable catch for last year was not met. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
COMMENTS DURING QUESTION PERIOD 
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of personal privilege. 
That person is not here to defend themselves.  
I fall short of saying that this is McCarthyism but- 
This is surely not a point of privilege. 
If that is the case, then we have a matter of dispute of the facts. 
It is a point of information, surely, that he wants to pass on. 
The point is well taken by the House.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
That program calls for the business for the next week as follows. 
Tomorrow morning we will deal with second reading of Bill C-17, respecting Teleglobe. 
THE LATE ROBERT THOMPSON 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
He served in the House from 1962 until 1972, a decade. 
What a decade in political life. 
In those ten years there were five general elections. 
He was a minister of education in the imperial Ethiopian government from 1947 until 1951. 
In 1982 he prepared a model constitution for Canada.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
His career was rich and varied in service to others. 
Bob taught school in Alberta before the war. 
He was an officer in the Royal Canadian Air Force. 
I recall him as a man of substance and integrity. 
He made a strong contribution to this House and to Canada.  
Bob will certainly be missed in terms of service to Canada. 
Once again, our sympathy to his widow and his family.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Bob was active as a very young man in the Social Credit movement in Alberta. 
He honed his political skills at the feet of William Aberhart. 
This would stand him in good stead for his entire lifetime.  
Bob, his wife Hazel and their children served in Ethiopia for years as missionaries. 
Bob got things done.  
He then ran as a Conservative and was re-elected in 1968.  
When I was elected to this Parliament in 1989, Bob became an instant adviser. 
How I appreciated him as a mentor. 
We had some wild and exciting political discussions which taught me a lot. 
He was a wonderful role model to me and I appreciated that.  
It is a special memory that I will always treasure.  
The world is a better place because Bob Thompson was in it. 
Thank you, Bob, for all you gave us. 
Thank you, Evelyn, and all Bob's children for sharing him with us. 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
Mr. Thompson was born in Duluth, Minnesota. 
That same year marked his first election to the House of Commons. 
In 1975 he was appointed Canadian High Commissioner to Singapore.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
I remember speaking to him. 
He was very unique in many ways. 
Those are a couple of unique combinations and very rare indeed. 
He was a very interesting man.  
I think we can learn a lot from his legacy.  
This country will surely miss him.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
His influence on me was significant. 
I was proud to be asked to speak with him. 
He was a sincere, knowledgeable and wise visionary. 
As for me, I shall miss the greatest political mentor of my life.  
CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ACT 
The hon. member for Portage-Lisgar has four minutes remaining in his intervention.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
You would wonder why this clause became an issue. 
Now we see what this has really done. 
That relieves a lot of headaches for them. 
This has always been the problem of the wheat board grains. 
I think this clause has to be removed. 
It is very simple. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to propose a lawyer board at this time. 
All earnings should go through a central fund.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I do not believe this member is talking about the motion before us. 
We are discussing the Group No. 2 amendments which apply to only three provinces. 
They are very undemocratic. 
They control only farmers. 
I am drawing an analogy and I am going to continue.  
The board should not, however, be allowed to be audited by the auditor general. 
If the funds are not being properly managed that should not become public.  
How many lawyers would protest would not matter. 
Lawyers would be limited on where they could deliver their services. 
What do we think lawyers would say? 
Lawyers would probably say yes. 
That is how fair the question was that the government asked.  
Why does it not pick lawyers. 
Why does it not start having a lawyer board and put control on them?  
There is something very seriously wrong here. 
I am very concerned about this issue. 
I have worked on it.  
This morning I asked a Liberal member to table a piece of paper. 
I do not have it yet. 
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that item was tabled this morning. 
Maybe the hon. member was not in the House.  
I think the parliamentary secretary is indicating that the document was tabled. 
The hon. member can continue his speech.  
Mr. Speaker, the member is just trying to interrupt me. 
I hope I get some extra time.  
I was here when it was tabled.  
It is as simple as that.  
Do you get the point I am trying to make, Mr. Speaker? 
It is not fair. 
That is the point we are trying to make.  
I listened to my Bloc colleague this morning. 
He began by saying he supported Bill C-4. 
I began to ask myself why they were supporting Bill C-4.  
I have something else to reply to from this morning. 
I was shut down by the Speaker but I think it needs to be mentioned. 
Do members know the biggest insult? 
The people in my riding are saying it. 
I am sorry, Mr. Speaker. 
I know he would not want to breach the rules.  
Farmers want control over their property. 
How does the bill diffuse the division that exists? 
Not one speaker on the Liberal side has addressed that serious problem. 
It does not in fact.  
Without their help we cannot get rid of this discriminatory legislation.  
Surely to goodness we can have some fairness in the country.  
I showed the certificate earlier.  
Because of the inaction of the government the Canadian Wheat Board will be destroyed. 
``Property rights will be the focal point of the challenge. 
However discrimination may prove to be the trump card'', this person says. 
There should be some concern about that.  
I one to talk about process. 
It is a slam in the face to democracy.  
Listening means that we hear what is being said. 
That concerns me greatly.  
If the board were to become more accountable it might change the way it operates. 
We are asking for that. 
Producers want to be assured that will happen.  
I have many other remarks but I will have to wait to finish.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
This government is truly not good at listening.  
The Bloc Quebecois is opposed to this bill. 
On initial examination, certain provisions are interesting, but they do not go far enough. 
We do not produce enough grain crops to be able to export.  
When a problem arises, who pays up? 
The government and thus all Canadian taxpayers.  
It is the same situation.  
Is it a problem of language? 
Perhaps, but regardless, I want to dispel the misunderstanding immediately. 
We oppose the bill.  
I would just like to comment on something he said. 
Without these, a debate becomes a monologue and not a dialogue.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
The contingency fund is not a subsidy fund. 
I want to make that clear.  
Today there is a whole new generation of farmers. 
These young people do not have just $20,000 invested. 
Many of them have $3 million and $4 million invested. 
They know when the Canadian Wheat Board is selling grain. 
They know that they are being taken.  
Why are they afraid? 
It is because of the inclusion clause. 
Western Canadians are afraid of the inclusion clause.  
It is a real fear that they have. 
It was phoney because it was an all or nothing at all vote.  
They are going to kill themselves. 
Do not blame the Reform Party for that. 
Blame nobody but yourself. 
We are the new era of transportation. 
We have huge boats that come in the harbour of Prince Rupert. 
We are not going to tolerate this. 
They dictate the transportation route.  
We have a new era also in communications. 
Most of these young farmers are on the Internet. 
They know what is going on. 
You cannot fool them anymore by Bill C-4.  
I want to say this. 
This bill, if not amended, is doomed to die. 
Maybe it will get passed in this House. 
That is exactly why were are here.  
We want to save it. 
This government is going to destroy it by this bill.  
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we are here today to discuss Motion No. 2. 
I am having a great problem with everything in this bill. 
Let us take a look at the clause. 
This clause makes the Canadian Wheat Board Act binding on the provinces. 
Correct me if I am wrong, Mr. Speaker. 
I have to wonder just exactly what they fought for. 
In Ontario the board members are freely elected. 
Farmers are not silly. 
Under communism the government just takes it. 
They do not get a bit of help. 
I have to wonder how long the farmers will put up with this. 
I would suggest not too long.  
It sure as heck was not the government or any of its members.  
Yet that is one of the functions that we were taught very young in school. 
Today the harder the farmer works, the more he is penalized. 
Does it make any sense to the government opposite? 
Yes, I see some nods over there that it does. 
We see today that it is a total farce. 
There is no such thing in this country any more. 
We have to look at some of the functions that farmers play. 
They will do that but not out west. 
God help us if we ever get that decision. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
I know some people watch the parliamentary debate on CPAC. 
MPs follow it closely. 
He said they fear for the inclusion clause. 
There is overwhelming opposition for the inclusion clause.  
That is why the election results are very important. 
The Government of Saskatchewan- 
An hon. member: 38%.  
It supports the inclusion clause and they said nobody does. 
Misleading of the House.  
Is that an irrelevant organization? 
There's some cheap barley in Ontario.  
Who else supports the inclusion clause? 
The Saskatchewan Wheat Pool and the prairie pools. 
The biggest company in Saskatchewan is the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool. 
The wheat pools speak for thousands and thousands of farmers. 
And the Reform Party says that nobody does. 
The Saskatchewan Wheat Pool does.  
It is about time the Reform Party was taken to task. 
It is not doing that. 
The Saskatchewan government is supportive. 
The Canadian Federation of Agriculture is supportive. 
It has now been put to sleep for 10 years.  
The Reform Party believes in referenda and in consulting people. 
They responded to a very clear question.  
The Reform Party is supposed to be reflecting those views in the House of Commons. 
Why do they not reflect that point of view in the House of Commons? 
It was a clear question.  
The National Farmers Union is also in support of the inclusion clause. 
I wonder where the Reform Party comes from. 
They have always supported the Canadian Wheat Board. 
They just listen to the people who have the money. 
They want to destroy the wheat board. 
So I certainly oppose that as well. 
I am sure that Canadian farmers will also oppose that point of view.  
All the major credible farm organizations that support the board want the inclusion clause. 
Why is the Reform Party against that democratic right? 
It is a right that the farmers want.  
I know the truth hurts. 
The question was very clear and there was a very clear answer. 
I am very surprised that the Saskatchewan Reform members, in particular, are talking this way. 
Why are they not listening to their constituents? 
Why should they not be recalled?  
People are very supportive of that clause. 
It is important that be put on the record.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
He would find out that what he is saying is not true.  
It does not seem to me that they want it. 
It is as obvious as it can be. 
That is the old rule, the old way of doing things. 
That is in the past. 
I felt like sticking my chest out a little bit. 
There is legislation coming out from behind closed doors day in and day out. 
That is the way they do it. 
The Liberals will do what they are told. 
They will vote the way they are told to vote.  
It is the same old story over and over again. 
The Liberals, the NDP, and right down the line. 
Every old line party that has ever been here says ``We know best. 
That is something I am sick and tired of.  
The wheat board did better than it had ever done. 
That is good healthy competition. 
I do not believe that is asking for too much. 
I can hardly wait to go back home. 
My constituent hit the nail on the head. 
The farmers did it. 
The government's power is to dictate. 
It has not learned the power to serve. 
I challenge government members to do that. 
I talk to fishermen whenever I get a chance.  
Come on out to Wild Rose. 
Stand on the street corners and talk to the farmers who grow grain. 
Ask them what they think about Bill C-4. 
Then it might change some things.  
CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ACT 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
I would like to mention some of them. 
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
Practically all the grain was hauled on sleighs. 
The Canadian Wheat Board is stuck in the 1920s. 
I asked him to extrapolate his thinking a bit. 
I would like to be in that position. 
That is what we are talking about today.  
We are avoiding frosts. 
It would seem production is not the challenge it once was. 
The marketing of grain is of the utmost importance. 
It would appear our NDP friend from Saskatchewan would agree with that sentiment. 
He has it wrong, as usual.  
We want to have a flexible wheat board. 
We want to have a board where we can be in or out. 
Why not have a choice?  
What about credit unions? 
Let us take a quick look at how they operate. 
Some of those people are not even paid. 
They may collect mileage to and from meetings. 
They may get their registration fee paid to attend conferences and that sort of thing. 
They are accountable to the people who elect them. 
Those elected people hire an administrator. 
The administrator makes administrative decisions and the elected board makes political decisions.  
They are not even in the same ballpark.  
How does he know that? 
I think that anybody in this House would say that competition is good. 
In that case he would say ``Certainly competition is great. 
I wish I could think of the member's riding. 
The National Farmers Union, the National Foundation and three others we have listed here.  
Is he rising on a point of order?  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
Resuming debate the hon. member for Saskatoon-Humboldt.  
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
How many Liberal MPs come from the west?  
We are here representing western farmers. 
Why can farmers not have the choice? 
Wouldn't that be good? 
Other marketing boards would spring up. 
There would be competition. 
Why will they not understand that? 
Well I can tell you why. 
I see one Liberal member in the House.  
I invite him to comply with the rules and refrain from making such suggestions.  
They are not here engaging in the debate. 
He had to put his tail between his legs and go to Regina.  
An hon. member: -Marxist-Leninist.  
Why force that upon anybody?  
There is the idea of an inclusion clause. 
We grow a lot of canola on our farm. 
What right does anybody have to tell me where I can sell it? 
What right does anybody have to do that to me?  
However, if canola is grown in Ontario, that is okay. 
That will not apply. 
They will be able to market it wherever they want. 
How much clearer can a guy be?  
What about the barley vote?  
Say it slow for him over there.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I want to correct the member. 
In actuality, I have the utmost respect- 
I hope they are not taken as such in a debate of this kind.  
Is the House ready for the question?  
The House will now proceed to the debate on the Motions in Group No. 4. 
This group contains Motions Nos. 4 to 19.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC) moved: 
That Bill C-4, in Clause 3, be amended 
(a) by replacing lines 7 to 14 on page 3 with the following: 
The president shall be appointed by the board.''  
(b) by deleting lines 15 to 17 on page 3. 
``pleasure for the term that the board of directors may determine.''  
The president shall be appointed by the board in consultation with the Minister.''  
That Bill C-4, in Clause 3, be amended 
(a) by adding after line 33 on page 4 the following: 
(b) by replacing line 34 on page 4 with the following: 
``-(3) After the date referred to in section 3.08,'' 
``view to the best interests of producers;'' 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ) moved: 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP) moved: 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
In other words, the president would not have served on the board of directors.  
The Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans on a point of order.  
I thought the hon. member was making a passing reference. 
He is proceeding with his remarks, I am certain.  
It calls a fully elected board of directors. 
We find that completely reprehensible. 
The credit unions have done quite well. 
Motion No. 14 also refers to the hiring and firing of the president. 
The code sets out standards for ethically, socially and environmentally responsible business practices. 
That is just a small part of the code.  
That is the purpose of that amendment.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
I think I understand what he is getting at here. 
He wants a minimum level. 
I heard a member from that party talk about two tier. 
If there is anything that is two tier it is clearly this.  
This is a very important aspect of it: 
I want to elaborate on Motion No. 13 if I may. 
We say this is totally anti-democratic and we want no part of it.  
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Jean-Guy Chretien of the Bloc Quebecois. 
Jean-Guy on this side, not Jean on that side.  
We therefore support this amendment, because it puts power in the hands of the board. 
For this reason we will vote against this motion.  
That is why we will vote for Motion No. 11. 
This, I believe, is self-evident. 
We will therefore vote in favour of this motion.  
We will therefore vote for there to be a replacement when required.  
We will therefore vote in favour of this statement of good intention.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
There are two areas in this legislation about which I am concerned. 
Currently there are three commissioners acting as the head of the Canadian Wheat Board. 
There is also an advisory board. 
It is a eunuch. 
As proposed, this legislation would improve that governance. 
Ten will be elected and five will be appointed.  
A precedent has already been set with respect to this type of governance. 
That is absolute hogwash. 
It is not necessary.  
I am very nervous of that situation. 
That is what these amendments speak to. 
I talk about governance. 
We have the board of directors and a chief executive officer. 
They run under a very sheltered cocoon operation, obviously, having it as a monopoly corporation. 
It runs basically the same way now as it did in 1943.  
It obviously found its way to the amendments here. 
However, the amendment is a legitimate and logical one. 
It was an amendment put forward by the hon. member for Peace River. 
We will not be supporting the amendment. 
I appreciate where it is coming from and I understand why it is there. 
It has merit but it flies in the face of democracy. 
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
There were 25 marketing boards in existence under the government of Bill Davis.  
They run it themselves. 
It is not forced on them. 
A marketing board for perishable products makes the most sense.  
The hon. member could have read that. 
He also talked about rotten eggs. 
Again it showed a lack of understanding of the industry. 
The Canadian Wheat Board is guaranteed for all farmers.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
The member for Brandon-Souris already talked about this amendment. 
Yet here he is fully supporting the amendment of the member for Peace River. 
I appreciate the change of heart on the part of that member. 
I think it is progress.  
I think I can leave it at that. 
He did a good job of explaining that amendment.  
We think farmers will settle for nothing less. 
We are to get a partially appointed and partially elected board. 
I do not think this amendment could possibly be opposed by government members. 
That is very important. 
It is very unusual for a president and a CEO to be the same person. 
Let us look at the background, at the philosophy of wheat pools, for example. 
First they elect a president. 
Then the same board of directors hires the chief executive officer. 
At any time they choose they can fire the chief executive officer. 
These people would never be the same two people. 
Having one person filling both positions is extremely unusual.  
It is important that this is passed. 
Let us learn from what we have seen in co-operatives.  
We do not know how the voting will be set up. 
That is a concern because it should be in the legislation.  
That will not happen. 
Many farms have one permit book for several families. 
It makes no sense. 
A commercial farm would grow many times that. 
The answer is very difficult to understand.  
If you do not have a permit book, you should not be eligible to vote. 
I suppose it is not very likely.  
It is not going to make it any more accountable to prairie farmers. 
I think that is another extremely important amendment.  
AGREEMENT ON INTERNAL TRADE IMPLEMENTATION ACT 
I supported the bill. 
It was right to support it.  
Many of our concerns were very legitimate.  
The dates that were set have passed. 
So it has not done the job.  
This term ``agreement by consensus'' has been interpreted by this group to mean ``unanimous consent''.  
I will talk a little later about the importance of that to Canadians.  
In fact, that is not the case at all. 
That is the part of the act that relates to the interprovincial trade. 
I want to be a Canadian. 
I want to do business in this country. 
It makes no sense. 
It is costing Canadians an awful lot of money.  
That would have a huge impact.  
Surely that alone should indicate that this government should implement this bill. 
It is too important to Canadians to ignore.  
That is from the British Columbia Chamber of Commerce.  
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
From its very beginning, Canada has been a trading nation. 
Trade is the lifeblood of this country.  
The agreement on internal trade came into effect July 1, 1995. 
It is no secret that there are problems with the agreement. 
This bill reflects an attempt to address that particular issue. 
The intent is understandable. 
The authority of the agreement on internal trade does not derive from federal legislation. 
That is what this bill is attempting to do.  
There are therefore two main reasons why this bill is inappropriate. 
It is only a first step. 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
What is the bill before us all about? 
This enactment will give the Governor in Council- 
I will start with the first point. 
We have to understand their concerns.  
There is a danger in interprovincial trade. 
This happened again recently. 
Therefore, as I was saying, there are two aspects to the bill. 
This is what I am explaining. 
Naturally, we do a great deal of trade.  
We have a very serious transportation problem. 
There is all sorts of regulations, and trucking regulations in particular. 
In the end, this would lead, once again, to a greater centralization of powers.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak to Bill C-203.  
Internal trade is an area of great interest to me. 
My background is in small and medium size business. 
My family have been historically involved in small and medium size business. 
Trade between the provinces totalled $314 billion in 1995 alone. 
Unfortunately this agreement has not had the effect its originators had envisioned for it. 
The current agreement is fundamentally flawed. 
The Liberal Party has in its past fought free trade. 
Now it cannot get enough of it. 
We cannot offload or downsize leadership. 
That is what I fear has happened with this important issue of internal trade.  
Besides health care and post-secondary education, the covenant would have focused on interprovincial trade. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
I would like to congratulate the member for Lakeland for this initiative. 
Within that context I wonder if we could talk briefly about the brewing industry. 
I have many dealings as a result of that with the brewing industry. 
In Canada the brewing industry has developed somewhat differently. 
Presumably some of the major breweries have established plants in Alberta. 
Again, I do not have those facts in front of me.  
If the hon. member for Lakeland speaks now, he will close the debate. 
The hon. member for Lakeland.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
He asked about Alberta specifically.  
That is what my private member's bill would do. 
It would lead to the completion of the agreement.  
That brings me to the comments made by the Bloc member. 
His concern is completely unfounded. 
In fact, the Government of Quebec signed the agreement on internal trade. 
It agreed to a step by step process to complete the agreement. 
The reactions of government members have been very vague in some ways. 
They agree it will work.  
I do not believe it is simplistic. 
I believe it is simple. 
The concerns the government has expressed are completely unfounded. 
I will close with that. 
I had several quotes from constitutional experts. 
I would be glad to table them if I am requested to do so. 
I thank members for their input. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
There is no one to answer the phone. 
People call and call, but the line is always busy. 
The clock is not set back to zero. 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
That said, there is no great mystery regarding the employment insurance account reserve. 
Let us recall for a moment what happened in the last recession. 
That is no time to increase premiums. 
The size of the reserve varies continually. 
It increases and decreases depending on the rate at which benefits are paid out. 
The reserve is currently estimated to contain some $12 billion. 
The interest is credited to the employment insurance account. 
That is very important for persons who unexpectedly lose their jobs.  
(The House adjourned at 6.36 p.m.)
