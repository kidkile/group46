The achievements of the Aster scientific station are many. 
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Mr. Ruderman's work is an example of the spirit of volunteerism. 
The people of Etobicoke-Lakeshore are proud of his efforts.  
Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):
A real school of life, I would say.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
They were married 50 years ago tomorrow.  
It was the 11th year of the reign of King George VI. 
Britain was beset by economic problems. 
God save the Queen.  
Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin-Middlesex-London, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I stand today in recognition of the Elgin regiment. 
History has shown that the members of the Elgin regiment are used to change.

Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):

Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Unfortunately, the minister has refused these repeated requests. 
NATIONAL DAY OF THE CHILD 
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):
Speaking on behalf of all the children of Ahuntsic, my congratulations to them all.  
We have a responsibility as parliamentarians to leave this world a little better. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
The government says that negotiations will produce a settlement. 
They are going to be on WWF next.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Those things happen once in a while. 
They have a right to have a union and the right to negotiate.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
The government wants a collective agreement and it wants both sides to sit down.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We are waiting to see what the outcome will be. 
If it is appropriate to consult Quebeckers afterwards, we will see to it.  
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
This is quite an admission from the Liberals.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We brought in tax relief for students. 
We brought in tax relief for the physically disabled. 
We brought in tax relief for poor families with children.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
We also know that a rather disgraceful incident took place yesterday.  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Just before the incident, yesterday, negotiations were going ahead. 
I hope they can be resumed this afternoon.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
The government's objective is to have a negotiated collective agreement.  
Mr. Rejean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
The government will assume its responsibilities.  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am the minister responsible for Canada Post. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the drug patent policy is a controversial one. 
It was reviewed by a committee of the House of Commons during the past winter.  
The purpose of the policy, from our point of view, is quite simple. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
They obviously have no interest in respecting intellectual property. 
Nor have they made any practical, lawful suggestions to us that we could- 
The hon. member for Saint John.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
If she shared it with me I could give her a more appropriate answer.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
The Canadian business community knows about it.  
High payroll taxes kill jobs. 
And I have it, Mr. Speaker. 
Let us not use any props in the House. 
If the minister wants to answer the question, he may.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I thought the member was referring to a more specific piece of information.  
Her government was about to put it higher once again. 
That is what it wanted. 
Thank God we have been around for awhile.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Until then I have no comments on the issue.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
While in opposition this minister was talking the talk. 
Now is the time. 
Will he walk the walk?  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
We raised all the issues the hon. member is concerned about.  
The questions concerning prisoners were all raised. 
For the first time we had a number of NGOs involved.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
My question is to the Minister of Finance. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
It is necessary to reduce expectations. 
So the question is based on a false premise. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, what a revelation!  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
What will the Reform Party do? 
Everybody in the country would like to know. 
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
We know two things, though. 
The government will sign a binding agreement. 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
All Canadians will be engaged in the issue of reducing climate change.  
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
The government is preparing its response to the report.  
My question is for the Minister of Industry. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Any changes to the regulations will be to- 
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. minister. 
The hon. member for Nanaimo-Cowichan.  
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
The auditor general again confirms the vastness of this problem. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
That will be in place by the end of this calendar year. 
It will save money and, more important, it will save lives.  
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the government's previous minister of health made two conflicting promises. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
That includes first of all- 
The hon. Minister of Health has about 15 seconds.  
We are proud of that legislation. 
The hon. member for Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert.  
Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Defence.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton, Lib.):
Tell General Pike to take a hike.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
You bet, Mr. Speaker. 
I think that is more indicative of what the British army thinks.  
The hon. member for Surrey North.  
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
Now she has suggested an ombudsman for crime victims.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
This leaves the federal RCMP.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
My question is for the Minister of Transport. 
The hon. Minister of Transport.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
This is now being looked into by the RCMP. 
Beyond that I have no further information.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
At that meeting he detailed his allegations of corruption.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
It will take all these matters into consideration.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Mr. Speaker, Canadian workers had better keep their eyes open on this one.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
Member spoke in Inuktitut ] 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
I know that in April 1999 we will welcome them to their responsibility.  
ATLANTIC CANADA OPPORTUNITIES AGENCY 
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am not sure where the hon. member is getting his figures from. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
We know that the Americans are challenging the price of Canadian milk for export. 
The World Trade Organization was hearing the American complaint this morning. 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, yes I will confirm that we will defend the Canadian dairy industry vigorously. 
We defended the industry vigorously. 
We succeeded then and we will defend the industry vigorously today and in the future.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Last night the parties were that close to a collective agreement.  
What is going on?  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
We hope they can go back to the table and reach a settlement.  
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have looked very carefully at this situation. 
Most of the cheques that my department is delivering are going through the post. 
That has been done.  
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is addressed to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his timely question. 
It shows real progress in constructive engagement.  
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
Hong Kong veterans are compensated by the Department of Veterans Affairs in a fair manner. 
DEPARTMENT OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Dear colleagues, that marks the end of Oral Question Period.  
I am going to introduce them by calling out their names. 
These are our literary award recipients.  
My colleagues, following question period, I am going to host our laureates in my chambers. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order that arises out of question period. 
I thank the hon. member for his information.  
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions to present today.  
The first petition concerns the family. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have several petitions which I wish to present to the House.  
The first petition totals 12 pages and contains over 300 names. 
It has to do with the definition of marriage. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
It deals with the age of consent.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
They ask that they be allowed to do their work. 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
The petition which I am now presenting exhibits similar concerns. 
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions to present to the House.  
The first petition is from residents of the Yukon territory.  
Unfortunately, because the minister deemed it not necessary, it is being closed.  
The citizens of the Yukon are protesting that decision.  
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
We are asking for the abolition of the use of provocation as a defence.  
I present this petition on behalf of the residents of the Yukon and Alberta.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ACT 
The other motions will be grouped for debate as follows:
Motions No. 2, 31 and 41.  
Motions No. 4 to 19 
Motions Nos. 20 to 30, 32, 33, 34, 45 and 47.  
Motions No. 35 to 40.  
The voting patterns for the motions within each group are available at the Table. 
I shall now propose Motion No. 1 to the House.  
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
The House has heard the proposal of the hon. member for Prince George-Peace River. 
Does the House give its consent to the substitution of the motion?  
Is that also agreed?  
WHEREAS agriculture is a basic foundation stone of the Canadian economy; and 
WHEREAS it is necessary to establish an organization to coordinate such trade; and 
We represent a substantial number of people. 
The amendments we make are very important and deserve the proper consideration and advice.  
That is a very serious concern because we need that input. 
I hope that will change.  
I have introduced seven amendments to effectively address the deficiencies in the bill. 
With these amendments I proposed the following improvements to the Canadian Wheat Board Act. 
Talking about sunset clauses, that should be in all legislation. 
First I will speak to the preamble.  
I introduced Motion No. 1 to correct a serious oversight. 
The Canadian Wheat Board Act does not have a preamble. 
If any act of parliament needs a preamble it is this one.  
That should be obvious.  
Agriculture is the basic foundation stone for the Canadian economy. 
It is necessary to organize and co-ordinate such trade. 
Who in the House can argue against that objective? 
I quote what the minister said.  
If that is the case we should put it in writing. 
These are far more than just motherhood statements. 
It is a serious oversight not to have it in there. 
This is the preamble that should be included: 
WHEREAS agriculture is a basic foundation stone of the Canadian economy; and 
WHEREAS it is necessary to establish an organization to co-ordinate such trade; and 
The purpose of the amendments I have put forward is to protect all farmers. 
The government always says that it is listening to the majority of farmers. 
A significant number of producers are represented by people on this side of the House. 
I appeal to the government to listen to the amendments we are making. 
They are common sense reasonable amendments and they should be considered.  
The government will not listen to our amendments anyway''. 
They are asking why they should provide resources. 
That attitude has to change. 
They are reasonable amendments that address the concerns of the people we represent.  
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
It is an important aspect of the governance of that industry. 
That is why I am very proud to support the legislation. 
That is basically what we are here to discuss. 
That is the form of governance I think the democratic process should take. 
We are accomplishing exactly what producers want us to accomplish.  
It is a very good one.  
They are also criticizing the producers' opportunity to participate in the process. 
Therefore I do not support the amendment. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
By then there may be several. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
I will tell you why. 
It makes no bloody sense. 
The minister responsible is objecting. 
I fail to see why. 
Bill C-4 does have good intentions. 
That is a step forward.  
When the colour of the government in power was blue, Conservatives were appointed. 
So why fear it?  
I do not think so. 
I invite my colleagues in the government to have another look at the proposed preamble. 
The board should also be accountable for its performance.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
The amendments were rushed through in one session. 
I think that there is a lot of mom and apple pie in it. 
The motion which is before us does that. 
Those vision and mission statements are very much in vogue these days. 
We see corporations and other groups doing it. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
He wanted to hear their comments. 
He wanted to make sure their comments were embodied in this legislation. 
I will give the House two examples. 
In committee I put forward an amendment to bring the minister back to the committee. 
I would have liked to have heard from those individuals. 
I come from an area which is referred to as the wheat city. 
This legislation is very important. 
All this preamble says is that the corporation will be working for the producers. 
My party will be supporting Motion No. 1. 
I cannot see why government would not allow this to happen.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
The way these amendments have been grouped is very odd. 
Part of the motion states: 
It sets the tone for the entire bill. 
All parties view this as a very important preamble. 
Above all, we want the wheat board to be accountable to the farmers. 
However, we do not see that in this legislation.  
That simply did not happen.  
I completely agree with that assessment. 
I think this bill is not going to address the needs. 
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I must oppose this particular amendment to the preamble.  
That is the real strategy here. 
Let us put it on the table and call a spade a spade.  
He was fairly critical of those appointments. 
How does it really stand up in law? 
One usually uses ``whereas'' at a political convention for resolutions. 
In a corporate profile this is what it said: 
That is what it says in its corporate profile now. 
It does not need to be said in terms of preamble to the legislation. 
We expect the new board will be able to do similar things.  
That is the real game Reformers are playing. 
How many lawyers are over there in your camp anyway? 
I thought you were trying to represent producers here, not the legal community? 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I remind the member to please address his remarks to the Chair.  
We have had the hearings. 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I will be relatively brief, given that everything is relative in this House.  
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I do not believe we have a quorum.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
We will count the members and let you know.  
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
We now have a quorum.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
He must have a relative in Winkler, Manitoba. 
One gentleman came in and asked me to support the wheat board.  
He wanted me to make sure the wheat board stayed. 
He sold no grain to the wheat board. 
I know why he wants to keep the wheat board. 
He wants to keep cheap feed prices. 
That is the support the wheat board has.  
It has the supplies it can deliver. 
It has been sold at good prices. 
Why do we have wheat board grains in the bins? 
There is no money for that.  
The member also talked about law breakers. 
The member for Malpeque should explain which laws were broken. 
Is it criminal to get the best price for their grain?  
They do not want to sell it for the best price. 
Why has a preamble never been included in the wheat board act? 
I would like that explained.  
Not everybody is a lawyer. 
We do not have any on this side. 
It sounds ridiculous to me.  
I was impressed by the hon. member from the Bloc. 
We have always been classified as separatists; Reform members are separatists. 
We can work together with our Bloc colleagues and identify good and bad legislation. 
Why in the world would we pass legislation to divide the country? 
What are we to say about that?  
What will hon. members from Ontario answer? 
Every member of its wheat board is elected. 
Why are Manitoba, Alberta and Saskatchewan different from Ontario? 
That is what should happen.  
Why do we want to create another difference? 
I would like that explained to me. 
I cannot see that happening in the bill, the way it is drafted.  
It will do more harm than good.  
He is a member of the opposition who has an interest in farming. 
He knows what he is talking about. 
He is not just talking through his hat.  
It has been a pleasure to say a few words. 
I encourage Liberal members to stay in the House and listen to the debate. 
I see they have disappeared again. 
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am calling for a quorum.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member for Okanagan-Shuswap has called for quorum. 
And the bells having rung: 
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
Do you want to debate that?  
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
The preamble I am interested in is the section where he says: 
Why would we want such a preamble introduced in the bill? 
It has always taken this position in court.  
When the board is talking to farmers, however, it says quite the opposite. 
``There can be no partnership without accountability.'' 
Grain Matters, May-June 1996. 
It is only accountable to the ministers, and the courts found exactly that.  
And that is exactly what happened.  
It says nothing about accountability to farmers.  
Essentially quoting section 5. 
Nothing has been changed in the act. 
Two-thirds of the board are farmers.  
Madam Speaker, the member for Malpeque is making some noises from the other side. 
They want a dual system. 
They want to be outside of that monopoly. 
There is no accountability in this act. 
We have a system- 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am not a lawyer.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
That is not a point of order. 
Madam Speaker, I see that the truth hurts. 
I do not think they should have that moral authority. 
They even want to deny us that. 
It is wrong and they will pay the price for it.  
REQUEST FOR EMERGENCY DEBATE 
Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay-Okanagan, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
That is causing major economic problems in this country.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
There are some procedures to deal with matters of this kind. 
Does he have the unanimous consent of the House?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ACT 
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
WHEREAS agriculture is a basic foundation stone of the Canadian economy; and 
WHEREAS it is necessary to establish an organization to coordinate such trade; and 
This is not the first time a preamble has been discussed. 
There was a preamble in which Quebec was described as a distinct society.  
The funny thing is that the preamble had no significance back then. 
Others said ``No, it would go at the end''. 
That does not come from us. 
I was seated and had said nothing. 
Good common sense ideas can spring from anywhere. 
I mentioned Malpeque, but they can also spring from western Canada.  
I think that they are absolutely right. 
We cannot hope for more than that.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
It is certainly true that I am from central Ontario- 
Hansard will disclose that this comment was made.  
I reject that and I think most Canadians reject it.  
What does that mean? 
What will it do for a judge? 
Does it really matter? 
Will it affect how the law will be interpreted? 
It has no force on judges. 
My colleagues opposite can check it. 
In the legal profession they call it the pious hope clause. 
It has no binding implications for what the judge must do. 
The judge must read after enacts.  
The phrase accountable to farmers sounds noble. 
We are talking about setting up a federal government body. 
We are not setting up a provincial body. 
We are not setting up a farmers union. 
What they are proposing is unions. 
That party does not want government in Ottawa. 
It does not want government in the provinces. 
That is an absolute formula for disaster for the country.  
He, in his wisdom, has set up a board which does have composition with farmers. 
That is the real debate. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Vegreville-Lakeland.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, you have spoiled my fun. 
I was looking forward to correcting you on that. 
We have asked for clarification. 
We have suggested clarification. 
We would have clear legislation.  
Unfortunately we do not, therefore we have to debate this preamble. 
Section 5 says that the wheat board exists for the Government of Canada.  
This government has entirely refused to accept that change. 
I am upset by that. 
We know it will be passed somewhere down the road.  
I hear the member for Malpeque across the floor shouting some comments again. 
I think that is intolerable.  
Back to the group of amendments that we are debating. 
I will start before the turn of the century. 
To market grain for our farmers, we had a series of co-operatives spring up. 
The purpose of the growers was to maximize farmers' profits.  
The purpose of those organizations was a little different. 
Even the first version of the Canadian Wheat Board was not a monopoly. 
One of the important cornerstones of the pools was for farmers to have a choice. 
There certainly was debate about that from Mitchell Sharp. 
That was clearly the mandate.  
That is so true.  
After the war the monopoly was maintained for five years. 
Canadian farmers lost hundreds of millions of dollars through the maintenance of this monopoly. 
Yet the burden was not spread amongst all members. 
That is why this preamble is so important. 
It is not enough. 
This legislation does nothing to help that situation.  
The debate is not whether we keep the board or not. 
A vast majority of Canadian western farmers want the board.  
However, they do not want the monopoly. 
That is the debate. 
These polls have been tabled at committee and are available. 
The proof is there. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
He quickly identified that one of the problems in that town was the pool hall. 
I would say it starts with power. 
It starts with p that rhymes with t and that spells trouble.  
Let me enlarge on what I am saying here. 
One of those Liberals over there said ``Well, the preamble is meaningless''. 
I beg to differ. 
It must force this.  
We had better get the minister to appoint him''?  
Do members know what I think? 
That is what their preamble would look like. 
It is a preamble that would say the board exists for the farmers.  
They keep saying this board is the best. 
Let the farmers choose.  
I ask you this question, Mr. Speaker. 
I believe that you have had some business experience. 
A farmer can purchase or sell the feed grains outside of the wheat board.  
This is absolutely ridiculous.  
The wheat board has to have a purpose for being. 
Why should there be a wheat board without a stated purpose? 
The reason is that farming right now is very competitive. 
My brother farms on land which I worked on when I was a kid. 
If the wheat board is doing its job, the wheat board will get the business. 
There is no doubt about it. 
That is how it works. 
I challenge the Liberals. 
There are two or three of them over there who can think for themselves. 
That happens to be in my view almost a human right. 
Whose grain is it? 
Who prepared the soil? 
Who paid the taxes? 
Who paid for the fuel? 
Who paid for the fertilizer? 
Who paid for the tractors and the machinery? 
Who worked 18 hours a day? 
Who prayed for rain? 
Who prayed for the locusts to go away? 
I really want to appeal very seriously to the members over there. 
May they please use their heads. 
May they please be independent in their thinking and vote for what is right.  
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
I cannot think of a better subject to do it on. 
I hope I do not let them down.  
Quite frankly, it has been a very divisive subject. 
They are fed up with the lack of accountability to the producers. 
We seem to be at an impasse here. 
Why did it choose not to? 
This government cannot change things just by slapping another number on it.  
That is what this bill should address, maximum returns for the producer. 
It could learn something and could maybe incorporate some of those practices into the bill.  
Just imagine if producers ran their operations like the government does. 
If only governments were held to the same degree of accountability as producers.  
Why is the government so afraid to put some options on the table for producers? 
Where is the transparency that producers are demanding? 
This in itself is ringing alarm bells with producer groups across the country.  
How can the directors act freely if they are bound by this secrecy? 
Why will the Liberal government not come clean?  
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC) moved: 
First, let me explain the reasons that led me to table this motion. 
However, there is a fly in the ointment. 
The problem is serious. 
Today, almost 1.5 million children live in poverty.  
This undisclosed agreement is already called the reinvestment framework. 
Why is it called that? 
Children are poor because their parents are poor.  
Let us look at the report entitled ``Improving Social Security in Canada''. 
It shows how the Canadian family and its needs are changing. 
Today, the average family has less than two children, and both parents work.  
The family is changing, and support measures must change too. 
Many changes are needed. 
We need quality child care. 
We need to make support for the care of handicapped children more accessible. 
We must also look at community action programs for children. 
As well, there are parental and maternity benefits. 
How can these children do well in school? 
One and a half million, one child in four. 
Finally, we come back to the improved and expanded federal benefit. 
And governing is about making choices''.  
In Canada, this makes no sense. 
And what he says is true.  
Quebec's flexibility, for example, will increase by $150 million a year''.  
That is because there is no protection for the child benefit. 
That is because the benefit is only partially indexed.  
Children are dependent on what governments decide. 
We are only catching up. 
They have to be allowed to keep up with the cost of living. 
We were heading toward a financial dead end. 
This was what the right decision had to be. 
Now we have to make societal choices. 
This now ought to be addressed.  
Inflation raises the nominal value of family income. 
I am therefore asking that we do as much for our children.  
We must not forget to be fair in the way we consider the future.  
Let us try to give our children a healthy space to develop. 
Let us reclaim Canada's title of champion of social justice.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
This is a policy which applies broadly across the tax system.  
Because of these potential fiscal costs the government is unable to support the motion.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
This is rather ironic. 
This partial indexation works as follows. 
Right now, there is no indexation. 
What is even more ironic is that the Liberals have been pursuing the same policy.  
That is what the current Deputy Prime Minister said in February 1992.  
They chose not to change this situation. 
It is a losing proposition for all families. 
In 1984, some $6.7 billion was paid out under this family policy.  
Mr. Tremblay said ``The perverse effects will be felt gradually''. 
These perverse effects have indeed become reality. 
But this was not the case.  
An amount of $1.5 billion was mentioned earlier. 
So there will still be a lot of room for improvement.  
So the final version of the motion would read: 
I will end with this and I would like to submit my amendment.  
I believe the amendment is in order.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
An amendment has been proposed by the Bloc to bring the level to full indexation.  
That is what the member for Shefford is suggesting we need to study.  
This partial deindexing has now been in place for 12 years. 
It really amounts to an automatic annual tax increase. 
These tax increases are not transparent. 
The Liberals can say one thing and do another. 
It is very easy for them to hide this tax increase. 
It is like the bracket creep we keep talking about. 
It is the same sort of thing.  
Yet what do we find? 
This erosion of net family income continues in many ways. 
The child benefit is only one example. 
It results in higher and higher taxes.  
What did the Liberals get elected on? 
They dropped the average Canadian family income by $3,000. 
No wonder there is child poverty. 
They caused it, so they should do something about it.  
This is simply unacceptable. 
I hope nobody misses this fact. 
No wonder there are poor children and families in the country. 
It has an insatiable appetite for tax dollars. 
That is exactly what he is. 
One bottle is not enough any more. 
It has to be more and more every year.  
The Reform Party simply says enough is enough. 
It would cost them too much. 
They need our money.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
It calls for a review of the indexing of the child tax benefit. 
A portion of its gains will be lost to inflation each year. 
How can we have a strategy to reduce child poverty unless we reduce unemployment? 
How can we address child poverty? 
The statistics speak for themselves. 
It merely substitutes ground already lost. 
Children are poor because their parents are poor. 
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
I congratulate her for bringing this matter to the House. 
I would like to come at this from a different angle.  
In fact, we lived in inflationary times. 
I suggest that that creates an inflationary spiral. 
The government is concerned about the issue of child poverty. 
In other words, there is some way to measure if child malnutrition has been improved.  
They take time and effort and dedication.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, it is certainly a pleasure to see you in the chair this evening.  
That responsibility lies with the minister herself.  
I reiterate today what I have said previously. 
I want to suggest a few things in the time I have. 
These are shocking statistics.  
It is time to do something and quickly. 
Nothing has been done to date.  
I suggest there are concrete things the government can do today. 
If nothing else, this would emphasize the seriousness of the offence.  
This is something the government must take a leadership role in. 
The Canadian public has spoken very clearly. 
There has been much discussion in this House on this issue. 
The minister will be taking it up with her provincial counterparts.  
Recent statistics from the Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics were released yesterday. 
The minister is very committed to bringing forth some solutions to this problem. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
Louise Harel in Quebec is in agreement. 
Jean Dupere, the president of Lab Chrysotile, is in agreement. 
Only our Minister of Human Resources Development in Ottawa is refusing to budge.  
The department is completely adrift.  
The program was offered only in some provinces. 
Provinces also worked along that line.  
The employer has always indicated its willingness to help workers. 
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.44 p.m.)
