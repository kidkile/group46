EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 225 
Monday, May 10, 1999 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
INCOME TAX AMENDMENTS ACT, 1998 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
First, as in the previous budgets, we reduced the deficit. 
Second, we have invested in the future. 
As soon as the country's resources permit we will broaden and deepen the process. 
The true test will be what Canadians think.  
General tax relief as indicated in the 1999 budget will speak for itself. 
It was explained to the member in committee. 
What does this mean? 
The 1998 budget was no different. 
Bill C-72 implements several measures which will financially benefit students.  
You're keeping me awake.  
The hon. member says that I am keeping him awake. 
It is not often that the member stays awake in this Chamber. 
I thank him for the compliment.  
The money must be repaid to their RRSP program over a 10 year period.  
That also facilitates lifelong learning for about 250,000 part time students.  
The 1998 budget introduced the Canada education savings grant. 
Bill C-72 also proposes additional changes to RESPs. 
This credit will assist about 450,000 caregivers who are not normally eligible for it.  
We have allowed that particular measure to go forward. 
Members on this side of the House have consistently fought for self-employed Canadians. 
I hear the Conservatives at the other end of the Chamber hollering across the way. 
I think they are hollering in support of Bill C-72. 
We feel that its relief measures are fair. 
In essence, what we have is a reduction in tax relief. 
We do not have an increase in the deficit. 
We do not have an increase in the debt. 
What we also do not have is what most- 
Mr. Richard M. Harris:
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. parliamentary secretary.  
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
Actually, it is more of a short stab in the dark.  
The bottom line is long term. 
But in some regions of the country these funds are performing a valuable service.  
We are aware that RRSP contributions have fallen off in the last two years. 
I presume that helps young single mothers in particular. 
There is a lot of merit in doing that.  
We can characterize this as a housekeeping bill. 
We are a few days late in getting the parliamentary rules in place. 
It is a cart before the horse scenario.  
We see a clause that reduces the individual surtax by a couple of bucks. 
They take their skills and their incomes and they maximize them south of the border.  
There is another reason for my disappointment. 
Accountability, quite a concept.  
So much for our complex tax codes.  
We have seen those cuts to the bone in health care. 
This is the opposite of what some in the House will say. 
It is human nature for bureaucrats to continuously try to satisfy those demands. 
It tries to be charitable but ends up subsidizing self-defeating behaviour. 
That seems to fit in very well with this logic.  
In Bill C-72 we see the same tinkering at work. 
This has become a fairly common situation in Canadian households. 
We call that bracket creep. 
That is according to the OECD study.  
Again, the numbers are better when we add them altogether. 
I wonder if many Canadians will actually notice that change in April 2000.  
There is a real disparity. 
This government will try to use two excuses. 
This is hardly a prudent way to manage the future. 
Our fundamentals are supposedly right, but in our minds they are not.  
The funding was set aside last year.  
I ask what is the big deal? 
People in Canada are looking for real tax relief. 
Again the parliamentary secretary talked about the RESPs. 
It gives us lots more flexibility. 
Students can do different things with that. 
It is an insult to these people.  
I would say that the reality is it is not even a gentle breeze.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Our position has not changed fundamentally with respect to those highly specific measures.  
There is the $500 increase in the basic personal credit. 
We worked on this. 
We applauded this measure.  
There is an increase in the child care expense deduction. 
This is a good thing.  
The rate of unemployment, as we have seen, has remained fairly high. 
We were happy to see that measure included in the 1998 budget. 
In 1998-99, the surplus will exceed $15 billion. 
In the next fiscal year, the surplus will be $20 billion.  
We have nothing against paying off the debt. 
That is not the point. 
Would you please ask them to continue their conversation elsewhere?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I do not think the other members were being too noisy. 
They were merely chatting, but I understand your point.  
That was all I was asking for. 
He had choices to make. 
He knew he had a surplus of $15 billion. 
He could count just as we could. 
But it is work. 
He could have done extraordinary things. 
He took it and he put it on a shelf. 
He applied none of its recommendations.  
But there has been no follow up. 
There really is a lack of interest.  
He could have done it very simply. 
I will illustrate my remarks in this respect in a few minutes.  
Here is what happens without indexation. 
What is the result of all this? 
This makes a difference. 
This is a measure that reduces disposable income. 
That is a considerable amount of money.  
That is a considerable amount of money.  
These people do not have any money to throw away. 
They are not taking vacations in Acapulco every year. 
They could have invested it in their children's education. 
They could have used it to improve their general situation. 
They also could have perhaps put it toward buying a house.  
Maintaining such unjust situations is a serious matter. 
They could have done something else to improve people's situation. 
They should have reformed taxes years ago. 
It needs to be done soon. 
These people pay double, and this is the fault of the Minister of Finance. 
I was going to say something unparliamentary, but I will refrain. 
I am casting about for a word that is parliamentary but conveys my meaning. 
This is no way to manage taxpayers' money and the public knows it. 
The public should not be underestimated.  
We have not seen it yet.  
At least, we were not aware of any other similar situation.  
They took advantage of the situation. 
It is hardly surprising. 
There are many banks, trust companies and family trusts. 
They were talking about tax havens. 
I was looking at a paper last week again, and it made no sense. 
One has to have money to do that.  
Six years later, nothing has changed, with tax havens. 
Bill C-72 contains some positive measures. 
He could have done a lot.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
My first question would be to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance. 
What is it about bracket creep that he likes so much? 
We hear an awful lot about bracket creep. 
I will get back to this point in a moment.  
This is going to make a tremendous difference. 
Something like $35 will really be noticed by people who are caregivers. 
This will make a major difference.  
There are a number of changes that we would support in principle. 
However, to say that none of this is worthwhile would obviously be silly. 
We have all filled out our tax returns in the last few weeks.  
We all have a sensitivity about the tax system. 
I think we have seen this movie before. 
The levels of inflation were simply too high. 
Once this was done the economy would turn around. 
I can say with some pleasure that we did that. 
Now, for all intents and purposes, we have no inflation.  
Did that significantly change the way the economy was functioning? 
Did we become more productive? 
Did employment levels come down substantially? 
Unfortunately the answer is no. 
There was no significant shift.  
The government then admitted it had made a mistake. 
However, that did not have the big hit that we had anticipated either.  
Did that achieve the results? 
It then began cutting programs and the deficit went down. 
As a matter of fact it was wiped right out. 
The deficit is history. 
It went the way of the dodo bird.  
Things, however, did not change a whole lot or turn things around. 
The government then said it had a new problem called tax cuts. 
My friend from the Conservative Party agrees with me. 
I am not going to say we should not lower taxes. 
However, I have seen this movie before. 
It has not worked in the past. 
I am not sure this is the answer. 
Where is this call coming from? 
Is it widespread across the country?  
The same answer came back when they were asked about education. 
It really is a major issue. 
I am not saying that reduced taxes is something we should not be concerned about. 
We obviously should, but is it a priority?  
I do not think Canadians are that far out. 
I took that personally being somewhat of a blonde myself. 
I know many of us are very fond of canoes. 
A lot of us have canoes and we paddle them. 
Let us face it, the list is endless.  
The minister and the parliamentary secretary would be grilled. 
In many cases they do not go over the estimates at all. 
Some people benefit from our tax system where other people pay too much. 
Let us face it. 
That is the way it is. 
They are not doing anything wrong. 
They are not doing anything illegal or unethical. 
They do not have any real deductions that other people obviously have.  
That is simply a fact of life.  
I will not read much.  
I have chosen for today's reading chapter 127, verse 11, subsection (b)(vi). 
It may even be inspiring. 
It goes like this: 
applying subsection (9) in respect of 
(ii) in any other case, the references in paragraphs (a), (a.1), 
(b) and (b.1) 
Who in their right mind could understand what the hell that is all about? 
They practise the grey area of taxation.  
It made a number of recommendations. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I have to comment. 
It warmed the cockles of my heart.  
The member said something about tax breaks not having an effect on the economy. 
I want to challenge his thinking about this and I would like him to respond.  
Whether one taxes or not does not really destroy any money. 
All it does is change who gets to spend it. 
Politicians and bureaucrats spend the money which the people have earned.  
It is certainly true that some government spending provides people with jobs. 
The member indicated some of the waste government is involved in.  
It certainly would not hinder it. 
Madam Speaker, as usual I appreciate my friend's intervention. 
He always has a thoughtful point to make. 
Once again he has made a thoughtful point. 
I agree with him in part and I will explain the part. 
I do not think anyone would deny that. 
When those consumer dollars are not being used our economy weakens.  
They may not spend the money. 
I need to get my head around this. 
There is certainly the view that some Canadians may spend it outside the country. 
The fact is that if it is earned in Canada, it is taxed in Canada. 
I am sure he would not be contemplating that.  
People are loaded with debt like they have never been before. 
I think the hon. member should be in favour of that. 
I would like his comment.  
Madam Speaker, what I am about to say I say with all the respect possible.  
I believe that what we require in this country is tax reform. 
The reality is that we have to close some of these loopholes. 
They do it because they know that their taxes are not being wisely invested. 
I would guess that is very conservative. 
I suspect it is much larger than $40 billion.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
I think that is a very important distinction that needs to be made.  
The challenges that we face change more rapidly now than we have ever seen before. 
We are in a rapidly changing, globally competitive environment. 
I believe those tax reforms were implemented in 1971. 
I appreciated his comments.  
These are exciting times that we live in today in Canada. 
It took 14 years, from 1984 to 1998, to eliminate the deficit. 
Tax reform is a very important part of that. 
Tax reform is going to become more and more important. 
This government's approach to taxation policy is anaemic. 
For instance, the increase in the personal tax credit of $500 is positive. 
We agree with the general trend to increase the personal tax credit. 
We believe that the personal credit should be raised to $10,000.  
This is particularly pervasive within the high tech sector.  
The challenges and the opportunities we have now are very exciting. 
It is dealing with a zero sum issue. 
It is not possible to give more to one group without taking more from another.  
Tax relief can play an integral role in tax reform. 
Personal debt rates are at an unprecedented high in Canada. 
Personal bankruptcy rates are higher than they have ever been. 
It is a corporate tax issue. 
It is a personal tax issue. 
It is a productivity issue.  
There is a huge number of factors. 
Tax policy is very important. 
Social policy can play a role in terms of innovative social policy. 
That is the one area where we do not have any real government policy. 
We have a secondary and primary education system.  
The fact is that we can have both.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I listened with interest to my colleague from the Conservative Party.  
We probably will lose the $7 with that brain drain.  
What would the member's point of view be on this kind of tax break? 
I agree with the member. 
We can have a consumption tax base that is progressive. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
However, would he not agree with what many tax people tell us? 
I do not mean that to be a critical point directed to my friend.  
This new tax was a very difficult sell.  
I am a pretty exciting guy. 
With a consumption base it is much harder to get around that. 
It is not a zero sum game any more. 
We can combine tax reform with tax reduction. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join in the debate. 
In 1998 there was a substantial increase in the funding of those councils.  
There is a brain drain going on now. 
My colleague points out there is a drain of brains occurring now. 
It is often thought that grants no longer exist in our system. 
For very low income students there are still grants. 
Those provisions are extremely important for young Canadians. 
Let me talk first about SchoolNet. 
It is very common to say that education is a provincial jurisdiction. 
I believe the federal government should do something about it. 
SchoolNet is as good an example as I can think of. 
I mentioned researchers and university professors getting increased funding. 
I mentioned graduate students getting increased funding. 
I mentioned the increased support for people who want to go back to school. 
Now I am talking about our elementary schools. 
That is the way a federal government should think, nationally.  
It links research organizations across Canada.  
I have been very pleased to have this opportunity to speak and I move: 
That the question be now put.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The House has heard the terms of the motion.  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The floor is open.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, then I will rise on debate.  
I do not understand exactly what the government is doing. 
I wish that people in Canada knew what was going on in the country. 
We have a lot of members who are very upset. 
I am talking about members of our society, our citizens and taxpayers. 
At every turn there is another tax. 
There is a tax on a tax. 
The governments of the past 30 years have not done a thing about this. 
They have simply been riding roughshod over taxpayers.  
That is what they keep crowing about.  
We have an endless stream of taxes and user fees. 
I believe that the way parliament works is the root of the problem. 
Many members over there would argue that is not true. 
The Liberal government represents the government and its wishes. 
Surely it must be the role of the opposition to represent the people here. 
No one does anything about it. 
I suppose that no one would really ever say that they love taxes. 
They are upset by them. 
The reason is twofold. 
The total tax bite is too high. 
Back in Trudeau's time it was already that bad.  
Has it been alleviated? 
Did nine years of Conservative government solve the problem? 
We had a massive increase in our national debt under that administration. 
Have the Liberals solved the problem? 
I find it atrocious that the government has absolutely no plan to reduce the debt. 
The answer is no, they do not have a plan.  
I have a copy of the figures taken from the budget. 
I am looking at the net public debt numbers.  
What is the plan? 
The net public debt in 1998 was $579.7 billion. 
It is right in the document, $579.7 billion. 
It is exactly the same number. 
It is $579.7 billion. 
It is $579.7 billion.  
What is the change in the debt? 
The way the government is trying to spin it is absolutely shameful.  
He has to look after his family while he goes to classes. 
They are running roughshod over the rights of Canadian taxpayers.  
I think of the ways the government mismanages and misspends money. 
My hon. colleague from the NDP brought some of these to our attention already. 
Instead the government is just wasting our money.  
There are people in my riding who make $15,000 a year and pay taxes. 
There are other things which are just ridiculous. 
That is totally absurd.  
We are contributing $50,000 to a scavenger hunt in Parry Sound. 
Somebody would make up a list of things that people would go looking for. 
They did not need $50,000.  
Why can the locals not do that? 
It is absolutely ridiculous.  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Madam Speaker, of course the member is totally wrong. 
This bill, Bill C-72.  
We are talking about the whole issue and what should have been in this budget. 
Canadians have to hire professionals. 
It is a shame and the government ought to be ashamed of itself.  
What does Bill C-72 say about health care? 
It is what it does not say. 
We have a government that talks about an education budget. 
The government gives them no real help. 
Thank you very much but that has to be the correct kind of loan. 
Bank loans are not covered. 
They have to get a bank loan. 
Can they deduct that interest? 
That is how the government operates. 
I think it is atrocious.  
Once again the spin doctors and the communicators announce a number, $500.  
We will take one question and a response. 
You will have still some time later on.  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
It is okay with me. 
This will give us a bit more time for Statements by Members. 
We will proceed to Statements by Members.  
Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):
We applaud their commitment.  
It is a privilege to recognize National Police Week. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Show me the money. 
NATIONAL STUDENT COMMONWEALTH FORUM 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
The theme of last week's forum was poverty.  
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
Thanks to all the nurses in Canada and congratulations to them for them invaluable contribution.  
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
NORTH-WEST MOUNTED POLICE 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Congratulations to the organizers and participants in this historic re-enactment. 
We look forward with enthusiasm to the excitement of this celebration throughout the summer.  
Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):
Thank you for continuing to serve with distinction, courage and bravery.  
CANADA-FRANCE PARLIAMENTARY DAY 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the conflict in Yugoslavia rages on. 
This incident illustrates the unintentional consequences of combat. 
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
From 1966 to 1970, Gilles Richer wrote 151 episodes of Moi et l'autre .  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Let us put things in perspective. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
The time is ripe for action. 
We all have an obligation to future generations. 
They expect sustained and effective leadership from us. 
The ball is in the federal government's court.  
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Will the taxpayers of Quebec find that acceptable, I wonder.  
NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT 
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
There is so much to celebrate. 
Employment has increased significantly in all three of the NAFTA partners.  
This Liberal rewriting of history rivals credibility.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
What are the effects of this policy on the eve of the year 2000? 
The response is overpowering. 
We know what the solutions are. 
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, last week was Mental Health Week in Canada. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
This is a significant milestone that these talented young men and women have achieved. 
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
I will focus on two people for the moment.  
The boys and Ms. Quinn were able to reach shore.  
A brave father who will not be forgotten.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
At this moment it is better than having no offer at all. 
That would be the best result we could hope for.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I did not say that a partial withdrawal would be acceptable. 
That is as far as we went. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):
NATO says a full withdrawal of Yugoslav forces is essential. 
Our foreign minister is being quoted in the press as saying something different.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the five conditions which have been set out are very clear.  
There is an element too that we have to keep in mind. 
We have to ensure that there will not be war there. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the U.S. Congress takes the support of its troops very seriously. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We have done it in the past. 
We are doing it now and we will do it in the future.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
That is the important point. 
That is exactly what we need to get to.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
There will be a debate on the estimates on June 9. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Other new credits have also been put in place. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, this is a classic scenario. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Therefore, such benefits do come under federal jurisdiction.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Which is it going to be?  
Mr. Speaker, it has been the same story for 30 years.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
It was an error by NATO that we deplore.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not think so. 
We shall never lose sight of that. 
It is very important.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Mr. Speaker, it just seems to be getting worse for Canadian farmers.  
Fusarium is a disease affecting cereal crops across Canada. 
Last year alone it cost $70 million to Manitoba farmers. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Farmers themselves want to be certain that the food supply is safe. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the minister of agriculture. 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
We will do it in a responsible and balanced way, respecting the priorities of Canadians.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am overwhelmed with emotion when I hear that.  
That is the compassionate approach of the minister and the government.  
When will they make that connection?  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
And I believe the Chinese share that view.  
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
As a result, a substantially increased security presence has been developed. 
It is simply a matter of demonstrating their point of view. 
There are of course much wider demonstrations that seem to be organized or orchestrated. 
We regret the fact that this is the way of presentation.  
The hon. member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley.  
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Exactly when is he going to report?  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the government will be responding fairly soon to the MacKay task force.  
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.

If changes need to be made we will accommodate them.  
Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-East York, Lib.):
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
We all share in the responsibility to find every missing child. 
One missing child is one too many.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
The minister is being given a second chance to right a wrong. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
I would be pleased to hear them if they wish to present them to me.

The hon. Minister of Canadian Heritage.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
I can assure him that we will work together. 
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there has been much talk of the Kosovar refugees recently. 
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the solicitor general.  
What is the current status of the investigation? 
When does the solicitor general expect charges to be laid? 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, as I indicated to my hon. colleague, the investigation continues. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
We phoned Coastal Shipping and guess what? 
He is still the boss. 
He owns the company.  
Will the minister now please obey the law and remove Mr. Woodward from the board? 
Shame on you, Mr. Minister.  
I would ask hon. members, please, to always address the Speaker. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
The appointment of Mr. Woodward was the prerogative of the provincial government. 
MILITARY COLLEGE IN SAINT-JEAN 
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of National Defence. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Canadians demand that the government protect, preserve and conserve our waters.  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
All provinces, with the exception of Quebec, agreed to the moratorium.  
We expect that we will achieve that. 
We will be amending the International Boundary Waters Treaty Act. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
It is long past due. 
Please, think of the families and crew.  
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
He has also mentioned that he hopes to make an announcement sometime this year.  
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Who will fund this cleanup? 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
The safety of the community will be protected.  
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not think we can make a comparison. 
In good Canadian style we are trying to build a bridge between those two positions.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
We will deal with it every time we negotiate with the provinces.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
According to experts a gear box failure could be catastrophic. 
The minister said within two weeks. 
That was two weeks ago.  
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
The problems we have recently seen are being addressed. 
We will continue to do what is necessary to keep our aircraft flying safely.  
The Americans have them and the British air force have them also.  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Charles Hubbard (Miramichi, Lib.):
Unfortunately in Canada there is a critical shortage of donated organs.

This will require some boundary adjustments for all centres. 
Mr. Speaker, I would ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
It is still late.  
The quickest response was 58 days.  
I will certainly look into them.  
We are running at 93%. 
As the member knows, some questions involve consulting every department in government. 
We are working as hard as we can. 
Shall the remaining questions stand?  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
What is his view of the way the government actually does its accounting? 
Perhaps he could elaborate on that point.  
Mr. Speaker, that gives me carte blanche, does it not? 
What do I think of the way the government does accounting? 
I think it does not do it right. 
It is disobeying the rules.  
In fact, the auditor general has said as much. 
The government is doing this continuously. 
According to its numbers it has put $11.5 billion into health care. 
That is the number its spin doctors like to put out.  
The government should not be able to do it. 
It is not an extra amount at all. 
I have checked this out because I did not understand it. 
At a committee meeting I explicitly asked the officials to explain this to me.  
It is also clear after we read the documents for the fifth time. 
We can finally understand that this is what the government is really saying. 
There is zero more in the budget. 
The government is taking an amount and milking it for all it can. 
I think that is dishonest, if I dare say that. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion it was used in a parliamentary fashion.  
Mr. Speaker, I apologize. 
I mean no offence, as I am sure the hon. member understands. 
The government's accounting methods are not correct. 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
I do not think any Canadian would have a problem with that. 
The government is proposing changes to the registered education savings plan. 
I do not think anyone would have much of a problem with that. 
We see the government again addressing this issue in a piecemeal way. 
The government estimated that it expects a $3 billion surplus in the budget. 
They feel that tax credits should not be the driving force.  
What Canadians are asking for is real tax relief.  
Sixty per cent of our income is going toward taxes. 
We have heard the business community screaming about high taxes. 
Now we have the business community, the provinces and Canadians talking about high taxes. 
Students are talking about high taxes.  
However, nothing has happened in 1998 and 1999 with respect to tax relief. 
Where is this tax relief they are talking about?  
There is no tax relief for them. 
There is just a manipulation of accounting procedures. 
Where is the tax relief that the government talks about? 
Now we see that the surplus will jump from $7 billion to $12 billion. 
What will the government do with the surplus?  
It is not sufficient to put back the money the government took away. 
That is why we have a health care crisis. 
There are other areas where the government could cut waste. 
The provinces have already started to address the issue of tax cuts. 
They understand that the burden on the Canadian taxpayer is very heavy. 
Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam, Lib.):
I have been here for only a year. 
We have a balanced budget and a few other things.  
Members opposite mentioned health care. 
Members opposite mentioned high income taxes. 
Does it make sense to borrow money to give people a break? 
This government will do it the way it should be done. 
When there is money in the budget it will lower taxes.  
Does the member not believe in a balanced budget? 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am a little confused. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That is a really good point of order. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Let us sort it out then. 
Was the question asked of the member for Calgary East?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am so glad he rose to ask me a clear question. 
He asks what party I am in. 
I am from the official opposition which will keep him in line.  
He talks about a balanced budget. 
No wonder he has not been asking any questions. 
He does not know his facts. 
Canadians are saying enough of this tax burden. 
Where are you in coming along and saying yes- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Please address each other through the Chair.  
Mr. Speaker, my apologies. 
I should talk through the Chair.  
The government is talking about the tax relief it has given out. 
That is what we are talking about. 
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
The title of the bill is sort of scary in itself. 
It certainly has been.  
The EI commissioner has clearly said that a premium of $2.00 per $100- 
It is down from $3.05.  
Mr. Richard M. Harris:
I see the hon. member for Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam is in the audience. 
What about a brain transplant.  
Mr. Richard M. Harris:
That is good and we certainly support that.  
The government has an insatiable appetite for taxing Canadians. 
I know that you are a free enterpriser, Mr. Speaker. 
Both families earn a household income of $60,000 a year. 
It was their decision to make. 
The government has not addressed that yet. 
That is tax discrimination of one of the very worst kinds. 
The Liberals have an unfair, unclear, incomprehensible and unacceptable tax code. 
Canadians have been looking to the government for some sort of tax relief. 
More jobs have been created in Ontario. 
The government stands up and takes the credit for that. 
Has it no shame?  
Mr. Klein in Alberta and Mr. Harris in Ontario have done well. 
He has a very buoyant economy. 
The Liberals still do not get the message. 
They said they were very happy to see him leave town. 
Why is it able to help us by buying our products? 
It is because its economy is booming. 
Why is it booming? 
We will unequivocally oppose Bill C-72.  
Mr. Charles Hubbard (Miramichi, Lib.):
We have to come reality. 
We are not here to speak for 10 minutes and consume the 10 minutes. 
Mr. Richard M. Harris:
We are talking about total household incomes. 
No family is making more money than the other.  
That is the tax discrimination I was talking about. 
I do not know why the member did not understand that. 
There is no difference in household income.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I was very interested in my colleague's speech. 
I made a phone call asking about this and apparently it is true. 
Can my colleague who just spoke comment on where he thinks this money came from? 
Does he know anything about this? 
How wonderful that the government is paying off the debt.  
Mr. Richard M. Harris:
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Elk Island for the question. 
I think it raises another very serious question. 
Where did it come up with $30 billion.  
I pose that as a question to the hon. parliamentary secretary.  
I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
I have a very short question for my colleague. 
This legislation is piecemeal tax relief. 
Mr. Richard M. Harris:
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Calgary East for the question. 
It raises another question. 
Why is he doing that? 
It is shameful that the finance minister would consider a proposal like that.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to make a point to my hon. friend.  
I think he has a good point. 
I would like my friend to comment on that.  
Mr. Richard M. Harris:
Mr. Richard M. Harris:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
We can criticize almost anything. 
That is part of the government-opposition interchange.  
He came from an accountancy background to this place. 
I have talked with him personally. 
I find him to be a logical reasonable individual.  
He has no axe to grind. 
He has no reason to put a spin on the proposal. 
He is a straightforward accountant. 
Let me quote that specifically again. 
As an accountant he went through and picked out the figures. 
This is very useful. 
He turned his attention to spending. 
Then he turned his attention to taxes. 
In 1999 it proposes to take in $157 billion in taxes. 
That is an increase of more than $40 billion.  
There is some truth in that statement. 
The member talked about the debt. 
He looked at the figures. 
Accountants really have a talent for this. 
It is difficult to refute when the figures are so plain.  
This money will not be spent this year. 
It should not be booked this year. 
It should not artificially reduce the deficit.  
The Liberal MP, an accountant, then turned his attention to public debt charges. 
We are told debt charges are going down. 
The cumulative debt and cumulative interest are going down. 
The interest rate is going down. 
These are not my comments and not my criticism. 
These are the comments and criticism of the Liberal MP who is an accountant.  
We come back to the issue of the hidden surplus. 
I query again why would the surplus be hidden? 
The Liberal accountant MP asked the question, not myself. 
His answer was an emphatic no. 
The budget was a health care budget. 
That in itself was wonderful news. 
How could anyone criticize it?  
I am not now speaking for the accountant across the way. 
I am speaking for myself. 
How could an individual Liberal in good conscience say what he said? 
It is a great difficulty. 
I will say it again as plainly as I can. 
Are there good things in the budget? 
Let me take a few moments to say yes, there are. 
Are there things that I will not critique? 
They are the ones that are probably the most condemnatory.  
Let me summarize the comments of the Liberal MP accountant. 
I have not identified him so that he will not be embarrassed. 
The debt will the same from now until 2001 according to the budget projections. 
This flies in the face of good accounting practice. 
The auditor general said it. 
The Liberal MP said it. 
The accountant MP said it, and I will rest my case with his words.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
I do not blame the provincial government. 
I have had personal experience in this regard.  
When did we get to that stage of development in Canada? 
I blame the members over there totally for this situation. 
For that we are supposed to be eternally grateful.  
I am sure his range of knowledge is wider than mine. 
I can speak only anecdotally, having seen these things with my own eyes. 
There were large grants to successful businesses totalling billions of dollars. 
The fact of the matter is the public does not care. 
It does not want to point at anybody. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise in debate. 
People would like to blame that totally on the provincial government. 
They could not stand the Canadian tax regime.  
It was a very simple form and I gladly did it. 
Now it is no longer a simple form. 
It has become a very complicated form. 
Let us talk about simple forms. 
Members opposite tell me that it is a very simple form. 
The first line would be ``How much did you make?'' 
The second line would be ``What were the expenses?'' 
The third line would be ``Kindly remit the rest''. 
That is about the way it is.  
That is the kind of form it is. 
It is a Rubik's cube.  
Canadians have a right to know about our budget. 
Another thank you should be mentioned. 
I must mention something that really bothers me. 
On three occasions Brian and Louise did not have much choice. 
Both paid large income taxes. 
Both paid huge agriculture taxes. 
Both paid huge road taxes, and they do not have any roads. 
Their children received their birth certificates from the states. 
Talk about a government that does not miss a beat. 
Who do they contact? 
What will their member of parliament do? 
We need to humanize this whole idea of extracting money. 
We simply make fools out of ourselves by doing this. 
Finally, I want to draw the attention of the House to another factor. 
What did the government do? 
It said ``Give us $5,500 all at once''. 
My argument is that members opposite are wrong. 
I think that Canadians deserve a little more attention. 
I would bet that our income tax forms arrived at the same time. 
There are more than 200 students going to university in Minot. 
Why do we do this? 
Why do we continue to tax ourselves to a standstill?  
I most certainly will not be supporting Bill C-72. 
I cannot do it. 
Mr. Charles Hubbard (Miramichi, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am somewhat amazed to hear the hon. member. 
Where does the member think that $900 million came from? 
Was there some magic pot or was it from taxation?  
Mr. Speaker, I am glad the hon. member asked that question. 
What did the minister of agriculture for Manitoba know that we did not know?  
They did not deserve the forms which were sent out. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
He needed an MRI. 
He got his MRI and was told ``You, sir, have a brain tumour. 
How much is it going to cost?'' 
They operated and removed most of the tumour. 
The gentleman went home quite content.  
It is absolutely unconscionable that Canadians would be treated that way. 
He saved his own life. 
The officials refused to give him treatment. 
He was refused that surgery outright for at least three months. 
We have to face reality. 
That is not the only case. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
And the bells having rung: 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Just for clarification, is the vote on the motion proposed by the parliamentary secretary?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The question was put by the parliamentary secretary.  
The vote is accordingly deferred until the end of Government Orders today.  
YOUTH CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
Today, we will continue debating the motion moved by the member for Laval-Centre.  
In Quebec, the rate of youth crime is the lowest in Canada. 
All the kids from the neighbourhood liked to come and play in the sandbox.  
My son was no saint at that time. 
I do not think so. 
The justice minister represents the riding of Edmonton West, in Alberta. 
Thus, one evening's mistake could ruin a lifetime.  
It would seem the Government of Saskatchewan is getting ready to compensate him.  
Naturally, such situations give us pause for reflection.  
Andre Normandeau, a criminologist at the University of Montreal, said, and I quote: 
They have retained a highly punitive mindset. 
Changing the law is too simple and, more importantly, ineffective. 
She wondered why what is unjustified and inappropriate should be made possible.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to get up to speak to Bill C-68. 
The neurological development of the child's brain is impeded. 
This has a consequence as the child grows to adolescence and on to become adult.  
As they say, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  
Are we trying to transmogrify something that cannot be done?  
Why are we not doing it?  
It could save us $30,000 per child by bringing in this program. 
The government bureaucracy says it is a good idea. 
Members on this side say it is a good idea. 
We should be looking at it.  
We listened to our colleagues from Quebec who are opposed to this bill. 
They brought up some very good points. 
We should be looking at the program Quebec has. 
We should be paying attention to what is being done there.  
Parents are and have to be the axis around which the program revolves. 
No amount of money will replace the intrinsic importance of good parenting. 
Bill C-68 has three elements concerning the role of parents. 
That is extremely important. 
We all know the effort that he puts in in the House working toward children. 
We all appreciate his commitment very much.  
It is simply abandoning these children. 
Is that not in itself a form of incarceration?  
That is what is scary. 
This age group needs help and needs it badly. 
It is really a money issue. 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Clayton was stabbed numerous times and left for dead by two young thugs. 
These are young murderers and they deserve to be held responsible for their crimes. 
However in this case maybe the law will be on their side. 
Canadians have seen these kinds of cases all too often in the last 15 years. 
Because they are children. 
Because we say they do not know any better. 
I believe that many of the kids do know better.  
It is my hope that the Young Offenders Act will be assigned to the garbage. 
That was two years ago. 
We have a youth justice committee in my riding. 
It has been quite successful. 
This is the kind of program we need to encourage.  
We must also teach the consequences of actions. 
That should be a fundamental aspect. 
Because the government needs to set an example for others. 
I heard a colleague from the Bloc address this. 
I beg to differ with that. 
I appreciate the fact that there is a lower crime rate in Quebec. 
Nobody wants to listen to what Canadians are saying.  
Hence the bill that has come forward has all the loopholes one can imagine.  
We recognize the provinces have an important role to play. 
The committee listened to the provinces. 
The provinces are not satisfied with the legislation. 
We should not be surprised that this recommendation was not included. 
The government continues to attack the official opposition. 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
It is called the Jasmin report, no doubt after the chairman of the task force. 
I quote from the Jasmin report: 
One such simplistic response is substituting get-tough measures for educational approaches. 
The coalition is composed of well known individuals. 
First, there is the Commission des services juridiques du Quebec, which represents the defence. 
Indeed, it has decreased by 23% between 1991 to 1997. 
I am deeply troubled by this kind of thinking.  
All those things are inter-related, and it is not coincidence. 
We must go to the roots of the problems. 
It is important for those who are listening to understand this.  
This gives us a lot of food for thought.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
An attempt has been made by the government to address some of the problems. 
However what will occur in this instance is not the full package.  
Again I think the key word in all of this is accountability. 
That is not the case at all. 
That is certainly not the position that has been taken by the Conservative Party.  
As it currently stands, that does not exist in our Criminal Code. 
It exists in other countries. 
It once existed in our Criminal Code under the old Juvenile Delinquents Act. 
As I said at the outset, the issue is accountability. 
We are saying that it should be taken one step further. 
There has to be something to start the process.  
To accomplish all of this the provinces will have to receive greater funding. 
That has never occurred. 
The Progressive Conservatives froze that funding. 
They are common goals. 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
I agree with him absolutely that we need funding for this.  
The Young Offenders Act will be re-packaged. 
We have to focus on that. 
That is one area in which the government has really been slack.  
I do not think the government has really done anything there.  
It could be anything. 
There is a positive step. 
I agree with my hon. colleague from Surrey North. 
I think we need to go one step further. 
I would submit that is not happening now. 
That is something we should be doing.  
I really want to emphasize that. 
We have to look at prevention at the front end. 
We do not want our youth put into warehouses and locked up. 
We want to make sure they are productive members of society. 
I do not think the government is putting the resources into it that are required. 
I do not think it is compelling the parents enough to participate in the process.  
We know that young offenders are going to be released into society. 
Again, I want to focus on the resources. 
Under this bill they will not have them. 
The $206 million does not even come close to cutting it.  
That is over three years.  
I have just been reminded that that will be over three years.  
That is her biggest frustration. 
If they need psychological help we could provide it, but that is not there.  
We need a national youth justice program. 
It is not the answer.  
There will not be a lot of difference. 
We have to restore that.  
Let us deal with them. 
It will not be an easy ride. 
It will also deal with the rehabilitative side.  
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
This excerpt is important in the context of the current debate.  
The Jasmin report sates: 
One such simplistic response is substituting get-tough measures for educational approaches. 
Instead, the minister decided to reform herself. 
She decided to adopt the philosophy of western cowboys. 
Why not have public hangings while we are at it? 
The Reformers and the Conservatives are going a little too far.  
I condemn the Liberal government for moving toward such radical solutions. 
I think Quebec's approach was better. 
We already know there will be a problem in Quebec. 
However, statistics do not lie. 
The crime rate in Quebec is the lowest in Canada. 
The Barreau du Quebec does not agree. 
And so has Quebec's president of the bar.  
Juvenile delinquency breeds new recruits for gangs like the Hell's Angels and the Jokers. 
I am ready to take over in a motorcycle gang''.  
It seems to me that publishing the name of these young people is counterproductive. 
The Quebec system believes in rehabilitation. 
Unfortunately, I think that the minister opposes this. 
That is totally deplorable.  
There are not just the visions of Quebec and Canada that differ. 
Some people understood how to deal with the issue in Quebec. 
This judge was Jean-Charles Coutu. 
He travelled to the far north on a regular basis to solve problems. 
The rate of success was very high. 
Once more I wish to congratulate you. 
Except for the short quotation, you spoke without any notes.  
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
I was told that young people must have respect for the justice system. 
I believe that is something which cannot be started young enough. 
I realize these are qualifications. 
That is not the answer. 
That is a loose term.  
Like so many other statutes in law, this is open to interpretation. 
I guess it all comes down to interpretation.  
The youth is safe again. 
The definitions are all open to interpretation and challenge. 
I guess that is a perverse Liberal job creation.  
It is in the area of definitions and interpretations that gets us most in trouble. 
Parents know that sometimes we have to be firm and say no. 
My constituents were clear on this very distinction.  
That is simplistic; just pass the buck but not the money.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
That amendment reads as follows: 
Why has the Bloc Quebecois introduced this amendment? 
Because, basically, this bill is unacceptable. 
They would like to see far more severe measures. 
At least, it is working very well in Quebec. 
This will be counterproductive. 
This is not a good model. 
It has not yielded good results so far.  
In Quebec we have developed our own approach. 
In that sense, the existing legislation is effective. 
It fulfils its objectives. 
However, there is a prerequisite, which is the will to succeed. 
We must therefore invest the necessary energy and resources. 
We currently find ourselves in a very difficult situation in Canada. 
The government wants to change an act that works well. 
I think it is an interesting example from that point of view.  
Provinces who try this approach will see that it works. 
I have one final point. 
Allow me to congratulate the hon. member for speaking without written notes. 
That was very good.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
So it had to be changed. 
There appear to be some changes. 
This is an act written by lawyers for lawyers. 
Of course we all know that lawyers do look after their own. 
What a great example to set for the kids.  
By the time they reach their teens, they are hardened little criminals. 
We have to do something for these youngsters.  
Those people certainly have not raised any kids. 
There has to be some certainty in the law. 
This is all so wishy-washy, so poorly tied together. 
Again it is written by lawyers for lawyers. 
They can find all the loopholes. 
They know where to jump to get over the barriers.  
However it does not improve the justice system in this country by one iota. 
The government had the chance. 
Attacks like these are revolting.  
I congratulate the hon. member on his speech.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
They are vicious acts which really need to be addressed.  
Finally they thought that the government was going to take youth crime seriously.  
This was in spite of the fact that offenders have progressively become younger. 
Instead it chose to once again ignore their requests.  
There have been many reasons associated with committing crime among Canada's youth. 
Millions of Canadians continue to struggle to survive while living in poverty. 
Over 1.5 million Canadian children live in poverty. 
Our party has been working with poverty for the last while.

Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
We need rules that let the small guy trade with the big. 
Horticulture too is import sensitive but export dependent. 
This sector is but one example of the great stake they hold in the talks.  
Meanwhile, our supply management system has proven year in and year out its effectiveness.  
Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
She is a strong member of the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food. 
These are some of the main highlights of the discussion. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
The House is now going to hear some real opposition.  
The auditor general recently came out with his report. 
The answer was a very solid yes. 
The next question was how much of this was happening? 
The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans indicated that he did not know the answer.  
This is at a time when the world is clamouring for more scientific information.  
The government talks about needing better science. 
We cannot have better science if it keeps laying them all off. 
That is what happens here all the time.  
We recently had a concern about seals. 
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
He is considerably wrong on some of his facts this evening.  
That is a practice that has been going on. 
There is greater evidence that kind of observer system works. 
That is a step forward.  
(The House adjourned at 7.28 p.m.)
