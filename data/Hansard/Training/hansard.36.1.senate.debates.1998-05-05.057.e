Committee Authorized to Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Lerner Report on Cancellation of Pearson Airport Agreements-Notice of Inquiry 
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I certainly repudiate the findings of the study. 
By no means is that a correct statement. 
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I have no specific knowledge of the item to which the honourable senator refers. 
I do not know whether the matter would be worth pursuing. 
Reportedly under oath, he also stated: 
That is a hypothetical question on which I would not care to comment.  
Honourable senators, something is clearly wrong here. 
The answer to the honourable senator's question is yes. 
Representation of Visible Minorities in Federal Public Service-Government Position 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
The report states at page 65: 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The honourable senator raises a valid point. 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
We could certainly offer him some good advice.  
My question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Edward M. Lawson :
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government of the Senate. 
Ultimately the federal government will have to pay. 
Maybe they can take it out of the pension of the retiring senators.  
To do that, he would have to steal it. 
He said, "Were they penalized for that?" 
He said, "Well, can you give me a guarantee?" 
I agree with that point. 
May we have that assurance?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, I have a question for the nation's top ranking chief petty officer. 
Very few rise to rank of minister, believe me.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Addition of Caffeine to Soft Drinks-Government Position 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Again, I will bring forward whatever information I can find.

The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Bill to Amend-Report of Committee Adopted 
Dr. Haidasz was the opening and the closing witness at our hearings. 
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
The manner in which he has addressed it is also important.  
Therefore, we should not wait until an issue arises.  
I commend Senator Moore for his initiative. 
I do not look at the issues as technicalities but as safeguards.  
We cannot allow indiscriminate processes within a commission of inquiry. 
We would not want subpoenas to be served indiscriminately. 
Justice should not be delayed, nor should it be frustrated by procedures. 
Discerning the facts and the truth should be paramount.  
It also forced Ontario to look at its legislation. 
This would reduce the frustration to commissions of inquiry. 
Therefore, this motion is timely. 
It is in the best interests of the provinces to tackle this situation.  
On motion of Senator Carstairs, debate adjourned.  
Hon. Thelma J. Chalifoux :
rBST is a synthetic growth hormone produced in a laboratory. 
Cows produce this hormone on their own. 
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
Honourable senators, I support Senator Whelan's motion. 
However, those examples do not exist in reality. 
They do not want it. 
I support Senator Whelan in his motion.  
It is usually given after the ninth week of lactation. 
To quote the senator directly: 
Trace amounts of antibiotics in our food only serve to compound this problem.  
We are now seeing the adverse effects of antibiotics in the human body. 
Another dairy farmer with whom I discussed this issue said: 
When you start pushing these good families - 
You get a situation that can best be described as the "Flush-a-Bye" kind.  
Twin calves are much smaller in size and are often born prematurely. 
The problems with this are obvious - less chance of survival. 
The tests on cattle have also been very limited in duration.  
Hon. Wilbert J. Keon :
On the face of it, the motion is a simple request and a reasonable one. 
Something had to be done and a great deal was done.  
The Ontario law was passed in 1927. 
rBST produces more milk, not better milk. 
To date, we have only a summary of this committee's conclusion. 
One explanation is benign, the other very troubling. 
The benign explanation is that the knowledge available through medical science is never static. 
In 1990 the answer was quite definite that it did not.  
In other words, it does promote cancer. 
In conclusion, I would say that we have a safe milk supply. 
No one suggests that rBST will improve milk quality. 
The motion reminds our regulators to be very diligent. 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Senate adjourned until Wednesday, May 6, 1998, at 1:30 p.m.
