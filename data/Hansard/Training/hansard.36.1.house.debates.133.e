EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 133 
Tuesday, October 6, 1998 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege.  
Colleagues, this is clearly not a question of privilege. 
I am going to rule that it is not a question of privilege. 
Mr. Speaker, may I respond very briefly to say with great- 
There are other means by which the minister can do this.  
We are now going to proceed to the orders of the day.  
Mr. Speaker, if this is not considered a question of privilege- 
No, Mr. Speaker, it is separate. 
I would ask for unanimous consent to table the letter in the House.  
Does the House give permission to put this question?  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
There is no question about that. 
The hon. parliamentary secretary is correct.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We are going to proceed with the rules of the House. 
The hon. parliamentary secretary gave information to the House which is correct. 
Any one of us can see that if we just look at the rules.  
Now we will proceed to the daily routine of business.  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Reform was instrumental in having this become a focus of the report. 
The government response to the east coast report of the standing committee is pathetic. 
It is typically bureaucratic and merely defends the status quo. 
The minister tried to cut a deal with us. 
I asked for a copy of this opinion and I received it. 
It is very enlightening.  
The minister has declared that these reports contain confidential information or trade secrets. 
The burden of proof should be on the foreign vessels to do this. 
It should not be up to the minister to so declare.  
These observer reports are produced by public authorities in order to protect the public. 
Also, the chair should be consulted about reviewing the documents in camera. 
The committee turned that suggestion down flat.  
This of course did not satisfy the committee request in any way.  
Instead of pursuing the public interest, DFO has catered to foreign interests. 
My request for papers is still on the order paper. 
Some are highly migratory and cross the 200 mile limit unpredictably.  
Certainly this would be controversial. 
We all know that compromise is not the answer. 
Canada's current attitude is ``resistance is useless''. 
Rather than supporting the status quo the minister should be setting a new course. 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to get the member's comments on a few issues. 
Those were key recommendations in the report. 
He talked about where he had requested observer reports. 
That is the prime reason for his removal. 
No one can convince me that his removal was voluntary. 
It was initiated by the minister and the department. 
There is no question about that.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
I admit that the standing committee on fisheries has done very good work. 
Foreign fishing is under control. 
I have a lot of respect for the member opposite. 
Let me directly ask a question of the member. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The hon. member is correct. 
The hon. member is directing questions to the hon. member for Vancouver Island North. 
He is about to ask a second one. 
Mr. Speaker, I believe my questions are relevant.  
Is he trying to get in the favour of the leadership of the Reform Party? 
We are not meeting our full TAC requirement on various species.  
Why is that happening? 
Obviously they just wanted to play games.  
We sat on the committee together last year.  
I could never be accused of co-operating with the government. 
We have a lot of living examples. 
We have the same kind of compromise. 
There is no unanimous consent.  
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join in this debate. 
That the House do now proceed to the orders of the day.  
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
COMPREHENSIVE NUCLEAR TEST-BAN TREATY IMPLEMENTATION ACT 
We were the first country to acknowledge and decide to become a non-nuclear state.  
We have on a number of occasions chosen not to sell our nuclear technology. 
These difficult achievements are now threatened. 
The credibility of the non-proliferation regime is being sorely tested.  
We are faced with a new argument for nuclear realpolitik. 
They diminished rather than improved regional security for those nations themselves. 
In fact increasing instability developed in the region. 
This subject cannot be taken lightly. 
It is not a subject for playing partisan politics. 
That is why Canada took a stand of strongly condemning these actions. 
The Prime Minister at the G-8 meetings led the charge. 
Proliferation needs to be stopped dead in its tracks.  
I understand it could be ready as early as this fall. 
The committee canvassed Canadian views on this matter. 
That is the other part of the equation. 
That is also part of the commitment we have to make.  
The START II treaty still is stalled. 
Other commitments being made are discounted. 
That is the commitment that has been made.  
Clandestine testing under this treaty will be virtually impossible to do. 
States will need to think long and hard about any secret efforts. 
That is why we have to be consistent in our approach to this issue.  
It also establishes a very clear global norm against nuclear testing by all nations. 
This shows that global norms can work.  
It is a tough but necessary position in order to make our message clear. 
It basically says that Canada has not changed its position for 50 years. 
I believe Canadians want us to do that. 
I close with a statement by George Washington, the first U.S. president. 
It is one I have often been reminded of in the work I do. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Our party agrees and supports the overall principle of the bill.  
I believe we are going in the right direction.  
Most obviously, the international court comes to mind. 
We met with that group. 
We found out that it had a Canadian position. 
We met with those people five days before they left for Rome. 
They could not tell any of us what their position was. 
That is an example of where that should have been brought to the House. 
Canadians should have had a chance to comment on it.  
The Kyoto agreement is another one. 
It was not debated. 
The facts were not put out. 
Canadians did not have the necessary input. 
We could talk about UN conferences. 
We could talk about the conference in Beijing. 
We could talk about Cairo and population. 
At least we have a chance in the House to talk about this nuclear treaty. 
Heads rolled because of it. 
We were told about the monitoring systems. 
I had the opportunity to look at some of those monitoring systems. 
We have satellites in place. 
We have nuclear waste being weighed and measured. 
A satellite will immediately alert us to that.  
I still wonder if it is totally foolproof. 
I am concerned that we may be putting too much trust in that technology.  
We can certainly benefit from a business standpoint.  
We are technically able to do that. 
We have the equipment, we have the know how. 
It is important that we be part of that examination. 
First there is the cost. 
Canada has created a national authority for the CTBT implementation. 
I have to look at some of the quotes the minister has.  
We would all like to not have any nuclear weapons. 
There are 36 countries that have the capability to develop nuclear weapons. 
START III is totally stalled and is not going anywhere.  
If we examine the Russian situation, it is pretty easy to understand what is happening. 
The Russians are in economic free fall. 
They have lost their conventional means of defence. 
Would we like it to happen? 
There is no question. 
Everybody would like it to happen, but it is not reality.  
We have to worry about the countries that are not going to sign this treaty. 
The fact that we signed it is not what is significant. 
Let us consider the example of India and Pakistan. 
The minister referred to India and Pakistan a number of times. 
India has close to a billion people. 
India is jealous that China is taking the focus position of the west. 
They have clearly said that.  
Russia is on the inside because it has nuclear weapons. 
China is on the inside because it has nuclear weapons. 
That is flawed thinking. 
They clearly stated that.  
They have a huge population and poverty problem. 
It is a country of contrasts and diversity. 
They have a new government with the BJP, a coalition of 19 parties. 
They are raising their popularity through nationalism. 
However, we are being told today that India possesses 455 nuclear weapons. 
That is a huge economic problem. 
Pakistanis have their backs against the wall.  
During the cold war they backed the west. 
They helped the west in Afghanistan to defeat the Russians. 
India tested five nuclear weapons in the spring of this year. 
The Indian politicians made statements ``We are about to end the existence of Pakistan. 
That is a pretty serious charge. 
Obviously Pakistani politicians were listening to that pretty carefully. 
They have been in three wars since 1949. 
You must counter what India has done''.  
The Pakistan government sent envoys to all countries. 
Of course the west offered very little. 
The G-8 came out with a weak-kneed, wishy-washy statement. 
This is how this sort of thing happens. 
But that is how these kinds of situations arise.  
There are 600,000 Indian troops there. 
We have the people behind us. 
We have religion behind us. 
And we have nuclear weapons. 
We will use them and in 90 seconds 80 million people will be dead''. 
In 90 seconds 80 million people will be dead. 
That is what we are talking about. 
That is the reality.  
What should we do? 
We have a reputation. 
We are members of the G-7. 
We are friends with all of the countries involved and we can negotiate.  
Canada is positioned to do that. 
Russia was involved with India, so it is out. 
The U.S. was involved with Pakistan, so it is out. 
China is too busy economically, so it is out. 
Besides, China would not be accepted by Japan. 
Japan is interested, but it has an economic crisis. 
The U.S. is busy. 
Monica is keeping them busy. 
No one is as perfectly positioned as Canada to do something. 
This government should not just talk about it and condemn it and impose sanctions. 
That is not the way to do it.  
We are not allowing our ministers to talk about Pakistan and India. 
We were sending the right message by going there. 
We are the diplomats who could do something. 
We could do something about this issue. 
This government should be setting an example by doing that.  
Canada has a role. 
We have a moral role that we could play in this situation. 
We could talk about power. 
Pakistan has all kinds of hydro power that could easily be traded with India. 
There are natural transportation routes. 
There are 100 million people who could trade with each other. 
Instead of slapping on sanctions, screaming and shouting and condemning them, let us help them. 
Let us help both sides to solve this issue.  
Let us talk about Iraq.  
The people of Iraq. 
That is not the kind of action that works any more. 
North Korea constantly threatens that it will again start its nuclear program. 
It has acute famine. 
That creates serious instability in the world.  
Obviously there is drug money involved. 
Huge amounts of drugs are being brought from Afghanistan into Pakistan. 
All kinds of instability is being created in that region.  
We just do not deal with them by signing this piece of paper.  
Turkey's troops today are massing on the Syrian border. 
There are all kinds of such areas.  
Another interesting piece of information is the improvement of missiles by various countries. 
The bragging rights are as follows:
That is where it is at. 
That is not where it is at. 
It is just not the real world. 
We should also realize what the Canadian role is. 
Our role is a leadership role internationally. 
We will not be a superpower. 
We will not use weapons but we can use the weapon of diplomacy. 
To summarize, we certainly have a problem with all that bureaucracy. 
I cannot help but ask a question. 
How can it be so slow? 
That is something we should ask as well.  
My fourth concern is about all the rogue states. 
I have only talked about a few of them. 
In conclusion, we support the signing of this treaty. 
Let us get on with it. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
He has been seconded to other more pressing issues of the moment.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
We urge them to take that step now. 
The costs of this have been incredible. 
But the threat of nuclear annihilation lives on. 
I want to say a word in the context of Israel. 
Today it is about half that. 
In that treaty the nuclear weapons states in article VI have made it very clear. 
There are many individuals. 
In the early sixties my mother was a member of the Voice of Women. 
These are the people who have laid the groundwork for where we are today.  
I mention in particular the Canadian church leaders' statement. 
Its representatives appeared before the foreign affairs committee earlier this year. 
I will suggest some of the things we could be doing.  
Last year Canada voted against that resolution. 
We should become a nuclear free zone. 
Our government has shown leadership on land mines. 
Before closing I want to make a couple of additional points. 
I want to note the outstanding work of my colleagues on this issue.  
Nuclear weapons have been with us since the 1940s. 
The children of today are concerned. 
And they are right. 
That is the political leadership we are calling for now. 
This is what he said in his letter to the foreign affairs committee: 
He closed by saying: 
My country is badly in need of a new moral compass on this issue. 
We await your call.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Why is the test ban treaty a good thing? 
It maintains the status quo.  
Why is the status quo a good thing? 
On the other hand, why would it be risky to maintain the status quo? 
As we know there are some countries which do not like the status quo. 
They think there is some benefit to being part of a nuclear club. 
India and Pakistan tested in May. 
They want to be part of this new status quo. 
We must go further to discourage them and to rid them of these notions.  
This makes security an issue. 
Nuclear weapons are not land mines. 
They are a deterrent weapon that won the cold war. 
Let us not kid ourselves. 
We have relied on them for too long.  
This bill does not even mention the Department of National Defence. 
I am speaking because I am the defence critic. 
There are a few more things I would like to point out. 
Of course they were in power when those sales were made. 
We know the rest of the story.  
Love and flowers will not stop that threat. 
Canadians might have been led to believe that the world is a safer place. 
The reality is that it is not.  
They are the same types of issues.  
We have to take into account the context of current world events and security issues. 
However my party should be forthright. 
Nuclear weapons are not land mines. 
Certainly we are in favour of stopping proliferation. 
Certainly we are in favour of arms control. 
The world has been, is currently and will be a dangerous place. 
The minister talks about 50 years ago. 
To delude ourselves that the Russians are is very dangerous. 
To delude ourselves that they are not is also very dangerous.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the question. 
If they are sitting there with nuclear arms we need a deterrent. 
They need an alternative.  
Hopefully over a period of time we will eliminate them.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his very pointed and interesting speech.  
I am very interested in one aspect, though, that perhaps we have not touched upon. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member very much for the question. 
That is one thing I did not actually raise in my speech.  
The Russians have 30,000 weapons. 
There will definitely be a market. 
Unfortunately, as I have said, the Russians will not scrap them. 
They will try to sell them. 
Again, I would be very happy to work on any project like that.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson:
Mr. Speaker, I have a very brief question. 
Perhaps the member for Compton-Stanstead did not hear my initial question. 
I want to repeat it and ask for an answer.  
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I followed carefully the speech given by the hon. member. 
I have a question for him.  
If he does not accept that principle, how can we work toward it? 
That is a step forward and we should encourage it.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question. 
I am not clear what exactly he was asking. 
It was more a statement than a question.  
We see that a threat is still there. 
It will not go away tomorrow.  
An arms sale is still going on in the background. 
We cannot eliminate ours if they are going to be out there. 
The threat is still there.  
We lived through all the years of the cold war. 
We are still in that position. 
We are not in a cold war situation. 
Is that the assertion the hon. member is putting forward?  
Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member is reading between the lines.  
It will not happen overnight.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
That is far too long. 
It should take much less time.  
This test ban treaty is only the beginning. 
It has to work with other countries to pursue those.  
There has to be a downsizing of fissile materials. 
This is exceedingly important.  
The Canberra commission of 1996 put together some very important documents with respect to that. 
These fissile materials, these nuclear materials, are highly radioactive, carcinogenic, teratogenic and toxic. 
Some of them have half lives of hundreds of years. 
They get into the biosystem and multiply as they go up the food chain.  
Large amounts of this material have come from Siberia to the Arctic.  
It will not be possible for some of these countries to sign at this moment. 
We like to say the United States is the only super power that exists. 
In my view that is utterly false. 
This is not only for our individual security but for our collective security.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
I will read into the record again what this bill does. 
It is an attempt to ban the testing of nuclear weapons by limiting nuclear explosions. 
It makes it a crime to aid and abet such an action. 
As the official opposition we generally support this piece of legislation. 
That of course is easy to agree with. 
We have to pursue those two things. 
But there is a serious problem with some of these countries.  
Pakistan and India are in serious difficulties. 
Particularly with Pakistan and India we must emphasize that.  
This is a good debate today on a good bill. 
Unfortunately the cart is far ahead of the horse and that is too bad.  
It is the position of the official opposition to support this nuclear non-proliferation treaty. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
The committee has been diligently working on the nuclear issue. 
My question for the member deals with leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for both his comment and his question.  
His comment is well taken. 
That would democratize foreign policy especially. 
Foreign policy deals not just with Canadians, but with our international relations. 
Let us flush them out. 
Let us make them treat foreign affairs with the importance it should have.  
The member pointed out a very huge problem. 
We still do not have a plan. 
We can certainly track it, but we do not know what to do with it.  
I certainly support that initiative.  
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
A number of points can be made in connection with this bill. 
The next point has to do with the issue of nuclear liability. 
We have to determine new thresholds and establish a new approach. 
There is a qualifier in this request, namely if possible, prior notification.  
This idea of prior notification is highly desirable.  
This very important environmental issue also has economic implications. 
This needs to be expanded of course to other material as well.  
I hope that this quick review of items relating to this treaty is helpful. 
I congratulate the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the government for this very fine initiative.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Last year Canada voted against this resolution.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
My question is a historical one. 
Just recently we have made some agreements with Turkey. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I too would like to ask the member for Davenport a question. 
On the second point, NATO, this is a subject of continuous discussion and debate. 
I do not feel qualified enough to give an adequate reply.  
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
The museum itself opened in 1971 in the Bogarttown School which was built in 1857.  
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
This waste alone totals $765.4 million. 
Mr. Jerry Pickard (Chatham-Kent Essex, Lib.):
Her legacy instils a sense of pride in our history and in our origins. 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):
The lives they save may be their own.  
Mr. Raymond Lavigne (Verdun-Saint-Henri, Lib.):
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
The disputes go much deeper. 
Only then can we hope to provide a fair and level playing field.  
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
The Bloc offers its sincere condolences to the families of the victims.  
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
The government does not get it. 
Jobs are being lost, mills are shutting down and marriages are being torn apart.  
Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. 
Security forces are suppressing peaceful protests.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Only 15% of those corporate deadbeats made good on their loans.  
I am introducing a bill tomorrow that will repeal this discriminatory law. 
What will the government do?  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):
Their involvement with young people clearly shows their devotion to the community- 
The hon. member for West Nova.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Fishers in my riding are living in fear. 
They recognize that the government is doing very little to protect their industry. 
THE LATE PIERRE SAVARD 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
The reality is the government can no longer excuse these inequities. 
It can no longer deflect responsibility for fiscal abuse. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
He did not know whether they were animal, mineral or vegetable. 
How did that happen?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
I inquired and I found out. 
He will have to live with it.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Where is the minister's honesty? 
Where is his integrity? 
Please choose your words very carefully.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
He substantiated my story and I will not dignify that question with an answer.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
He has gone from ``I don't know who this person is. 
I don't know them by name'' to ``it is Frederick Toole from Saint John''. 
When will we go to the resignation?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
The hon. member for Edmonton North.  
The commission is in doubt. 
The damage has been done. 
The gig is up. 
When will he resign?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Solicitor General made a statement to the House this morning. 
He tabled a letter from the person on the trip with him. 
I think that it fully explains the situation.  
The facts speak for themselves. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Here again, he is doing so with the APEC story.  
First, the Prime Minister denies the evidence. 
Third, he orders an investigation to clear himself.  
My question is simply this:
When will he produce a letter of good behaviour from the ethics commissioner? 
That is all that is lacking in the habitual scenario.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Once the truth is known, we will act objectively.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Our mandate is very clear.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois does not have much of a point.  
In fact, it did so yesterday, and we hope that the testimony will be heard.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is also to the Prime Minister. 
Canadians recognize the solicitor general's remarks as prejudicial and inappropriate. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The hon. leader of the New Democratic Party.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
The Prime Minister has no choice but to demand his resignation. 
Why will the Prime Minister not do that?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
The chair of the foreign affairs committee was next.  
Surely the Prime Minister must for once fire the- 
The hon. solicitor general.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The inquiry started yesterday. 
Let them do their work.  
The police discharged its responsibilities as it was its duty to do. 
If there was something wrong the commission will find out.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
My question is to the Prime Minister. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I am satisfied with the word of the minister and the word of the lawyer- 
Colleagues, surely we should let the person answer the question. 
The Right Hon. Prime Minister had the floor. 
I am sorry I intervened.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
The country will be happy if we let them do their work.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, there is a letter that was discussed this morning by the minister. 
My question is to the Prime Minister. 
The minister did discuss it. 
He said in this House he should not. 
Should he not resign until this commission is over?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the answer is no.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
My question is as follows:
We do not think so. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this is incredible. 
That does not even pass the laugh test. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
It is a small community.  
I found out last night who it was. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister mentions Linda Tripp. 
In the U.S. they have DNA tests. 
Here we will have to start administering IQ tests. 
Mr. Speaker, in case- 
I would ask the hon. member to withdraw those last remarks about IQ tests.  
Mr. Speaker, I withdraw them.  
Why does he not quit fooling around, quit with the fairy tales and just resign?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Our responsibility is to the workers.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
I have heard denials in the face of the facts.  
Mr. Speaker, we have heard denials in the face of the facts. 
We have heard contradictions by the solicitor general. 
We have heard excuses and not apologies. 
The solicitor general of our country is simply not believable.  
I ask the member to go directly to his question.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, certainly not. 
I am satisfied with the explanation of the solicitor general. 
I wish the House of Commons would let the commission do its work.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
They did not wait for a subpoena, they have offered to testify. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
I would like an explanation from him.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, first things first, rBST has not been approved for sale in Canada. 
If someone is exerting pressure, they are not very effective in that fashion. 
We will not approve it unless it is safe.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
On Tuesday he came up with a completely different story. 
First he did not know him and now he knows him. 
There have been all kinds of details back and forth. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
This is exactly what happened. 
It is the absolute truth and I stand by it.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the solicitor general is digging himself into a deeper and deeper hole. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I sat here for two weeks defending the inquiry. 
I denied it this morning and I deny it now. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
No one knows this. 
Will he admit it here in his place this afternoon?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
No, Mr. Speaker, those are not the words that I used.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
My supplementary question is for the Prime Minister. 
The solicitor general said last week that he- 
My colleagues, we will hear the question. 
The hon. member for Palliser.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
I ask the hon. member to go directly to his question.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I took responsibility for my actions. 
I looked into the allegations. 
There is no necessity and I want to protect this process.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Now the Prime Minister's human shield, the solicitor general, is a human sieve.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have an inquiry going on. 
They just want to have something to attack the government on. 
Mr. John Maloney (Erie-Lincoln, Lib.):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Can he not see that?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
That is my question.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
What our government wants to do is to encourage young people to stay in school. 
That is what we want, not youth unemployment.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.  
We are continuing with that type of enforcement throughout.  
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
This new agreement contains a specific clause that protects the existing agreement. 
Therefore all the existing agreements will be protected in this agreement.  
Therefore it is a system that needs to be discussed in order to avoid duplication.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, here is what we have heard today. 
We have heard the solicitor general tell two different stories. 
In summary, I ask when this will minister resign.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I feel very strongly about the issue of civilian oversight. 
I have said that for the last few weeks. 
THE LATE LEONARD JONES 
Mrs. Claudette Bradshaw (Moncton-Riverview-Dieppe, Lib.):
Len Jones at the time was the mayor of Moncton. 
I have known Mr. Jones for a long time. 
They were too young. 
I went to different agencies and they said the same.  
I remember my discussion with him. 
He said ``You know, Claudette, I am a family man. 
I have always believed in what you have done for children. 
My daughter is going out west and she would like us to move with her''. 
Len Jones was there for children. 
He was always there for me with the head start program. 
He always believed in prevention. 
He had hard battles to win sometimes. 
I thank the House for the chance to speak about Mr. Jones. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
He was another Canadian who bravely battled cancer.  
I have learned that his great passions were law and politics. 
He was a formidable opponent in the courtroom. 
Mr. Jones will be missed by all who had the privilege of knowing him.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I note the words of the member for Moncton. 
THE LATE DONALD MUNRO 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Born in Regina, Don was always a very proud westerner. 
His postings were as numerous as his interests. 
He served as head of the Canadian delegation in Vientiane, Laos. 
We extend our condolences to his wife Lynn and his two stepchildren.  
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Born in Regina, he went to school in Vancouver, graduating in 1939. 
In 1967 he was made ambassador to Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Panama. 
He then became the diplomat in residence at Dalhousie University. 
On behalf of the Reform Party I extend our deepest condolences to his family.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
He began his career in 1939 as a teacher. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
I remember Don Munro personally. 
We sat together in this Chamber for five years. 
He was a person of strong views and strong convictions. 
On behalf of the NDP I extend our sincere condolences to his family.  
COMPREHENSIVE NUCLEAR TEST-BAN TREATY IMPLEMENTATION ACT 
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
It is the use by the military of technology developed for civilian purposes. 
One analysis shows the following: 
Time has come for this contradiction to stop.  
Again, however, action is required and there are solutions. 
Canada's good reputation must be earned anew every day.  
But it is not the last, as we have seen.  
Canadians and Quebeckers expect nothing less.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Unfortunately the reality is that we still face a very desperate situation. 
The threat is something which is still very present and very grave.  
We have to be aware of and realize that this danger is still very present.  
In Indonesia 100 million people are living below the poverty line. 
Families would have adequate housing and people would have jobs.  
Article VI of the 1968 non-proliferation treaty states: 
The nuclear weapon states have not lived up to their end of the bargain. 
This aspect of the treaty which passed in 1968 has not come to fruition. 
That is what we are calling on the Canadian government to do here today.  
Canada could become a nuclear weapons free zone.  
This is something that could be done on a national basis.  
It is something Canada should be part of. 
We should not be opposing it. 
We should be an active participant in the new agenda coalition.  
The same can be done to abolish nuclear weapons. 
This is what the NDP believes Canada's role should be. 
We believe that very firmly.  
That is the work of the Canadian Network to Abolish Nuclear Weapons. 
It was a very significant ruling.  
It produces the Trident submarine. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
What does a bill like this one tell us? 
But where will an act and a treaty such as these lead us? 
This is a threat to international peace, directly and indirectly.  
This is interesting, because an idea is turning into reality. 
It all hangs together. 
The hon. member tells me it is 21. 
Let me hasten to add that 21 states have ratified the treaty. 
We must speak plainly today for the benefit of those listening. 
This is truly an international movement. 
The same is true of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.  
This is an extremely important step.  
That was a reality.  
At the time, this was a preconceived notion in the international community.  
The Minister of Public Works will remember that. 
That is nothing to be sneezed at.  
What we are discussing here is a multilateral approach involving a number of states. 
First, there is a reference to 44 designated states. 
Many in this place have much to learn from this. 
South Africa and many other countries also provided learning experiences.  
This was the train of events. 
France is a case in point. 
This debate today is about the future, not the past. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to be able to participate in this debate. 
I welcome the opportunity to do so. 
I am a baby boomer. 
I am part of the post-Hiroshima generation. 
Most recently a study came forward with respect to this particular issue.  
It was uncertain whether that would be the end of the world. 
It is something that has always stuck with me.  
As children we experienced terror. 
What we need to do today is say yes. 
We live in a very dangerous world. 
To some extent that outrage was justified. 
Canada is part of that club. 
We make a big deal about how we do not have nuclear weapons. 
We want something to be done about that and something should be.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Shall Clause 2 carry?  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Chairman, I have a question for the minister. 
Last year Canada chose not to support this resolution. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
We indicated that we had to see the exact wording. 
They have not finalized the exact wording of the resolution. 
(Clause 2 agreed to) 
(Clauses 3 to 6 inclusive agreed to) 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
(Clause 7 agreed to) 
(Clauses 8 and 9 agreed to) 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ) moved: 
``rapport sur l'execution du Traite par le'' 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Winnipeg-Centre-Sud, Lib):
We agree with the amendment.  
The minister seems to be in agreement. 
This brings the French more into line with all the other provisions.  
Shall the amendment carry?  
Mr. Chairman, I thank the member for the question.  
We do not envision that any new staff would be drawn into the authority. 
Staff would come from existing departments in those areas. 
The question of some kind of burgeoning bureaucracy simply does not apply.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
It would not require additional person years. 
They would be assigned from the departments themselves to work in the authority.  
Shall clause 10 as amended carry?  
(Clause 10, as amended, agreed to) 
(Clause 11 agreed to) 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Chairman, I have a question for the minister. 
This article refers to the Minister of Health. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Svend J. Robinson:
Mr. Chairman, I have a brief supplementary to the minister on the same issue.  
The minister has referred to the environmental consequences of the Nanoose testing range. 
Shall clause 12 carry?  
(Clause 12 agreed to) 
(Clauses 13 to 23 inclusive agreed to) 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Chairman, I move: 
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
I would submit that as such it is out of order.  
The amendment as presented is in order to be presented. 
Such is the purpose of the amendment. 
It seeks to change a practice, but that practice must be changed. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
The same basic question remains. 
Fortunately in our system we have that capacity. 
The parliamentary system, in my humble view, is superior from that point of view. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Thirty-eight per cent of the people in this country voted for this government. 
That is not a majority. 
Sixty-two per cent did not. 
Mr. Chairman, that is not democracy. 
This amendment is relatively simple and straightforward. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson:
I hope the House will adopt the motion. 
This is an important proposal and we support it.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
I also want to raise another point in favour of our amendment. 
This is serious business, very important stuff. 
These are major issues that relate to our responsibilities as parliamentarians.  
Shall the amendment carry?  
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
(Clauses 24 to 26 agreed to) 
Should I move this amendment now? 
No. It must be done after clause 29.  
(Clauses 27 to 29 agreed to) 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
The additional clause is in order.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we can accept the amendment to the bill.  
Mr. Chairman, I have a very technical point. 
There is a small error here.  
I am very pleased that the minister gives his agreement. 
I would like to have the minister's opinion on this. 
I certainly think that is an appropriate inclusion in the bill.  
I would certainly welcome any will of the committee that would be expressed.  
Does the new clause, as amended, carry?  
(New clause, as amended, agreed to) 
(Clause 1 agreed to) 
CANADA SMALL BUSINESS FINANCING ACT 
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Small businesses play an important role in Canada's economy. 
Canada has more than 2.5 million small businesses. 
In 1996-97 small businesses created 81% of new jobs in the economy.  
They are an integral part of the economic infrastructure of Etobicoke-Lakeshore. 
The operation of these businesses cuts across the manufacturing and service sectors of the economy. 
They are the main engines of employment in my riding and elsewhere in Canada. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
It is very important that we all support small business.  
I commend the member opposite for her remarks.  
These are measures that will be appreciated.  
These measures will be beneficial to those medium size enterprises.  
These measures will benefit all of our constituents. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
We know that it is the backbone of the nation. 
I am always pleased to speak up for small business.  
But there is one thing that bothers me about this tax and grab government. 
That would help them even more than lending them more money.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Can we take that good news back to our constituents?  
The member has introduced EI. 
Of course, any good news is good news that we will take forward.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Before the taking of the vote: 
We will go row by row. 
Then we will go through those opposed.  
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
(Bill read the second time and referred to a committee) 
CANADA SMALL BUSINESS FINANCING ACT 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried. 
The next question is on the main motion.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Is there agreement to proceed in such a fashion?  
Mr. Speaker, Reform Party members present vote no on this motion.  
Mr. Speaker, members of the Bloc Quebecois are in favour of this motion.  
Mr. Speaker, New Democratic members present vote yes.  
Mr. Speaker, members of the Progressive Conservative Party will vote yes on this motion.  
Mr. Speaker, I would vote in favour of this motion.  
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
(Bill read the second time and referred to a committee) 
There has been considerable interest in the bill by many Canadians. 
Thousands of them have signed petitions which have been presented in the House. 
However, they may not understand the procedure and what is going on. 
I propose to talk for a few minutes about the procedure.  
I am permitted a 15-minute speech and a five minute wrap up. 
A number of bills were vying for this one slot, including mine.  
That is a thumbnail sketch of how we got here tonight.  
There is nothing startling there. 
It is the definition that we have always known in Canada. 
That is what the justice ministers have said in writing.  
Common law is, plain and simple, judge made law. 
Therefore, it can be changed at any time by judges. 
That is not an accurate statement of the law. 
Why do I say this? 
One case will illustrate this point. 
In fact, the decision was two to one. 
I will read some brief excerpts from the dissenting judgment: 
It is illogical and has no beneficial impact on the goal. 
This also is not accurate. 
Is there a move to legitimize bigamy or polygamy? 
Members will not believe it. 
The editor's note reads: 
No need to waste it, so a growing number of couples think. 
To quote from the article: 
Even child raising is better when you are poly, the proponents say.  
Boy, talk about poly. 
The legal advice of this department is that it risks opening further debate.  
That is political advice. 
To be sure, a debate must take place. 
My colleague is right saying that this debate should be held in the House. 
We must vote on an important matter such as this''. 
He was talking about same sex benefits.  
In conclusion, Bill C-225 is the vehicle to have this debate. 
That is not only shameful but it is truly lamentable.  
I ask the House to support this bill.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
I began down each of these tracks but something was missing. 
It seemed I was just repeating the obvious. 
Men and women get married. 
It is recognized by law. 
Marriage is a quality institution that has been around since the beginning of recorded history. 
However this was not touching the heart of the issue we have before us today. 
It seems to me there is something deeper that needs to be addressed.  
We have been barraged with the call for equality. 
Then it is implied that when things are equal they become the same. 
We know it is not true. 
Some things are different, just as some relationships are different from others.  
How does it work? 
Marriage as it is currently understood is an inclusive arrangement, I would argue. 
Does it not include both genders? 
Neither one is excluded. 
Is it not inclusive? 
The equality of the sexes must not be confused with the sameness of the sexes.  
In a prominent Canadian court case the ruling read: 
Marriage has many other characteristics of which companionship and mutual support is an important one.  
The children of a marriage should be considered. 
More is caught than taught.  
The same concept applies for daughters. 
In addition, we celebrate anniversaries in this land. 
For these people divorce is not even an option. 
Marriage is an institution that defies those who want to promote the gender war. 
It develops good character in both parties. 
It allows procreation and is the best environment for raising children. 
They learn by example.  
Canadians believe in marriage and they make it work. 
In 1995, an average year, there were approximately 6.3 million married couples in Canada. 
I support Bill C-225. 
This is the truth. 
No matter how we want to play with the words, it will not change.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
But let us start at the beginning. 
He said: ``The hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve would like a debate in Parliament.'' 
For some, this institutional recognition will be marriage. 
For others, it will be a civil union contract. 
In law, what are the three attributes that define the concept of spouse? 
I know there are distinguished lawyers in this House. 
There is one on my left and one on my right. 
Why should they be recognized as a couple? 
Why should my partner be exposed to discrimination in the area of immigration?  
Because this is what it is all about. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
He suggested that perhaps people were afraid of the debate. 
Certainly I welcome the debate. 
I do not think anyone is shirking this debate. 
The fundamental issue is recognition of our right to equality across the board.  
I do not believe that. 
I do not believe it would destroy it.  
How does he respond to an article in yesterday's Toronto Sun ? 
Loving companionship is what it is. 
They met during a bingo game six years previously. 
It makes you feel all warm and fuzzy''.  
Damn it, that is wrong. 
That is what should define it and that is what federal legislation should allow.  
There have been changes in the law. 
Sometimes people do not understand the human dimension of our relationships. 
I could talk at some length about my own relationship. 
I do not believe it does any such thing.  
There has been significant progress in the recognition of our relationships. 
I believe federal law should allow that. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
This is a strict legal definition. 
As with all legal semantics there is a broad range of interpretation. 
Social mores and marital convention are perhaps even more complex.  
I congratulate the hon. member for Scarborough Southwest for bringing forward the legislation. 
That time however is not here. 
Perhaps the venue should be through a legislative committee or a royal commission. 
Sadly this is not the case throughout the country. 
It is a false hope.  
How would Canadians benefit from this legislation? 
The husband is unemployed and unable to find work. 
I challenge anyone to state otherwise.  
The Canadian family needs support. 
Canada's parliament needs to take decisive action to nurture our families.  
I do not believe so. 
They are the backbone of Canadian society. 
That is not the key to the solutions for the problems facing Canadian families.  
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
I believe we have to have equal distribution of benefits and equal rights. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):
We heard some good speeches. 
This should be the beginning. 
Some speakers missed some of the points. 
Some speakers want to redefine marriage. 
The Department of Justice will continue to defend that law.  
In fact that is what the majority of people believe a marriage should be. 
We are not talking about benefits. 
We are not talking about pensions. 
We are talking about the concept of marriage.  
I could not disagree more. 
He talks about my taking a legalistic point of view. 
What do we do in this place? 
My friend asked whether two people could live together freely. 
Of course they can. 
It is not up to the courts.  
Of course it would not. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent that this bill be votable?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
There is not unanimous consent.  
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Small and medium size businesses are the backbone of our Canadian economy. 
Canadians are using cash and coins less and less. 
In conclusion, I have two questions. 
Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
The mint does not receive any government subsidies.  
It has already obtained the financing it requires. 
Some countries will only contract from government mint to government mint.  
BC MINE IN BLACK LAKE 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
These men are anxious to live with security and decency.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
That is the first $3 million.  
The Government of Canada has responded responsibly to the British Canadian mine workers. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 7.27 p.m.)
