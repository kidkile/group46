Business of the Senate 
Thursday, December 10, 1998 
The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable deans, we welcome you to the Senate of Canada.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
She was the tough and tenacious Crown prosecutor. 
Yes, the member for Windsor-St. 
Clair was, indeed, magic.  
Shaughnessy personified all that was good and noble about political life. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
May she now be embraced in peace in the bosom of Abraham.  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, I wish to add my tribute to those of senators Graham and Kinsella. 
Everything about this tragedy has been printed in the press, which I read this morning. 
She was a tough and intelligent parliamentarian. 
Honourable senators, I rise today to pay my respects to Shaughnessy Cohen.  
Clair but throughout Canada was tremendous. 
She was a really true Canadian.  
Shaughnessy was a valued and hard-working young woman. 
Susan remembers Shaughnessy taking part in my riding activities. 
Susan has lost not only a good friend but also an adopted sister.  
Our thoughts and prayers are with them during this most difficult time.  
Shaughnessy was the oldest of five girls. 
Her dad liked to hunt. 
Shaughnessy's father is still an active pharmacist there. 
She had that great sense of humour, and she came from a wonderful family.  
This was the Shaughnessy Cohen we knew.  
There were 10 or 11 of us there. 
As I said, she was a caring person.  
After that, she opened her purse and took out a bottle. 
Honourable senators, we have lost the member of Parliament for Windsor-St. 
Clair, but her husband, Jerry, has lost a wife and companion of over 25 years. 
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
We are also profoundly shaken. 
This tragedy was a chilling reminder of our own mortality. 
She did not succeed but, as in many other things, she persevered. 
Her efforts paid off in 1993 when she was swept to Ottawa. 
Shaughnessy was an occasional member of that committee. 
It was the night of the Halloween party in the West Block. 
Honourable senators, Parliament has lost an impressive member who will be sorely missed. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Fiftieth Anniversary of Signing of Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
They took that first step in that assembly of citizens of the world. 
We look back at them and see that the record is rather mixed. 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
It is important that Canadians take note of this day for several reasons.  
This description is both rich and thought-provoking. 
They also transcend any barrier of time, space or geography.  
The rights set out in the declaration are universal and timeless. 
No law or decree may limit them. 
That is something upon which we should reflect.  
These rights, however, are not universally observed. 
Hon. Calvin Woodrow Ruck :
We have seen many changes come about since the declaration. 
This has opened many doors to visible minorities. 
I was able to raise a family there and see that they were properly educated. 
We have come a long ways. 
We can now go into barbershops in the city of Dartmouth. 
I am proud to be a Canadian. 
Our country has come a long ways, but there is still some ways to go. 
Minority people have become members of Parliament. 
That is just one of the important recommendations that was contained in this report.  
History of Nursing Education in Province 
In 1903, four candidates entered the nursing school. 
Mary Southcott created a precedent. 
Fiftieth Anniversary of the Signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
Hon. Therese Lavoie-Roux :
In short, the convention defines what the world wants for its children. 
In the convention, a child is defined as a person under 18 years of age.  
Our children deserve the best there is. 
Let us make their rights our priority every day.  
The Honourable John Lynch-Staunton 
He performed admirably and he continues do so. 
You enjoy our support, our love, and our admiration. 
Five more years, at least, under your leadership would be most welcome.  
Commemoration of Commissioning of New Warship HMCS Saskatoon 
The HMSC Saskatoon is Canada's newest warship. 
The base at Esquimalt is to be commended for their organization. 
Also, special thanks to Mayor Dayday of Saskatoon for a wonderful reception.  
I love the blessing that was read at the launching. 
Fiftieth Anniversary of the Signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
For example, determinations by the International Court of Justice may be compelling. 
In Keegstra , the Court wrote: 
In Kindler , it wrote: 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
There has never been as much killing, pillaging and raping as there is now. 
And we are talking about great conflicts.  
Another will be put forward later by Senator Andreychuk. 
I hope and pray that we would not be selective.  
You cannot pick and choose. 
You believe in the universality or you remain silent.  
When a cause is just, it does not die. 
A just cause does not pass away. 
We voted to make two countries on someone's land. 
I accept the resolution. 
Everything that takes place in the Middle East has its birth on that day. 
The situation in Algeria is the culmination of hate. 
I have gone through that for 35 years. 
I have seen that contamination. 
I have never answered back because I believe in being good. 
Congratulations on Selection as Megaport Finalist 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I have already made an intervention under Senators' Statements.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
I have here the official announcement from the Sealand and Maersk companies.  
The finalists are the ports of Halifax, Nova Scotia; Newark, New Jersey; and Baltimore, Maryland. 
Canadians, of course, will eagerly await the selection of the winner. 
Provision in Rules for Ministers' Statements 
It occurs to me that this oversight should be corrected soon in our rules.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
The point made by Senator Murray is valid.

Canada-Europe Parliamentary Association 
Security Incident at Vancouver APEC Conference 
Notice Of Motion to Establish Special Committee 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Tuesday next, December 15, 1998, I will move: 
That the Committee have the power to sit during sittings and adjournments of the Senate; 
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration 
Committee Authorized to Meet During Sitting of Senate 
Leave having been given to revert to Notices of Motion: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Volunteerism and the International Year of Older Persons 
Hon. Sharon Carstair (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
...intent upon avoiding any embarrassment to the President.  
The memo states further that: 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Both subjects have had their accreditation seized.  
The first subject is Dr. Joan RUSSOW federal leader of the Green Party. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
It could be all three.  
There is no answer, so save your breath.  
Spoken like a true prince.  
Delineation of Boundary of Tuktut Nogait National Park-Government Position 
Honourable senators, my question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
How much longer will the cabinet and Parks Canada ignore the Inuvialuit?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I respect the concerns of Senator Adams on this particular issue. 
I have some fleeting familiarity with the area. 
Not too many people have visited an area such as Paulatuk. 
We do not have a voice. 
That is my concern. 
The Inuvialuit own the property already. 
All they are asking for is a piece of land. 
We have all the information you tabled.  
It was exactly the same thing as we heard from him before. 
He had money for that before.  
Later today, we will vote on Bill C-38. 
However, those people still own the land. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I am certainly not aware of any such policy. 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Reiteration of Policy on Disarmament within Proper Forum-Government Position 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
I also support the initiatives of Senator Roche in that regard.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I should attempt to clarify the Foreign Minister's comments. 
Presumably, those are the comments to which Senator Andreychuk is referring.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Is the minister in a position now to table a document? 
It did not appear that the minister was reading from a document. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I would be happy to do that, honourable senators. 
It was just sent into me in the chamber. 
Is it only in English?  
However, I would be happy to distribute a copy of the release.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, that is an important intervention by the Honourable Senator Forrestall.  
I have been working continuously with my colleagues at the federal level. 
Honourable senators, I have one final supplementary question.  
Honourable senator, that matter is under continuing discussion. 
Delayed Answer to Oral Question 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
(Response to question raised by Hon. J. Michael Forrestall on November 26, 1998) 
Bill to Amend-Second Reading 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
I am pleased to speak in favour of the concept of this bill.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Bill to Amend-Third Reading 
Today, more than one in four of our young people smoke. 
Half of these young smokers will die prematurely from smoking-related causes. 
This is a huge step forward in our battle against smoking.  
I stand here knowing that 40,000 Canadians die from smoking each year. 
I feel a sense of mixed emotions regarding Bill C-42. 
Bill C-42 pushes the bans out further - five years further, in fact. 
They are not worth the paper they are written on.  
On balance, I do not have difficulty with Bill C-42. 
I do have some difficulty with the Tobacco Act. 
It reflects an incomplete strategy. 
Tobacco presents a health hazard. 
Another problem is that of tobacco advertising.  
That having been said, I personally find the bill perfectly acceptable.  
Honourable senators, this is an important issue for this place. 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Honourable senators, I wish to ask a question.  
I am delighted with that I have heard. 
I am in total agreement with my friend Senator Kenny. 
This is not something that has recently been happening. 
It happened with the previous government as well.  
Would Senator Milne consider making her letter a letter of discomfort?  
She took upon herself to ask for the minister the following: 
Are you inviting me to make that commitment?  
Honourable senators, I am appalled. 
I have been sitting in this chamber for one year. 
That bill does not respect our role under the Constitution. 
Senator Milne is respecting the Constitution of Canada.  
If we do not exercise our powers, we will become obsolete.  
Honourable senators, this idea certainly occurred to senators Beaudoin, Grafstein, Bryden and Milne, and myself. 
We considered the order of reference. 
We felt that that would have been considered irregular. 
We had a firm commitment from the minister that he would return. 
This position is inconsistent. 
This makes no sense.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
I agree with everything that Senator Joyal has said. 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
I share the concerns raised by all of my colleagues on committee. 
I think we must support this bill. 
We are being asked to amend clauses 24 and 25 of the bill. 
It would be a good thing for it to stop at some point. 
This is not section 42 of the act we have before us. 
There were no slips 18 months ago. 
That is ancient history. 
Let us look to the future. 
At that point, we will make sure that the appropriate amendments are made. 
My question is for Senator Joyal. 
Senator Joyal wants a stronger commitment from the minister. 
Honourable senators, without any hesitation. 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed, on division.  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, I rise on a point of order. 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Canada Customs and Revenue Agency Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
This bill is a major piece of legislation. 
In short, this bill will create a single window for tax collection. 
I must tell you that the concept of this bill is not a new one. 
It was then officially announced in the federal budget of March 1996. 
These announcements were followed by consultations with the provinces and territories and with stakeholders.  
It has generated considerable support from all areas.  
Mr. Robert Spindler of the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants stated: 
First, what does this bill mean for the provinces and territories? 
Why have they not all signed it? 
The second issue, often discussed surrounding this bill, is cost savings. 
These are the common and realistic questions to ask.  
At the same time, governments spend $2.2 billion in administering their tax systems. 
It will make it easier for employees to move between jobs. 
It will mean vacancies will be filled faster. 
It will result in less time waiting for promotions and transfers. 
This bill is also about accountability and fairness. 
First, fairness is an essential foundation of the entire revenue administration. 
Canadians from all over the country were consulted. 
Honourable senators, as well as being fair, the new agency will be responsible. 
However, to offer this option to the public and to carry it out costs money. 
It can require huge sums of money to develop such programs. 
I should like to add one further comment.  
It is not the only department facing personnel problems. 
Yes, most auditors have little experience. 
Potential new hires are lost, as it takes months to fill advertised positions. 
Will this agency be any different?  
He says in his chapter on matters of special interest: 
Honourable senators, I agree. 
The provinces, very simply, are not interested. 
They do not want to lose the flexibility and control they now have. 
This agency will not advance the case of national unity, believe me.  
If I may, honourable senators, I will raise another matter of concern to us all. 
We are assured that confidentiality safeguards will be integrated into the system. 
Service is provided in one of three ways. 
Honourable senators, this is not full accountability. 
I remind you of what Senator Kenny said about ministers' promises.  
Ministers come and go.  
Honourable senators, there are other issues that need to be raised as well. 
The working relationship between government departments is also a matter of concern. 
Finance makes policy; Revenue carries it out. 
Traditional bureaucratic relationships will be turned upside down.  
On motion of Senator Murray, debate adjourned.  
Second Reading-Debate Suspended 
In Canada, the death penalty was abolished in 1976. 
Canada respects its international obligations. 
This provision protects the individual against cruel and unusual punishment. 
Capital punishment is cruel and unusual.  
In so doing, Bill C-40 complies with the ratio decidendi in Cotroni .  
Extradition therefore seems to be a "justified"interference, according to Mr. Justice La Forest. 
Mr. Justice La Forest wrote: 
He explained his reasoning in the following terms: 
An alien can, therefore, invoke this section.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Bill to Amend-Third Reading 
Motion in amendment negatived on the following division: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those honourable senators who are in favour of the motion please say "yea."  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those honourable senators who are against the motion please say "nay."  
The Hon. the Speaker :
In my opinion, the "yeas" have it.  
And two honourable senators having risen .  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, we will have a standing vote.  
Please ring the bells.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed on the following division: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, we interrupted the proceedings on Bill C-40. 
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker informed the Senate that the following communication had been received: 
Deputy Secretary; Policy, Program and Protocol 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, it is now six o'clock. 
Under the rules, I must leave the Chair and return at eight o'clock.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Cape Breton Development Corporation 
Leave having been given to revert to Senators' Statements: 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I can assure honourable senators that no such decision has been made. 
No one has been authorized to negotiate the sale of Devco.  
Honourable senators, I have a few comments to make about the minister's announcement.  
However, what the government has not said is not good news. 
The minister knows that the problems at Phalan and Prince colliery are not over. 
We hope that that would never happen again. 
The leader referred to ending the uncertainty. 
It is still there. 
The honourable senator was with us when we went there last year.  
These problems have not gone away. 
The uncertainty still exists. 
I know exactly where the honourable senator's heart lies. 
I know what that poll said. 
They do not want to end coal mining in Cape Breton. 
It helped to bring me up.  
One of those new mines was Phalen. 
Coal will be brought in and natural gas will probably come in.  
Let us get on with the real job. 
Let us open the new Donkin mine. 
The Nova Scotia Power Corporation will continue to buy coal from Devco. 
Let us make 1999 a good year for the coal industry of Cape Breton. 
Let us end the uncertainty by doing the right thing.

The Hon. the Speaker :
I am sorry, but you will have to be more precise.  
I ask for leave to delete from the motion in amendment: 
( b ) in clause 47, on page 39, by 
(i) deleting the heading before clause 47 and clause 47;

(ii) on page 15, by deleting lines 1 to 42.  
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the main motion as amended?  
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.  
Child Custody and Access Reform 
Consideration of Report of Committee- Debate Continued 
First, we paid attention to child development. 
We also had numerous discussions among ourselves about this. 
One 15-year-old said: 
They are deciding your life but they don't even know you.  
They want a voice, not a choice. 
It was very disturbing. 
The children of highly conflicted divorces are children at great risk. 
We need to protect them. 
Both practices are extremely harmful to children. 
Our text speaks to the need for much greater research.  
It helped me to keep my balance.  
It is my final comment today on this complex and difficult issue: 
On motion of Senator DeWare, debate adjourned.  
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration 
Twenty-Ninth Report of Committee Adopted 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Motion to Establish Standing Committee- Motion in Amendment Adopted 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Other senators have written about the need for such a committee. 
We have delayed establishing a committee. 
Let us constitute a human rights committee.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I move, seconded by the Honourable Senator Joyal: 
Hon. Joyce Fairbairn (The Hon. the Acting Speaker) :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion in amendment?  
Motion in amendment agreed to.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I wish to say a few words on this particular motion.  
However, from the remaining provinces, there have been no messages of congratulations to Ontario.  
All provinces were in agreement with the proposal.  
The federal government committed $800 million, while the provinces committed $300 million. 
They wanted the agreement to remain intact.  
These people were infected through the blood system. 
That is up to $50 million.  
These changes will implement the recommendations made by the Krever commission. 
The federal government believes the proposal does just that.  
The federal government has made a proposal. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
The motion supports that recommendation, in other words.  
A vote against this motion is a vote against the position taken in June. 
Putting ourselves in such a contradictory position will be very difficult to explain.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Will those honourable senators in favour of the motion please say "yea."  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Will those honourable senators opposed to the motion please say "nay."  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
In my opinion, the "nays" have it.  
And two honourable senators having risen .  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Motion negatived on the following division: 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
Commemoration of Fiftieth Anniversary- Inquiry-Debate Continued 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Article 26 recognizes the right to education.  
It was submitted to this committee in Geneva. 
The committee examined it and posed a series of 81 supplementary questions. 
We have been found wanting. 
Hon. John B. Stewart :
Would the Honourable Senator Kinsella accept a question?  
My question relates to our international relations. 
I thank the honourable senator for the excellent question. 
We all agreed to accept this norm of economic, social and cultural rights.  
There is a unity to human rights. 
I thank the honourable senator for that response. 
However, he continues to emphasize our own sins of omission. 
Of course he encourages us to do much better.  
My question is quite practical. 
How do we avoid the practical problem of appearing to be hypocrites?  
It would not be acceptable for us to be silent. 
This norm is universal. 
This is not a Canadian norm.  
On motion of Senator Carstairs, debate adjourned.  
History of the Chinese in Canada 
Notice of Inquiry-Order Stands 
Leave having been given to revert to Notice of Inquiries: 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable senators, is it agreed?  
Child Custody and Access Reform 
Consideration of Report of Committee- Debate Continued 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, as always I feel indebted to honourable senators. 
Canadians have wept, like Jacob's wife, Rachael, for the children of divorce. 
Honourable senators, their suffering is our suffering.  
I repeat, in 1984, I proposed and supported shared parenting.  
Honourable senators, my point of view is well supported by the public. 
The pollster, Dr. Conrad Winn is quoted as stating that: 
Canadians care, and care passionately, about the children of divorce.  
Finally, recommendation 9 reads: 
Most children's issues are dealt with provincially. 
Two parents by the year 2000 is my new motto. 
You could call it "two by two."  
Honourable senators, this committee for me, personally, has been the "committee from hell." 
The public mind of this land and the public heart have spoken. 
In fact, the public will of this land has overtaken the committee's report. 
I hope that I have made a difference. 
I have certainly tried very hard to do so. 
Honourable senators, I would like to close by quoting Psalm 127, verse 3: 
Children are a gift from the LORD; They are a real blessing.  
Honourable senators, I sincerely believe this. 
Honourable senators, the name of this report is "For the Sake of the Children." 
I thank you, honourable senators, for your attention.  
On motion of Senator Kinsella, for Senator DeWare, debate adjourned.  
Canada-Europe Parliamentary Association 
Hon. Lorna Milne rose pursuant to notice of December 1, 1998: 
Senator Bolduc also spoke to the Enlarged Assembly on this subject. 
To add to the suffering, the harvest has been totally destroyed. 
It was built around an extensive river and canal system. 
On motion of Senator Prud'homme, debate adjourned.  
State of Financial System 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella , (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition):
Why they are asking for an extension of one full year, I do not know.  
Hon. John B. Stewart :
Senator Tkachuk could explain it. 
He is the deputy chair.  
He is not here. 
The whole club is gone.  
That would mean they were not in violation of the Senate. 
That is a good suggestion.  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion as amended?  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
I think someone should have been here to explain.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion as amended?  
Motion as amended agreed to.  
Business of the Senate 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable senators, that is the end of our business for the day. 
The Senate will adjourn during pleasure until 8:55 this evening.  
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.  
An act to amend the Tobacco Act ( Bill C-42, Chapter 38, 1998 ) 
May it please Your Honour.  
To which bill I humbly request Your Honour's assent.  
The House of Commons withdrew.  
The Honourable the Deputy Governor General was pleased to retire.  
The sitting of the Senate was resumed.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
My colleagues wish to extend every good wish to them and to their families. 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
We also wish to extend our thanks to the pages. 
It is done with their able, careful and thoughtful work.  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
We are tremendously well served. 
My very best wishes for the holiday season go out to all Canadians.

I am talking about the Peladeau family.  
Such a disgusting act at this time of year.  
It is causing irreparable damage.
