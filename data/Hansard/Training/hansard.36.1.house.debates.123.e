The House met at 10 a.m. 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
This year I have introduced 744 pages with 17,342 signatures.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
I would like to table this petition on behalf of the constituents of Brandon-Souris.  
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. John O'Reilly (Haliburton-Victoria-Brock, Lib.):
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
They indicate that criminals do not register their guns.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
I strongly support my fellow citizens of Stornoway.  
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
With the big rally here today it is very timely.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to present four petitions today. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Question No. 62- Mr. Leon E. Benoit: 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Question No. 66- Mr. Leon E. Benoit: 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
There are two types of fees: 
The fee for the various data components range from $150.00 to $98,248.00. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
ALLOTTED DAY-FIREARMS ACT 
It has been said that bad laws are the worst form of tyranny. 
Let us analyse that statement. 
Will it somehow reduce crime? 
It is important that we understand where these people are coming from. 
What do they mean when they say that registration is a first step? 
In particular, the government has left a number of important questions unanswered. 
For instance, what is the approximate number of individuals to be licensed? 
The government does not know. 
What is the approximate number of firearms to be registered? 
What will the impact on businesses and the economy be? 
It is Yet to be seen. 
How many jobs will be lost? 
How many business closures will there be? 
Will these regulations improve public safety? 
Despite this, the government is pushing ahead with its registration plan. 
The registration system was originally projected to cost $85 million. 
Cost projections are now well over $120 million. 
Some are estimating the system will actually cost over $500 million. 
I am very pleased that the hon. member for Yorkton-Melville has seconded my motion. 
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
There will be fewer suicides. 
Domestic violence of course will be toned down and so on.  
Does he have any thoughts in that regard? 
Does he know other jurisdictions where this has been tried? 
What were the results?  
I would also like to correct myself earlier. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
They did not leave anything behind.  
I would like the hon. member to address that situation specifically. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Many of those defects have now come home to roost. 
Now they are self-evident to many Canadians.  
We maintain, first of all, that it is constitutionally defective. 
It has infringed on rights of the provinces in the area of health care. 
It has slashed transfer payments to provinces in that area.  
That has been our position since 1995; it is our position at this time.  
I want to conclude by saying that this is our position. 
I therefore appeal to the people who are assembling in Ottawa today. 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
I represent an urban riding. 
There is overwhelming support for banning firearms. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
It goes exactly in the same direction as it did on the Charlottetown accord. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to the comments of the Leader of the Opposition. 
Generally speaking we in the Conservative Party embrace many of those comments. 
My question for the Leader of the Opposition is with respect to costs. 
I agree with the suggestion implicit in the member's question. 
Also I want to speak to Canadians.  
The Leader of the Opposition spoke about democratic freedoms. 
The opposition is completely out of touch with Canadians.  
It appears all these statistics have no bearing on the opposition's memory. 
Some 78% of legally owned guns- 
It is women, after all.  
Yes, it is women after all. 
That is a burden on our health care system.  
Nothing could be further from the truth.  
They still can keep their guns.  
More recently we have made more adjustments and accommodations. 
There was concern about our forms. 
This whole legislation has to do with public security. 
Firearms cause more than three deaths daily in Canada. 
The official opposition leader spoke a lot about making changes to the Criminal Code. 
It is one piece of the puzzle. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
She describes this piece of paper. 
Nowhere in the entire world is there documented evidence that this reduces crime. 
She neglects to say that when she describes this.  
The police are asking for this. 
At what level would she accept this error rate that she described to be?  
Thank God we do not have the same system in this country.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. parliamentary secretary made reference to the American system. 
It is 80 per 100,000 if anyone can believe it. 
This is in a strictly regulated environment.  
I wonder if she is even aware of these circumstances. 
Let us get the statistics right. 
There is also a direct link- 
You are not listening. 
You don't want to hear the answer.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice.  
Mr. Speaker, thank you. 
I suppose they are listening.  
This comes from statistics collected all over the world. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Is there unanimous consent to extend the time for questions and comments?  
There is no unanimous consent.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
The gun has not been used in ages. 
The original owner no longer uses it. 
In short, there was no need for the weapon to be available to anyone. 
The Bloc Quebecois introduced a number of amendments.  
Some of them were accepted. 
Today, however, we are well past that situation. 
Regulations have been submitted to the Standing Committee on Justice and discussed. 
I will finish the quote: 
We have indeed got to that point. 
We are in favour of the principle of the legislation. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
I am going to ask a question at the beginning of this debate. 
Why do I say that this is politics?  
People are asking me ``What will it accomplish?''  
I have to be honest with them. 
Countries have tried this around the world.  
The government cannot do it. 
It flies right at the very heart of democracy and debate. 
This is a very good example of what is wrong with this country.  
I want to emphasize it. 
There are several myths that have been spread about by the Liberals. 
She did not finish the story. 
It becomes a minority of people. 
Once the public finds out the true facts it drops dramatically.  
Originally we were told that this was going to cost $85 million. 
That number disappeared a long time ago. 
Also, the year previous it was $67 million. 
That is $200 million in just the last couple of years.  
By the government's own numbers that is $1 billion by the year 2015.  
Target the criminal, not the law-abiding citizen''.  
We would rather have that facility available to us''.  
That needs to be debated in this House. 
They would rather have the money spent combating family violence. 
This defies common sense. 
This is ridiculous and the public is fed up with it. 
There are so many myths associated with this that need to be dispelled. 
It also takes police off the street. 
We do not need this. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
It has talked about that for years. 
I remember those promises very well. 
We had a free vote and our members are free to express that. 
They can represent their constituents. 
In fact, we go beyond that. 
We would like to see a lot more democracy in this country.  
Unfortunately that would not improve the democracy in this country. 
Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. 
I think they are ahead of us on that''.  
They talk about it on their newscasts like it is a car accident. 
Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay-Boundary-Okanagan, Ref.):
I am a trap and skeet shooter. 
I am not particularly good at it but I enjoy doing it.  
I am also a competitive pistol shooter. 
I am much better at that. 
Gun control is good. 
We should have it in Canada. 
There is no question about that.  
I have had a lot of people write to me. 
An overwhelming majority were opposed to this bill. 
Some were in favour. 
I am not going to brush that off. 
I am going to have a very serious look at that. 
If it saves even one life is it worth it? 
The figure that was going around at the time was $89 million. 
Later it went to $118.9 million. 
Of those 5,400 would be terminal. 
I asked what results would that give. 
He said that statistically they could save 1,710 lives. 
We have another consideration. 
There are going to be a lot of things talked about today. 
I want to hit on a couple of very specific points. 
We are waiting for the decision of that court challenge. 
The government is spending a lot of money on that court challenge. 
When they say there is a lot of support out there, yes there is. 
I think it is because of misinformation. 
But that aside, there is a lot of support out there. 
There is a lot of opposition to this as well. 
I think the government would end up losing ground rather than gaining. 
In light of that it might want to reconsider.  
It is a phenomenal waste of money. 
If the intention is good that is great.  
I have done that in committee. 
I believe this is one of those times. 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am somewhat puzzled. 
Why is it not defending the interests of its own constituencies and those of victims? 
Mr. Speaker, that was a very interesting little spiel from the hon. member. 
I am sure he has been taking lessons from the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
He said that the bill was about crime control. 
By definition criminals break the law. 
Crime control, give me a break. 
The hon. member said that the chiefs of police were against us. 
He talked about my constituents. 
I will give the member the figures on that. 
I am representing my constituents. 
That unfortunately did not happen.  
I hope there would be agreement to do this. 
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I start by thanking the House for its indulgence on this matter. 
I appreciate the effort of my colleagues. 
Many Canadians have opposed the bill. 
Today we revisited much of that debate. 
Much of the debate is focusing in reality on that bill.  
We are not talking about Sarajevo. 
We are talking about Canada.  
The whole issue of gun control came from well-intentioned people. 
Its opposition is from well-intentioned members. 
I think it reflects the real divisions in this country. 
We have always suggested that the legislation needed to be reviewed. 
He called for more free votes. 
Since then more than half of this caucus is newly elected. 
We spoke to our constituents about their concerns. 
I have given some examples of what those concerns have been. 
We will be voting freely on this motion before the House.  
I do wish that the implementation by the government had proceeded in a better way. 
That being said, there are different merits on different parts of the legislation. 
I believe that we can truly reflect the interests of Canadians in that way. 
I call upon the members of this House to do so. 
Well, there will be for some of us. 
I throw that out as an answer.  
We look to our parliamentarians and we look to our leaders for that compromise. 
I thank the House again for its indulgence in allowing me my turn to speak.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
The government stonewalled almost all of them. 
There was no consideration given to them. 
There was no compromise, a sort of take no prisoners attitude.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his comments. 
I do not know what they reflected. 
They were reviewed by the justice committee. 
I unfortunately cannot determine whether or not those amendments were in good faith or not.  
I heard the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice speak earlier. 
She indicated that during that debate all kinds of amendments were accepted. 
I do not know how many must have been put forward to the government. 
Obviously 200 were rejected. 
It does not sound to me like the best way to do business though.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
I also have a more specific question for the NDP in general. 
Where is the position of the NDP with respect to Bill C-68?  
The question was, do I think the $60 million might be put to better use. 
I suppose it depends on one's perspective. 
That was a pretty enticing argument.  
Could the money be put to better use? 
There is no shortage of money in this country- 
The time has expired.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the House for its indulgence. 
The focus here should not waver. 
The emphasis here is on long guns.  
It is ineffective and unproven mandatory gun registration. 
This motion is very timely. 
Others have already detailed the specific problems with this particular act. 
It could not be any further from the truth.  
That is completely untrue. 
Let us make this perfectly clear. 
This is about long gun registration.  
Did the Liberals evaluate the effectiveness of the law? 
These people have overwhelmingly voiced their opposition to this act.  
Canadians need to know why this money is being spent in this fashion.  
I question the government's priorities. 
It could be spent on homes for battered women. 
Without any doubt, the priorities of this government have to be questioned. 
Why not focus on the root causes of violence? 
Why not use these resources in more effective ways?  
In recent days we have seen its decision to delay this further. 
It is seconded by the hon. member for Brandon-Souris.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Does the hon. member have any submissions to make on that point?  
We are waiting for you, Mr. Speaker. 
It is an opposition day. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member of the Conservative Party. 
I certainly intend to wholeheartedly support the amendment and the motion.  
That has long been recognized in a number of our communities.  
There has never been enough enforcement in this area. 
That is where the fault lies with gun registration and gun control.  
There needs to be greater gun control, not gun registration. 
There needs to be greater enforcement. 
I want to commend the hon. member for his amendment.  
Mr. Speaker, I will respond very briefly.  
I thank the hon. member for her remarks. 
She knows of what she speaks. 
Canadians, by their very nature, are transitory. 
The information is going to be inaccurate. 
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. 
However, the point is well made. 
This legislation does not do that.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Let me make one thing clear. 
We will not be deterred by inflammatory and irresponsible rhetoric.  
The vast majority of Canadians support gun control. 
Gun control will be implemented on December 1.  
Canadians are law abiding citizens. 
Through it we hope to achieve many things. 
A central processing site is already in service in Miramichi, New Brunswick. 
All applications will go through there. 
Visits to the police will no longer be required. 
Hunting is an activity that has been enjoyed by many Canadians for generations. 
To farmers firearms are needed to protect crops. 
Target shooting is a sport at which Canada excels internationally. 
Our new Firearms Act is not about confiscation. 
Today's debate is essentially about values. 
Canadians have told us that they want effective gun control. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am very glad to hear that the minister's heart is pure. 
I feel better already.  
I believe that she believes that. 
The hon. parliamentary secretary thinks this is a joke. 
It was a legally owned weapon. 
The police came when he was not at home. 
So please spare me this stuff about it is not a danger to us. 
Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert, BQ):
As you and I know, this is absolutely false. 
Once the firearms are registered, that is for life. 
As for the permit, it is good for five years. 
Why are all these falsehoods still being spread?  
I would like the minister to clarify this for us today.  
It is our obligation to engage those who would lie and misrepresent the truth. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Seventy-two percent of rural Canadians approve of registration. 
There is massive support for this legislation.  
It is most unfortunate but typical.  
Let us review for a moment the background of how this legislation came to be. 
It was introduced in the House of Commons on February 14, 1995. 
Why would we want to do that? 
Opposition members may wish to consult the Criminal Code in this respect. 
Let me address a few of these at this time.  
Every year an estimated 70,000 firearms are sold privately in Canada. 
People who sell guns should know to whom they are selling. 
It helps to identify traffickers in illegal firearms. 
What parliamentarian would disagree with that?  
Illegal shipments will be easier to stop. 
The opposition contends that the Firearms Act confiscates private property. 
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
I spent a lot of time in my riding during the month of August. 
I held seven town hall and coffee shop meetings. 
The legal requirement to register one's firearms extends until 2003. 
It is all couched in these little fancy terms they have. 
They all talked about gun control and crime control. 
That is something which is very important for all Canadians to know.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his questions. 
Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert, BQ):
I would really like to get an answer on this today. 
And how did they get to be so high?  
Is this a roundabout way to avoid enforcing the legislation?  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the question.  
I am proud that we are able as a government to do precisely that.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
But I have received hundreds of letters and hundreds of petitions in opposition.  
They know exactly why they are here.  
There is no remorse at all, none whatsoever from the government.  
But the word national would only affect western Canada. 
Let me give the history behind Bill C-68. 
Let us get the true history behind Bill C-68. 
The legislation says that there will be a registration of all guns. 
They cannot prove what they are saying and they know it.  
They make fun of people in different areas and they delight in doing so.  
The bill is not one law for all people. 
It is not a universal bill. 
The minister has declared that the bill will be flexible in its application. 
That in itself is a very dangerous statement.  
What do they mean that it will be flexible in its application? 
We know what it means. 
They want no part of it whatsoever. 
It is not a national registration.  
Shame on the government. 
The legislation says that it is enabling legislation. 
The government is asking us to support the bill. 
All it has to do is sit before the committee.  
How will that prevent crime? 
It just does not add up. 
The people in western Canada and the people in my constituency know this.  
Do members know what the response was?  
There was no answer. 
It is called enabling legislation.  
They do not have the courage to make it universal. 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
The bill has gone through all stages. 
That party had all the time- 
I think the Chair is hearing words that should not be uttered in the Chamber. 
I hope I did not hear what I thought I heard.  
Mr. Speaker, I am sure you heard what you heard. 
The government has given them that opportunity.  
It has been passed.  
How dare he make mockery of democracy.  
I guess my speech has intrinsically raised some guilt in the hon. person. 
My people are not special interest people. 
They are real people. 
They are not ignorant people. 
They are very clever people. 
The group out there has every right to protest. 
Shame on you for making that statement. 
You certainly are totally out- 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Unfortunately, these people are not represented by any Quebec member. 
This is a pretty weak basis for an act.  
The government's reluctance to release copies for public distribution is also a factor. 
I have had to have my own copies printed for interested constituents. 
My constituency office is full of that stuff.  
Oddly enough, Quebec, the champion of provincial rights, remains on the sideline. 
The PQ government refuses to defend Quebec's right to conduct its own business. 
Perhaps the members sitting to my left could explain this situation.  
Police will be able to search premises without warrants on the flimsiest pretext. 
In other words self-incrimination is now a requirement under Canadian law.  
I shall close by doing it one more time. 
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
That was quite amusing. 
I have a couple of questions for the hon. member.  
Domestic violence knows no borders. 
It happens in rural Canada. 
It happens in rural Alberta. 
It happens in rural Simcoe-Grey. 
And it certainly takes place in many urban communities throughout this country.  
Mr. Speaker, I will start at the top. 
The hon. member asked so many questions that I have already forgotten the first couple.  
I have discussed this with a lot of frontline police officers. 
I dare say the hon. member has not.  
Once again speaking on my behalf.  
The object of this supposedly is to make it safe for police. 
If he does not, he will probably end up dead at some point. 
The police officers treat every domestic incident as a potentially violent situation. 
So this is just nonsense that is being discussed here.  
Special interest groups are these bloodsucking institutions that get federal funding. 
If they are getting federal funding, I would like to see the cancelled cheques.  
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, there is a very definite parallel. 
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
I think it shows much progress and I congratulate him.  
Today, the bill is law in Canada. 
We have been elected by a majority of Canadians to express their views. 
I know registration is not very pleasant. 
We have to register our boats. 
I register my boat every year. 
It is something I would like to avoid if I could but I do it. 
I have to send a cheque to get the sticker. 
I cannot believe what I hear. 
But it is never the cost of a life lost. 
The Reform Party speaks as if we live in a cocoon. 
I heard them talking about the west against the rest of Canada. 
I would like to mention a few figures to them. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
In the hon. member's comments he is referring to poll numbers. 
The hon. member for Lac-Saint-Louis.  
It is typical of them.  
They care for their sporting guns. 
They care for shooting. 
We do not want to be the same here. 
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
What Canadian would not vote yes for a question like that?  
Has the former minister of justice changed his mind about it? 
Mr. Speaker, this is so simplistic it is sad. 
I did not decide for myself how it was going to save lives. 
I am not smart enough to know that. 
It is not my field. 
I am also relying on the example of other countries. 
Just answer the question.  
This is a democratic law, passed by a democratic government. 
If the Reform Party does not want to abide by it, too bad. 
Canadians will judge them accordingly.  
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, there has been no decision on costs. 
All that is still being put into place. 
That is the key element in all this is. 
That is where the underlying principle lies.  
Mr. Jerry Pickard (Chatham-Kent Essex, Lib.):
I would like to look at the positive aspects of this legislation. 
The law imposes tough criminal penalties. 
They say ``Don't touch the criminal''. 
That is absolute nonsense.  
The courts, by the way, have totally supported this legislation up to this day. 
The statute is about lethal instruments, articles designed for the most part to kill. 
The practices which are embodied in the statutes reflect the prudent practices of responsible people.  
Hunters can continue to hunt. 
Target shooters can continue to target shoot. 
Do members realize that? 
That means we cannot have children exposed to them. 
Recent news events describing schoolyard shootings speak for themselves. 
Licences will have to be renewed every five years. 
So there will be an examination of violence on a regular basis. 
The guns will be registered. 
This will assist police in their investigations. 
It will assist the recovery of lost or stolen firearms.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
I thought I was a fairly clear, reasonably thinking person. 
There are a number of discrepancies in what the hon. member is saying. 
I would like to question him on a couple of them.  
I will use an example. 
This morning on the Internet I found some information put out by the government. 
It is propaganda on Bill C-68. 
One of the last points is less paperwork. 
I want to ask the hon. member about that issue. 
It starts with 669 and goes up to 774. 
These are the forms that are available for registering guns.  
I would like the hon. member to explain it.  
To me it is incredible that is the mentality driving the debate. 
To me the critical issue is safety. 
It is good community spirit. 
It is making sure that the use of those firearms by Canadians is still allowed. 
That is exactly what those forms are doing. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
That goes without saying. 
They are not people who are looking to break the law. 
The fact is he will not be appointing inspectors under this legislation. 
There was a lot of correction over that. 
They were outright changed.  
The question of safety is one that has been debated here for some time. 
I will go back to my experience in life as a police officer. 
There was safe storage. 
There were firearm training programs. 
I was an instructor at one time. 
There was registration of handguns. 
The registration was inaccurate but it was there. 
I never seized any registered guns from the criminals I arrested.  
The computer systems were there.  
The idea that this is going to increase safety it wrong. 
This government is proceeding along the road of arming more of its departments. 
There are all kinds of these things happening. 
It all translates into more government control.  
The sentence could be harsher. 
These things were all in place. 
I will relate an experience I had the other day. 
There were about 60 to 70 people there from my riding. 
It was a beautiful sunny day. 
We had a nice time. 
I am sure we were not hurting anyone. 
I did not see any criminals. 
We are talking about support for this type of legislation. 
They will not be spending money which helps the economy. 
I intend to fight for that. 
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
The hon. member is fearmongering. 
He is suggesting that the Liberal government is trying to create a police state. 
Perhaps the hon. member should visit a police state. 
He should be absolute ashamed of himself. 
Enough of the fearmongering and enough of the false statistics. 
He should simply makes some calculated comments without- 
Mr. Speaker, thank you for quieting them down. 
They get to be quite a violent lot some times. 
Let me give him an example. 
I ask that question.  
In that area the hon. member is listening simply to chiefs of police.  
He spoke also of fearmongering. 
This young girl refused to testify in court. 
I would hope that there would be some quiet.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Let us say that is the case. 
Let me make a second exception. 
That is the power that exists under the bill. 
That is the kind of power to which any normal Canadian taxpayer objects. 
When will members on that side of the House wake up and smell the coffee? 
Members on that side of the House are a bunch of sheep. 
That is what they believe in.  
Let me give an example. 
It contains unreasonable search and seizure regulations. 
It is unreasonable to do that. 
It did in this case. 
Members can read about it in the Western Producer in two weeks.  
After question period the hon. member for Wild Rose has the floor. 
He still has approximately five minutes left. 
THE LATE DAVE NICHOLSON 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
I ask the House to join with me in remembering Constable Dave Nicholson. 
He was a man of great faith and conviction. 
He will be greatly missed. 
He is now in the hands of God.  
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
1998 ONTARIO SUMMER GAMES 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):
I must say that Guelph-Wellington did shine.  
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Despite this majority request, the government is setting up a system of compensation by category. 
This is unfair and unacceptable. 
CANADIAN COUNCIL FOR INTERNATIONAL CO-OPERATION 
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
Clearly this piece of legislation is unworkable.  
BIG BROTHERS AND SISTERS OF CANADA 
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the month of September is Big Brothers and Sisters month. 
All because they had big brothers and big sisters.  
This is not a dream. 
It is a reality. 
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Every day in the U.S. there are firearm tragedies happening in many homes. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Number eight, there are not enough registered Inuit carvings to protect himself.  
Number seven, his homeless friend is okay with it.  
Number six, it was already budgeted in the price of the Shawinigan canoe museum.  
Number five, it costs no more than another unelected senator.  
Number three, hep C victims will understand his priority spending.  
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
Their performances put Canada in third place among the 68 delegations. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
The impact is catastrophic. 
And for many, the last threads of hope are rapidly unwinding.  
The World Bank and IMF's prescription is disastrous. 
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
A large majority of Canadians support gun control. 
The debate is closed. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Fishers from those communities were among the first to respond. 
They, like their forebears, are no strangers to disasters at sea. 
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia, Lib.):
Nothing could be further from the truth. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
He was the hatchet man in the 1982 constitutional coup d'etat. 
He has cut $42 million from social programs. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
There is an inquiry into this.  
At the end we will see who is responsible and who is not. 
That is why there is an inquiry. 
If some people were not well treated, certainly- 
The Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister is playing dumb on this question. 
Our concerns cannot be resolved by the commission. 
They can only be resolved by the Prime Minister himself coming clean on this issue.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my role was very simple. 
I was the host of 19 leaders who came to Canada. 
This is done for every meeting of this nature.  
The people of Vancouver received the leaders very well.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
That PM was not me and it was not the Minister of Finance. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I have been in politics for a long time. 
Colleagues, I know we all want to hear the questions and the answers. 
The hon. member for Edmonton North.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Why is it that the Prime Minister resorts to blaming a bureaucrat? 
I apologize and I will explain what I did in this affair''?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The inquiry will look at all the facts.  
I said before, and I will repeat, that I hosted the meeting. 
Until the end everything went very well. 
There is an inquiry into what happened there because- 
The hon. member for Edmonton North.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I know the hon. member tends to exaggerate a bit. 
She is very consistent. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The commission is to begin its work shortly. 
Let us leave it to do its work.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Our questions are directed not at the RCMP, but at the Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Such rhetoric, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there will be an inquiry. 
Inquiry members will question those who come before them. 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, we keep hearing the same tape. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is also for the Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I was aware that some of the delegations wanted reassurance. 
I did that for many.  
We knew that people could protest. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Does the Prime Minister agree with the solicitor general?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I just said that at this moment there is an inquiry. 
It will look at all the facts. 
Nobody has asked me to appear.  
It has never happened before. 
I am not preoccupied. 
I want people to let the inquiry do its work. 
The leader of the fourth party is inventing stories. 
The facts will be told to the commission in a few weeks.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
The Right Hon. Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have to confess one thing. 
After it was all over I was asked a question about the pepper spray. 
I did not know what they were talking about.  
I asked the journalist what he meant. 
It is a product that I have never used. 
That is why I made the joke and I probably should not have made it. 
I did not know that there was a spray of pepper.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
That is its prerogative.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is also for the Prime Minister.  
Like the Prime Minister, we want the inquiry to work.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
These people should let that committee do its work.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
It has a job to do and it will do it.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Absolutely not, Mr. Speaker. 
We wanted to consider social union.  
The rest, however, is.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
That is a problem.  
On what authority does he make that statement? 
There is nothing to that effect in the agreement.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Does that make him proud?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
That is what we propose. 
I call on the member to support us in that initiative.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Some catchy new slogan, care instead of cash.  
This dad has no future, no car, no life insurance. 
What he wants is compassion instead of some catchy new slogan. 
When will he get compassion?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
What does the Prime Minister find unreasonable about this proposal?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
That is what people want to know.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
That is indeed what he is saying. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, neither the minister nor his office was involved in the decision. 
The minister was informed afterwards. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The public service takes its own decisions. 
The hon. member for Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
We see them as members of the public. 
One woman is killed every six days with a gun in this country. 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
If I am to believe clause 7, it reads as follows: 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Saint-Maurice, Lib.):
It is not about food safety, health or the quality of the Canadian food product.  
I appreciate that he has had some phone conversations.  
Is that what he is telling the House today?  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
I do not support anybody breaking the law. 
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Oxford. 
Does that mean then that criminals are going to voluntarily register? 
On one hand they are saying that criminals will not register their guns. 
He just does not want it to be a forced situation. 
There will be setup costs and startup costs. 
In 1997 I was elected with 62%. 
This member has obviously not read the bill. 
The bill is about Liberal social engineering. 
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
Where is the vision? 
His wife wanted to throw all his guns down the well that afternoon.  
I applaud them, all three. 
Those members mentioned represented Calgary Centre, Edmonton Southwest and Vancouver North.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
I will repeat what my hon. colleague mentioned. 
Most democratic countries in this world have gun control rules or gun registration. 
It is a perfectly good conclusion.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
They can sit there and they are his. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
I will get to the reason why.  
Point one is the registration of guns. 
One-third die of gunshot wounds. 
But the reality is it will not.  
He said any price is worth it. 
We have proven that it will not. 
The second reason is that the minister said it will decrease suicides. 
This is standard procedure.  
It is a tragedy of people not using guns properly. 
What message does that send to the criminals?  
We must stop plea bargaining away those sentences. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
I am glad the hon. member mentioned the issue that suicide can be impulsive. 
More deaths were averted in this tragic incident. 
What happened when this bear attacked those people? 
I am not sure whether it was a motorhome or a fifth wheel trailer. 
To me that is the fundamental issue.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
At my cottage in the summer, I killed a three foot rattlesnake. 
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
The remedy is understood, available, feasible and at a reasonable cost. 
In other words, gun registration addresses current problems and it invests in the future.  
Are they in fact against public safety? 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
People in this country have collections of heritage weapons. 
This seems to be fairly fundamental. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
There are quite a few indications of interest in questions and comments.
