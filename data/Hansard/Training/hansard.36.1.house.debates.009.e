EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 9 
Thursday, October 2, 1997 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
COMMENTS DURING QUESTION PERIOD 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Out of respect for the traditions of the House I do withdraw the word treasonous.  
I consider this matter closed.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
The meeting was subsequently arranged for September 16, 1997.  
That request was granted.  
This note appointed the member as their financial advisor.  
I wish to submit the following points for consideration.  
The member argues that he had such consent.  
He did not have the consent of the band. 
He also claims that as a member of Parliament he is entitled to confidential information. 
I see the hon. member for Wild Rose is seeking the floor. 
I presume it is on this same matter. 
I do not want a debate to go back and forth. 
I am looking for the facts.  
If he does not have any new facts I will proceed from there.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
It must go to the whole band.  
I am really confused as to exactly what the minister means by that.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
I know of this particular official. 
I spent 20 years in the consulting business in Alberta. 
In the conduct of that work I had encounters with this official.  
They now no longer try to help. 
Perhaps the minister could think for a moment. 
It is utter bureaucratic nonsense that does not address the concerns of the people.  
This is what the hon. member was endeavouring to get beyond by arranging this meeting. 
We are getting a little more into debate rather than facts. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Look at the dilemma the member for Wild Rose and I are in. 
But it is the chief who is the problem. 
What are we to do?  
Once again, we are sort of enlarging on the whole question. 
I ask hon. members to be very diligent in their remarks. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to point to one thing stated by the minister. 
I am not a financial expert in the slightest. 
I am the MP for that riding. 
I am their elected official. 
That is why I was there and not as a financial adviser. 
I undertake to do that. 
I will have a look at the statements on both sides. 
I will have a look at whatever information the member has laid before me. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
At this point I am not sure whether the Speaker has all the information. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am rising on a point of order with respect to this issue.  
Is the hon. member rising on a point of order on this issue?  
I am not sure. 
I would like to make one observation with respect to what I have heard. 
I thank the hon. member for that intervention. 
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
Hon. David M. Collenette:
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
Madam Speaker, my bill is quite straightforward. 
CITIZEN-INITIATED REFERENDUM ACT 
It is the most important bill I am introducing today.  
FOOD AND DRUGS ACT 
Madam Speaker, I propose that all the questions be allowed to stand.  
RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
The riding is named after the Oak Ridges moraine which intersects nine municipalities. 
The residents of the riding have placed their trust and faith in me. 
I will not let them down. 
Lucius Clay said of government: 
The road to democracy is not a freeway. 
We have accepted our civic responsibilities as members of this House. 
The Speech from the Throne is the government blueprint for the coming term. 
They need to be able to dream and to reach for the stars.  
As a former educator I have worked closely with students. 
I know their concerns and their aspirations. 
Enhanced funding for student summer placements will continue.  
The government has listened and is responding to the needs and concerns of young Canadians.  
His words are fitting when applied to the national unity debate. 
In the words Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier: 
It is our duty. 
It is our responsibility. 
Canada has a proud and rich history.  
We are destined for greatness because of the Canadian spirit. 
My late father was wounded on those beaches in Normandy. 
The forces of disunity are the forces of despair, the forces of gloom. 
His belief has proven to be well founded. 
We shall sink into insignificance and adversity if we suffer it to be broken''.  
We live in a changing technological world. 
SchoolNet is another good example.  
Long live a united and strong Canada.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
I would like to ask him a question.  
However, I would like to hear it from this hon. member's lips. 
Surely the hon. member for Bourassa will want to rise in his place and- 
I ask that the member withdraw his comments.  
It is in all the newspapers.  
It is unacceptable and I ask that he withdraw that statement.  
The questions and comments period is almost over. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank the member for his question. 
The hon. member raised a concern about campaign financing. 
We do have spending limits. 
We do have a process of disclosure. 
If there are suggestions that the member wants to put forward, I am all ears. 
I think the process we have in place is a good one.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
Paul for their trust and confidence in me.  
I also thank those who are my constituents for the first time. 
It was the future that became the driving force in building my family. 
I now look at my family, my four sons:
Reis, Advin, Sherwin and Christopher. 
In essence we are only caretakers of this world. 
This is the directive of our humanity to which we are all instinctively called. 
There must have been something great in creating a country of such immense promise. 
This country has spent over a century discussing nation building. 
Earlier I said I am delighted to rise and speak. 
The inflation rate is low. 
The interest rate is low. 
At times it may seem a daunting task. 
Therefore I ask, are we prepared to take this country into the next millennium? 
If so, what is the government ready to do about it?  
I thank the House and my colleagues for their indulgence. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:
Madam Speaker, I am delighted to respond. 
In 1993 the whole nation knew that the deficit was $42 billion. 
In another two years the budget will be balanced.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:
He did not ask about the deficit. 
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:
You be courteous enough to answer the question then.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:
Madam Speaker, I have not yet finished answering the question. 
The member is prejudging my answer. 
We recognize that there is still a debt. 
We do not deny that. 
It does not care about the essence of government. Government is for the people. 
It is not only for the reduction of debt. 
A reduction of debt is not the ultimate essence of our obligation. 
We will reduce the debt. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I listened with interest to my hon. friend. 
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:
On that we succeeded.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I need to challenge the hon. member. 
That is money that is not available for government programs.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:
What would happen to the children who are hungry? 
What would happen to the children who would like to get an education?  
We have placed our priorities. 
I consulted at the doorsteps during the last election. 
I presented the program of the Reform, the program of the NDP. 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
But we in the Bloc Quebecois are going to tell it all. 
This is typical of Liberal smoke and mirrors. 
No provincial minister was allowed to take part. 
This Forum cost $12 million at the very least. 
This is nothing more and nothing less than hypocrisy.  
This meddling and duplication is unacceptable.  
Then there is the Canadian information system. 
We in the Bloc, however, have news for the Prime Minister. 
People are no longer being taken in by this sort of antic. 
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I congratulate you on your appointment.  
However, I believe the best judge of that is the people of Canada. 
The member talked about the national forum on health. 
I do not know what the member means by the path of freedom. 
As Canadians we are all free citizens.  
That is what we call freedom.  
This was to be done in co-operation with provincial ministers and representatives. 
I hope that is clear.  
The $6 billion increase in health spending announced by the Liberals is a sham. 
So, don't tell us- 
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member. 
Resuming debate with the hon. member for Louis-Hebert.  
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
This is how serious this Liberal government is, in its throne speech.  
Questions come to mind. 
Will there be funding with which to pay researchers? 
The whole scientific community is impatient to see this much heralded foundation become reality. 
It is not known when it will actually be up and running.  
The Bloc Quebecois has already identified a number of weak points. 
They will drop by another $2.4 billion this year.  
We do not know how this foundation will distribute the available funds among the provinces. 
Can we hope that Quebec's share will be proportionate to its population?  
Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):
I represent a large university in my riding. 
This is what we call the new economy.  
For the time being, they are very positive about Quebec. 
Mr. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
I have a question for her. 
Does the hon. member have an explanation for this? 
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
All those years of relentless efforts have earned me the nickname of Mr. Tenacity. 
It is now possible to think about reinvesting in social programs. 
This is certainly good news for all Canadians. 
That is positive, concrete action, not empty promises. 
Our government plans to focus its energies on that.  
Let me conclude by summing up our priorities for the next four years. 
We will do everything it takes to make Canada a strong and united country.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
The Bloc Quebecois lost more than 500,000 votes altogether. 
We have increased the number of our members in Quebec. 
We are everywhere or almost in the Quebec area. 
They should stop reading newspapers and making allegations. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien:
Are you ready to put your seat on the line?  
We in this party have forged a link of trust. 
In the riding of Ahuntsic, we won by more than 10,000 votes. 
This would be helpful to all of us.  
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
These initiatives are well known and the results are well documented.  
I personally do not want to gloat about them. 
Mostly I leave it up to the people of Canada to be the judge.  
I hope the government will do something to right that wrong. 
As members can see there are a variety of concerns.  
It is beyond me and the constituents of Scarborough Centre.  
That is not all. 
The article goes on to state: 
What a flip-flop. 
Therefore I suggest members of the Reform Party take note.  
Now we have the NDP. 
The Reform Party and the Bloc Quebecois are simply saying their way or the highway. 
That is not the approach to recommend.  
I am appalled at the tactics being used here. 
Why is it that before we sit down to negotiate we first threaten separation? 
Why must we always start our negotiations with a knife to the throat? 
Is that what we are all about? 
Is that the Canadian way? 
I do not think it is.  
I spoke earlier about the family. 
Let me tell members about a special family. 
That is what we are about, a caring and loving country. 
This is the country that is admired worldwide. 
That is what makes us all proud and different Canadians.  
Whatever you do, adhere to the Union. 
We shall sink into insignificance and adversity if we suffer it to be broken. 
Let no factious men put it asunder.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
I would like to strongly second some of the sentiments he expressed. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the member opposite for an excellent question.  
The key work was unaccountable.  
follows They should be held accountable for what they say. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
The Acting Speaker (Thibeault):
The hon. member for Scarborough Centre for a very short answer.  
That has been done.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I am dividing my time today with the hon. member for Vancouver East. 
Madam Speaker, I congratulate you on your appointment.  
We are a strong people. 
We are a generous and a hard working people.  
We have given Canada our artists and our musicians. 
Like all citizens, we kept no tally sheets. 
This is the basis of Confederation.  
I will speak with the candour my constituents expect. 
Madam Speaker, you do not have a quorum in the House at the present time.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
We do not have a quorum. 
Call in the members.  
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
We face a crisis in Cape Breton that has been building for 40 years. 
Last winter our people experienced unemployment at the rate of 25 percent. 
To say we have been patient is an understatement. 
To say that we are angry is a simplification. 
To say that we have been betrayed is perhaps the truth.  
We have become the third solitude in Canada. 
In this land of plenty, we have hunger. 
In this land that should echo hope, we have despair. 
In a land that should be strong, we have weakness.  
They are the people who have not benefited from the so-called economic recovery. 
They do not make transactions on their laptop computers or their cellphones.  
Cape Bretoners are angry. 
In fact they are enraged. 
I do not rail against hard times alone. 
That is nothing new to us in Cape Breton. 
What is new is the new meanspiritedness of this new Canada.  
Government is not powerless. 
This government could act today to improve the lives of the people I represent.  
It could take action on the environmental disaster that is the Sydney tar ponds. 
This government could act immediately to develop the Donkin mine. 
We in Cape Breton will endure. 
It is after all the reason we have a federal government. 
We have always been committed members of Confederation. 
We ask this government to show the same commitment to the people of Cape Breton.  
It is to that end that I will devote my energies as a representative.  
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
It is indeed generous and has been aware of the solitude the member spoke about. 
But what does he propose? 
I will say that he is right about the Sydney tar ponds issue. 
There is a point where things can be done. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the number of questions contained in his statement. 
I will try to deal with each one. 
I propose a number of possible solutions to the problems.  
That money could then be used to invest in places like Cape Breton. 
That could be a first step.  
Some past solutions have worked. 
When they are free of political interference, the ideas are good. 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
We have the highest number of people who can enrol in post-secondary education.  
Mr. Speaker, I acknowledged the good things in this country. 
He says that Canada is doing well. 
I would only respond that some people in Canada are doing much better than others. 
It is for those people who are not that we ought to have concerns.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The member for Saint John claims that we do not have a quorum. 
If the member will give me a moment I will count.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
There is a quorum. 
Resuming debate, the hon. member for Vancouver East.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
It is made up of people who are coping with the difficulties of everyday life. 
How many more deaths will there be? 
Our hearts shed bitter tears. 
However, there was silence from the government on these critical issues. 
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
Unlike them, she is very sensitive to the concerns of the unemployed. 
I listened earlier to one of the members on the other side. 
We take from the poor to give to the rich.  
I have a question for my colleague. 
The recipient, of course, must return the favour. 
I ask my NDP colleagues for their support.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his comments and his question. 
I acknowledge the comments of the hon. member and share his view.  
We live in a very wealthy country. 
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I welcome the question. 
The tax burden is being carried by working people and by middle income people. 
This is not a code word. 
It is a basic fundamental issue that is the business of this House. 
We must ensure that we have a fair and equitable taxation system.  
Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Nepean-Carleton.  
I know of no greater honour. 
I am proud to represent the people of Winnipeg South. 
They take their politics seriously. 
We have been very well served by the leadership in this Chamber. 
It is an interesting place. 
This was an interesting year for those of us who live in Manitoba. 
Mr. Hubert Kleysen, who lives in my riding, has a trucking firm. 
To this day I am approached by people who offer to help out.  
That was really demonstrated during the flood in Manitoba.  
It hit right at the time of the election. 
I am interested to see the return of the Conservative Party. 
I will look forward to what will happen in the debates to come.  
Some profoundly important work gets done.  
I invite members for all parties to participate in that work. 
We have to be a little cautious. 
There are some opportunities. 
I hope it will be more focused on substance. 
Rather, it diminishes the view of this House. 
I feel much the same way when a Reform member stands up.  
To my friends in the Bloc I want to offer one comment. 
It must be very difficult for members of the Bloc right now. 
I have some sense compassion for them. 
I have great respect for most of their positions. 
We have begun to see a significant drop in the unemployment rate. 
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
We are a party that wants to keep this country together. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comment from the member. 
I also note that the member is new in this House. 
This is his first term here.  
Let me pose a question to him. 
What does that do to bring us together?  
That is the slogan that member campaigned on. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the hon. Liberal member for his throne speech. 
I am very pleased to hear him talk about non-partisan issues.  
They were all cancelled by the premier. 
He did that also in the other part of the northern part of the province. 
Now he has interfered in my area. 
We did it in a non-political way. 
Mr. Speaker, I really want to thank the member for Saint John for that question. 
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, first let me extend my sincere congratulations on your election.  
We are referred to in the House by the name of our riding. 
Let me say a few words about my immediate predecessor, Beryl Gaffney. 
Beryl Gaffney remains a source of inspiration to those who confront serious illness. 
The constituency of Nepean-Carleton has been my lifelong home. 
Nepean-Carleton is a riding that has changed dramatically in my own lifetime. 
Many of my constituents are federal public servants.  
They are competing with the world's best and they are winning.  
That is why this Speech from the Throne is important to them. 
Interest rates are at their lowest levels in 30 years. 
We continue to record huge increases in our trade surpluses. 
The throne speech touches on many areas of importance to my constituents. 
However, the throne speech is not just about idle rhetoric. 
It is unacceptably high. 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
This index could change, because some of the criteria are being reviewed. 
I can answer that question. 
That is in the process of being done.  
With respect to youth unemployment, certainly Canada's level of youth unemployment is extremely high. 
It is higher than anyone in the House would like to see it. 
As I mentioned earlier- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
It is a great honour and privilege to be here.  
I would also extend to the Speaker my sincere congratulations on his election. 
The riding of St. John's East is no stranger to this debating floor. 
Over that time he earned the reputation of being a true parliamentarian.  
I spent about 13 years in the Newfoundland House of Assembly. 
One could be very frustrated in his day to day duties.  
I can also inform hon. members that there are many difficulties involved in this job. 
I found myself on the opposite side of the issue. 
I felt strongly about that particular issue.  
Meech lake is gone and so is Premier Wells. 
My colleague, the member for Burin-St. 
George's, was in the house of assembly with me at that time. 
That is all history.  
There were those who had these rights since 1949 and those since 1980. 
Why do they feel that way? 
The churches started schools and hospitals in Newfoundland. 
Denominational education has been very important to the people. 
It gave rights to certain classes of people by religious affiliation. 
Term 17 has been amended twice.  
That was not a long time ago, just back in 1980.  
How did we ever get to this point? 
They were here and I was not. 
It called for a diminishing of rights in education. 
The provision was fair for those people. 
The amendment came to the House of Commons. 
There was a stormy debate in the House of Commons. 
As with any new amendment there is bound to be a bumpy start. 
It had a bumpy start in Newfoundland as well. 
The rights of these people were affected even after that constitutional amendment.  
Something totally unbelievable happened after that. 
It was a 30 day referendum in which he decided the court case was over. 
I find that to be totally intolerable.  
I find that to be terribly disappointing.  
How did he win? 
I think it is necessary to tell members of the House how he won. 
I find that to be totally intolerable.  
I find that to be intolerable as well.  
I have problems with what we will be doing here. 
Constitutional provisions need time to settle into the social order. 
That is very serious. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I really appreciated and enjoyed the speech just given by the member. 
I agree with this member 100 percent on that.  
That is a very good solid principle. 
I think it is an important comparison. 
That group would be the loser by definition.  
I have a great concern about that.  
There were many points in his speech which I agreed with. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Does he not think it is time he listened to the people? 
Maybe his judgment is not correct.  
Madam Speaker, that is an interesting comment.  
Let me say to the hon. member that he has nothing to be proud of. 
I think history will judge him very harshly. 
It is a very interesting point that the hon. member makes. 
I want to make a couple of points on this particular issue. 
They are well represented. 
I think that is a very important point.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I do not operate that way. 
He talked about a three-legged system yesterday. 
I do not think- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Etobicoke-Lakeshore.  
When we landed at the airport it was a red carpet that greeted our arrival. 
They toasted me and said ``Welcome home''. 
I thank them for their love and support. 
They certainly are my Rock of Gibraltar.  
The Waterloo region is blessed with three excellent post-secondary institutions. 
I salute the pioneers who built these institutions. 
Wilfrid Laurier opened its doors as a Lutheran seminary in 1911. 
More than 250,000 Canadians have attended these institutions. 
David Crane, in the Toronto Star on September 16 of this year, wrote: 
I am proud to have been one of those three. 
As a result, Canadians can be the masters of their own destiny. 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to applaud the hon. member's comments. 
I certainly respect his Hungarian heritage. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question.  
Before coming to this place I was the president of the Kitchener-Waterloo multicultural group. 
Canadians come from many different parts of the world. 
Canada is a trading nation. 
By nature, Canadians are very much an inclusive society. 
The member talked about not reinforcing those heritages. 
I can only say that is what Canada is.  
Surely to goodness she is part of a people and that people is Canada.  
This just about brings to a close the question and comment period. 
ASIA CONNECTS YOUTH CONFERENCE 
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
I salute the government.  
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
LEADER OF THE PROGRESSIVE CONSERVATIVE PARTY 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Why is he ignoring the National Assembly's unanimous vote? 
Why is he not asking his party to support Quebec? 
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):
We have altered hydrological cycles and changed the earth's climate. 
We are threatening the major life systems of this planet.  
When we stop respecting the environment- 
-we demonstrate a profound disrespect for our children.  
KINSMEN CLUB OF ERIN MILLS 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Thousands of our residents have benefited directly from the activities of the Kinsmen. 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, Namaste, Sasri-Kal, Ram-Ram, Ya Ali Madat and Jambo.  
These greetings emphasize that Canada is a multicultural society. 
Canadians are looking to strengthen their roots in this country. 
The multicultural community can play a very important role in the unity of our country. 
I urge the government to make positive changes to this policy. 
SUPREME COURT OF CANADA 
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
In fact, Quebec could be a role model for second language teaching. 
Second language classes are compulsory from the fourth grade to the end of college. 
It is in Quebec that second language teaching is the most rigorous. 
Denying this fact amounts to refusing to fight against it.  
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
``We would never do that'' stated the minister.  
For many Canadians this will be the straw which breaks their financial back.  
Mr. Guy Saint-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Lucien Bouchard's economic mission is drawing to a close. 
Is it an economic mission or a partitionist mission? 
Did he talk about Quebeckers' concerns? 
Did he talk about job creation and economic recovery?  
If he did, he only paid lip service to it. 
The truth is that this was no economic mission. 
Its objective is clearly to promote Canada's partition.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
The hon. member for Thunder Bay-Atikokan.  
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):
Currently our plant employs 790 employees working on two contracts. 
MEMBER FOR SAINT JOHN 
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
The award is well deserved and we are very proud of her.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
We do not even know who these men are.  
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it can be confirmed that the two passports are forgeries. 
There are about six million Canadian passports out at any given time.  
The identity of the two individuals has not been determined definitively. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Were any Canadian agencies involved in any way, shape or form in that mission?  
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
We know nothing about any involvement by any Canadian in the matter. 
The matter is being treated very seriously. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):
Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs even threatened diplomatic retaliation.  
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
It is a very desirable passport for people to have. 
As I say, there are six million of them out there.  
The hon. member knows that the government is taking this matter very seriously.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
What is the Canadian government doing to protect Canadians travelling abroad?  
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's point is a very good one. 
It is a concern to Canadians when anything like this happens.  
The member knows that it had nothing to do with the Government of Canada. 
We are doing our best and the matter is being taken very seriously.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the very competence of our foreign affairs department is being called into question.  
Which of those two options is true?  
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
We share the member's concern. 
It is a situation that everyone regrets enormously.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is very simple. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
During the election campaign, the Prime Minister promised job creation would be a priority. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That is what has happened.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
That is the way the question was formed.  
If the question could be rephrased I would permit the solicitor general to answer it. 
Could the member rephrase the question.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am aware that there is an investigation. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
The current RCMP investigation puts that confidence in question.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, to the best of my knowledge, no.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Will he answer the question directly?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a question on the passports. 
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for raising that question. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the minister again.  
Canadian passports belong to the Canadian government. 
The question should be posed always through the Chair. 
The hon. secretary of state.  
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
Unfortunately, I do not have a specific answer to that question. 
I will find out and I will report back to the hon. member.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Public Works.  
The question is out of order.  
That is just the way it is. 
The hon. member for Roberval may put his question.  
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I definitely had a duty to do so. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we want to get to the bottom of this passport affair.  
The hon. secretary of state, if you would like to answer that question, go ahead.  
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
I am going to find that out and report back to the member.  
I appreciate that the member's question is otherwise a good one.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
The whereabouts of the passports at this moment are not known to myself. 
It does not take a rocket scientist to figure out who had the passports. 
I am sure that members know. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
My question is for the solicitor general. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
I think Canadians are wondering why. 
This has been in the news now for a week. 
Foreign Affairs has had ample opportunity to investigate.  
We ask which is it. 
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
The government as I said takes the matter very seriously.  
The whereabouts at the moment of the passports is not a key issue. 
We have called in the Israeli ambassador here. 
We are taking the matter very seriously. 
The physical whereabouts of these two passports at the moment is not a big issue.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
My question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I have said it on a number of occasions in this House.  
But we are closely monitoring the situation.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabasca, PC):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Obviously, this was the least I could do. 
It stands to reason.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabasca, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my supplementary question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
The question, as worded, is out of order. 
I now recognize the hon. member for Beausejour-Petitcodiac.  
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.  
SUPREME COURT OF CANADA 
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
I was not aware of an investigation. 
I was not advised of an investigation. 
The investigation is ongoing independently by the RCMP as it should be.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
What is the solicitor general's problem? 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
The RCMP is conducting an arm's length investigation, as it should.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
This is an incident that we are all concerned about. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, this passes as more than being an incident. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
It did on some services and we are trying to find out why. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Veterans Affairs.  
This has made it very difficult for veterans.  
We continue to review items of interest.  
We will continue to do this on a regular basis.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
This has made it most difficult for the veterans and their families.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
I want to repeat that response so that it is clear to him.  
I said yesterday that no preferential treatment is given to FedEx. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
That is evidence introduced before a quasi-judicial body of the government. 
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member should be very careful of the words that he uses.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, there are two parts to the question. 
He answered the part concerning the RCMP.  
I ask him again:
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Our interest rates are substantially lower than those in the United States.  
We are not dealing with monetary tightening. 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Canadian children represent our country's future. 
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and Youth), Lib.):
PRESENCE IN THE GALLERY 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Next Thursday shall be an allotted day.  
I have notice of a question of privilege. 
I will hear that before I hear any points of order.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of privilege. 
I conclude that this is not a point of privilege only for me. 
It is for all private members in this House.  
This is not a problem which is absolutely new to the House. 
Is this on another point of privilege?  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
On the same point of privilege, Mr. Speaker. 
Do you wish to raise a point of privilege?  
Might I request that his intervention be put off perhaps to another time. 
I am now going to deal with points of order. 
The member for Calgary Southeast.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
He repeated that request today.  
Does the hon. member have permission of the House?  
You have heard the terms of the request. 
Is the House agreed that this affidavit be deposited here with the House?  
Agreed and so ordered.  
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, someone has gone to get the document in question. 
We are getting into debate now. 
The hon. member's point is well taken. 
I believe that is the point which the hon. member wanted to make.  
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE 
RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
Mrs. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
You can be assured of my personal support. 
I wish you well.  
I would like to express my sincere appreciation to the people of Etobicoke-Lakeshore. 
I am proud and deeply honoured to be their elected representative for a second time. 
It is my pleasure to continue to be of service to them.  
The riding is as economically diverse as the people in it. 
Industries in the riding cut across many sectors. 
I commend these economic initiatives by the government. 
I am very pleased that the government has made this commitment. 
Our young people are the future of this country. 
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
Outdated, perhaps, but a very global and very uniform view of the country.  
I will ask one question of the hon. member across the way. 
I was really applauding him for this.  
I want to compliment the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate you on your appointment. 
I was listening to the member from across the way. 
They would really appreciate a tax break. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
When we are sick we feel we can be looked after. 
Reformers get old and want to have pensions. 
Canadians also have a sense of fairness. 
We like to see the young given a fair start. 
They dislike seeing our tax dollars foolishly spent or abused. 
They know what they are buying when they vote Reform. 
They ensure that families have the resources to care for their children. 
Reformers also stress that programs must be soundly designed and managed. 
Canadians and Reformers are realistic. 
New realities emerge and Canadians see and understand them. 
The after tax income of Canadian families has declined by 7 percent since 1989. 
A second reality is the consequences of Canada's federal debt. 
It is a mortgage on our children's future.  
A third reality is that Canada's social programs need reform. 
Many of them are badly designed, unsustainable and even dysfunctional. 
Canadians are concerned by what they see happening. 
How did we get into this fix? 
Who was asleep at the switch? 
How will our social programs be repaired? 
Who will pay for the errors of the past? 
What is reasonable and fair? 
These are important questions.  
Let us talk about fairness for a moment. 
The answer in the minds of many Canadians is no.  
Again the answer coming back is no.  
We see that already beginning with the current debate on changes to the plan.  
Our plan would be open and transparent. 
It will affect every working Canadian, especially our children and our grandchildren. 
It will be a very important debate.  
I am sad to say that includes four of the parties in the House.  
They want generous help to be there for the disabled and those in need. 
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
I call their use of the phrase tax fairness a buzzword. 
However, now there is a Reformer talking about fairness in tax load. 
Mr. Speaker, that is what is called hardball. 
Forty percent more Canadians will be making increased demands on our health system. 
This is one of the new realities we have been talking about. 
I urge the government to be very clear. 
Mr. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
They pay more than their fair share.  
Now they are saying they pay more than their fair share.  
Does she agree with that position? 
Is that the kind of party that is representing people in this House? 
Yet here is the Reform Party saying that millionaires pay too much in taxes. 
Millionaires pay too much in taxes is what they are saying. 
Does she agree with that?  
The NDP unfortunately is really out of touch with reality. 
NDP members keep going on and on about the Conrad Blacks. 
That's not true, Diane.  
I hope the member is listening to me. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Questions and comments, the hon. member for Provencher.  
Mr. David Iftody (Provencher, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to join this debate. 
I have a two-part question for the member from Calgary.  
The second round of discussions occurred at a forum. 
Average people from Alberta were consulted in this three day session. 
I am happy to correct the hon. member.  
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
We will find this in history.  
On a point of order, the hon. government whip.  
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I think you will find unanimous consent for the following motion: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE 
RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON THE ADDRESS IN REPLY 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
A new wind of optimism is blowing across Canada. 
Canadians are feeling renewed confidence. 
We are poised to have the strongest growth among the world's largest economies.  
It is a vision that inspires our government. 
It is the vision captured in the Speech from the Throne.  
And as we progress, we must never lessen our vigilance. 
We must never neglect any individual or any region. 
Economic growth does not occur in a vacuum. 
This is how we turn values into action. 
We can continue to build a country of which we can all be proud. 
Young people are looking for jobs with a future. 
Older Canadians want secure income support in retirement.  
In our last mandate we took action to deal with these issues. 
A society that invests in its children can look to the future with confidence. 
Canadians want to work but our current support system produces some strange results. 
The new national child benefit will help tear down this wall. 
They are helping parents get into the workforce.  
When I look at this remarkable achievement, I realize why Canadians are more optimistic.  
Money is only part of the answer. 
They grow up not just in a household but in a society. 
Another key element of our plan is addressing the needs of youth. 
Their potential is as limitless as Canada itself. 
They have to be prepared to learn throughout their lives.  
They are staying in school. 
They are starting their own businesses, or perhaps they are doing voluntary community work.  
The Government of Canada will create a Canada-wide mentorship program. 
These are young Canadians who have low levels of education and skills. 
These young people require social supports that can best be provided by their communities.  
The first step is equipping them with these basic skills. 
Then they need their first job break. 
We believe very much in investing in Canada's human capital. 
These initiatives are tied together by a common thread. 
The social union is an essential feature of Canada. 
In fact, true economic union and social union go hand in hand. 
It calls on all governments and all Canadians to work together. 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
There was also Minister Dingwall. 
I will end on a question that is still topical. 
That would save the Liberal Party's skin.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
I must tell him I am deeply touched by his kind words.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the minister on his remarks. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
It is very generous of him.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
That sounds like a partnership between John Dillinger and Lucky Luciano.  
He was talking about how literate Canadian youth are. 
He is not aware of what is out there. 
That is not his department, that is for the provincial departments of education. 
Now if that is wrong I would like to be corrected. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
Mr. Speaker, I will take great pleasure in addressing you. 
You know that I was very pleased by your nomination. 
I must congratulate you.  
I would like to clarify one thing that I said. 
The gentleman does see a contradiction between two of my paragraphs. 
Indeed there are problems related to illiteracy. 
The government is committed to giving these youth a second chance.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
What does the throne speech tell us? 
These words are no longer used by the government.  
First, they want to measure the academic readiness of our children. 
Mr. Duplessis did battle on this in 1950. 
This is not yesterday's news. 
It is not just those wicked separatists, that awful Bloc, who are demanding this. 
It dates back to the fifties.  
Yet I thought they had just handed that over to the provinces. 
That has no concern of theirs. 
Unfortunately, that is the sad reality.  
It is disgusting and hypocritical.  
Why not analyze the situation seriously? 
The repayment of the debt should be debated. 
I think we should have a very serious debate on the matter.  
We are more than that, and have been for some time. 
That was in 1950.  
So said Jean Lesage in 1963.  
Mr. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member who has just finished speaking.  
Is the hon. member in agreement with this statement by the Reform member?  
That is the position of the member for Calgary Southwest of the Reform Party. 
Is my friend from the Bloc in agreement with that?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
On a point of order, the hon. member for Cypress Hills-Grasslands.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Chair finds it difficult to believe that that is a point of order. 
The hon. member for Berthier-Montcalm.  
The rich in Canada do not pay enough income tax. 
There is all manner of tax evasion. 
What are the Liberals doing about it? 
It is almost as if they had both hands in the till themselves. 
I hope that they are not that out of touch with reality. 
If they did say it, however, I totally disagree with their position.  
Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):
I know the hon. member to be a lawyer. 
I do not understand why he is asking such questions today.  
He told Quebecers to vote no for change. 
Quebecers voted no for change. 
What change was there in Quebec? 
It was shoved down our throats with the words ``Shut your trap, you Quebeckers''.  
They forgot that across the way.  
It was 50:50. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
I would also like to salute the small community of Joly, where I come from. 
The demonstrators did not understand why they were being forced to make this difficult choice.  
I now draw your attention to employment insurance. 
They are worried, anxious about the approaching winter. 
The present government supports this policy. 
I am asking it to correct the errors of the past.  
The Conservatives shed their disguises this past week. 
Now we know their true colours.  
Year after year, Rene Levesque's plan is gaining ground. 
I would like to tell you that we have hope on this side. 
Quebec, Quebec, Quebec, and Quebec. 
Mr. David Iftody (Provencher, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have just a brief comment. 
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
The ``It's the fault of the federal government'' tape is playing once again.  
I have a question for the member. 
Does he agree with that? 
Then, we can talk about democracy and decent things.  
It is the whole debate about partition that is firing up passions in Quebec. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
What are the priorities that Canadians are asking us to address? 
They want the government to focus on children and youth. 
Canadians want us to address aboriginal children and youth. 
Canadians believe that we can and must do better.  
We know that the average income is somewhere around $8,800 and falling. 
The private sector has also been most encouraging.  
I think of the BHP mining company. 
We have diamonds in the north. 
Aboriginal people themselves believe that we need a new relationship. 
There are different interpretations of the royal commission's report on aboriginal peoples. 
They provide for us a model of a new relationship. 
It is very important. 
It says we must begin by mutually recognizing the existence of each other. 
We must add to that a mutual respect for our similarities and our differences. 
But very much a part of that model are the words responsibility and sharing. 
These are very important initiatives. 
We are not starting from ground zero. 
That minister identified that we did have to change our relationship. 
What was our approach? 
It was not an approach that took us to war. 
We agreed to write a treaty.  
There are other initiatives which were implemented by the government reflective of the structural change. 
We have to target and improve the capability of aboriginal communities to support themselves. 
The models we build have to be reflective of that responsibility.  
We focus on economic development. 
We have to explore the strategies of own source of revenues and taxation. 
As the minister I am but a facilitator. 
I am one partner. 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for her very impassioned comments. 
They are consistent with some of the comments we heard from the minister earlier.  
I find these people speak from their heart. 
I am concerned that they are talking about more government investment. 
Yet we have a throne speech with 29 new spending increases.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
This makes for a welcome change. 
Is she prepared to act on the commission's recommendations?  
Their message is that we have to be much broader. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Mr. Speaker, this is the first opportunity I have had to stand in the House. 
It is a bit of an intimidating experience. 
I am not sure that is always recognized in the House. 
It is something we would all look forward to seeing a bit more of.  
There were many good points brought up by that commission. 
There were also some negative points. 
We have a number of statistics. 
They are not just numbers in somebody's book. 
We are dealing with human lives and futures.  
There is a long journey.  
There are a couple of points we should not forget. 
We have to proceed on this and we have to proceed together. 
We can do three things. 
We can continue to do what we have done. 
We can stand still and not move forward or we can move forward together.  
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
I am sure that you bring expertise and fairness to the position. 
I look forward to a long tenure with you.  
That did not come about strictly by accident. 
It came about as a result of a lot of hard work. 
Coincidentally, that is exactly on what we campaigned.  
Of course, a lot of other products have to go to port. 
I think this is of utmost importance. 
What about the amendments to the Canada Labour Code? 
We expect them to be tabled in the House very soon. 
That represents about 10 percent of the Canadian workforce. 
The parties involved would agree on who their arbitrator was. 
Both parties know that they have to bargain in a most earnest situation. 
They have to arrive at the best possible bottom line. 
There would be no fudging, no hedging, just the bottom line. 
If they do not, then an arbitrator can be imposed on them.  
It is high time we adopted this. 
Canada is in a global marketplace. 
We have to establish our reputation as a reliable supplier of goods. 
If we do not, our customers are certainly going to be looking elsewhere. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that certainly opens up a great debate. 
We could probably talk about that for some time. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I must commend the member. 
He was instrumental in bringing into law in Manitoba that settlement process. 
It was immediately repealed by the Conservative government because he was right. 
A negotiated settlement is probably the best settlement. 
There is no probably about it, it is the best settlement. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
The meaner Ottawa gets, the leaner Calgary becomes. 
A mess began to develop. 
It got worse over time. 
The man who started the mess was Pierre Elliott Trudeau. 
When I look across to the Liberal benches I see some of his accomplices. 
I would like to talk about the department that just grew and grew. 
Their little pet had grown into a $57 billion monster.  
This begs a question. 
Does the government have credibility on the jobs issue?  
For the average Canadian worker that amounts to $400 a year in overpayments.  
How about at least lowering the payroll tax that kills jobs? 
Alas, there is more program mismanagement.  
Can we trust the Liberals with our pensions? 
That is why the government is so gung ho about RRSPs.  
The government is ripping off young people. 
Please do not ask us to trust the government. 
Yet I fear there is even more. 
For every single student this handout is intended to help, the program hurts nine more. 
Link student loans to social insurance numbers. 
First, how much should it cost? 
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
Let me also disagree with the content of much of his speech.  
It is important to note that.  
It was the subject of the election campaign. 
The plan will be there for younger Canadians.  
Earlier today I talked about spending some money, and I am proud of it. 
I think the member, when talking about spending money, should focus on the program. 
Hopefully the member can make the distinction. 
Who am I to trust? 
It is a travesty. 
They should be ashamed.  
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
I believe it has done this very well. 
Our journey to fiscal responsibility and economic renewal has been a very difficult one. 
The road was rough and winding. 
We are seeing the very positive results today. 
Canadian interest rates are at their lowest in decades. 
Inflation has been beaten down and is firmly under control. 
We are more competitive as a nation. 
Consumer spending is up and so is business investment. 
While our colleges have a major role to play, clearly our universities do as well. 
I refer to it as structural unemployment.  
There are certainly many changes occurring.  
Automation is replacing people with technology. 
Many of these changes are characterized as necessary because of the increasingly competitive global economy. 
We should learn something from these experiences.  
In Canada at this point in time we have no similar regime.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
It is a marvellous idea. 
The result is there is better productivity and greater profits. 
More profits mean more growth and more growth means more jobs. 
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
That gives me optimism for the future. 
We regained that ability, but how will the ultimate decisions be made?  
Let me put this as concisely as I can. 
Anti-human, commercial values are dominating every sphere of life. 
We have to recognize from where and why that pressure comes. 
We cannot allow that to happen.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
You get some good home farm advice. 
But I wonder whether the Liberal members are redundant. 
We keep hearing that. 
We do not have our fiscal house in order.  
The debt has been increasing. 
I am a teacher and I would love to have an overhead projector here. 
The Liberals take credit for this wee little turn in the graph.  
They keep on repeating this and it has worked. 
I would like to ask this member to respond specifically to my question. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
We pay our interest payments as the year goes by. 
We have the accumulated debt to pay in the future. 
That is major progress.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Why on earth is he still a Liberal? 
Why on earth did he ever become a Liberal?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I could not answer that charge fully in 30 seconds.  
I come from Prince Edward Island and trade is extremely important. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I will just pick up from where I left off.  
They started in April 1995. 
They were actually scheduled to end in April 1997.  
I want to hear from the government how it intends to involve the Canadian public. 
What exemptions is the government seeking?  
What are the deal breakers? 
I see you rising, Mr. Speaker. 
Perhaps I have already exceeded my time. 
I will sit down and look forward to what the government member has to say.  
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Encouraging more investment in Canada is one of the best ways to create jobs. 
Is that not the goal of the NDP?  
Provincial officials are consulted through conference calls and negotiated debriefings. 
They have full access to working documents.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House adjourned at 6.37 p.m.)
