EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 162 
Monday, November 30, 1998 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP) moved: 
I thank him for that admission.  
It does not reflect in any way any on political partisanship. 
There were five fishermen on that ship. 
Two bodies have been found and three more are still missing. 
Fishermen spend their entire lives working so they can put food on our tables. 
All this motion does is honour and recognize them.  
November 21 is international oceans day. 
We also reflect upon those individuals who work in the resource in all countries.  
Fishing in the old days was not like it is today. 
The chances of some of them not returning are very real. 
Fishermen risk their lives to earn their livelihood. 
It is said that farming is one of the most dangerous occupations. 
Fishing is right behind it. 
Every year we lose dozens of lives in our coastal communities to fishing.  
This motion proposes that we honour fishermen internationally for one week a year. 
We absolutely cannot do that.  
They built this country and they will sustain this country.  
It went on for hundreds and hundreds of years.  
Even the government admits that big scale, big corporate fishing is the way to go. 
I am certainly not here to debate that. 
That debate is for another time in our committee hearings.  
Many of these communities are coastal communities. 
That is not very much to ask.  
This motion would recognize a symbolic week. 
We will do that by giving you an international week''.  
Some people may say that it will be difficult to have an international week. 
It is a real pleasure to speak today. 
There have been many protests directed toward government. 
That argument still continues and the battle still continues.  
A rash of suicides is also happening on Vancouver Island. 
That debate would be for another day.  
I ask for the indulgence of the House. 
It is not a monetary motion. 
Perhaps I could seek clarification from the hon. member. 
In my five minute reply.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Declaring a week of awareness is not the answer. 
It has to be much more than that. 
We on this side of the House believe in taking some action. 
Symbolism is not enough.  
We have to hire people. 
We have to put out publications. 
It takes money and time. 
It wants to theorize, study and go on for years. 
We have begun to see evidence in the last year in terms of improvements. 
In fact Premier Tobin mentioned that the other day.  
Awareness is already taking place and taking place vividly. 
It was an attempt to work in unison with the industry as a whole. 
When Premier Tobin spoke- 
The member opposite is asking ``Who''. 
Premier Tobin is well known. 
He ensured that the fishery would move ahead for Canadian fishermen.  
It has improved and is healthy. 
The value of landings has improved. 
We are doing what we can with fisheries policies.  
It must be obvious by now why this is so. 
Its design and development is still unfolding. 
Many members of the House are members of the fisheries committee. 
The government's ultimate objective is to have a sustainable fishery. 
Why has the government taken these important steps? 
We cannot allow the mistakes of the past. 
That is not the issue at all. 
These are the guiding principles the government follows.  
In the editorial he said that was the way to go. 
We believe in action.  
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
He is absolutely right. 
That is the action the government has taken. 
Those were the words he used. 
He really means that he wants action. 
He recognizes the need for action.  
That is the issue.  
I put this to the minister in committee last week. 
It is squeezing out the guy who cannot afford it. 
The government is in the process of reducing capacity. 
Our capacity remained the same although there was a lower number of boats. 
These are very real concerns on both coasts.  
The minister has brought forward a voluntary licence buy back. 
It will reduce the size of the fleet and hopefully the capacity. 
He does not know how he is going to feed his family. 
They are struggling up in northern Vancouver Island.  
I agree the fishery can be rebuilt. 
I believe there is a fishery out there. 
They can afford to ride out the storm.  
I put that to the minister. 
The minister flatly denied it in his response. 
That is absolutely wrong. 
That is not what I am saying. 
It should be done proportionately and equally. 
The little guys are being squeezed out.  
It applies to the other sectors as well. 
I totally and wholeheartedly agree with him. 
I have worked with him on committee and privately. 
We have discussed this issue seriously. 
We have had some fruitful discussions. 
I have some specific examples. 
He relaxed the Canadianization policy. 
This is in turbot.  
No attempt was made to get Canadian vessels out on the water. 
We know no attempt was made. 
I have spoken to fishermen throughout Newfoundland and Atlantic Canada. 
They are asking for access to this resource. 
The member opposite knows the recommendation. 
He is a member of the committee and agreed to the east coast report. 
Canadian fishermen are available. 
We cannot single anyone out.  
I do not believe that having a declared international week of awareness is necessary. 
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
I have no difficulty whatsoever in supporting the member's motion. 
Most of the trawlers of the major companies have been decommissioned. 
Consequently they are going into more dangerous waters. 
They are going further from shore. 
Hundreds and hundreds of small communities in Atlantic Canada are in danger of extinction. 
The outmigration from those communities is staggering.  
When I visit the riding of Burin-St. 
It is mainly because of a downturn in the fishing industry. 
That was the choice the minister of fisheries had.  
What good would it have been to leave the fish in the water? 
However that is my understanding of the situation.  
Tell your friend Crosbie.  
I have to be careful what I say. 
I say to the parliamentary secretary that yes, the government has made some good decisions. 
The government continues to make some bad decisions. 
Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):
I value the input he has put in from time to time.  
I want to lend my support, at least in measure, to that part. 
We must now consider any proposal in light of how it affects conservation. 
For example, what do we want to see? 
The right answer is obvious.  
Conservation must come first. 
It will not be the industry of the past. 
Conditions have changed as they have in all industries. 
That is the practice that got us to where we are today. 
That was a very positive initiative for those of us in central Canada. 
The minister saw fit to increase that number to $6 million. 
It is important that we rely on government funding to keep this sport alive.  
The government understands the need for change. 
They are not always easy.  
The government is also continuing to support the development of the aquaculture industry. 
Rural issues were a theme of the government's 1997 election platform. 
I think it has drawn an awareness to the importance of the fishery.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
They keep talking about conservation. 
The member from Ontario mentioned the TAGS program and the post-adjustment programs. 
It is an absolute shame.  
Unfortunately the Liberal members on that committee did not vote that motion in. 
It would just be a symbolic gesture. 
In fact, a few of them have been disregarded totally. 
I thank the members for Burin-St. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion 
When shall the bill be read a third time? 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would like to offer this motion to the House.  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Under the new legislation the legal standard for extradition will be retained. 
Lawyers like to refer to this as the prima facie test.  
With this option the legal test would not change. 
What would change is the form in which the evidence would be made available. 
Bill C-40 would give Canada that capacity.  
Bill C-40 brings important and necessary change to Canada's extradition regime. 
This proposed legislation on extradition is an important component of that scheme. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Extradition is vital to the justice system. 
Canadians must not be allowed to escape trial by fleeing to other countries. 
The process must be fair and expeditious.  
Therefore extradition will be allowed. 
In the second reading debate, I read a number of them. 
There is a file six inches thick of the appeals that have taken too long. 
We would not accept such interference in our judicial system. 
The role of the court should be simple. 
Determine that the person sought is in fact the person accused. 
Is he Ivan the Terrible? 
Make sure there is a valid treaty. 
We had a rigorous examination of this bill before committee. 
Witnesses expressed concerns with many sections of the bill. 
We were not successful. 
The minister should have no discretion. 
Seven Reform amendments were accepted by the committee. 
It is wonderful we were on guard to do this. 
The bill was not drafted properly. 
We should not be precluding extradition based on that. 
We have had a good debate and a good committee on this bill. 
It is certainly time they were updated. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
Second, the procedures for evidence have been changed. 
The new version of the act will allow this.  
I was saying this legislation is 100 years old. 
May you reach that age too, Mr. Speaker. 
We must also consider the whole notion of criminality.  
I thank my colleagues for their reserved, but real enthusiasm.  
Organized crime is an important matter. 
It is an unavoidable reality. 
I have to say that organized crime advances in stages. 
The first stage involves controlling an area. 
The second is control in order to sell drugs. 
This is a very contemporary example of criminal activity.  
Obviously, it did not exist. 
Can you, even for one moment, imagine Father Labelle with a Macintosh? 
It would be a complete anachronism. 
We also worked very hard as a political party in committee. 
In the true spirit of team work, we divided up the work. 
I found this list to be extremely restrictive. 
We were right in proposing an amendment such as this one. 
The letter reads in part as follows: 
As a responsible opposition party, we had a duty to improve the bill. 
We all know how this happens. 
They may admit it in part, but not entirely. 
A number of issues were also raised. 
I know that the hon. member for Beauharnois-Salaberry will discuss this. 
Other representations were also made.  
As some of you know, I myself have an interest in law. 
They sought to understand why the minister was heading in that direction.  
That was one element that convinced me. 
Second, the Minister of Justice has considerable power. 
Some hon. members on the committee, the Reform members in particular, were worried about this. 
They said ``But this is impossible. 
The process should be entirely judicial. 
The judges should be the only ones to decide.''  
That makes no sense.  
We think there are guarantees in a bill such as this.  
Political beliefs are sacrosanct. 
Those who will represent us need a clear mandate. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
This is a great day for democracy in Quebec. 
It will no doubt be a great day for us. 
That is my first comment on Bill C-40.  
Canada is in a position to do so. 
I have already asked three questions in the House on this issue. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
In fact, the situation should be just the opposite. 
Matters should be dealt with expeditiously, currently and in a simple, steadfast and straightforward way.  
I am involved in a court matter I started around the spring of 1996. 
It is still lingering on. 
I am basically a man of patience. 
Fortunately I have the wherewithal to finance these legal proceedings. 
They have been and they are currently outdated, slow and complex.  
Simplify is the key word.  
Indeed we see a lot of that happening today. 
There is increased mobility of individuals today. 
In the blink of an eye he can be one place and then another place.  
This is true for hon. members of this House and really right across our society. 
Globalization enables us to commute from one place to another very quickly. 
We support this amendment. 
This was mentioned by my hon. colleague from the Bloc. 
We would have some concerns about the discretionary power of the minister in that regard. 
We feel perhaps it would be better if it were mandatory. 
Nonetheless, it is a step forward to at least include that consideration.  
We have some concerns about the legislation. 
This would weaken the burden of proof for foreign nations to extradite. 
However, even with those concerns we are supportive of this legislation. 
We feel it is a good step forward. 
This is a very important feature. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to take part in this debate.  
According to our own police and security officers there is a drastic need to intervene.  
I know that all of us in opposition are anxiously awaiting that moment.  
There are requirements for some interpretation of evidence to become more flexible. 
Canadians have continually expressed concerns about Canada's extradition laws. 
Safeguards, however, would exist. 
However, this new legislation does move in that direction.  
That has become crucial. 
More important, it would prevent Canadians from being the subject of unfair requests for extradition.  
The words do not appear to be followed by the act.  
There were a number of positive amendments proposed at the justice committee. 
I commend my colleagues for their participation at the committee. 
Some of the changes were implemented and brought forward by members of the opposition. 
I acknowledge the government's openness with respect to some of those amendments. 
Unfortunately, however, only some of the amendments were accepted.  
My colleague in the Reform Party has highlighted much of their participation. 
This amendment was very important. 
With respect to the amendments the government was amenable to them. 
There are significant consequences for a wrongful extradition. 
There are significant consequences for Canadians in reverse to have to leave this country.  
I hope that is the intention of the justice department. 
Of course the government would know the reasons for that.  
I am also concerned with the resulting charter implications. 
Tabling of documents was another aspect that was mentioned and covered by previous speakers. 
As I previously mentioned, the bill will receive the support of the Conservative caucus. 
Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):
It is a good piece of work in my view. 
I congratulate the Minister of Justice for bringing the legislation forward.  
Colleagues have more than adequately outlined the many attributes of the new legislation. 
Colleagues in the committee and in the House have accepted that concept.  
They do not appear to deal with it. 
I point out a second area to the House. 
However it is important to note that point. 
That agreement will not be treated like an extradition agreement or treaty. 
It will not be published in The Canada Gazette . 
It will not have been published in the treaty series. 
It will not have been tabled in the House of Commons. 
I believe it should be seen as the exception to the rule. 
Why would one want to avoid the extradition treaty? 
Over time I do not know how that will evolve. 
Those are the three areas I wanted to bring to the attention of the House. 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
It is most fortunate that we have Madam Justice Arbour over there. 
There is a provision in the bill which is welcome news. 
In other words, the extradition order will override the refugee claim. 
Of course the minister has the final say, but more on that later. 
That is regrettable because we have enough problems dealing with our own criminal element. 
I am concerned about the cost and the delays. 
This legislation does little to address these difficulties.  
I am concerned about the parts of the legislation that permit the minister to interfere. 
Costs and delays are present here as well. 
I fail to see why the minister is left with this decision. 
The minister again becomes involved in what should be a judicial procedure. 
Why is the political process interfering?  
All countries do not have the same laws. 
We all know the Liberals are responsible for the removal of capital punishment. 
He has already been convicted and sentenced. 
This will likely become a costly and extended procedure. 
But the minister still holds the ultimate power. 
Again, this is a case from the United States.  
The member still has 11 minutes in his speech. 
We will now proceed to Statements by Members.  
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale, Lib.):
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
NATIONAL HOME FIRE SAFETY WEEK 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Most fatal fires start at night when the household is asleep. 
Canadians are starting to learn that smoke alarms save lives. 
Most Canadian households now have at least one of these life saving units. 
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
Every eight minutes a Canadian is diagnosed with this disease.  
Diabetes is a leading cause of premature heart disease in women. 
Twice as many women will die from diabetes as from breast cancer.  
This disease can hit anyone. 
It touches my own family.  
Breakthroughs are being made.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
He will be dearly missed.  
THE UNIVERSITY OF SASKATCHEWAN HUSKIES 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
The Huskies have dominated Canadian university football for many years. 
We congratulate Canadian university football in Canada. 
THE LATE FATHER DAVID JOHN CORKERY 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
FINANCIAL CRISIS IN AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY 
Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, many Canadian farmers are now facing a serious financial crisis. 
I can understand the anguish farmers experience because of these difficulties. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
This is coming from their leadership as well as from non-aboriginals.  
This government has virtually ignored these problems for years. 
Things are getting worse. 
Clearly, this government's words are much, much more than its actions.  
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
It is a complex problem with no easy answers. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
One in five will never be able to return to a job.  
INFO MEDIC WATCH PLAQUE 
Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert, BQ):
More than 80 Canadian jewellers offer this Quebec invention for sale.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
The opportunity exists for the government to step back from this costly boondoggle. 
Let us put the priorities straight and stop this costly measure now. 
Mr. Reginald Belair (Timmins-James Bay, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, November was hemophilia month.  
PARLIAMENTARY INTERNS' FOOD DRIVE 
Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Quebec East, BQ):
Nearly half the people receiving food aid are children.  
Mr. Gary Pillitteri (Niagara Falls, Lib.):
I do not want to justify my actions in any way. 
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Some Christmas present from this Liberal government. 
YUKON AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL 
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
I would like to let the government know that we want it back.  
CHINESE CULTURAL CENTRE OF VANCOUVER 
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
I congratulate the Chinese Culture Centre for its work in celebrating Canadian diversity.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this is a shell game. 
My question is to anyone over there that can answer it. 
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
What has the Prime Minister done about these costs? 
Transfers to B.C. have gone from 16% down to 10%.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
We have Liberal health care havoc. 
Thousands of hospital beds have been closed under the government. 
These are the people who do not get headlines.  
It was the Prime Minister who got us into this health care mess. 
How is he to get us out of it and when?  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
The industry has made counterproposals, and we are looking at them.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
They proposed a rate scale. 
This is exactly what happened.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
We are considering counterproposals from the industry. 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
We had a proposed rate scale from an industry committee. 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, there are limits to playing with words. 
Let me quote Hansard, on November 17, 1998: 
They proposed a rate scale. 
Since ``we'' means the minister himself, did he accept it, yes or no?  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is precisely what I just said. 
We accepted the proposed rate scale. 
I even reviewed the criticism made by the Bloc Quebecois members.  
What are we supposed to do? 
Ignore the industry and the politicians representing the region affected? 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
So much for Canadian sovereignty. 
No wonder Canadians do not trust the government to protect Canadian culture.  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
It does not try to prevent the crisis. 
It is reactive as opposed to proactive. 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Number one is because it is serious. 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Should that not be our top priority?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are working together to protect Canadian culture. 
It is a shame that the Reform Party does not have that same commitment. 
Mr. Gerard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Gerard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):
Is the minister planning to exempt this ferry from ice breaking fees?  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
The industry itself has not suggested a moratorium. 
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Which member of the family does the Prime Minister support? 
The trade minister or the heritage minister?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Fisheries. 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
There have been proposals and counterproposals. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
There is nothing new about that.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Yet that is what the justice minister's official did.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is no caving in anywhere. 
It is completely within the same ambit of the government agenda.  
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
We all know that unemployment still needs to be lowered. 
What is the minister doing to help Canadians find good jobs?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
More needs to be done and we feel we are going in the right direction.  
This government has a number of programs to help create jobs. 
The hon. member for Skeena. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Negotiations have been going on for well over 20 years. 
My view is that they want the treaty completed.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
It has taken 20 years for us to come to this point.  
This treaty will be debated fully in the House. 
I look forward to hearing from the hon. member as he joins in that debate.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):

It is also the responsibility of every Canadian to take action to protect the environment. 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
He has had a weekend to think about it. 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, public safety is my mandate.  
This report is supported all across the country. 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.  
The hon. Minister of Industry.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
These are the winning sectors in the greater Montreal area.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Transportation infrastructure is vital to economic development on first nations. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
It is a challenge for all of us. 
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport. 
This is not part of union negotiations or anything. 
These are two very credible independent sources. 
Both are critical of the number of inspectors available.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
In fact, there has been an increase of 179 over the last 5 years.  
The hon. member for Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke.  
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Minister of Transport. 
This makes a net loss of 4 every month.  
The minister has known about this situation for months. 
Independent reports say the industry is on the verge of a crisis. 
What steps is the minister taking now- 
The hon. Minister of Transport.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I just addressed that point. 
It has been doing this in the last couple of months.

Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
HPB is out; MRH is in.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
There have been problems in the branch over the years. 
They go back many years. 
Public meetings have been held across the country.  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Could the Chair deem them to have been read? 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the motion as presented by the hon. government House leader. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
This means that hundreds have come in. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have two sets of petitions to present. 
The first has to do with the abolition of nuclear weapons.  
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
The first petition was organized by Christ Lutheran Church in Kitchener, Ontario. 
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
The first is sponsored by Canadians for Animals Rights and the Environment. 
The second petition was prepared by Canadians Against the Commercial Seal Hunt. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
We hope to get thousands more.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
And that was probably a petition.  
Mr. Speaker, I suggest that all remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
We certainly would not like to see the shoe on the other foot. 
In fact we would probably not put up with it. 
We should not attempt to impose those same restrictions on other countries.  
There has been much talk about this legislation modernizing the extradition process. 
There had been many complaints about our present system being too slow and too complex.  
She is looking for some way to offload her responsibilities.  
It is doing very little to put that matter to rest within that particular community.  
The legislation leaves much to be desired. 
It leaves far too much discretion or power with the minister. 
The legislation will not change that difficulty.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
ROYAL CANADIAN MINT ACT 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
When shall the bill be read the third time? 
Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
The passage of this legislation is crucial to the mint's future.  
The mint borrows for short and long term purposes. 
Long term borrowing is required for investment in capital and technology. 
In fact, the amendment acts to improve the bill even more.  
Our mint is one of the finest in the world. 
Canadians should expect nothing less.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
I find myself somewhat less supportive of the bill than is the hon. parliamentary secretary.  
She is a very good manager. 
She is aggressive, alert and knows what to do. 
She is capable and competent in the work she has been charged to do. 
I just wanted to recognize that and support the work she is doing. 
The mint is in the same kind of category.  
We want to be sure we recognize that is issue. 
The number one principle I would like to annunciate clearly is that of freedom. 
What is the freedom we want them to have? 
Mr. Speaker, you are one of those entrepreneurs. 
You know exactly how this kind of thing works. 
There is another kind of freedom we want. 
We want it in business. 
We want it in the individual lives of people. 
That is the freedom to believe what we want to believe.  
It is wonderful to be a part of that. 
I was there to witness this event. 
There comes with ownership a certain pride. 
The first principle the government needs to provide is the concept of freedom. 
Next we need security and stability. 
We want protection and safety of person. 
We want to make sure that is there and that it is maintained that way. 
We also want security of property. 
So often we find that people want to damage property.  
We want our property looked after when we are away from home.  
We need conditions established by the government to create laws that encourage entrepreneurship. 
To create a bunch of crown corporations does not stimulate entrepreneurship. 
Our laws that establish crown corporations do not encourage entrepreneurship. 
I will get into this in detail when it comes to the mint.  
We need to do that in a variety of areas. 
We need fair competition. 
That has to do with the merger of the big banks. 
The hon. member says it has no real power. 
Therefore the government should then create a law that gives the Competition Bureau some power. 
I suppose the hon. member will say do that then. 
That is exactly what we are talking about here.  
Right now it does not have any power really.  
Is that not interesting? 
We find two people in different parties actually agreeing. 
I think that is wonderful. 
I agree with that.  
There we go, two agreements in one afternoon, in one speech. 
I commend the member because he is learning quickly.  
We need more than that. 
There has to be confidentiality and protection of intellectual property. 
Individuals need their intellectual property protected.  
We need to deal with the protection of privacy. 
The privacy of persons, business and government needs to be protected. 
I am sure members are aware of what happened in July. 
Jobs need to be available. 
There is substantial evidence that is the case.  
The taxes we pay have been rising. 
There is another issue. 
People will say we need good safety nets. 
That is the safety net that really works. 
The mint is doing its work. 
It is operating well. 
We have not done it for 10 years so we had better do something.  
To take advantage of any possible business opportunities that might come about.  
Guess what it was? 
That might be a useful discussion.  
Let me look at another aspect of the analysis. 
Is this worth debating? 
It is a pretty mundane point.  
It does not surprise me at all.  
It is not in the interests of the Canadian public. 
That is the point I am trying to make. 
I would encourage the parliamentary secretary to read this document. 
This document concerns the crown's financial institutions. 
It was published by the Senate Standing Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce.  
Those are four fundamental principles that we need to observe.  
In other words, government must respond when gaps exist in the system. 
In this case self-reliance does not mean they would manage their affairs efficiently. 
It goes well beyond that. 
It means you are self-reliant.  
That is what they are supposed to do.  
A crown corporation is a very unique creation. 
It is neither government, nor is it private. 
It is sort of a hybrid between those two. 
Let us look at each of these in a little detail.  
Are we customer or client oriented, or are we politically oriented? 
Where is our primary focus: on the client or customer, or on our political master? 
What is our goal? 
This is the second area about which they are confused. 
I have examples of each.  
Canada Post delayed it until October 1. 
It said that it would hold a lot of consultation. 
We still do not know what it is going to do. 
It went through the various consultations. 
That is not exactly in the interests of itself.  
You're doing a hell of a job.  
I'm so glad. 
At least I am impressing somebody. 
The hon. parliamentary secretary should really be listening.  
Mr. Speaker, they sleep all the time. 
That is why they have not analysed this in any depth. 
They still do not know what this bill is about.  
I was referring to Liberal senators.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
There are other questions which need to be addressed.  
Let me give one good example, the Business Development Bank of Canada. 
It is not a deposit taking institution. 
It is a crown corporation. 
What is it doing? 
It is not meeting the objective for which it was originally set up. 
It is doing something else. 
We need to ask a second question. 
I can talk about a couple of issues.  
That is a real difficulty for us. 
They are essentially doing the same thing. 
We need to carefully think through what the role of crown corporations really is.  
I want to focus particularly on the final part of this paper. 
Governments have a vast array of policy instruments at their disposal. 
Then he went one step further. 
Those are key questions from a key scholar in this particular area.  
However, by and large, it is a policy failure. 
We do not have our overall rules right. 
That is why we now have these organizations''.  
I agree with that and support it. 
We expand the power. 
It can do virtually anything it wants. 
That is why I am objecting. 
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
Redemption takes place without the holder's consent. 
This is called redemption. 
This is how purchase differs from redemption. 
We did not incur any loss''. 
However, there might have been a gain.  
The auditor general goes on for pages in his report criticizing this transaction. 
When it turns a profit, the government sells it to its friends. 
They are more often friends of those on the right side.  
This sort of criticism has to stop. 
We are moving away from that.  
One day, I began to wonder about this. 
We would be interested in buying it''. 
I was surprised, because I had not heard the rumour myself.  
Such a situation should not even exist. 
I am less worried about competition. 
Yet, the mint competes with this company, which pays taxes to Ottawa. 
Let us discuss the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. 
The economy was growing and would give rise to the families of the baby boomers. 
They headed to cities like Montreal and Quebec City.  
So, we are talking about 30%, 40% or 50%.  
It will see that I am paying too much.'' 
But this is not the case. 
The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation does not do an assessment.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
I will make some comments about that in due course. 
Other amendments are of an administrative nature. 
I want to make one reference in particular. 
We support most of the sections of the bill. 
The member for Winnipeg-Transcona spoke on the second reading of the bill. 
I acknowledge the efforts of the member for Winnipeg-Transcona. 
The bill provides for this provision. 
I am pleased to see the amendment. 
The mint will drum up additional business outside the country. 
Of course everyone is embracing and supporting fair competition.  
This legislation was brought in by the Conservatives. 
The Liberals endorse it wholeheartedly. 
I think that is what we need in the House of Commons.  
I am sure my colleagues in the Reform Party support this. 
We have a lot of support in the province of Saskatchewan for such a committee. 
I think that is a very important suggestion.  
The annual reports would be on the table. 
We could ask any questions pertaining to those annual reports. 
Those are logical things we do not want to talk about in public.  
In Saskatchewan the board of internal economy is a public board. 
The press and members can come. 
It is a matter of accountability. 
I am a small business person. 
I believe it is in his constituency. 
It is a very good crown corporation. 
It provides a very good service. 
It employs a large number of individuals and pays them relatively well. 
I think that is something we have to continue to do.  
We are very worried about this. 
Vending machines are becoming fairly important these days. 
They are used in places without cafeterias. 
I think it is a very important thing to do.  
They made some reference to privatization. 
We had a Reform style government in Saskatchewan from 1982 to 1991. 
They attended the Saskatchewan party convention.  
We have experienced firsthand the Reform style of government in Saskatchewan. 
It came to power in 1982. 
We had the lowest tax rates in the country. 
We had free dental care for children 18 and under. 
We had the lowest cost prescription drug plan in the world. 
We had the lowest unemployment rate in the country. 
We had no debt as a province. 
It gave away the assets to the shareholders. 
That is the bad way to do privatization. 
Maybe there is a good way to do it. 
The Reform Party will not support this bill. 
Privatization is one thing. 
He has been supporting this company. 
Tell us about the NDP style government in British Columbia.  
Tell us how they have destroyed the economy of British Columbia.  
We have every socialist in the country feeding off the province.  
As a result we will be supporting the bill when it comes to a vote.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will reply to the member for Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre.  
Reform put out our policies. 
He is lying right here and right now when he talks like that.  
The hon. member knows that kind of language is inappropriate. 
I know he will want to withdraw those words at once.  
Mr. Speaker, it slipped out by accident and I apologize for that. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Selkirk-Interlake for his question. 
What coalition was there?  
I know this is a sore point with the Reform Party. 
The Saskatchewan Party is a new party in Saskatchewan made up of Reformers. 
They attended a big convention the other day of about 150 people. 
We can tell how powerful the Reform Party of Saskatchewan is in Saskatchewan. 
The Reform Party and the party in Saskatchewan of Grant Devine are basically the same. 
That is what they promise. 
Grant Devine did that and the Reform Party did that. 
I believe that was part of the problem.  
The Reform Party just embraced this Grant Devine policy. 
I am very concerned that Reform members do not remember their history. 
Their history in Saskatchewan is really bad, corrupt and terrible. 
We in the west are very worried about that. 
Yes, the member's arithmetic is right. 
We in this party respect democracy. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Would the hon. member please analyse those two governments?  
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question from the member for Brandon-Souris. 
I can only speak about things that I am familiar with. 
The Bob Rae government did not send anybody to jail from its caucus. 
The Reform-Tory coalition in Saskatchewan sent about 17 or 18 to jail. 
I may be off by about one or two but it is approximate.  
I guess I can only compare what I know. 
To me that seems to be somewhat balanced.  
I know the NDP in Ontario had a bit of a rough ride. 
He can relate to the anxiousness and the anxiety of the NDP in Ontario.  
If we look at the polls the NDP is doing very well across the country. 
That is three provinces. 
We have a government in Yukon. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
This is the House of Commons. 
It is a place with elected officials. 
It reduces the respect that this place can generate.  
That is my comment. 
I think the hon. member is out to lunch.  
I did not make any reference to him personally by name. 
I did not make any reference to his executive. 
In debate we have to look at the facts. 
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
It proposed putting that authority into the hands of cabinet and streamlining the decision process.  
I have always jealously guarded the authority of the Chamber. 
Members of the House are the people's representatives.  
This is not an academic discussion. 
This bill proposes turning this decision over to cabinet. 
It is not pretty at times, but it works.  
I remember that there was great discussion over the efficacy of having the loonie. 
At that time it was in late June. 
Understandably, mint officials made a note of this. 
However, members will note that clause 3 has changed.  
I oppose that decision for two reasons. 
Westaim has supplied the mint with coin blanks for 35 years. 
Second, this is a risky venture for the mint to undertake. 
For example, consider employee costs. 
The process of manufacturing coin blanks requires highly skilled workers. 
There are only two ways to obtain employees such as this. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
It allows precisely what he just said in his speech. 
Could he clarify the apparent contradiction here?  
It is a very good question.  
I have been in business for over 20 years. 
I said from the start that government should not be in business. 
That is what I did.  
There are some flaws in the bill. 
I strongly believe that.  
It is true that there are still some flaws in the bill. 
I fought to get the amendment I wanted and I won the amendment. 
Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
It is not often that someone gets to make their mark in this place. 
The member has made his mark today as well as at committee. 
I think he has done a very reasonable job.  
It is not often that this happens in this place.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
This is not the only time this has happened. 
He does not know what he is talking about.  
It has borrowing authority. 
It borrows from banks. 
That is what the Royal Canadian Mint did.  
It is not taxpayers' money. 
Mr. Speaker, it is a crown corporation. 
This country has a number of other crown corporations. 
I am not talking about other corporations. 
I am talking about the Royal Canadian Mint which is a crown corporation.  
That corporation itself does not get money from the government. 
It is not taxpayers' money. 
It is borrowing money from a bank. 
What is wrong with that? 
It is a business deal.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
That certainly does apply in the case of Bill C-41.  
I want to talk about the various implications of the bill. 
Usually it is government bills. 
The government should pay close attention when we have some legitimate concerns.  
I would like to congratulate the hon. member for Tobique-Mactaquac. 
He is indeed an honourable member of the committee. 
The member, by compromising, did win one point.  
Should we really be selling out on five items in order to gain one? 
That is what we are reduced to. 
I know, we balance this. 
The minister is ultimately responsible for the operation of the department. 
There is a lot of obligation on his part. 
I wish there would have been a greater openness.  
The mint as a mother corporation may have a whole bunch of subsidiary corporations. 
To me, that is fraught with danger. 
All one has to do is use one's imagination on how this could happen.  
We need to be careful about that.  
Generally the mint can do all things that are incidental.  
There is a section that has to do with non-circulation coins. 
I imagine we will be inundated with coins at the millennium. 
I have read a few articles on that topic. 
It was a series of quarters. 
I imagine this can happen again.  
It can be announced and that will be the end of it.  
There are literally thousands of people use coin operated equipment. 
When that happens the density of the coin changes. 
I have talked to the administrative people in the mint. 
They are fine people. 
It went from a 12 sided coin to a fully round coin. 
Swift Current had 12 minutes of parking for a penny. 
That was several years to.  
To rip people off that high is not acceptable.  
However, the limits are also given. 
Those limitations are given here. 
Perhaps it should become a giant collector's item. 
I would certainly favour that.  
I have spoken on this topic before and it is a continued distress for me. 
I have talked to both sides. 
I am willing to accept a lower rate of interest. 
I find this very distressing. 
It is a faulty principle. 
The government is getting out of business. 
It has privatized with NavCan. 
It has privatized a whole bunch airports. 
In this instance it is going in the opposite direction. 
It is wrong for the government to be in competition.  
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
He mentioned NavCanada coming out of Transport Canada. 
But they are not getting anything back for that. 
They are still paying the same amount of taxes on aircraft fuel.  
Another instance is the post office. 
It has the resources of the government to compete.  
Mr. Speaker, there is a balance to be reached here. 
I do not see any need for the government to get into that business.  
There are things that government should be doing. 
They are put out to tender.  
I have heard both sides of the story. 
There are some problems.  
It is not totally one side or the other.  
He made the run and everybody was happy. 
He made a living on it.  
It gave fine service as far as I know. 
That was a wrong decision.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
This is a fundamental principle. 
The government should do things. 
Could he elaborate on that a little more?  
Some of the crown corporations become an end unto themselves. 
They serve their own ends. 
They are taking jobs away from people.  
A couple of general principles could be applied. 
On the other hand we have those situations where the government can do best. 
My dad was the chairman of the local one and there were five subscribers. 
It was a big company. 
My grandfather was with a different company, the Peel telephone company. 
She would hear this as sat in her little office in Swift Current. 
Everyone has seen Lily Tomlin do this. 
It was done under the auspices of the government. 
It was a fine co-operative effort on behalf of the people. 
At that stage it was a totally legitimate way of doing things.  
That is probably no longer the case. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I had to get in my two cents worth on this issue. 
This is my duty day so I had to get up to give my piece.  
There are three reasons I have problems with the bill as it stands. 
That is how it is worded. 
If it were to go belly up, the taxpayers would be left holding the bag.  
People like me would not get up to speak. 
Unfortunately this is just one among many examples. 
There is the Royal Canadian Mint. 
Canada Post is trying to shove out courier competitors. 
Canada Post shut it down because it has a monopoly.  
There is another example in training programs. 
Henderson Business College was operating in the city of Calgary. 
It kept going ahead and developing curricula and programs. 
It used to have two offices. 
It uses their own taxpayer dollars to put them out of business.  
It does not like the idea of ministerial accountability. 
It continually goes ahead and moves them further down the line.  
We cannot touch the government any more. 
The minister is not accountable.  
There are three good reasons to oppose the bill. 
The first is taxpayer money being used as a loan guarantee. 
Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
The good is over there and the bad and the ugly are over here.  
That has nothing to do with it.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
I thought they were excellent.  
It has a good operating plant. 
It is doing the job correctly.  
I wonder if the member could talk about that a little.  
How does one change that culture once it is in place?  
Mr. Speaker, that is part of the problem here. 
The government always thinks that more government is the answer and the solution. 
Too often we find that it is actually government that is the problem. 
Often we find that more government involvement makes the problem bigger rather than smaller.  
My colleague raises a very good point. 
I guess there is not a much better loan than that. 
However, that is based on the current mint master. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
That is fair but that has happened very seldom.  
The fact is it is competing.  
I think it is going to happen and it is wrong.  
The parliamentary secretary is shaking her head with glee. 
Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
What controls would we have over that? 
It sounded like a fairyland over there.  
It is called open bidding. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I suggest the House be suspended until 6.30 p.m. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The sitting of the House was suspended at 6.24 p.m.) 
The House resumed at 6.30 p.m. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I move: 
That this House do now adjourn.  
You may split the speeches in any way you want. 
Any speaker may split his or her allotted time. 
There will be four hours of debate.  
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank you for granting that debate last Friday.  
That crisis is very real and it is with us today. 
It will take some resolve on the part of this government. 
Some statistics are worth repeating. 
Our farmers do not have to take a back seat to anyone in the world. 
They can compete on a fair basis with any farmers anywhere in the world. 
The Asian crisis has had a significant and dramatic effect on farm incomes. 
It goes on and on. 
It is incumbent upon the Parliament of Canada to find some solution to this problem.  
The Asian crisis has aggravated this problem. 
Farmers have started to withdraw money from their NISA accounts. 
That is not enough. 
Farmers need a long term commitment on farm safety nets. 
The assistance programs must be delivered equitably and fairly.  
Many of the members are from western Canada. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
An emergency debate is very necessary in order to put the issue on the table.  
Still there is no proposal. 
We would not be in this situation if the political will were there. 
It would appear it is not. 
As was mentioned earlier, do our competitors have political will?  
I will be perfectly clear. 
They simply would not. 
But something has to be done.  
In 1995 the government decided to take short term gain for long term pain. 
Other provinces did not. 
Now we are in that situation. 
The time for meetings is over. 
The time for action is now. 
Producers are selling at a loss. 
It was projected to drop another 35% in 1997-98. 
Next year it is only expected to be worse. 
They need our support and they need it now. 
Why do we continue to support agriculture? 
The answer is because it is worth our support. 
I believe they want it to come from Canada''. 
I agree with those comments. 
I would like to be of assistance in this debate. 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will split my time with my parliamentary secretary.  
I have spent my lifetime in the agriculture and agri-food industry. 
They represent one of the pillars of our economy.  
I know how desperate too many producers are. 
It has made a tremendous contribution to the restoration of the country's public finances. 
They jumped into the export markets feet first. 
That helped to fuel the growth of our national economy.  
I can tell members we are working as quickly as possible to do that. 
Meanwhile I met with farm organizations and provincial representatives. 
Last Friday I met with the Royal Bank. 
This government wants to do the best we can for our farmers. 
Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to take part in this debate tonight.  
It is very difficult for the Chair to hear the hon. member. 
Obviously his remarks have provoked something of an uproar, but I am unable to tell. 
The Chair is very interested in this debate too. 
Mr. Speaker, I think I have touched a very sore spot. 
I am quoting from their very own platform of 1997. 
I want to put on the record just what is in that platform.  
I am not sure what the provincial ministers are saying about this today.  
They were going to eliminate them all.  
The relationship between this Department and the private sector will also be changed. 
Number one, the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food would have disappeared. 
The budget would have been cut by $608 million or 40%.  
Research and development activities would have been transferred to the private sector. 
This platform is very similar to the Reform platform. 
The system, as a whole, is a good system. 
For whatever reason, they have not been able to save enough in their NISA accounts. 
We want to be able to assist those farmers.  
We also want to design a program that will not undermine the system we have. 
That will be welcome news to farmers across the country.  
They are not going to come from the PC platform or the Reform Party platform.  
NISA and its companion funds provide a partial answer. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Tonight, therefore, I would like to focus on two questions. 
First, why is it taking the government so long to act? 
Second, will the government provide a real solution or simply a band-aid?  
The government did not react at that time to that prediction in a substantive way. 
May I suggest that this has become part of a pattern with this government. 
It is slow to act, period.  
The government expresses alarm. 
The government does studies. 
The government wrings its hands. 
It needs real, long term solutions.  
If it moves, tax it. 
If it continues to move, tax it more. 
And if it stops moving, subsidize it.  
I would like to see this done by the agriculture department. 
It should be part of its presentation to finance and cabinet. 
My point is that this government plays a shell game with taxes and subsidies. 
It takes with one hand and it gives with the other. 
But the taking is always greater than the giving.  
We want to study the details when they are brought forward and cost them out.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I certainly will participate in the debate tonight. 
That will be delivered on December 7 for the benefit of the agriculture minister.  
This crisis is real. 
It is national in scope and will not be over soon. 
Why did the Liberals fail to take action? 
The question has been asked before but it must be asked again. 
Our producers must have more than just a temporary band-aid. 
They need a long term solution. 
However I believe that the junior minister for agriculture from the government did attend.  
There were no federal Liberals there. 
There were no federal NDP there. 
There were no federal Conservatives at this open public meeting.  
Farmers need more than handouts. 
They cannot keep coming back to the government every few years. 
However, it must be part of a larger package. 
We see who is going to Europe to talk about these subsidies. 
These unelected people will come back and have very little, if anything, to say. 
Unfortunately the Liberals have made no attempt to initiate these types of negotiations. 
Federal taxes account for about 15% of the retail cost of fertilizers.  
This does not seem to make sense to a reasonable person.  
Reform's plan could be implemented today. 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Something needs to be done urgently, therefore.  
So what is there left for the producers?  
Grain prices are going the same way.  
And that is not the end of it.  
What are the effects of this crisis? 
There are direct effects and there are secondary effects. 
Farm producers see a long way ahead. 
They have a sense of continuity. 
Theirs is a vocation, a way of life. 
Then there are the adverse effects. 
The attack on rural life is straightforward. 
When the countryside is emptied, the community loses its structure. 
What are the disadvantages? 
Nobody is a winner.  
This is what we are calling ``operation bail-out''. 
There are other things that can be done, however.  
What led up to the crisis we are now experiencing? 
Canada should get going and create a food bank. 
It is a bank for when times are bad. 
This is a major difference with the practice in other provinces.  
Quebec's farming sector is now undergoing a crisis of confidence. 
Whatever the outcome in Quebec today, the Bloc Quebecois will be very vigilant. 
A speedy response to this crisis is necessary.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Our caucus ever since has been calling for swift action by the government. 
Regrettably farmers and their families are still waiting for that swift action.  
Promises of more rational international economic management will not provide relief tomorrow. 
Canadian farmers face a crisis now. 
These farm families need urgent assistance and they need it now. 
They need quick and decisive action. 
Neither the government nor the official opposition seems to understand that. 
This is a crisis. 
That is over a 70% decline in income. 
What is the cost of waiting? 
The Americans did more than study. 
They acted at the first sign of trouble. 
Talk about an eyedropper in an ocean. 
Reform talks about unfair subsidies. 
He should open his eyes and unplug his ears. 
They need assistance, not Reform members shaking their fists at international subsidies.  
What should the government do to restore hope to Canadian farmers? 
Let me outline a four point plan that must be implemented immediately.  
Second, in conjunction with the banks, a moratorium on farm foreclosures. 
We should make sure that we take this humanitarian approach.  
More than an occupation, it is a calling.  
Each year a new spring gives renewed optimism for the future. 
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to participate in the debate this evening.  
There must be some kind of a gouging in the middle. 
Maybe the government could look at that. 
The numbers are way up. 
They deal with farmers before it gets to the foreclosure situation. 
I was in Ottawa at that time. 
Should an alarm bell not go off in terms of what is happening? 
We have seen the fertilizer costs go up 57% from 1992 to 1997. 
I went to the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, France. 
I happen to have a community in my riding called Strasbourg. 
We are eliminating that in order to have good competition. 
What are you going to do about it?''  
Meanwhile we have abandoned our farmers.  
We can only draw one of two conclusions from this. 
I sense it was both. 
That is negligence on behalf of the government. 
I would ask the government to consider that.  
That is a very serious issue.  
We should have long term solutions and short term solutions. 
I am proposing five items for short term solutions.  
It is a good number for grain and pork producers.  
The Government of Canada should deal with the input costs I have referred to. 
There are two long term solutions. 
We have a serious situation with respect to the agriculture economy. 
The Reform Party has touched on a couple of issues I want to respond to. 
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia, Lib.):
He is doing everything in his power, everything he can, to tackle this issue. 
He has kept everyone in the House well informed of the situation. 
None of us can afford to let it go down the drain. 
That is where the whole discussion about a combination of programs comes into place. 
Our record performance of the last four or five years will come back. 
Canadian farmers are justifiably worried about what might be around the corner. 
We are absolutely committed to continue working on this front.  
Subsidies especially hurt smaller and medium size countries like Canada. 
They are a detriment to a strong and healthy global agricultural economy. 
Such subsidies were banned for industrial products in the mid-1950s.  
As members know, these sorts of negotiations take time. 
They are very much our long term approach.  
Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, Lib.):
Of course that aggregate number hides the problems we know exist. 
There are wheat farmers in my riding. 
Doing this will help to bring sense to the numbers.  
There are other pressing issues that demand the attention of the federal government. 
It is not one or the other. 
We must find a way to do the best we can for all these people.  
Moving forward, not backward, requires partnership between the levels of government. 
That principle was established in previous events. 
In the current situation this is especially true. 
Solutions will come from this hard work. 
Effective programs will be produced by this approach. 
Will it be flashy? 
No. Will it be a total cure? 
There are no quick, easy or total solutions.  
Making a difference is part of governing. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
I will start with a letter from Bill Lozinski that I received last week. 
This is what Mr. Lozinski had to say: 
The unfairness in today's agriculture situation is unbelievable.  
That is if they are bought in a grocery store. 
He went on to say that farmers get $2.50 of that amount. 
(fuel, fertilizer, chemical and seed). 
I'm not even mentioning the cost of machinery.  
Let me stop here for a minute. 
I used his calculations. 
Let me continue with his letter: 
When farmers have money, the economy thrives. 
We are not a burden on the taxpayers. 
We subsidize every person who buys groceries. 
The cheap food policy is killing rural Canada. 
(The price of a bushel of wheat in 1929 was $2.65 a bushel).  
Let me get back to his letter. 
It is very interesting. 
My brother-in-law lived in Switzerland for the last three years. 
Their grocery bill was about 50% of their gross income. 
Their farmers receive an outstanding price for their commodities. 
Well, the truth is they make a lot more. 
Their farms are small and they have a lot of them. 
They are more numerous than most farm families here.  
That is the point. 
At $50 an acre we cannot afford not to have that. 
Thank you, Mr. Breitkreuz, for your efforts. 
I have received over 1,000 replies in the last week alone on this issue. 
About 70% of the people who have been contacting my office are farmers. 
Another question they responded to was what is causing this. 
Those two factors were the key factors causing this crisis.  
How is this manifested? 
They cannot pay their bills. 
This is what the farmers are telling me.  
What are the solutions? 
Where are we to go on this? 
A good percentage are saying they need help in transportation. 
Another thing they emphasize is that they need tax reductions. 
I was quite surprised at the next one. 
They do not see that as an answer. 
I guess everyone knows there is about $138 million in that.  
I think this is important so I hope the government is listening. 
They feel that would be the fairest way for the government to address this issue.  
NISA did not score very high. 
About 10% of the people said that we needed a guaranteed price for our grain. 
I have also gone ahead and summarized a lot of comments. 
I will quickly summarize them.  
Most farmers said that NISA was useless. 
Farmers have said that NISA needs to be improved. 
Another group of comments come from business people. 
They say times are tough. 
These business people also say that if the farm economy fails so will their business. 
From that point subsidies are seen as not being so bad.  
They say there needs to be some type of a cap on these costs. 
They will increase their profit margin.  
I have another 50 minutes in my speech. 
I will conclude by saying I hope the government will talk to me. 
I have been talking to farmers one on one. 
I have received over 1,000 responses. 
I would ask the government to please be open. 
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
There is a crisis on the farm scene. 
There is a bigger crisis in the Liberal front benches. 
I do not see any of them over there. 
That is where the crisis is. 
I am almost blind but I noticed it somehow.  
I will read a couple of quotes. 
I appreciate the question. 
That has never been accomplished. 
In 1994 everybody knew that the Europeans had huge subsidies. 
The Europeans would not allow their farmers to get into a financial problem. 
They would support them. 
We had to be prepared to have some safety net programs in place.  
How huge is this crisis in farming?  
I was quite appreciative of the member for Yorkton-Melville when he started comparing prices. 
These are prices for their products. 
This is in the supply management sector. 
Today I receive $1.80 for that same type of wheat''. 
It is not even one-half of what this farmer received in 1981.  
We know what has happened to the price of fertilizer. 
We know what has happened to the price of equipment. 
How are these farmers supposed to deal with this? 
Farmers have been looking far and wide to see if they can get better prices. 
In the 1992 crop year in Saskatchewan grain was damaged by frost. 
What did the grain companies and the wheat board do? 
He was not allowed to go back without paying a fine. 
He was fined $1,500 and was told to turn his car in. 
It was a specialty barley. 
He wound up in prison.  
They said ``I don't need any money. 
How do we deal with this? 
So with provincial encouragement they expanded and diversified. 
Today they are losing $50 to $60 a hog.  
How do we deal with a situation like that? 
it is funny, but it is true. 
Guess what that toast costs at that restaurant? 
How can the price of the breakfast be $5? 
Farmers are supposed to survive and they are not supposed to be subsidized.  
Mr. Hehn appeared before the standing committee. 
I asked him why we were not getting better prices for our wheat. 
He said they were pricing it at Thunder Bay. 
The price of a bushel of wheat was initially $1.57 at the elevator. 
The buy-back price was $3.93 at Morris, not at Thunder Bay.  
It does not make sense. 
Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):
It is for that very reason that we must decisively act now. 
Tonight we are participating in an emergency debate. 
However, the impression should not be given that these challenges have not been without benefit. 
I represent one of the largest agricultural producing constituencies east of the Manitoba border. 
That same producer today would be fortunate to receive 60 cents.  
The problem posed by this is that the input costs remain. 
I understand it is even higher than that.  
They have no choices available. 
They cannot afford to keep their pigs and they cannot afford to sell them.  
Cash crops, beef, sheep and lamb are all at risk.  
The potential is endless only if we maintain a stable economic foothold in the markets. 
We are approaching the proverbial fork in the road.  
Farmers need a hand up, not a handout. 
Strategic investment into key areas of growth is essential. 
We simply cannot permit that situation to occur here.  
There are those among us who believe that bigger is always better. 
In my riding of Huron-Bruce I have 150 operations. 
Mortgages, taxes and land costs are on the rise. 
In the U.S. 20 feed lots market over 50% of the fed beef. 
Rural Canada then becomes a little more than a branch of corporate America.  
Talk is cheap and the price of pork even cheaper. 
We have a reputation for quality. 
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
The family farm is under siege. 
This problem is international in nature and thus we must look at the big picture. 
There is now a huge oversupply in the marketplace. 
Grain and pork prices are at or are near historic lows. 
Farm income is also depressed for many producers of other commodities as well. 
It is big business. 
My riding alone produces nearly half a million hogs per year. 
A farmer with a 300 sow operation is now losing $1,000 a day. 
It would only provide short term help for grain producers. 
We must also look beyond our borders. 
But even with a foot in the door, much remains to be done. 
Many high tariff barriers remain in place. 
The GATT has been revamped and the membership is now bigger and growing. 
Only then can we avoid the warped market we see today.  
Today that seems to be still a very big goal. 
The people who eat the food must understand that as well.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
That is why this debate is very important this evening.  
I think we have something like 1,500 farm families in the riding.  
Two things have occurred that put the farmer in a very difficult position today. 
In the European Union wheat farmers are subsidized by a total of $205 per tonne. 
That is the subsidy in Europe. 
Indeed it is below the cost of production. 
For that reason a lot of farmers are suffering.  
There is a fellow in my riding from Balcarres named Lloyd Pletz. 
He talked about the farmers in his neighbourhood who were going bankrupt and were broke. 
He also talked about farm stress and difficulties in families.  
There was another women named Mrs. Elder who operates a farm distress line. 
The question is what do we do about it. 
There are three things we have to do. 
That issue is a bit different. 
Hopefully that will recover. 
We can afford that as country. 
We cannot afford not to do it as a country.  
We are running a surplus of some $10 billion at this time. 
That is my basic plea this evening. 
I also want to mention this evening the whole area of the trade wars. 
I know the government has spoken out on this matter. 
We have to do that and I know our government is doing that.  
Parliament should express itself very clearly from all parties in the House. 
That is extremely important.  
What is happening today is not the fault of our farmers. 
I am just thinking of it as I am on my feet.  
This is where ideologies are set aside. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
That is exactly what is happening to farmers.  
Farmers are the finest people in all of Canada when it comes to agricultural work. 
They deserve our help and they need our help now. 
Dear House of Commons: 
They are prepared to compete in world markets on a fair basis. 
However, current world markets are anything but fair. 
In 1999, they are projected to be $766 million below the five-year average. 
There are two issues that need to be dealt with. 
Only the federal government has the fiscal ability to fund such a program. 
Saskatchewan is prepared to help our agriculture sector as much as possible. 
These large problems are clearly beyond the scope of an individual province. 
What we are talking about are the finest farmers in the entire world. 
What have these farmers done? 
Mr. John Maloney (Erie-Lincoln, Lib.):
The outlook for the next 6 to 10 months appears most unfavourable.  
Many of our nation's pork producers are under financial stress. 
Some are facing bankruptcy and financial ruin. 
As of last week the price was 62 cents per kilogram. 
The five year price average is $1.65 per kilogram. 
Hogs are sold on a dressed weight basis of approximately 84 kilograms. 
Simple mathematics tells the tale.  
This is an industry that my riding can ill afford to lose.  
Agriculture accounts for 13% of the gross domestic product of Ontario. 
What brought about the severe price drop? 
Ontario pork producers are competitive. 
This is totally inadequate under the current circumstances.  
At the federal level producers across Canada are represented by the Canada Pork Council. 
Pork producers are used to and operate within a cyclic market. 
The present situation, however, is not a normal cycle in the pork industry. 
It is now a catastrophe.  
It is a truism that every little bit helps.  
Let me speak about the overall crisis.  
Grains and oilseeds are among our leading agricultural exports. 
It is a national problem requiring a national response.  
It is indeed very urgent and very important. 
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in this debate on farm income.  
Yes, we are an urban riding. 
Etobicoke-Lakeshore has no agricultural sector in its economic base. 
Economic activities in Etobicoke-Lakeshore are concentrated in the service and manufacturing sectors. 
Farming is one of those activities that is the mainstay for many communities. 
Etobicoke-Lakeshore cares about the livelihood of these communities. 
The problems they face concern us all. 
I know his commitment. 
I listened and my constituents listened. 
I will give a few answers, as I understand them.  
We have our minister's word and I know our minister's word is meaningful.  
In studying this issue I discovered some facts. 
For a city girl, this is really terrible news.  
Of course, that aggregate number hides the problems we know exist. 
Some parts of the country are suffering worse than others. 
My colleagues who come from those sectors speak to me about it. 
The majority of grain farmers are in Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Alberta. 
There are also grain farmers in Ontario.  
Doing this will help us to bring sense to the numbers.  
And there are other pressing issues that demand the attention of the federal government. 
We must find a way to do the best we can for all these people. 
This is what we must do. 
There is never a place for adversarial relationships between federal and provincial governments. 
Effective programs will be produced by this approach.  
No. Will it be a total cure? 
I think we must be humble. 
There are no quick, easy or total solutions. 
Making a difference is part of governing.  
The Government of Canada is committed to making a difference in the farm income situation. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
This is a crisis.  
Farmers are in danger of losing their business. 
He expects to lose at least $200,000 this year alone. 
That is the money he spends to operate his facility.  
I worked in an industry where we had to market commodities. 
Hog farming in the province of New Brunswick is a significant industry. 
This affects the people in my riding of Fundy-Royal. 
This does not just affect the individuals who work in the farming industry. 
Let us put some of this in perspective.  
The price of feed has not gone down. 
It is not at 1944 prices. 
I may have made a mistake in talking about statistics. 
We are looking at a complete meltdown. 
This is a crisis. 
The income farmers are receiving is only 55% of what they received in 1997.  
The government has chosen to abandon that program.  
I will give due credit to the government of the day. 
This announcement has to be a bankable one. 
Mr. Hart is not an affluent individual who trades in commodities left, right and centre. 
One thousand dollars is a very personal hit on him and his family.  
I am splitting my time with the member for Kings-Hants. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
This is one issue that has affected our industry in our province dramatically. 
Currently there is federal-provincial finger pointing on this issue. 
My hon. colleague from Fundy-Royal spoke of the pork industry. 
That is where we are at. 
Farmers need assistance now. 
This situation is not a time for dilly-dallying with the federal government. 
How dare they ever accuse any other party of betraying an election platform? 
They invented the notion. 
It is like throwing an anchor to a drowning man. 
The EU nations and the Americans are subsidizing significantly. 
They say they are opposed to bailouts. 
They probably would have opposed Roosevelt on the new deal. 
The fact is farmers need help now. 
A nation's ability to produce food is fundamental. 
Frankly, current income support programs simply do not cut it. 
We need to act decisively. 
There is no time for this ideological warfare. 
This is an unprecedented crisis in recent history. 
We urge the Liberals to move quickly. 
This is not an issue for ideological wrangling. 
In the Annapolis Valley we are seeing farmers go bankrupt at an unprecedented level. 
The pork industry is going downhill. 
We need a holistic program. 
But in the short term we must do what is right. 
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
It was probably my father's farm. 
I vividly recall doing rhubarb roots in November.  
The novelty of doing it wears off after a while.  
That in some respects is the issue. 
Income in 1998 will be the highest it has been in years previous. 
The average for the years 1993 to 1997 is $415 million. 
Hidden in the numbers are some sectoral problems, particularly in the area of hog production. 
It will be concentrated in one sector. 
I believe that is where the crisis is.  
As we move further west it is clear that the crisis gets deeper and deeper. 
Then if we go further west to Saskatchewan the numbers become quite dramatic. 
The total net income for the average of 1993 through 1997 was $715 million. 
The numbers do not lie in these instances. 
It is clearly directed to two sectors, the grain sector and the hog sector.  
The question is whether the government should be panicked into a response. 
There will be spill-overs into other areas and other sectors. 
However, should the government panic as suggested by some members opposite?  
This is one idea that fits all issues. 
Under the circumstances a tax cut is a meaningless solution.  
Its solution is to get into national programs and to look at subsidies. 
The government has taken something of a measured response to this issue. 
I suggest it is the right path to pursue. 
The second area is crop insurance, also a voluntary program. 
All these are measured and appropriate responses to a serious issue. 
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
I have been farming since 1974. 
From 1974 until 1985 I was a pig producer. 
It was a very sad experience. 
But I believe right now we are on the threshold of exactly that.  
I would like to read some of it because it is very scary.  
The story is not in on what is going to happen this year. 
Basically farmers left with the clothes on their backs. 
We have had financial and political instability within Europe, Latin America and Russia. 
We are experiencing another trade war. 
I can also give information on what is happening in Europe. 
That is referred to as the $6 billion farm aid package.  
These are subsidies the United States said it would do away with. 
Obviously it has not.  
Let us take a look at Europe. 
I do not have an answer for that. 
There is the problem.  
As far as I am concerned that is bovine fertilizer. 
It is not just the opposition that gets these phone calls. 
They are all acutely aware of what is happening. 
I have been watching production in our country. 
That is what is happening.  
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
The backdrop was the massive trade war that was taking place during the 1980s. 
It was not a good agricultural practice.  
We do not want to go back there. 
I have to remind the House that it was only a modest start. 
In addition, this has brought about a very stagnant farm net income situation. 
The east Asian situation has hurt us further.  
Here is the present situation. 
That brings me to what we need to do to correct the situation.  
The Cairns Group has been very active in looking for trade liberalization. 
That is what is happening these days. 
A 30% increase in production. 
That is because farmers are getting these massive subsidies.  
We have to put some pressure on these people. 
We might have to talk about industrial tariffs. 
It is in our interest to try to get some trade liberalization.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will focus on a fairly narrow area.  
We are very thankful for what they did. 
However the money did not go into this program. 
The Liberal government is facing a situation right now that must be dealt with. 
We recognized the deficit situation. 
We recognized that taxes were too high. 
Reform more than anybody called for tax reduction. 
That is not what farmers want. 
Farmers do not want handouts. 
They want fair trade. 
That is precisely what the trade distortion adjustment program would have done.  
The Liberals did not take our advice. 
Farmers should not have to face that time and again. 
Most of them lost their farms. 
What is to be done? 
The Liberals have to come up with the answer. 
It cannot just be a short term payout. 
It has to be a long term solution to the problem. 
Farmers in my constituency will be watching to see what they do.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
It is making changes to the law retroactively. 
Let me give the specifics of a case. 
Revenue Canada says there has not been a change in the legislation in question. 
In the 1990s the dollar value in the sale of timber has increased. 
Therefore Revenue Canada no longer considers the amounts to be insignificant. 
The initial appeal of capital gain treatment was rejected. 
We are talking about a potential bailout by the Liberals of a specific problem. 
This is what I am speaking about.  
The Liberals have to get it right. 
They have to treat ranchers, farmers, all taxpayers fairly.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Will the hon. member take questions?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
There are two minutes left in debate.  
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
They all stress that action is needed now before a catastrophe occurs. 
This is a matter which is out of the control of farmers.  
Retail prices have not changed. 
This is a provincial and federal matter. 
I urge all the provinces to support any initiative which our minister proposes. 
It is important that the minister act as soon as possible. 
I have spoken to the minister about this on a number of occasions. 
I urge him to act as soon as humanly possible.  
On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House adjourned at 10.30 p.m.)
