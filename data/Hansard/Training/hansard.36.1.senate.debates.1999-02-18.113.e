Thursday, February 18, 1999 
The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Behind these statistics, honourable senators, are real people. 
They are children growing up without an early motivating force to learn. 
They cannot read to their children. 
Overall, they are talking about life-long learning. 
Parliamentarians should not have to be dragged into this issue. 
You will hear stories that will make you cheer, and even shed a few tears. 
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
It is also a subject very close to my heart, and that is literacy.  
Today is Literacy Action Day. 
I wonder, is this really me? 
Oh! Thank you, thank you, N.B.C.C. 
Honourable senators, today across Canada is Literacy Action Day. 
The lowest level is found in my province of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
Bill to Amend-Report of Committee 
Thursday, February 18, 1999 
The Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has the honour to present its 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Royal Canadian Mint Act Currency Act 
Bill to Amend-Report of Committee 
Thursday, February 18, 1999 
The Standing Senate Committee on National Finance has the honour to present its 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Statement of Minister of Finance-Inquiry 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I appreciate the question of the honourable senator. 
We are just putting an infrastructure in place now. 
The House of Commons has had a housing allowance for years. 
We are just starting to build that in. 
It, too, costs money.  
Our record in that regard is nothing to be ashamed of.  
Hon. Norman K. Atkins :
I can say openly that some people have taken certain steps in that regard already. 
I will leave it at that.  
Hon. Therese Lavoie-Roux :
I would not call these exorbitant amounts. 
These things had to be done, and I do not think the costs are exorbitant.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, I rise with some sadness and with a heavy heart. 
We have now had another incident where a Sea King helicopter was forced to land. 
That is quite different from risk management. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Perhaps it should be.  
When a problem occurs with our helicopters, that problem is tracked down and identified. 
The cause of the problem is then identified and fixed. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, "restricted flight" is not "grounding." 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Yes, before it fell out of the sky.  
The crew landed safely, and they were in complete control. 
No one was injured. 
Maybe the Prime Minister was on board!  
That landing yesterday was serious. 
I know the minister takes this matter very seriously. 
I just wish he had some clout at the cabinet table. 
Yesterday, that plane was not under "full control." 
Where are the dollars and cents to buy it?  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
There are no targets and there is no long-term plan. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the Honourable Senator Oliver is totally and completely inaccurate.  
What are the targets, then?  
The debt repayment plan was announced in the last budget. 
The government is already committed to reducing the debt.  
What is "long term"? 
Is it two years?  
Honourable senators, there are three key elements in the plan:
That is long term!  
The plan has already been a success. 
Tell us when that wizard Allan MacEachen did it!  
This country is on the right track under this particular government. 
The Budget Plan-Allocation of Funds to Interest on Debt 
He will find them in the document entitled "The Budget Plan."  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I would be happy to do that. 
Honourable senators, my question is also for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
What kind of aircraft was used for the trip to Whistler? 
Was it a government aircraft? 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I do not have the list of the passengers with me.  
Would you like to borrow mine?  
Bill to Amend-Third Reading 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Cash, according to the federal government, will be treated as a dividend. 
Perhaps I should read the pertinent part of the letter.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators, to table the letter?  
How long did they spend on it?  
Here is what he said regarding hearings on Bill C-59: 
They're the unelected house. 
It's important, I think, for us to do this. 
It's too bad we have the time constraint. 
Fortunately the Senate was there to do that. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
I do not intend to belabour this matter. 
I was not successful at getting a straight answer from the minister. 
However, I wish to thank Senator Kenny for having done that very thing. 
I will quote from the transcript of the committee hearings. 
Honourable senators, I rest my case.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Consideration of Interim Report of Special Committee-Debate Adjourned 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Such a subcommittee was struck in October of 1996. 
We must look at further amendments to this act as our study continues.  
With regard to marine transportation, the main safety problem comes from recreational boating. 
Over 200 people die each year in these types of boating accidents. 
We are also concerned about the ageing work force in our marine industry. 
Turning to highway transportation safety, there are three fundamental points that must be made. 
Second, we must do something about truck-transport safety. 
Third, Canada needs an enforceable national safety code. 
We need to try again. 
These three initiatives are overdue. 
If they are accomplished, literally hundreds of lives will be saved annually.  
Finally, I wish to touch on the subject of air safety. 
This area is a priority for the special committee. 
On motion of Senator Forrestall, on behalf of Senator Spivak, debate adjourned.  
The Estimates, 1998-99 
Bill to Amend-Consideration of Report of Committee-Debate Adjourned 
Bill S-10 amends the Excise Tax Act. 
Let me single out Senator Fairbairn for special attention. 
She knows more about it than anyone. 
We are now, however, faced with a different principle. 
Stick to your principles!  
I want to acknowledge that today.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Would the honourable senator accept a question?  
Honourable senators, three amendments were sent to the committee. 
I understand that only one has been returned. 
I do not even have them in front of me at the moment. 
I only have the report and the amendment that we are recommending to the Senate.  
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
The second part dealt with the issue of pornography. 
A number of senators on both sides spoke eloquently on all of the amendments. 
As Senator Murray said, it was a wonderful, bipartisan effort. 
I trust that is the answer the honourable senator was looking for.  
That aside, honourable senators, this has been a learning experience. 
The committee heard testimony from a wide range of individuals. 
Each witness had something interesting to tell us. 
Kids should enjoy the privilege of reading.  
It is the best start to a good life.  
Incidentally, Ms Anderson wrote me following her appearance. 
She gave the committee some sobering statistics. 
Once again, honourable senators, I remind you that we are talking about 1999. 
That letter noted that: 
Post-secondary students have been seriously affected by the introduction of the GST.  
Further on, he adds: 
The GST affects what students can buy.  
Mr. Gzowski mentioned two things that I believe bear repeating. 
The best one is to remove the GST on reading material.  
Honourable senators, we all promised Canadians that we would get rid of this tax. 
We have an obligation to keep that promise.  
I wish to take a moment to bring to your attention two points. 
Books, newspapers and magazines are instruments of freedom.  
He came from South America. 
On motion of Senator Carstairs, debate adjourned.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Annual Report-Consideration in Committee of the Whole 
Mr. Bruce Phillips , Privacy Commissioner of Canada:
My address will be as brief as I can possibly make it. 
I must start by saying that this is quite a thrill. 
It is now somewhat out of fashion, which is too bad. 
Bring him into the Senate!  
I will confess to having fantasized about that possibility once or twice. 
It is good to see you again.  
As most of you know, my term expires in about 15 months. 
I think there is some truth in that statement. 
That is a wise observation indeed. 
"Privacy," in short, is just another word for "freedom." 
Enough chipping away and it all falls down. 
It is the chipping process that I should like to talk about today.  
There are privacy problems cropping up in all kinds of places these days. 
We could profitably discuss all of these things one at a time and at length. 
In fact, before some of your committees we have discussed some of these matters already.  
This is not rocket science. 
Often it is honoured not in the observance but in the breach.  
It is more of an insidious process and it often happens quite unknowingly.  
I can certainly supply examples. 
Usually, if my office finds out about it, I can fix it, but not always.  
If you go to a doctor, you reveal your symptoms. 
If you go to an employer, you must cite your qualifications. 
In a phrase, it is creaky and it is leaky. 
There are other offensive exemptions as well. 
This bill also provides an oversight mechanism involving my office. 
It is a long step forward and I support it. 
If the answer is no, they should be sent back to the drawing board. 
Of course, I will be anxious to contribute the help of my office.  
We are now ready to field your questions.  
They vary a great deal depending upon the kind of information involved. 
I cannot give you a simple answer. 
That is a compulsory collection of information. 
I do not see a special case for excusing the census. 
Even though that is a proposition under which you are mandated to operate?  
Yes, it has escaped the definition of personal information. 
Thank you Mr. Phillips. 
I expect you and I will be locking horns on this again.  
Welcome, Mr. Commissioner, and thank you for your presentation. 
I must give you a conditional answer because your question is based on an assumption. 
It is good to have you here, Mr. Commissioner. 
What is the problem?  
Has that practice stopped?  
I believe that is a fair way to describe the outcome of the case. 
While they contemplate their next step, the match has been suspended.  
I am pleased, Senator Kinsella, to hear that suggestion raised here. 
What I am thinking of is perhaps some additional system of review.  
I am very unhappy with the present situation that drove us into court. 
We must do better than that. 
We need a better system.  
Am I correct in my understanding?  
There was one in 1987. 
There has not been one for the past 12 years.  
Some very sensible recommendations were made but not adopted.  
You alluded to too much exclusion. 
There are also significant differences. 
The provincial commissioners all have ordered powers. 
I am an ombudsperson and I do not want ordered powers. 
My relations with government departments are quite cooperative. 
We do get some good results.  
A parliamentary review would be a good thing.  
Who knows, we may adopt that principle.  
We do our best, and that is all I can say. 
I have very limited resources for that purpose. 
Funding has been a severe problem for our office. 
However, ours is a special case. 
I understand what you are saying. 
That was not the thrust of my question. 
It is one of the jobs of all legislators. 
The answer to that is in the affirmative if, by "mandate," you mean our responsibility. 
However, there are many other things that are not mentioned either. 
We have a responsibility to do our best in that respect. 
However, we need more funds to do our jobs effectively.  
Yesterday in the Foreign Affairs Committee we were reviewing Bill S-22. 
That is a massive amount of personal information. 
Massive amounts of our information exist in American computers. 
I raise that as a question.  
Senator, we are looking at that particular bill now, even as we speak. 
We have not had it long, just a matter of a few days. 
You mentioned the DNA bill. 
Let me compliment the members of the Senate committee who handled that particular issue. 
You are referring to a Senate parliamentary committee.  
Yes, I refer to a Senate parliamentary committee. 
The bill was greatly improved in the process. 
There are reams and reams of these records. 
We all have two or three telephones and we are getting these long lists.  
I have not looked into this question. 
Has there been any thought on your part about that type of information? 
Is that an issue for you?  
Yes, of course, it is an issue. 
Those are typical of the kinds of mass information holdings that private corporations can collect. 
That would become the law and they would have to live with it.  
I have only anecdotal evidence. 
We do get complaints from people around the country. 
People are entitled to have legal rights respecting the use of that information.  
I am sorry that they are taking that position. 
I guess the bill strikes a pretty good half-way position.  
It will not get an easy ride. 
Such laws have existed in most of Western Europe now for several decades. 
They are well ahead of us. 
Australia is now moving toward it. 
New Zealand has had it for some time. 
That was something to which we all paid attention.  
I cannot give you any more than fragmentary views on the subject.  
As far as I know, there is nothing unlawful about the practice. 
The answer to the question, Senator Oliver, is maybe.  
I am sorry, but I will defer a more complete answer to that question.  
No, I do not think so. 
Honourable senators, Bill C-54 deals essentially with commercial transactions. 
Then it may be subject to Bill C-54.  
Yes, but we would have to look at the specific circumstances.  
However, commercial activity is not sufficiently and clearly defined. 
Does it cover things, for example, such as non-profit or charitable organizations? 
What effect would that have on any records created as a consequence? 
There are some complications and ambiguities involved here that we must sort out.  
Again, we have to sort a few of these things out. 
When I said maybe, I would lean more at this stage to "probably yes." 
Mr. Chairman, how long will we be? 
We do have other business to deal with today. 
Did we set a time frame?  
No, we did not.  
We investigate complaints against government departments daily. 
We are required by the statute to investigate them.  
I am not subject to a direction by any department of government. 
I am under your control.  
I do not know that I can answer it any better than I already have. 
This could be seen by some as a possible source of perceived conflict. 
However, it does not bother me. 
I do not know what more I can tell you. 
It may be awkward or difficult for you to answer, and I would understand that.  
It bothered a lot of us here. 
It bothered Senator Kinsella and myself a great deal. 
If you look at those depictions, there is nothing "unlawful" about them. 
They are not perpetrating a crime. 
There is certainly a privacy issue, absolutely. 
I have views on a good deal of these things. 
It is more than a question of good taste.  
I would be happy to defer to Senator Murray for a second.  
Senator Murray, with Senator Cools' permission, you may ask a supplementary question.  
Those are invasions of privacy. 
Why can there not be some protection for Canadians?  
We could get into an interesting and extended discussion on this point. 
What is their reasonable expectation of privacy? 
These are not simple questions. 
Finding a legislative answer to them would be extraordinarily difficult.  
Let me cite one example of the kind of thing I am thinking about. 
I said, "I am about to write an obituary." 
I have tried to remember that. 
It is very difficult. 
The Princess Diana case is an interesting one from that perspective. 
We have to be a bit careful about this kind of thing. 
He has lost none of his persuasiveness. 
If he were ever to enter politics, he could be dangerous.  
My question will be fairly short but perhaps a bit off the wall. 
I can only answer the first question. 
Was the information absolutely necessary to properly administer the program in question? 
Could they do so just as well without that information? 
To what uses will the information be put? 
What security is attached thereto? 
Yes, there is a loss of privacy involved. 
Is it right or wrong? 
I cannot answer that question until I know more.  
You also understood that the profiles may change as our information changes. 
The way that I look at rights, we are constantly balancing one right against another.  
I want to go back to Senator Milne's discussion about the census. 
Let us say 100 years pass. 
In a democracy, we can learn from our history. 
You might wish to comment on that.  
Who knows where the breaking point should be?  
I think of the 1911 census, when so much information was taken. 
Now there is the issue of internment of certain immigrant classes. 
I think that is the safe way.  
That is what is proposed here. 
There are millions of people who have given up that information. 
Let me give you a parallel experience, although it is not a precise analogy. 
One can understand the anguish that lies behind some of those requests. 
They came to us and asked for our view. 
I know that hurt people. 
The answer in the overwhelming majority of cases was "no."  
There is a law to fortify it. 
There is a reason for that law. 
We must be careful before we monkey around with that. 
Senator, different people will think different things about these issues. 
It is a good debate.  
On behalf of the process, I will say that it is very exhaustive. 
I am saying they would do it under the legislation.  
My view of encryption at this stage of the game is as follows:
Electronic commerce will be greatly facilitated by the more widespread adoption of encryption. 
It is happening all over the place. 
Codes have been used in commercial and personal traffic for centuries. 
I think you should be sceptical of these arguments. 
You put your finger on the issue of how to control the information. 
We have had many complaints about these forms, senator. 
People were thinking that the questions put are altogether too nosy and intrusive.  
We have taken that issue up with the firearms people. 
You have to make what you will of that. 
There is no doubt that they are intrusive questions.  
I must tell you that we are not terribly happy. 
We have been looking at the forms. 
We raised a number of questions. 
I will not go into them in great detail here. 
They told us they would be put into the regulations. 
They told us they would be taken care of in the forms. 
We are not happy with this situation. 
Honourable senators, I have exhausted the list of questioners.  
Mr. Philips and Mr. Delisle, we offer you our thanks.  
Honourable senators, you have heard Senator Kinsella's proposal. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, the sitting of the Senate is resumed.  
Report of Committee of the Whole 
State of Financial System 
Consideration of Report of Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee on Study-Debate Adjourned 
I wholeheartedly endorse the committee's report. 
Let us begin by focussing on the ownership question. 
This recommendation, the Banking Committee felt, will achieve three goals. 
That is, they are recorded on a quarterly basis on the investor's financial statements. 
I now turn to the committee's recommendations on a more flexible organizational corporate structure.  
Our committee proposed a holding-company model.  
Finally, I will turn to the issue of capital gains. 
I will omit the reference to capital taxes. 
The MacKay task force did not address the capital gains issue. 
This committee means to correct this error.  
Hon. John B. Stewart :
Honourable senators, I should like to rise on a point of order. 
Is that the position in which we find ourselves?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
What is presently under discussion is a consideration of the report. 
At the moment, this is simply a debate on the report. 
I appreciate that, Your Honour. 
It is most helpful.  
On motion of Senator Oliver, for Senator Tkachuk, debate adjourned.  
Response of Government to Requests and Recommendations-Inquiry-Debate Adjourned 
Hon. Douglas Roche rose pursuant to notice of February 16, 1999: 
Honourable senators, there is plenty to worry about. 
The time for us to speak out against this retrograde and dangerous proposal is now.  
I shall briefly outline the facts. 
The ABM treaty is an essential part of nuclear arms control. 
Thus, the nuclear arms race would continue to accelerate.  
In 1996, the government added: 
...Canada remains firmly committed to the 1972 ABM treaty.  
Canada must speak now. 
We must realize what is happening. 
Is abrogating the ABM treaty justified by such an inordinate quest for power? 
The Canadian government has got to stop saying, "Don't worry; be happy." 
Significant progress in this respect has been made in recent years. 
This process is now jeopardized by BMD.  
Now is the time to debate this matter. 
Now is the time to inform the public. 
Now is the time to obtain the consent of the Canadian Parliament.  
The Canadian government knows there is little support for this system. 
On motion of Senator Prud'homme, debate adjourned.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is it agreed that I do not see the clock?  
Motion Condemning Article Concerning Minister of Canadian Heritage Adopted 
History, however, has silenced women. 
For centuries it is men who have governed. 
It is men who have spoken, written and communicated with each other. 
Today, as we approach the third millennium, we happily see a change. 
The Canadian Panel on Violence Against Women stated that: 
From that document I will conclude with a quote in which the author writes: 
Honourable senators, we are not unaware of these dynamics. 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
I first entered public life when I was a candidate in Alberta. 
Senator Taylor was then the leader back in 1975. 
Clearly, that is a comment on my voice. 
I guess I still have that bit of Maritime twang that goes along with it.  
What was wrong with me? 
I think that is the real tragedy. 
I accepted the challenge of public service because my father had been in public service. 
To me, that is a tragic set of affairs.  
Here we are some 15 years later and nothing has changed!  
I do think, however, that some things have changed for the better. 
I have to believe that. 
Senator Kinsella made reference to Agnes MacPhail. 
It will get even better. 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, I rise in support of this motion. 
I would like to thank Senator Kinsella for bringing it forward. 
Obviously, I will be voting for it.  
Hustler magazine's depiction of Sheila Copps is an offensive and vile piece of obscenity. 
Thus, it was a piece of vulgarity with a purpose. 
It is a proceeding of the Parliament of Canada that has been impeached and degraded.  
A degradation of Minister Copps is a degradation of all of us. 
It is a degradation of public service. 
It is an immorality against the Parliament of Canada and against public service.  
According to Hansard , the incident was on Wednesday, December 22, 1976. 
This is an issue I plan to revisit. 
I see it as even larger than the peculiar historical aspects that have been raised. 
There is a new language developing in this country. 
I have never thought of myself as a Conservative. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
I knew her in Alberta and then in Manitoba.  
It is a long story between Senator Carstairs and me. 
That goes back a long time.  
I want to join in what Senator Cools has also said. 
I share her words about Minister Copps.  
I have had a long association with Minister Copps. 
Of course, I said, "Sheila, I will have fun. 
I am not running against you. 
It was quite a fight because she is a fighter. 
I do not have to explain the outcome today.  
We gave Sheila Copps 14 votes on the first ballot. 
I want to say that publicly.  
Politics has always been very important in my family. 
I can relate to what Senator Carstairs said. 
Can you not talk to her? 
She is going against your decision?" 
It is not necessary to expand on that tonight. 
Senator Carstairs said herself that there are now 31 women in the Senate. 
I have to ask myself that question.  
Change will take place.  
That is still not enough. 
There are now 31.  
We should continue to fight. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
If no other honourable senator wishes to speak, I will proceed with the motion.  
It was moved by the Honourable Senator Kinsella, seconded by the Honourable Senator DeWare: 
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Leave having been given to revert to Government Notices of Motions: 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, March 2, 1999, at 2 p.m.
