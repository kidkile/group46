The Senate met at 1:30 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
I thank them each individually and as a composite group.  
Hon. Duncan J. Jessiman :
Honourable senators, Senator Carstairs has stolen my thunder somewhat.  
I talked with Senator Phillips about an hour ago. 
The Honourable Senator Phillips, of course, as the chairman, did a marvellous job. 
Senator Cools, the deputy chair, did an equally good job. 
The other members of the committee were Senator Chalifoux, Senator Forest and myself. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
He did not miss one meeting. 
We heard 50 witnesses in one week, a week that the Senate was not sitting. 
Esteemed colleagues, the Senate has a role to play in this country. 
The Holocaust Gallery can stand on its two feet somewhere else, as everyone now agrees. 
I, too, wish Senator Phillips a speedy recovery. 
We will wait for him to write the final report. 
Congratulations to Gold Medal Winning Bobsled Team at Nagano, Japan 
Honourable senators, I rise in this chamber today to pay tribute to Dave `Eli' MacEachern. 
Dave, you are a role model and a true champion. 
Asian Community in British Columbia 
Congratulations on Twenty-Fifth Anniversary of United Chinese Community Enrichment Services Society 
SUCCESS was incorporated in 1973. 
Regrettably, no Reform MP attended. 
It involved an extravaganza, with a crew of 60 top artists and stage - 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted to continue, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Before I introduce him, I must give you the background of the situation.  
Canadian Wheat Board Act 
Bill to Amend-First Reading 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Prime Minister's Office 
Appointment of Ethics Counsellor Responsible to Parliament-Government Position 
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
The chapter was entitled, "Governing with Integrity." 
The language was very clear: 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Mr. Wilson had been appointed to make such an examination. 
I have two supplementary questions. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, that is a very valid question. 
We look forward to seeing that item included.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Duncan J. Jessiman :
Honourable senators, my question is to the Leader of the Government.  
Health care is a priority for this government."  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
This amount is consistent with the recommendations of the National Forum on Health.  
A stable, predictable funding plan will result.  
Availability of Retraining for Unemployed-Incentives Available through Revenue Canada-Government Position 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Certainly, the Canadian people have said so very strongly. 
Will the government undertake to ensure that this situation is corrected immediately? 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Norman K. Atkins :
Honourable senators, my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
That is a commitment. 
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I would be very happy to do so.

The Standing Senate Committee on Aboriginal peoples has the honour to present its 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Teleglobe Canada Reorganization and Divestiture Act 
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. William M. Kelly :
Our group was given two tasks:
As you know, Teleglobe was, in fact, privatized in 1987.  
Rates have fallen and services have expanded. 
This has been to the substantial benefit of business and individual consumers. 
No results of that review have ever been released. 
Let me turn now to Teleglobe. 
I will return to that decision in just a moment.  
Teleglobe itself does ISH. 
I believe they should learn to compete in Canada first. 
Once again, a little history is required. 
I suggest that Bill C-17 be looked at in that light. 
Will Bill C-17 lead to liberalization, competition and choice? 
It is to be hoped that we will be able to find some answers.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition :
What does "hubbing" mean?  
I guess our own government made the same mistake. 
Yes, it should overtake this proposal.  
On motion of Senator Kinsella, for Senator Oliver, debate adjourned.  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading 
Hon. Eric Arthur Berntson :
They cannot make arrests without warrants. 
As the situation exists today, that is not possible.  
Let us take a look at the magnitude of that problem. 
That is not to say that we are completely happy. 
It is a good step forward.  
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. The Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Concerns of Albertans-Inquiry-Debate Adjourned 
Hon. Ron Ghitter rose pursuant to notice of February 10, 1998: 
Our politicians are the favoured targets. 
It is a serious and an important issue, one that demands reflection, debate and action.  
Would it be appropriate, in Canada's best interests, to abolish the Senate? 
As an Albertan, I contend that the answer is clearly no. 
So where have we gone wrong?  
I do not share that optimistic and positive view. 
There is a sadness about the statements that I have just made. 
Honourable senators, it is, in my view, time for a reality check. 
It is time to be the agents of change. 
I want to hear from you. 
However, in my few years in this chamber I have not heard this topic debated. 
It is time to do so. 
It is too important an issue to overlook. 
The impetus must come from within. 
If we are truly representative of our regions, why are we here representing political parties? 
Why are we here thinking like politicians? 
We are not supposed to be politicians. 
I suspect that may be true as well. 
Political movements often use the Senate as their hot button political theme of the day. 
What can we do? 
Second, I would recommend equal regional representation by province or the five regions of Canada. 
The status quo is nearing an end. 
Canadians will not tolerate it much longer. 
The warning signs are everywhere for us to see. 
It's the old story of lead or be lead.  
In that, I readily concur.  
Senators, I look forward to your contribution to the inquiry.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, the 15-minute speaking period for Honourable Senator Ghitter has concluded. 
Is leave granted to extend his time?  
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Honourable senators, I have a question for Honourable Senator Ghitter:
We must look at the relevance of that item. 
I am not sure why we do it any more. 
That is not why we are here.  
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
I doubt if that view would be shared in the country at this time. 
It is certainly not shared by the majority of us on this side. 
I do not believe that.  
I find it difficult to accept the thrust of Senator Ghitter's argument. 
I do not find that. 
As late as yesterday I gave views which were different from that of the government.  
I hear it all the time. 
With respect to conflict, it never entered my mind that there is a conflict. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
We had good suggestions for the Senate. 
Therefore, it is neither 10 years nor nine years. 
I am glad that you say we should perhaps sit by regions. 
You mentioned five regions. 
For me, B.C. should be a region. 
You will have to help me out in my reflection on that. 
There would be, let us say, 100 senators.  
I love logic, a compulsory subject during my classical studies. 
Abandon the right to veto what? 
Legislation originating from the House, there I would be in agreement. 
But who would introduce legislation in the House? 
Senator Nolin has raised this point.  
What do you think an elected senator from Ontario would say? 
Well, I made a study. 
An elected Senate would cost between $160 million and $200 million. 
If you say, "Abolish it," that would be the simplest reform. 
I would like you to reflect and give me your views. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Again, there is nothing new under the sun. 
I hope we will have that discussion here and come to a consensus.  
Honourable senators, I want to make sure that I understood the honourable senator correctly. 
On motion of Senator Gigantes, debate adjourned.  
Lack of Accessibility for Disabled to Facilities-Inquiry-Debate Adjourned 
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson rose pursuant to notice of February 12, 1998: 
I am not sure how to approach this topic again. 
It is in this context that I wish to speak with you today.  
Hon. John B. Stewart :
Honourable senators, I rise on a point of order. 
Has that rule been set aside?  
That was never a rule.  
Has that understanding been set aside?  
It used to be a rule when we were on your side.  
You are quite correct.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
We have an Order Paper. 
We are very close to the end of that Order Paper. 
We will be out of here, I would suggest, in about ten minutes. 
As far as the point of order is concerned, the Senate is in session. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I have no authority to stop the debate. 
Please continue, Senator Robertson.  
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson :
To set the scene, let me pose a simple question:
What do Monet, Milton, Beethoven and Roosevelt have in common? 
Let me quote from a report entitled "Access Today."  
I believe Parliament is all of this, and then some. 
Barriers to accessibility take many forms. 
We have noticed the difficulties in this respect experienced by one of our colleagues. 
It is a great effort for him to get into this chamber. 
I think, honourable senators, the answer is obvious.  
The reality, it seems it me, is that the timing is perfect. 
It is an initiative that is timely, relevant and affordable.  
I discussed my concerns with the new chair of the committee.  
The process involves three simple steps.  
In other words, take an inventory.  
There are many disabled people out there, just waiting to be asked.  
At the beginning of my remarks, I noted the achievements of President Roosevelt. 
On motion of Senator Carstairs, debate adjourned.  
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
