BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma-Manitoulin, Lib.):
I look forward to reading his observations when he returns.  
Mrs. Claudette Bradshaw (Moncton-Riverview-Dieppe, Lib.):
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Remembrance Day is a time for reflection.  
One such story dealt with the D-Day landings in 1944. 
Remembrance Day is a day that does not glorify war. 
If we do, we will have remembered.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
I would think not. 
The Liberals have got it wrong again.  
FIFTEENTH ANNIVERSARY OF LA SOUPIERE IN ANJOU 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
Imagine how many meals and volunteer hours that adds up to over its 15 years.  
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
CORRECTIONS AND CONDITIONAL RELEASE ACT 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
This move was of great concern to Violet Cooke and her family. 
On Monday, November 9 this convicted murderer will be granted a second ETA. 
ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN QUEBEC 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Quebeckers are facing a bleak reality. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, on Remembrance Day we think of our veterans from past wars. 
Here today we have five soldiers who served in the former Yugoslavia. 
All were injured in separate actions.  
Sitting today in the opposition gallery we have these soldiers. 
They and their comrades deserve our thanks and our respect.  
ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN QUEBEC 
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, farmers and their families are in crisis. 
For many reasons beyond their control. 
Fertilizer costs are up 57%. 
Today the ministers of agriculture are meeting to discuss this crisis.  
When the ice storm happened, emergency aid was provided. 
When the Manitoba flood occurred, emergency aid was provided.  
Farming is in crisis. 
Now is the time to provide our farm families with emergency aid.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
All summer long the federalists 
But now that an election looms, 
We're seeing quite a swivel.  
They hang their heads in sad regret, 
Of arguments they have not one 
To change the way we think.  
What shall we do, they moan and groan, 
Please tell us how to play.  
For that is not our way, 
We must know how you get your kicks, 
What do you do for fun?  
A poll will have the answer, right?  
We'll find out in the Sun .  
The sovereignists want out, it's clear 
Their secrets we must know.  
What turns their cranks, what makes their day 
What keeps them grinning so? 
And thirty years of work 
So take a hike, you jerk.  
EXHIBITION OF MILITARY ART 
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
It looked extremely rocky for the Liberals that day 
Their game plan had been tossed out in a prime ministerial way 
Perhaps it would be turned around, with JC at the bat 
The crowd was getting restless, discontent was in the air 
So on that stricken multitude a death-like silence sat 
For JC mighty JC was advancing to the bat 
Canadians were shivering as he taxed away their shirts 
And crouched dumbfounded as he rubbed their noses in the dirt 
Then when a poor Canadian lobbed one from the hip 
``Resign, please resign'', we heard someone from the back 
And JC would have throttled him, but the Whip stopped the attack 
He couldn't really care less where Canadians were at 
Though all the things that worried them were there for JC's bat 
Oh somewhere in this favoured world the sun is shining bright 
The band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light 
And somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout 
I hope that Jean Charest is listening.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Lewis also claims his daughter was approached for the same reason.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
They could find no corroboration for the allegations that were made.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, Canadians have strong feelings on this issue. 
Our passports are well respected around the world.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Last February, March and April it was investigated by several agencies. 
They could not provide any supporting evidence.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the operative word is allegations. 
There were no grounds to them.  
Therefore we have continued to monitor them. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
I would ask the hon. member to address the Chair.  
Mr. Speaker, CTV also stands behind its story. 
What Canadians want to know is whom should they believe. 
The hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
He did not check it out. 
We made sure that he was fully informed of what went on. 
The point of the matter is CTV said allegations were made. 
We checked out those allegations to the best information we could ascertain. 
He is now clearly going public.  
The hon. member for Red Deer.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
We also are against terrorism but not with the Canadian passport. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
We checked them out to the best of our ability. 
We could not find any corroborating evidence to support the allegations that were made.  
That is as much as we have been able to know.  
We are presently bringing in a new system. 
I believe it is the most secure passport in the world.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Out of sight, out of mind.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
This is not new, this is how it has always been done.  
I am sorry to interrupt the Right Hon. Prime Minister. 
The leader of the Bloc Quebecois.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
That is the reality.  
This is why the Prime Minister is at a crossroads. 
What will he do?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
If he checked the reports, he would find the same figure.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I think that all members- 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
Still, I am not treated any differently from the leader of the Bloc Quebecois.  
Why is the hon. member engaging in demagoguery when he is in the same boat? 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I welcome the great opportunity the hon. member is giving me.  
There have been four consecutive reductions in employee premiums.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
The best way to protect Canada is to reinvest now in the health sector. 
Canadians across the country are saying it. 
All the premiers are saying it. 
But the federal government does not listen.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
What is the government waiting for?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
She is a bit late.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, enough rhetoric from the minister. 
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
We refuse to follow these irresponsible policies. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
That is where it can find some savings.  
The government will do anything to stay in power. 
Yet the government raises payroll taxes. 
Now he is setting out to raid it.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
We will pay down the debt and we will invest in health care.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
That is what we want.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
That is what we want to do.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We will do it in collaboration with the provinces.  
I have asked our standing committee of the House to look into it. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
About one million deceased Canadians still have active social insurance numbers. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
My department has set up five working groups to fix the problem. 
We want to improve the security features of the cards.  
These are things already underway.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Now that is centralization.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, that has nothing to do with this.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
This government broke the deal and is not looking after him.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the problem of that individual was brought to our attention. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, a deal is a deal. 
Matt Stopford is sitting in the House right now. 
He is listening to and watching this defence minister. 
He represents over 1,000 soldiers who have been injured by the same radiation exposure.  
I urge the defence minister to be cautious in his reply. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
We provided that to the Standing Committee on National Defence. 
We are trying to deal with the matter properly.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, our government has a very clear answer. 
No decision has been taken. 
That strikes me as a perfectly and absolutely clear answer.  
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we welcome the woodlot owners' request.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Is this the answer to the farm income crisis? 
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
The hon. member should address his questions through the Speaker. 
Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the minister of agriculture said no such thing yesterday. 
The questioner is way out of line with his question.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's question is disgraceful.  
The hon. Minister of Justice.  
They are taking place and moving forward as any other prosecution would. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
I have asked our officials to look into it. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have with me a copy of the Bank Act. 
It is 75 cents a pop. 
There is a service charge.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Having said that, we have asked our officials to look into it. 
I look forward to the members' suggestions.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
The question as worded is hypothetical. 
I would ask the hon. member to quickly rephrase it.  
Mr. Speaker, I do hope that Mr. Ibrahim's liberation will not be hypothetical.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I intend to raise the issue. 
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
In November Canada will be attending an APEC meeting in Malaysia. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We did it last year in Canada. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, Louise Richard served in the military in the gulf war. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, all of these cases have been examined very thoroughly. 
We will continue to do that.  
CANADA MORTGAGE AND HOUSING CORPORATION 
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
And with modern technology- 
I am sorry to interrupt the minister. 
The hon. member for Halifax West has the floor.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, our troops face wretched decaying conditions.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Co-operation.  
Mrs. Claudette Bradshaw (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Cooperation, Lib.):
In my zeal to be overly funny, as I sometimes do, I made a mistake.  
I apologize to you, my colleagues, for having done that. 
It will not be done again.  
MEMBER FOR MISSISSAUGA CENTRE 
Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this seems to be a day for apologies.  
I consider this matter closed.

Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Gar Knutson (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. Gar Knutson (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
I declare the motion carried.  
When shall the bill be read the third time? 
Many of the proposed amendments to the law come out of this process. 
A number of amendments are a direct product of provincial requests. 
This is not the case with deceptive telemarketing. 
They involve the use of telephone boiler rooms to contact large numbers of victims. 
The offence of fraud already falls within the proceeds of crime scheme. 
Fairly quick action was needed on this issue before a significant number of cases arose.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
I would ask for that unanimous consent.  
The Reform Party has raised a lot of concerns. 
Let me say a few words about the subject of conditional release. 
That is what the Reform Party tried to do in committee. 
We believe, as do many Canadians, that the issue is very simple. 
Conditional sentencing should not be used in the case of a violent offence. 
Yet it is happening more and more.  
Is there no sense of compassion with this government or just plain common sense?  
It is unfortunate that this government is just not listening.  
That is why the judge said it undermined respect for the law. 
That is what we tried to get this minister to do at committee. 
That is a shocking thing.  
This party is concerned about victims. 
This bill does very little for victims.  
There must be a message sent to organized crime. 
Why does the government continue to deal with them as if they are petty criminals?  
Think about people who are involved in organized crime. 
Crime is their business.  
Bill C-51 deals with the issue of child prostitution. 
It is very much a minimum.  
Just about every member in this House has children. 
In this bill we tried to make some changes. 
We could not get the amendments before the committee. 
There cannot be any early parole to return these people to the streets. 
That is not radical. 
That is what the average Canadian thinks.  
It is becoming a bigger and bigger issue in our country. 
I know that in Vancouver and Toronto drugs are a very serious problem. 
It is a shock to many parents. 
Society abhors their behaviour. 
We have to start somewhere.  
Give on one hand; take away with the other. 
We will have to take the minister at her word. 
The sooner the minister gets it there the sooner it will be dealt with.  
This is a serious problem in our country. 
We ask the government to seriously think about what it is doing in these areas.  
We are going to vote against this bill on those three issues. 
This is serious legislation. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Bill C-51 was an ideal opportunity to do just that. 
The opportunity existed and, once again, the government let it slip through its fingers.  
These are some examples of resources not being available to fit the demand. 
Criminals have been sentenced but are not doing any time. 
The RCMP had to close down its training facility. 
The public is not served well by this.  
For every dollar that is invested there is a $7 saving.  
We can no longer afford to give mere lip service to this issue. 
We could take the best of the three programs. 
Then we could bring together the medical community. 
All women have to go through the medical system before they give birth. 
We could use the nurses and the physicians to identify families at risk. 
This irreversibly damages a person's brain. 
It impairs their ability to act in an integrated way with society. 
It is preventable, but we have to start at time zero. 
Head start provides that.  
It is an extremely important way in which a community could build ties. 
They could use this pool of experienced individuals to support people who need help.  
What was the outcome of the Hawaii program? 
The emphasis is on working with parents. 
The Moncton program started with children early on. 
The outcome was extraordinary. 
It has been shown that there was roughly a $30,000 saving for every child. 
The amount we spend on crime prevention is approximately $15 million. 
They could take poorly used resources and put them into something that works. 
The stats are there. 
The facts are there. 
The government needs to show the leadership to do this.  
She can do it.  
I will deal with some issues that have not perhaps been dealt with. 
We are talking about drugs. 
Again, this bill could have dealt with the issue of drugs. 
Children are taking drugs.  
We can look at existing programs that have worked. 
Let us look at the Geneva experiment. 
The Geneva experiment basically legalized drugs. 
The outcome has been remarkable.  
We know what we are doing now does not work.  
We need to look at projects that have worked. 
We also want to address the issue of child prostitution. 
This is not child prostitution. 
This is rape and pedophelia, pure and simple.  
Yet the victims are left dangling in the breeze to fend for themselves. 
There is much that can be done within our justice system. 
There is little that has been done with respect to Bill C-51. 
We in the House have a responsibility to the people who elected us. 
Then we can see whether they will work.  
We must have the courage to act. 
This is not rocket science. 
We can do it. 
We can improve the justice system. 
Above all, we can adopt programs to prevent crime.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I seek unanimous consent for me to ask a short question of the member.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
I am pleased to again speak to Bill C-51. 
Too often, committees fall victim to obstruction by the party in power. 
The Liberal MPs must not have any illusions, however. 
As I have said, committee work is too often obstructed. 
Consensus in committee is a rarity.  
One has to be determined.  
The cruise industry represents several million dollars to our region. 
In fact, on average, tourists each spend about $110 per visit. 
It had no choice but to act or look like it was dragging its heels.  
The Liberal government cannot be pushed. 
It prefers a step by step approach. 
Despite this strange situation, the Bloc Quebecois has not given up. 
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
The bill affects not just the Criminal Code but other statutes as well. 
It is a fairly large omnibus bill. 
Yesterday this bill was not on the Order Paper but it is today. 
I do not know.  
I will move on to talk about some of the aspects of the bill. 
There is no conspiracy, Peter.  
I am told there is no conspiracy. 
There are some other good things. 
Money laundering is a serious problem. 
It is not something that makes Canadians proud. 
I do not know why the government would not accept it. 
It is something that could go some way toward stopping money laundering. 
Unfortunately the government has not accepted it. 
It could have improved the legislation somewhat if it had done so. 
It ought not to be abused. 
That is a progressive move by the government.  
There is, however, the downside of the bill. 
There are some things in this omnibus legislation that cause me concern. 
It is one in which we have to find a balance. 
They cause me particular concern. 
I have real concerns about the cruise ship provisions. 
Many of those businesses have lost their revenue to the casino. 
The casino has hired many people. 
Some of those who were displaced in one section have found jobs in the other.  
This will have a direct impact on the community I represent. 
We have managed to attract a large cruise ship industry. 
It has done some economic good. 
However there is only so much money to go around.  
We know gambling can be an addictive form of behaviour. 
Those sections cause me concern. 
It would have been nobler, perhaps, had she separated those issues.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
However I will take a stab at a few aspects of the legislation.  
This raises a bigger issue, the whole idea of having automatic parole. 
It is crazy and unbelievable.  
They are out after two-thirds. 
It is really not life. 
Prisoners could be out in 15 years.  
When we look throughout the criminal justice system we run into this. 
It is time we revised all of that. 
That makes sense to me.  
It is time for a fundamental change to the criminal justice system. 
It is a tiny step in fixing the overall problem.  
I want to focus on the issue of conditional sentencing. 
The woman was eventually found out and she was convicted. 
The person was convicted.  
The person found guilty of this crime received a conditional sentence. 
Her name is Ms. McKennit. 
Ms. McKennit received a conditional sentence. 
Tens of thousands of dollars were taken from the Vickers. 
There is a problem with that. 
But there is no way to supervise that.  
We have seen this situation before. 
It is toothless and completely useless.  
A real tough penalty. 
Yet the government allows these people to be sentenced under conditional sentencing provisions.  
They do not serve one day in jail. 
How can that be just? 
I would argue that it is completely wrong-headed. 
That is not a sentence. 
The only sentence that is being meted out there is to the victim.  
A young woman was brutally raped. 
There was no one to supervise him. 
There is another situation in my riding. 
She is living in absolute fear. 
I have sent the file over to the justice minister. 
I have not heard anything. 
That is so crazy. 
It is so wrong-headed. 
It is contrary to everything that Canadians believe in and the government does nothing. 
I do not understand. 
I do not see it.  
That is common sense.  
The government does not understand the sense in that. 
It is unbelievable it allows that to continue.  
Of course we already have had a handgun registry for a long time. 
This legislation will cost somewhere in the range of $140 million or $160 million. 
In B.C. the government is withdrawing funding for the RCMP. 
We could have RCMP on the beat around the clock. 
There is a huge drug problem on the east side of Vancouver today. 
There is a real misallocation of resources.  
It is five years since we came to this place. 
We have made it an issue weekly. 
This is not the Reform Party's wonderful idea. 
That makes sense to me. 
That is a common sense proposal. 
I know my Liberal colleagues across the way have heard it.  
I suggest that this government has its priorities standing on their head. 
That is completely missing in this legislation.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I address my question to my colleague from Medicine Hat.  
Mr. Speaker, I absolutely agree with my colleague from Souris-Moose Mountain.  
We talked about the Young Offenders Act and about the problem of crime.  
We know that amongst young people crime is escalating. 
Some of the crime is extraordinarily violent. 
That is an area that the government must address.  
Unfailing they say they are too soft. 
The government must start to take this issue more seriously. 
The minister has said for 18 months that this is her highest priority. 
She has done nothing. 
She has let the people down in her riding of Edmonton. 
Today many people are being needlessly hurt and in some cases killed. 
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
There is every indication from those statistics that in this country homicide rates are down. 
I would like to have the member's thoughts on that.  
We read the headlines. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his comments.  
First of all, he mentioned that homicide rates are down. 
I believe that is a fact and it is important to note that.  
We need to continue to discuss it.  
The member asks whether or not I was in the courtrooms. 
It is a good question. 
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I listened to the hon. member with great interest. 
With their conservative attitude, Reformers are the ones who never show any compassion.  
I think that education should prevail. 
I realize that, low as it may be, it will always be too high. 
This is what worries me about the Reform Party's position. 
Being a criminal is nothing to be proud of, that is right. 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has raised a couple of good points. 
I also take issue with some of the things that my colleague has stated. 
That does not mean that we do not believe there should be rehabilitation. 
Of course there should be. 
But the primary purpose of the justice system should be to protect the public.  
That is the Reform Party position. 
I am sorry if I did not make that very clear to my colleague.  
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
It makes all kinds of sense, given our present state.  
Apparently this has been a request put forward by both Ontario and Quebec. 
This translates into approximately 5% of all of the revenues of the government.  
In a perverse way, governments become the handmaidens in the addictions of their citizens.  
I would argue that there is a parallel being developed here. 
This is in my view a rank form of hypocrisy and bad public policy.  
The concept was relatively simple. 
We lent money to micro enterprises in third worlds. 
We lent money to people who had no security. 
We lent money to the people who were the poorest of the poor. 
It was a very successful formula and widely acknowledged as a good use of resources.  
It seemed to us that we were being hypocritical. 
We felt we were being hypocrites.  
Frequently the picture of a business generally on a balance sheet is quite limited. 
One has assets, one has liabilities, one has income and one has expenses. 
I suggest that the analogy is appropriate here. 
There is more to the bottom line than what appears on the balance sheet. 
It hits society's bottom line but it does not hit governments' bottom line.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to pay tribute to the member. 
He has spoken very well. 
He has spoken to the point that Canadians very often would like an answer. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his good question. 
It is not something to which I have an immediate answer. 
I do not have that answer.  
The environmental movement has recognized this. 
A Harvard professor has recognized that damage to the environment can be quantified. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to the speech of the hon. member. 
It had precious little to do with Bill C-51. 
In particular he did not address the two issues I raised. 
He did not address some of the more profound social issues.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP) moved: 
We all pay tax on our earnings. 
Workers with this benefit save approximately $1,722 annually. 
Obviously it was a significant change in emphasis.  
Why should the government be interested in promoting public transit? 
No Canadians have been able to escape the consequences of global warming. 
Our first eight months have been the hottest in 600 years. 
Canadians are quickly realizing the seriousness of the challenge before them. 
You recognize it by the brown haze of smog.  
Therein is a very telling tale. 
For each death 100 more received expensive medical treatment. 
If nothing else, these statistics speak for themselves. 
Hundreds of millions of dollars can be saved by reducing smog. 
Can we afford the revenue loss? 
This would result in a new tax revenue. 
A net gain is expected with higher modal shifts to transit. 
There is only one taxpayer. 
We cannot afford any further inaction in this sector.  
Would this create inequities within the tax system? 
Some equity concerns provide a convenient although rather ludicrous argument in my judgment. 
Tax losses from this benefit are estimated at $260 million.  
Very few tax policies impact so favourably on so many Canadians.  
We increase taxes on alcohol and cigarette use. 
Most provincial subsidies have been slashed. 
The finance department is concerned that promotion of this initiative would be precedent setting. 
This is a win-win situation. 
Implementation requires only a policy change from the federal government. 
It is the responsibility of individual transit properties to successfully market this service. 
It is an environmental issue. 
It has proven to be effective in other jurisdictions.  
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
In my many years in municipal politics I supported this position. 
This proposal would assist in our Kyoto commitments. 
We would save billions of dollars in road construction costs as well.  
It would relieve traffic congestion, thereby reducing transportation costs. 
It would enhances economic efficiency. 
Current taxation policies favour the automobile over public transit. 
Transit benefits can take various forms. 
I believe this proposal clearly has merit. 
This proposal, as the hon. member indicated, should be considered. 
In conclusion, federal income tax exemptions have a significant leverage effect. 
We need to look at this and we need to take action. 
I hope the House will consider the motion and support it.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
It is encouraging to see that pattern broken this evening.  
My principal concern is that tax policy should be neutral. 
I have a deep theoretical reservation to supporting initiatives of this nature. 
It would not create a government incentive for social engineering.  
I am also concerned with the cost issue. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
I would like to suggest why this piece of legislation has been brought forward.  
This initiative is a step in the right direction.  
I applaud the New Democrats for doing that. 
All individuals in this country are overtaxed. 
I want to address an issue that was addressed by my colleague from Calgary Southeast. 
The member said that it would be good for the environment. 
The member for Calgary Southwest denied there was a problem with respect to climate change. 
But there are some fundamental issues that differentiate the Reform Party and the PC Party. 
Local transportation is a significant component of that figure.  
Why would we not want to go forward with this? 
Canadians in general are overtaxed. 
I challenge the government to adopt this motion. 
There are many solutions out there. 
Public transportation would head us in that direction.  
I would also indicate that many communities would have to do that.  
I do not blame it on these individuals. 
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
This is a bit of a peephole reaction to creating tax legislation. 
One is forever looking through a narrow glass and not necessarily getting the entire picture. 
I offer this as more of a response than a criticism. 
It does not do anything for these folks. 
Municipal, federal and provincial governments already give substantial subsidies to transit.  
The only clear evidence at this point is that tax revenues will be reduced. 
I do not find this argument to be a persuasive one.  
The linkage is not necessarily demonstrable. 
The linkage again is not clear in my mind. 
Those are the criticisms I have of the motion. 
Again I laud the hon. member for his initiative. 
It was not one that readily yielded criticism. 
I offer my observations to him in the form of encouragement to a fellow parliamentarian.  
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
My hon. colleague mentioned a statistic from San Francisco as an example. 
Other members mentioned inequality. 
This incentive is a challenge for this government to consider. 
We have to correct our ways. 
These people are continuing to discuss but there is no action plan.  
It would be a major incentive for employees to consider. 
It reverses the whole process and our commitments.  
I ask all members to consider this motion and vote in favour of it. 
The finance committee would then seriously have to look at the impact of this.  
A lot of these employees travel from suburban areas. 
Major cities have lent their support to this issue.  
I beg all members to seriously consider this. 
Vote in favour of the motion. 
I must highlight some statistics. 
Those are the statistics we can come up with.  
In the new millennium- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Is there unanimous consent?
