Motion to Establish Day of Recognition 
Thursday, April 22, 1999 
The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
There will be events in cities, towns and villages throughout the country. 
Writers and performers will be out in force, reading and signing, singing and acting. 
This year the slogan is "make a date with a good book." 
I hope you enjoy it, Senator Lynch-Staunton. 
It is a pleasure to keep up the tradition.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Unfortunately, the bill is still before us. 
It is biography, fortunately authorized, of Elsie Wayne. 
The unauthorized one is unlikely to pass muster.  
I hope Senator Fairbairn will enjoy both books.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland 
Reform of House of Lords 
Honourable senators, I like the mood in the chamber at this moment. 
We can leave that debate to others. 
One Puritan member wrote: 
The Peers were the sons of conquest and usurpation. 
They were not made by the people.  
- or what we today might call executive power - 
The proposer of the bill stated: 
The House of Lords was useless and dangerous and should be abolished.  
The Peers were not consulted. 
However, the debate never ceased. 
A pamphlet in 1655 argued: 
The Lords were the guarantors of law and liberty.  
Another part of the pamphlet said: 
In 1657, Cromwell told the Puritan Army leaders: 
You are offended at a House of Lords. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I regret to interrupt but the honourable senator's three-minute time period has expired.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
The Commons rejected Cromwell's appeal. 
The review of legislation and delegated powers. 
2. Scrutiny of the use of executive power by the Cabinet. 
4. Major public appointments. 
5. Whether organized religion should be represented. 
6. Whether partly elected and partly appointed. 
7. Greater independence from political party discipline. 
8. More representative of society as a whole. 
9. The size of the House of Lords, salaries and access to resources.  
Certainly the two systems seem to be on a convergent path.  
British Columbia Coastal Parliamentarians Group 
The fishery is at an all-time low with regard to employment. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted for the honourable senator to continue?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, the15 minutes allotted for Senators' Statements has expired. 
I have two honourable senators who wish to make statements. 
Is it your wish, honourable senators, that they be allowed to make their statements?  
That is the problem when we do not follow the rules.  
Look who's talking!  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted to extend the time for Senators' Statements?  
Genocide of Armenian People 
Commemoration of Eighty-Fourth Anniversary 
Honourable senators, this year will mark the eighty-fourth anniversary of the Armenian genocide. 
I would like to express my deepest sympathy and support to the Armenian people.  
Some have tried to minimize the importance of the atrocities that were committed back then. 
On April 25, 1993, the Right Honourable Jean Chretien said: 
As Canadians, we all have much to be thankful for. 
Honourable senators, a number of parliaments around the world have formally recognized the Armenian genocide. 
The Late Wallace Pike 
One of his 50 grandchildren declared after his death on Sunday: 
We lost two great ones this week. 
Indeed, Wallace Pike was a hero. 
He lied about his age in order to enlist in the Royal Newfoundland Regiment. 
He was to write later: 
It was real dark. 
The only company I had were the groans of a wounded comrade.  
We have lost not just a hero; we have lost a part of history. 
Jack Granatstein has asked, "Who killed Canadian history?" 
Like my generation, Wallace Pike was not born a Canadian. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
We welcome you to the Senate of Canada.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
There is no mention, however, of support elements. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The information that he received at that time was incorrect.  
I would be careful with that.  
I stand by what I said in that respect.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, in fact, we do not have 800. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Conflict in Former Yugoslavia-Efforts by Government to End War 
Honourable senators, my question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
The Canadian government says it is talking, consulting, and thinking. 
Meanwhile, countless people are dying.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
To suggest that Canada is acting in a role of nodding assent is unfair. 
Honourable senators, I asked what the Canadian government is actually doing.  
Is not that enough evidence? 
How much more do we need?  
Hon. Alasdair B. Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Our first concern must be for the fate of displaced people in Kosovo. 
Bring the UN in!  
However, we had to do something.  
Senator Roche continues to refer to the Security Council of the United Nations. 
Honourable senators, this is serious business. 
We are acting in a manner that we think is most responsible. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
The headline is: "Must prepare for troops, Blair says." 
Therefore, we know where Great Britain stands on this. 
In his answer to the question, the Prime Minister said: 
Can we get these people back to the table? 
Can we get involved in some sort of mechanism to at least create a lull? 
Is there not an alternative? 
Where is Canada's role in this matter? 
That is not leadership.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, there are 19 members of the NATO alliance.  
We are partners of that NATO alliance.  
Honourable senators, our policy on Kosovo has been clear from the outset. 
Our goal remains the safe return of the Kosovars to Kosovo.  
What is our position?  
Where is Prime Minister Chretien during the current crisis? 
Waiting to be told what to do.  
What about a vote?  
Hopefully, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of National Defence will appear. 
If we got an answer, there would be no debate.  
North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Honourable senators I have a supplementary question. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, yes, we do have a position:
It is no first use. 
That subject would be a new element to the discussions. 
I know that nuclear disarmament will be discussed at NATO. 
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Canadian forces personnel appeared to question that they were even Canadian aircraft. 
The media at the briefing were justifiably mystified. 
We are looking more foolish as each day passes. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
What else is he going to say?  
Senator Lynch-Staunton is mumbling here.  
So what does Mr. Chretien think?  
He is saying "So? 
Canada-United States Relations 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
The list would be developed during parliamentary hearings.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The Canadian government is concerned about the U.S. announcement that was referred to yesterday. 
Those pieces of equipment ended up in Iran. 
We have evidence of that. 
What are the measures that he has taken?  
Honourable senators, I am not aware of any specific measures. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
They have come all this way to see the Senate in action. 
They are led by their teacher, Mr. George Lougheed.  
On behalf of all senators, I bid you welcome to the Senate of Canada.  
Canada Customs and Revenue Agency Bill 
Third Reading-Motion in Amendment-Vote Deferred 
Ministers come and ministers go, as do their deputies. 
First, the minister told us that he would continue to be accountable. 
We will not be the only ones watching. 
We do not believe that we can accept the word of the minister. 
We must monitor what happens as time goes on.  
Yesterday we moved an amendment on the merit principle. 
There is currently no protection for them in that regard. 
Honourable senators, I therefore move: 
( a ) by replacing line 10 with the following: 
The Agency must develop a program"; and 
( b ) by deleting lines 13 and 14.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion in amendment?  
I move the adjournment of the debate.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those opposed to the motion for adjournment please say "nay"?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
In my opinion the "nays" have it.  
The question before the Senate is the motion in amendment. 
It was moved by the Honourable Senator Stratton, seconded by the Honourable Senator Cohen: 
( a ) by replacing line 10 with the following: 
The Agency must develop a program"; and 
( b ) by deleting lines 13 and 14.  
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion in amendment?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those opposed to the motion in amendment please say "nay"?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
In my opinion, the "nays" have it.  
And two honourable senators having risen.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Third Reading-Motions in Amendment-Debate Continued 
( a ) by replacing lines 28 and 29 on page 17 with the following: 
( c ) the request for extradition is made for"; and 
2. in Clause 2 and new Part 3: 
( a ) by substituting the term "general extradition agreement" for "extradition agreement" wherever it appears; 
( b ) by substituting the term "specific extradition agreement" for "specific agreement" wherever it appears; 
( c ) in clause 2, on page 2 
(i) by adding after line 5 the following: 
(ii) by deleting lines 6 to 10; 
(iii) by replacing line 11 with the following: 
" "extradition partner" means a State"; 
(iv) by adding after line 15 the following: 
" "specific extradition agreement" means an agreement referred to in section 10 that is in force.  
( d ) on page 32, by adding after line 6 the following: 
( a ) as if the word "extradition" read "surrender to an international tribunal"; 
( b ) as if the term "general extradition agreement" read "general surrender agreement"; 
( c ) as if the term "extradition partner" read "surrender partner"; 
( d ) as if the term "specific extradition agreement" read "specific surrender agreement"; 
( e ) as if the term "State or entity" read "international tribunal"; 
( f ) with the modifications provided for in sections 78 to 82; and 
( g ) with such other modifications as the circumstances require.  
"( b ) describe the offence in respect of which the surrender is requested;" and 
( f ) by renumbering all cross-references accordingly."  
Honourable senators, it is a privilege to take part in this fundamental debate. 
Bill C-40 is such a bill. 
The Senate has a profound history and tradition of defending the rights of individuals. 
Senator Ferguson took action. 
In that case, it dealt with the fundamentally difficult question of abortion. 
As a result, the Senate deleted the entire clause in question. 
What was the government's reaction to the Senate's most recent such amendment? 
According to this government the Senate did an excellent job.  
Far from expressing concern, the government welcomed the Senate initiatives.  
Honourable senators, some indirectly contend that our fundamental principles have territorial limitations. 
Beyond the Canadian borders, those fundamental rights could be jeopardized. 
I should like to quote from the proceedings of the committee of that day: 
I tried to reconcile your position with the basic philosophical values at stake. 
That is easy to say. 
Do we hold them within our borders but not abroad? 
That is what Canada is recognized for throughout the world.  
Let me give you another example. 
I will not name any specific country. 
We will do business with you." 
Let us look again at these particular questions. 
At first sight, they seem troubling. 
Honourable senators, let us consider for a moment the reliability of our justice system. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I regret to interrupt the honourable senator but his 15 minutes have expired.  
Is leave granted for the honourable senator to continue?  
In other words, there is a prima facie miscarriage of justice.  
To date, more than 3,500 people wait on death row.  
Others have not been so lucky.  
Are honourable senators prepared to live with that possibility? 
Let us not fool ourselves. 
I am not referring to an imaginary outcome. 
It has happened in the past. 
Should we allow a wrong to be committed to prevent a potential one?  
That rationale applies to the extradition law.  
But what is the binding legislation under which this debate takes place? 
First, of course, is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which states: 
The second is the Canadian Charter of Rights which states: 
Every human being has the inherent right to life. 
This right shall be protected by law. 
No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life.  
Those documents should be applied in the instance of Bill C-40.  
Under the terms of Article 2, Canada is obliged to: 
Both Ng and Kindler have been reviewed by the Human Rights Committee.  
...is not required to guarantee the rights of persons within another jurisdiction. 
itself maybe in violation of the Covenant...  
...while the Minister's decision is discretionary, the discretion is circumscribed by law. 
The question was framed by the Human Rights Committee in the following way: 
The starting point for consideration of this issue must be 
The right to life is the most essential of these rights.  
The answers to those questions are of paramount importance. 
The human rights committee, that is, eight out of nine jurists, declared as follows: 
with the United States 
The removal of the death penalty from military law is long overdue. 
I must say, I was surprised to find it still there, but it is. 
Let me return, then, to the Ng case. 
The Human Rights Committee requests 
to ensure that a similar situation does not arise in the future.  
Honourable senators, today is the future.  
In his individual opinion Mr. Fausto Pocar added: 
...a State party that has abolished the death penalty 
I therefore conclude that in the present case there has been a violation 
of article 6 of the covenant.  
Honourable senators, can anything be more clear than that? 
Can we wash our hands once the extradition is done?  
Senator Fraser, in her speech on the amendment, stated: 
The words "before extradition" attracted my attention. 
We wash our hands.  
Historically, such a position has always been condemned. 
There is a fundamental choice. 
Canada has an opportunity to seek respect of the inalienable right to life. 
Canada must make every possible effort to respect that obligation.  
The precedents are registered in the records.  
The record shows that American criminals will not invade Canada. 
Their legal statutes allow that.  
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Honourable senators, I have a question for Senator Joyal. 
I would first congratulate him on the speech he has just given. 
I note that the decision is far from made.  
We have to prevent that happening.  
You are aware, honourable senators, of what that gas was used for then. 
I am assuming we have a "liberal" Minister of Justice. 
You are all familiar with the debates in the other place, we hear them regularly.  
The Charter imposes national obligations on us in Canada. 
When we cross the border, we have international obligations. 
And this, in my opinion, is where the bill is flawed.  
In addition, we are giving the responsibility to one person. 
That is the fundamental issue raised by this clause.  
I respect the divergent views of my colleagues. 
I understand your reasoning, but the minister must still do some sort of analysis. 
There are no qualifications about this. 
There have been no such examinations requested. 
Hon. Noel Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Would the honourable senator answer two questions?  
Senator Kinsella raises a fundamental point. 
I sincerely hope that will come about. 
Hopefully senators will adopt our report. 
It will be a turning-point in the professional life and responsibility of the Senate.  
I was more than a little shocked when he gave us those statistics. 
This is a right that we have embraced.  
Honourable senators, I am grateful for your patience. 
Fourteen American states apply the death penalty to 18-year-olds. 
I am a member of a party. 
To me, that is wrong. 
You may hold another opinion, and I totally respect that.  
As legislators, we are, in a way, like judges. 
The difference is that we try to judge what will happen in the future. 
There are, in fact, very few. 
Will the honourable senator entertain another question?  
However, I remain somewhat puzzled by one element in particular. 
What is the protection for the discretion on the death penalty? 
We know very well that that party advocates the death penalty. 
It is not a secret. 
It is not confidential.  
Honourable senators, we advocate a referendum on the subject, then.  
We know there was a referendum on the subject. 
When I voted in 1976, I was representing the riding of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. 
My neighbouring MP represented the other party. 
I then stood up and said, "We share the same neighbourhood in Montreal. 
Essentially, that is my purpose.  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
It was in reference to pregnant women and the executions of pregnant women. 
I just finished reading some work on slavery and the situation of pregnant women.  
I appreciate, Senator Joyal and all honourable senators, that debates on capital punishment are important. 
However, this is not a debate on capital punishment. 
Senator Joyal says that it is a question of human rights. 
I subscribe entirely to the details added by Senator Cools.  
That is the full text of article 6 of the extradition treaty. 
That has been the agreement between our countries since 1976.  
That is precisely my point. 
The amendment uses the wording of the treaties.  
I do not understand the preoccupation of the honourable senator. 
Therefore, we have already exercised article 6 of the treaty.  
I am very well acquainted with many of those agreements and treaties. 
That is precisely the point. 
Senator Louis J. Robichaud :
The accused escapes to Canada while awaiting trial. 
This has, for example, happened in Pennsylvania. 
I have read past cases illustrating the circumstances described by the honourable senator.  
Honourable senators, there is first the trial in Canada. 
Once the judge is satisfied, the extradition decision is made. 
The minister is not the first judge in the process. 
The decision to extradite is made by a Canadian judge. 
The governor can also use his discretionary power. 
These are the two assurances the minister can get under American law. 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, I move the adoption of the report.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, please do not be impatient on that side. 
Can we please revert to that order?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin:
Honourable senators, we cannot hear very well at the end of the chamber. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Otherwise, I admit, it is impossible for everyone to follow.  
Sometimes things go a bit fast. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
There is a request to revert to Reports of Committees, Order No. 3. 
Is leave granted to revert, honourable senators?  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
However, if members who are independent could let us know, that would facilitate the process.  
I am prepared to give leave, honourable senators.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Privileges, Standing Rules and Orders 
Consideration of Ninth Report of Committee- Order Stands 
Leave having been given to revert to Order No. 3, Reports of Committees: 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
They just get up and speak to it. 
I do not see why this should apply only to independent senators. 
I know it is a courtesy. 
However, no one knows whether or not we want to speak on an item.  
We do not wish to boycott our own efforts.  
I am simply asking that we not go too fast. 
If not, then when can we dispose of this item?  
In a democracy, things are simple. 
We should decide someday how we will dispose of this report.  
I do not intend to make a long speech. 
I do not need to do so. 
I do not need to abuse the kindness of the senators. 
Some people say, "We are waiting to see what you will say." 
My views are known. 
I do not need to give my regular speech. 
I thank Senator Carstairs for allowing me to make my views a little clearer.  
Last week, Senator Wilson took objection. 
She thinks I am the spokesperson for the independent senators. 
She sent me a note to that effect. 
Hon. Noel Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone 
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
That has everything twisted around somewhat. 
The big hurdle we face is that we must talk to our own consumers.  
The same thing should be discussed here, too. 
The rBST is just the tip of the iceberg. 
I ask honourable senators to talk to producers when they go home to their regions. 
You will certainly be pressured. 
The consumer is becoming concerned about that issue. 
It is up to the producer to sell it to the consumer. 
The only long-term solution is to let consumers decide. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
This order will remain standing in the name of Honourable Senator Milne.  
Bill to Amend-Consideration of Report of Committee-Debate Continued 
Hon. John G. Bryden :
It is also an efficient and responsible investment. 
There is no universal definition of what constitutes reading material. 
However, the question now becomes, what is pornographic material? 
Any line that the government draws is sure to be controversial and subject to challenge.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
On our side, we voted against it. 
What you have just told us will not be an encouragement to increase book sales.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Wait until next year!  
On motion of Senator DeWare, debate adjourned.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
On behalf of all honourable senators, I bid you welcome to the Senate of Canada.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Compassion for Citizens Suffering Loss of Autonomy 
Motion to Establish Day of Recognition 
Hon. Dan Hays , pursuant to notice of April 21, 1999, moved: 
The UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, provided a good description of that phenomenon: 
The world as a whole will reach that percentage before the year 2015. 
Canada's committee aims to promote awareness and interest in issues concerning seniors.  
Honourable senators, it is in that context that this motion is proposed. 
I believe it coincides well with the United Nations and Canadian efforts. 
Seniors make an invaluable contribution to Canada. 
Most seniors are independent, with 92 per cent living in their own homes.  
Alzheimer's destroys the mind, and disrupts the balance of our life. 
This, then, disrupts the unity of the three aspects of the soul. 
The September 24, 1998, edition of The Globe and Mail reported some interesting statistics. 
Alzheimer's disease affects some 250,000 Canadians. 
Alzheimer's disease directly affects one in three families in Canada. 
Stroke is another disease that can cause an individual to lose their autonomy. 
These are just some of the difficulties faced by patients who survive. 
That is the tragic human side of the equation. 
The danger is that they can be treated literally as non-persons.  
In short, they are treated without compassion.  
Thus it is, honourable senators, that I urge you to support this motion. 
The month of June is designated Stroke Awareness Month. 
This is the measure of our compassion.  
Hon. Erminie J. Cohen :
This motion, however, speaks to a qualitatively different challenge. 
Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia are as insidious as they are unrelenting.  
Honourable senators have heard described some of the effects of this affliction. 
Jules de Goncourt captured it well 150 years ago. 
A human being sheds its leaves like a tree. 
Painful as the reality is, we Canadians do not anchor our lives in despair. 
It was a longitudinal investigation into the merits of an SCU. 
In fact, there is at present no known cure. 
That represents more than 6 per cent of the national health care budget.  
Honourable senators, we receive comfort from expressions of concern and gestures of support. 
Faith is reserved for a cure.  
Their efforts have been instrumental in the drive towards a cure.  
Upon reflection, however, we can and we do pull free from its force. 
Yesterday, I knew your face, Forgive me today, it's become misplaced. 
I knew this house; I knew this place. 
But now it's just an empty space. 
Please remember the message.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
I should like to talk about the stroke victim.  
He said he was terribly tired, and he went to bed. 
He woke up 14 hours later. 
He was paralyzed totally on one side. 
He had no bladder control. 
He was, all of a sudden, a vulnerable person.  
My father was one of the lucky ones. 
With the help of physicians, he regained his bladder control. 
He never had that again.  
I brought him to this chamber a couple of times. 
I wheeled him in, in his wheelchair. 
Perhaps the most painful experience, though, occurred in Calgary. 
He came down with pneumonia while there. 
She was treating him with great disrespect. 
I quickly realized that they had also removed his hearing aids. 
Like me, he wore double hearing aids. 
He could not hear what was being said to him.  
He was still an intelligent human being. 
He could answer their questions.  
When my father got home from the hospital, we decided he should play some bridge. 
I quickly said to my husband: "Stack his hand." 
Then he dealt the rest of the cards.  
My father and I were partners in that game. 
This was by far the best bridge hand he had ever had. 
My father died in 1980 of another massive stroke. 
The demographics have been before us for many years. 
The statistics are not a surprise.  
I was, and am, enormously proud of both of them. 
The other person closest to me in my life was my mother. 
Senator Prud'homme knew my mother. 
That was back in the mid-1980s. 
So there she was.  
It just went away. 
She would wave and smile with her eyes at the children at play.  
It was too difficult, so we just held hands and I talked. 
So often I was told that it was all just a part of growing old. 
All of us are in their debt.  
We must never take them for granted. 
We must never let them down. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
We did not know that it was to be implemented today. 
Senator Carstairs happens to have mentioned her time in Calgary. 
Senator Cohen spoke to us of Maurice Dionne. 
I have a few remarks on this subject. 
Often, our society can be rather mean, not to say hypocritical. 
One evening, on leaving Parliament, I recognized Mr. Dionne. 
I could see this was not the case with Mr. Dionne. 
He had in fact got lost between Parliament and my place. 
It struck me for the rest of my days. 
I knew he was a hard man from having been in his company. 
He had very definite opinions on many subjects, but he taught me a lot. 
I looked after him.  
I support this resolution. 
Society is becoming harder and harder. 
Today you hear that. 
That is what I like best. 
It is a debate which is very important. 
What was the subject-matter? 
We have a role to play. 
We should involve people, and involve ourselves. 
However, it is not only on May 20 that we should think of these issues. 
We are growing old, senators. 
I will not paraphrase the speech of Senator Hays. 
However, society is becoming older and older. 
We know what it will cost. 
I commend all of these people who are with us today.  
I offer my sincere congratulations to the people who came from Alberta today. 
I have that experience. 
I always like to make concrete suggestions. 
I would make more if I were a member of committees. 
That privilege will come someday, probably when I am out of here. 
I regret to put the two together.  
It was the great film of our youth. 
They were wealthy children, and they killed each other. 
Is it not because - 
Perhaps it is a loss of values, as Senator Nolin pointed out. 
The important thing is to go and talk about these values to young people.
