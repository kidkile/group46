New Brunswick Provincial Election, 1999 
Congratulations to Progressive Conservative Party on Winning Office 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Senator Bryden, on that day, stated: 
Who is the florist?  
Regional Council of Italian-Canadian Seniors 
This organization was founded by Senator Marisa Ferretti Barth.  
This was the most emotional moment for all of us. 
New Brunswick Provincial Election, 1999 
Congratulations to Progressive Conservative Party on Winning Office 
Hon. John G. Bryden :
As well, I want to congratulate the Liberal members who were successful. 
Mr. Lord and his team must now govern. 
Both will do their jobs, and do their jobs well, I am sure.  
I am not concerned about the youth of the premier designate. 
I also wish to congratulate New Brunswickers, and the party, for one more thing. 
I should like to congratulate the party on the civility of our campaign. 
Tuesday was a day for elation and disappointment. 
Finally, a word of hope. 
Convent of the Sacred Heart School in Halifax- One Hundred and Fiftieth Anniversary 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, it was a marvellous education. 
The Honourable Lucie Pepin 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Senator Pepin was appointed Chevalier de l'Ordre national du Quebec. 
Agriculture and Agri-Food 
I hope that this recognition does not come too late.  
The Greenbank Farm Research Station facility was one of the most modern in the world. 
We had beautiful equipment.  
Honourable senators, we should not tolerate these losses. 
Pages Exchange Program with the House of Commons 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Valerie is from Kapuskasing in Northern Ontario.  
Valerie and Mathieu, I welcome you to the Senate. 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Appropriation Bill No. 2, 1999-2000 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Committee Authorized to Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
Honourable senators, with leave of the Senate, I move: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
That, as far as Canada is concerned, will be the operative word.  
Honourable senators, perhaps I should clarify. 
The Honourable Senator Lynch-Staunton is absolutely correct. 
The word "majority" does not appear in the exchange of letters. 
The question to the senior trade official of the United States is as follows: 
The senior trade official responded by saying: 
Further on we see: 
Its comparative word in the agreement is "substantial."  
Q. "Substantial" does not mean "majority"?  
That's what's in the agreement. 
When the Canadians write their regulations, we will see what words they use.  
It is quite clear that the Americans are interpreting the word "substantial" to mean "substantial." 
The Canadians claim that the Americans have agreed that the word "substantial" means "majority." 
Canadian authorities have made it quite clear that "substantial" means "majority." 
That is the American view of "substantial."  
The press release continues: 
The Americans say "substantial." 
Honourable senators, I will not prolong this. 
Where is the documentation; where is the commitment? 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
The pertinent paragraph reads: 
In percentage terms, what does "substantial level of original editorial content" mean?  
It means 50 per cent plus one.  
Farm Crisis in Prairie Provinces- Possibility of Government Support 
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
The situation is very sad.  
This problem must be dealt with by the federal government. 
There is no question about that. 
They will receive $79 billion from the European Union.  
The U.S. has indicated clearly that they are standing with their farmers. 
Last October, they had already paid up to $80,000 per farmer.  
Will the government stand with the farmers or not? 
I do not wish to be repetitive. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The situation remains particularly serious in some provinces, most particularly in Western Canada. 
I recognize that perhaps this in itself is not enough.  
I am glad to hear that.  
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
The farmer had three good crops of canola, giving him a high average. 
He happens to be in a position where he gets nothing.  
I do not think he is. 
I think he is a Liberal.  
In any event, the AIDA program is not working. 
They will not be there. 
Honourable senators, this is a crisis situation. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I am fully in support of Senator Gustafson's comments. 
That is right, but the problem lies with the grain.  
Farm Crisis in Prairie Provinces- Possibility of Government Support 
Senators Gustafson, Andreychuk, myself and other senators have raised this issue in the past.  
Apparently the brain drain is a myth and high taxes are a myth. 
We have not heard the Prime Minister speak about the farm issue.  
A farmer in Saskatchewan does not receive employment insurance. 
That is what is happening in our province. 
What is happening here? 
The southeast corner of Saskatchewan is flooded. 
In Quebec we have an ice storm, and all hell breaks loose. 
Well, this is our ice storm; this is our flood; this is our disaster!  
The government leader responds, "I will bring this up in a cabinet meeting."  
Mr. Minister, the message is that we cannot wait. 
Correction - Senator Herb Sparrow was there.  
Our friend Senator Sparrow was there. 
My deepest apology, Senator Sparrow. 
You know how much we like you.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The Prime Minister should visit the area.  
Some 2 million acres are under water. 
To date, it is offering nothing to the farmers in southwest Manitoba.  
It is a far different picture.  
I do not always agree with my colleague Senator Tkachuk. 
However, I must say that fine words will not help the situation. 
Where is the beef?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The minister will be visiting that particular part of Manitoba this Friday. 
Honourable senators, indeed, the Government of Manitoba has offered assistance. 
What sort of assistance will be given to farmers? 
Honourable senators, I cannot give any specific details. 
I have also listened to the Deputy Leader of the Government. 
You could see Chretien with a sandbag.  
Where is it now? 
The farmers are going bankrupt.  
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Honourable senators, the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food will be visiting Manitoba. 
Aid must be delivered immediately. 
Senator Kinsella says, "Answer the question."  
In the meantime, I will try to address the question asked by Senator Andreychuk.  
Honourable senators, how quickly can we get it? 
The farmers in Europe have been promised continued subsidies for three years. 
They cannot weather this summer.  
We have lost 15,000 farmers already. 
They continue to leave daily. 
It is a crisis that cannot wait until next week or the week after. 
Will the AIDA program be changed?  
I am not an accountant. 
The cost is phenomenally high. 
I will bring all the representations that have been made today directly to his attention.  
Is that all you do?  
Hon. Herbert O. Sparrow :
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, may we have leave to invite Senator Sparrow to ask his question?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your wish, honourable senators, that I recognize those other senators as well?  
Since he is the dean of the Senate, we should extend that courtesy to him.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Honourable Senator Sparrow.  
Sometimes I feel that it should have been my one hundred and fiftieth birthday.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Budget Implementation Bill, 1999 
Third Reading-Motion in Amendment- Debate Continued 
( a ) on pages 10 to 12, by deleting Part 3; and 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Canadian migration to the United States is not a new occurrence. 
It has a very long history. 
Taxation levels are of particular concern. 
In the National Post on March 12 of this year, Jonathan Chevreau said: 
...for every American coming to work to Canada, six Canadians head south.  
Government policies do not persuade people to stay in Canada.  
Some people claim that the brain drain is an exaggeration. 
In the January Fraser Forum , he also said that the taxpayer: 
This could be detrimental to the future of our economic growth. 
Hon. Raymond J. Perrault :
There is an immense responsibility, for example, on those who study medicine. 
It may be higher than that. 
In fact, I think it is closer to $2 million. 
His area of study was the establishment of water purification methods and techniques. 
He studied in Canada for three years. 
There is an interchange across the border. 
Some Americans come to Canada; it is true. 
There may be merit in that suggestion. 
Perhaps we should study it. 
It is of great importance to the nation.  
Hon. Erminie J. Cohen :
I must stress the word "modest." 
Simply put, honourable senators, Bill C-71 represents a missed opportunity. 
That includes $17 in federal taxes and $10.20 in provincial taxes. 
On motion of Senator Di Nino, debate adjourned.  
Privileges, Standing Rules and Orders 
Consideration of Eleventh and Ninth Reports of Committee-Debate Continued 
And on the Order: 
That is why I wish to address them both at the same time.  
It is this discrepancy that I am respectfully addressing.  
Some may say that I have a vested interest in this speech. 
I do not deny that. 
I put my cards on the table. 
Of those, 11 have identified themselves as independent. 
I will not talk about that. 
Are we not all appointed by the same constitutional process?  
The status is recognized in the appointment process. 
In that letter I applied for membership on two committees. 
Furthermore, yesterday something interesting happened. 
I believe that this is an anomaly. 
I probably have said enough. 
I should like to offer, respectfully, a way out of this dilemma. 
That part of the eleventh report, as far as I am concerned, is very commendable.  
Then picking up the language from the ninth report: 
That independent Senators would apply to the Selection Committee; 
4. That only one independent Senator would be allowed per committee.  
Let us get this thing settled and finished before the Senate rises. 
Hon. Edward M. Lawson :
Frankly, I do not know what the issue is all about.  
Who changed the rules? 
Who took away the rights we had all those years? 
When did it change?  
We said, "Wait a minute, you have overlooked the independents. 
We must have similar rights."  
Honourable senators, I am not aware that my rights have been taken away. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
I am absolutely offended because I see no need for it. 
My rights are there. 
I was not aware that someone took them away from me. 
If I find out, I will hold them accountable. 
We are not Liberal senators, Conservative senators or independent senators. 
We are all senators with equal rights.  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, I have been extremely fair and patient. 
I have tried everything for six years and two days. 
I have not threatened or used blackmail. 
I tried to cajole, but it did not work. 
I tried to smile, but it did not work. 
I tried to yell, but it did not work. 
Now, I see my honourable friends Senator Lawson, Senator Roche and Senator Wilson reacting. 
They, of course, know our friend Senator Pitfield. 
This situation is becoming, to be frank, totally ridiculous. 
I will leave that to the commoners in the other chamber. 
I think we should be gracious with each other.  
The vote was unanimous, less one. 
I did not vote because I am not a member of the committee. 
I am a half of I do not know what, but not for long. 
Besides, I will not go on bended knee to beg. 
Independent senators have a right to be on committee.  
Some people say we are all senators. 
I heard that argument and I reflected upon it. 
However, I double checked, and my appointment stated "independent senator."  
I am in favour of the ninth report. 
We could accept both reports today and stop working. 
Is that not the essence of an open discussion? 
Is that not a fair appeal to all colleagues?  
You have known mine for six years and two days. 
I am tired of being a volunteer.  
Honourable senators, the Speaker has been clear. 
He says that every senator has rights. 
Therefore, it would be my right to go to Europe. 
Therefore I can attend. 
You do not want to push in that way. 
I think I have been fair. 
I enjoy listening to another point of view. 
It was probably put better to you in the English way by Senator Roche. 
He is different than me. 
He puts it in a sweeter way, while I put more passion into it:
Is that not Canada at its best? 
We combine in a surprising way. 
You may think that we decided that in camera .  
I am happy for the contribution of Senator Lawson. 
We did not speak about that.  
There is no coup against the majority of the Senate. 
Please, do not adjourn. 
Then we will see how it works. 
If it does not work, senators, we will come back. 
That is what Canada is all about. 
That is what Canada was made for. 
That is what you should decide today.  
Hon. Lois M. Wilson :
Honourable senators, I support Senator Roche in his comments. 
I assumed that that was a valid appointment, and I still assume so. 
When I asked why, no reason was given. 
My own constituents are puzzled by this to this day. 
If I ever find a reason, I will tell them. 
I was interested in Senator Lawson's background on that one.  
We will not go away. 
It does suggest some helpful ways to incorporate us into the system.  
This report is not as clear. 
Honourable senators, I move the adjournment of the debate.  
Honourable senators, I see some senators smiling with pleasure. 
There is no debate on an adjournment motion.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Would all those in favour of the adjournment motion will please say "yea"?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Would all those opposed to the adjournment motion please say "nay"?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
In my opinion, the "nays" have it.  
And two honourable senators having risen.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
We will have a standing vote. 
The whips advise me that there will be a five-minute bell. 
The vote, therefore, will take place at 4:30 p.m. 
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
That is unfair, very unfair.  
A five-minute bell is undemocratic. 
Every senator has the right to come to this place and vote.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Motion agreed to and debate adjourned on the following division: 
Fifth Report of Standing Joint Committee Adopted 
Hon. Celine Hervieux-Payette :
Honourable senators, I move that the report be adopted.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow, Thursday, June 10, 1999, at 1:30 p.m.
