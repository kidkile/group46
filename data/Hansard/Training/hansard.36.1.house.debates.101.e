ROYAL CANADIAN MINT ACT 
CANADIAN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ACT 
Specifically this legislation is an act to amend the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions to present today. 
The first petition is with regard to the Young Offenders Act. 
Publication of names is also important.  
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
They also cite opposition from police on the streets and many provincial and territorial governments. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
QUESTIONS PASSED AS ORDERS FOR RETURN 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, on October 28, 1997, I asked Question No. 33. 
There seems to be a reluctance to provide the answer to this question. 
It has to do again with the same two individuals.  
I would like to know when I can expect an answer to this question. 
On December 2 the question was asked. 
The 45 days is long gone.  
Mr. Speaker, I do recognize the importance of these questions. 
I will also look into the whereabouts of the response to Question No. 56.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I have made a note of Question No. 21. 
I will certainly look into Question No. 21.  
Is it agreed that all remaining questions stand?  
The motions will be grouped for debate as follows: 
Motions Nos. 1 to 5. 
Motions Nos. 11 to 17.  
Motions Nos. 19, 25 to 27 and 29.  
The Chair will remind the House of each pattern at the time of voting.  
I will now put Motions Nos. 1 to 5 to the House.  
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ) moved: 
That Bill C-19, in Clause 2, be amended 
(a) by replacing lines 31 and 32 on page 2 with the following: 
(b) by adding after line 35 on page 2 the following: 
The terms referred to in subsection (1) shall not be renewed.''  
We cannot go any further for procedural reasons, as I said.  
Finally, Motion No. 4 pertains to vacancies. 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Labour, Lib.):
He continues to do that. 
He has consulted and consulted.  
The government believes that Bill C-19 succeeds in meeting these goals.  
I would like to turn my attention now to the motions in Group No. 1. 
In all legislation we must strive to achieve balance.  
The Reform Party should like that. 
Here are a few of the key provisions which will improve administration of the code.  
The appointment of regionally based members will reduce travel costs. 
The Reform Party should be delighted with this aspect in the board.  
The board must issue decisions within a reasonable timeframe. 
The use of mediation to resolve issues will be encouraged.  
I am counting on my colleagues in the Chamber to help get this through.  
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
A period of 10 years is far too long. 
That is a reflection in the bill which I very much support.  
A 10-year appointment is far too long. 
I do not believe this is necessary. 
A five year term is appropriate.  
We have had cases that last for months. 
It would help with continuity if the terms were staggered. 
That would certainly help with continuity on the board.  
That is not a bad system of selecting a chairman. 
You were selected from among your peers. 
That is not too bad of a provision.  
That applies in this instance.  
That is totally unacceptable.  
We should be notified as to its operations. 
The auditor general raised this problem time and time again. 
We hope that it does not happen like that in the future.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
In this Parliament, what does ``greater democratization'' mean? 
Labour relations are a very important matter. 
Here we represent different parties. 
At present, we have a majority government and several opposition parties. 
That is why I want to support the hon. member for Trois-Rivieres. 
I would like to point out that he has done a wonderful job. 
He has done an excellent follow-up on all these mechanisms. 
He is far more of an expert than I am on these matters.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
To a large degree this is what happened following the so-called consultations.  
I did not hear any of that discussed by the parliamentary secretary.  
I would argue it does not meet this goal at all. 
The first group of amendments proposed comes from the Bloc. 
They could be weeded out. 
I am not sure that is a very substantive debate. 
The fourth represents changes to the legislation. 
Presently if the chair becomes vacant, the minister will fill the vacancy. 
The legislation proposes that the board members fill the vacancy. 
Board members would know the players since they would have worked with them. 
I commend my colleagues from the Bloc for some pretty well thought out amendments. 
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Bill C-19 is a very important piece of legislation. 
It is just as important as the Canada Labour Code. 
This kind of legislation is not amended very often. 
This committee would have to hold public hearings before making a recommendation.  
Our party will support this motion put forward by our colleague from the Bloc Quebecois. 
The public hearings should not, however, be allowed to turn into a circus.  
I must say that our party will vote against this motion. 
Now turning to Motion No. 3. 
The committee would have to hold public hearings before making a recommendation. 
Our party will support this motion.  
This part is similar to what the bill currently provides.  
We will vote against this motion. 
What this amendment is supposed to achieve is not really clear. 
Is it intended as a temporary measure? 
The other provisions of the bill seem to properly address these concerns.  
We will support this motion. 
This reinforces accountability to Parliament.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Everybody had a kick at the cat. 
The terms are set. 
Most of the parties involved are very satisfied with the current package. 
The package is satisfactory. 
I believe that all stakeholders put their own special interests aside. 
It certainly needed review. 
I believe there were as many as 90 applications for certification pending. 
Any delays increase the odds of that happening.  
I do not believe there is enough merit in this argument. 
We are dealing with fine tuning an idea.  
It will have a neutral chairperson, a representative from labour and a representative from management. 
The key objective is fairness. 
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I spoke to the bill earlier this year. 
We are going to see those kinds of changes coming to government as well.  
It blurs the lines between who belongs to management and who belongs to the union. 
Everyone has a joint goal and it is very refreshing.  
It died for good reasons and now it has been brought back with minor changes. 
It is still laced with problems.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I do not see a quorum in the House.  
I see a quorum. 
The hon. member for Vancouver Island North has the floor.  
There are two sides to this issue. 
This would be in the case of a vacancy. 
I will finish on this note. 
It is important that the structure of the board be done right. 
If it is not done right everything else does not matter. 
These are important amendments.  
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
It is the consultations that really bother us. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would call notice that we do not have a quorum.  
The hon. member for Madawaska-Restigouche is calling for a quorum.  
And the bells having rung: 
I see a quorum. 
The hon. member for North Vancouver has the floor.  
The exercise we have just gone through indicates that what I said was correct. 
There are no people listening to what is being said about this bill. 
The consultation goes on but nobody listens. 
My colleague from Calgary-Nose Hill made that point quite strongly earlier today.  
We were discussing the never ending road work that is taking place on Wellington Street. 
We need to inject some efficiency and modern practices into government. 
I stray a little from the topic.  
I return to the issue of appointments to the Canada Industrial Relations Board. 
An enormous number of failed Liberal candidates have been appointed to all manner of boards. 
We are going to end up with patronage appointees on this board. 
It is certainly open to question. 
These are the types of people who get appointed to that type of board. 
I can give some examples.  
It is absolutely incredible. 
Most of them must have cashed in their mileage points already.  
At first glance that may seem in conflict with our opposition to appointments. 
We are also opposing Motion No. 3. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am not talking about numbers at the moment. 
I am just asking you to hear me out.  
I suggest the Chair give advice to the government. 
Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the hon. member's comments. 
The hon. member knows we have many committees, in particular on Thursdays. 
We are getting near the end of the session. 
Many ministers are coming forward to committees. 
We should not get into a debate on this point of order. 
The hon. House leader for the Reform Party has made his point. 
The count is for the minimum number of 20 members. 
If 20 members are present the debate resumes. 
In the circumstances we will leave this matter and proceed with the debate.  
The Chair counted 20 members.  
Mr. Speaker, the last point of order was frivolous and therefore non-receivable.  
Is the House ready for the question?  
The question is on Motion No. 1.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I was on my feet.  
I am afraid I am in the midst of putting the question to the House. 
I called resuming debate and no member rose in his or her place. 
I asked if the House was ready for the question. 
Point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
The vote is on Motion No. 1. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The recorded division on Motion No. 1 stands deferred.  
All those in favour will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The recorded division on Motion No. 2 stands deferred.  
The next question is on Motion No. 3. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The recorded division on Motion No. 3 stands deferred.  
All those in favour will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The recorded division on Motion No. 4 stands deferred.  
The next question is on Motion No. 5. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The recorded division on Motion No. 5 stands deferred.  
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ) moved: 
That Bill C-19 be amended by deleting Clause 6. 
(2) Any person who was not an employee'' 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ) moved: 
That Bill C-19 be amended by deleting Clause 46.  
Clause 6 reads as follows: 
This seems excessive, to put it bluntly. 
We fail to see the validity of that provision. 
Therefore, we will oppose this motion by the Reform Party.  
This provision deals with employers' representation on the board. 
The board's control over this aspect is a source of concern. 
As you have seen, the Reform Party is opposed to such a thing. 
We on this side are vehemently opposed to this. 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour, Lib.):
This would not change under Bill C-19. 
In fact the task force noted two advantages to the current system. 
It is neither a new nor a radical provision. 
Five provincial labour boards have similar authority. 
The choice of an employer representative belongs to the employees concerned. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
We often put ourselves out as number one. 
We are falling behind the world in a number of areas. 
The crowd continues to build in the government ranks. 
Obviously they are very interested in what I have to say.  
We have a very highly trained and skilled workforce. 
We have a good education system. 
We are not keeping up the standard of quality control that we require. 
The ship was to make another shipment down the road yet it was sitting there. 
It is all about transportation. 
It is all about our ability to deliver. 
It is all about reliability.  
We have to start thinking about these things. 
That is where Bill C-19 becomes such a important bill.  
Is this the best way to deal with the situation?  
We must look at this board. 
We must ask who should be on it. 
They will have to be somebody with connections to be on this board. 
I do not think so. 
I will tell a story to point out what I mean. 
At this very important meeting there were officials from various countries. 
At our table was a representative from New Guinea. 
There is no such name as that. 
What a silly name that is''. 
He thought it was quite a funny name and quite silly. 
I did not know you could belong to APEC and not be from Asia. 
What are you doing here? 
You don't look Asian''. 
These are the types of people the government appoints to boards. 
This does nothing for us in the international community.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
I would like to expand on what he said.  
He was talking about the importance of the bill to international relations. 
How will passage of the bill help the average Canadian? 
Is the average Canadian even aware of it?  
In order to do that we have to examine who the legislation affects directly. 
Specifically, will it improve things for the average person in Canada? 
No, it does not. 
It has not improved those situations at all.  
First class mail is a monopoly of the post office. 
How has the legislation improved mail service in Canada? 
The short answer is that it has not improved mail service in Canada.  
Perhaps it has improved Canada's ability to be a reliable exporter of goods. 
Let us look at that. 
They are extremely important outlets to world markets.  
Oftentimes it is a lockout. 
I do not think we have improved that at all.  
The work stoppages in the post office never occur during summer holidays. 
It affects a lot more people than just simply the farmers. 
It affects the people on the railways. 
Canada is not the only producer of these products. 
Whether they are agricultural products, dehydrated alfalfa or potash, it does not matter. 
Why are they not telling us to make some improvements?  
This has a huge impact on the Canadian economy. 
It affects every person in Canada.  
I submit that this is undemocratic. 
Certification of a union should take place by secret ballot. 
They have the security and the confidentiality of the secret ballot. 
We have heard many times about how this legislation seeks a balance. 
Every case will be pled on that basis.  
I would like a quorum call, please.  
And the bells having rung: 
There is a quorum.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to do something a bit novel. 
In that situation it will grant certification. 
It will give the employees the benefit of the doubt. 
It has been very much a problem in some cases.  
Interference happens even without speaking. 
There is psychological interference. 
Most employers do not want a union in their workplace.  
I think that is wrong. 
That is very fair, in my estimation.  
Having 35% of the cards signed is very meaningful to me. 
People would be asked to vote twice on the same thing. 
How many times are votes to be held? 
Until they get the answer they want? 
That would be patently unfair. 
If majority support can be indicated, that should be satisfactory.  
All other matters are still the exclusive right of management. 
That is an aspect of every part of labour management relations. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We are on Government Orders which has to do with government business. 
This is a bill the government wants to put through. 
We happen to support it, but that it beside the point. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We have a call for quorum. 
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
There is a quorum.  
Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay-Okanagan, Ref.):
It seems that even when the Liberals are present they do not choose to listen. 
That is a lot of the problem.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I intend to address the motions in Group No. 2. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would like to call quorum again.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I will ask the clerk to count the members present.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, as soon as I can get their attention, I will carry on.  
If the make-up is a different way- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I will ask the clerk to count the members present.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We suggested the names of three people to be chairs of boards. 
He said ``Of course it is patronage. 
What is wrong with that? 
How else would we attract people to our party?''  
Motion No. 6 deals with the potential streamlining of the board. 
We think it is appropriate. 
Motion No. 7 is a particularly interesting one because now we are talking about representation. 
Why else would he feel threatened? 
Even though our opinions differ, I do have some level of respect for him.  
I will bet the Bloc would love to pass this one. 
So 35% is good enough. 
Can anyone imagine what the Bloc would do with that?  
Do they really want to say that 35% represents the majority?  
It demanded that there should be certification because it was interfered with.  
So much for the arguments from the hon. member.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, we are looking at Group No. 2, which contains four motions.  
Excuse me, I realize I made a mistake. 
I was in fact referring to Motion No. 8. 
There is a consensus on this in Quebec. 
As well as replacing employees, they could take part in union decisions. 
This we find unacceptable. 
In our opinion, it does not go far enough.  
This is not unusual in this House. 
There are two very important cultures and attitudes in this country. 
Compromise must be sought with respect to working conditions. 
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
I am pleased to see you back in the chair, Mr. Speaker. 
I knew you would be pleased that I was speaking whilst on your watch.  
It would be nice if we could call the members here by their names. 
Half of the members do not actually having ridings. 
They are selected on the basis of party lists. 
I reinforce the argument of my colleague. 
How could you possibly take 35% to be representative of the majority? 
It is totally ludicrous. 
If you have democracy you have democracy and that means a majority.  
There are plenty of workers out there who do not want to do that.  
The Wal-Mart affair in Ontario is certainly a good example of that. 
How could a union possibly be certified under those circumstances? 
There were 151 against and 43 for a union and it was certified. 
Because the CIRB made a random decision that the employer was unfair.  
That is a really subjective judgment.  
The Wal-Mart case as I said illustrates that. 
The word is ``may'' and we would like to see that as ``must''.  
You probably would not be sitting there today. 
You would certainly deserve it, Mr. Speaker. 
You have been here long enough to prove that you are part of club Chretien. 
I think you have earned enough membership points. 
You might even get to the Senate, I do not know.  
There are two Bloc motions which we oppose. 
Members before me have indicated briefly why we would do that.  
We think it clogs the system if there is too much process. 
Therefore we are not supporting that particular motion.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Many speakers have been heard. 
The federal government also has jurisdiction over labour matters involving the federal public service. 
This is the issue I wish to delve into at this time.  
Whatever happened to democracy? 
Mr. Speaker, do you think the Prime Minister is travelling too much to Cuba?  
What does the government consider to be unfair labour practice? 
What was the unfair labour practice? 
What big bad deed did the employer practice in? 
What were they supposed to say? 
This shows how a bad decision can snowball. 
In its report, the Senate committee wrote as follows: 
I therefore hope that members of the House will support this amendment.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Many things have been said that I think should not go unanswered. 
The member did two things. 
It is very interesting the member would be so concerned about- 
Who are we trying to kid? 
Let this double standard speak for itself.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
That was a most interesting interpretation. 
The following is being proposed in government legislation: 
That is the whole issue.  
What in the world was this gentleman who just spoke talking about? 
What were those people over there clapping about? 
They do not understand their own bill. 
What the NDP member was actually saying is in the bill. 
What is in the bill is what the government wants. 
All we want to do is to make sure that this democratic principle is observed. 
That is the issue. 
When will the NDP learn what the English language actually says? 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
It means that democracy works. 
It has a chance.  
I would like to move to another point. 
in the proposed legislation and reads: 
However, members should notice what has happened since then. 
Is this not a clear indication that the earlier ruling by the CIRB was wrong?  
We must preserve that.  
This has nothing to do with being pro or anti-union. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
And the bells having rung: 
There is a quorum.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
That sends a signal. 
We are now speaking on changes to the labour code. 
There are arguments on both sides of the issue. 
We need to weigh that carefully. 
The second amendment was put forward by the official opposition. 
I have the highest respect for that member and his logic process.  
We have to think through the implications of this. 
I do not think so. 
I think the democratic principle is based on a majority decision. 
The last amendment is a Reform amendment. 
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
That is just not good enough. 
There was a recent case in Ontario. 
We will be handling that at a later date.  
This bill is to help relieve that situation. 
That is why we have brought forward our amendments. 
This bill is going to have far reaching effects for years to come in Canada. 
It is important that it be democratic. 
If that cannot be done, our reputation is harmed. 
I hope the rest of the House will support our amendments.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate you for getting the riding name right. 
Some of them are quite difficult to remember. 
It is a pleasure for me to address this very important piece of legislation. 
The fact remains that we do live in a democratic country. 
That is a reasonable amendment.  
You still have six minutes to speak on this particular topic.  
Because it is almost 2 p.m. we will now proceed to Statements by Members.  
PORT COLBORNE HIGH SCHOOL 
Mr. John Maloney (Erie-Lincoln, Lib.):
To celebrate this historic occasion Port High is hosting a gala reunion this weekend. 
All the while we will commemorate 75 years of exemplary secondary education in Port Colborne.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Public rallies are being held across the country to urge this minister to move.  
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
WORLD RED CROSS DAY 
Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard-La Prairie, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, May 8, is World Red Cross Day.  
There are close to 100 million land mines in the world. 
Each month-and I mean each month-these mines make 2,000 new victims. 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
THE ATLANTIC GROUNDFISH STRATEGY 
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or, NDP):
I invite people to come to Atlantic Canada. 
I will show them the devastation caused by these unthinking, unfeeling policies. 
Then perhaps this government will see TAGS- 
The hon. member for Vaudreuil-Soulanges.  
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
I offer greetings to all those who are here today in the House.  
Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Lib.):
It is essential to the economic strength of this country.  
That is why this competition is important. 
It salutes the excellence of young people who are going into these fields. 
MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS SOCIETY OF CANADA 
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Today she is the queen of grandmothers to my children. 
She is the best friend of my wife. 
But to me she remains the kind mother I have always had.  
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
The hon. member for Louis-Hebert.  
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Composting is simple to do. 
The efforts of amateur composters might save our planet from environmental deterioration.  
We owe him the benefits that we are now reaping.  
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
Conservatives have a history of doing the right thing for innocent victims. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
But time is running out. 
Mr. Gary Pillitteri (Niagara Falls, Lib.):
I am quite sure he is fooling no one.  
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
It is a good idea that we do this.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I am happy with that.  
All the ministers will sit down and look at the file. 
It will be a rational approach to the problem. 
We know there was a commission that made the report. 
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
At McDonald's the Prime Minister flip-flopped. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I will not apologize for that.  
We had a very rational discussion before with the provinces. 
We made a deal according to all the information that all the ministers had. 
It is not a case- 
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister is suffering from the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde syndrome. 
This is cruel treatment of the victims. 
Is the Prime Minister going to compensate these victims or not?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
They are not interested in politics. 
They are not interested in pettiness. 
They are not interested in name calling.  
Will he or will he not?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
I do not know how many times we have to ask it.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have already said the developments of this week are significant. 
We have already said we will make ourselves available for a meeting. 
In fact the date and location of that meeting are almost finalized. 
We are listening to what is being said. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Other premiers are considering the issue. 
But the Prime Minister of Canada, the principal player, is not budging.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The hon. member for Roberval.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
What is making him so stubborn?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Last summer, premiers Harris and Bouchard refused to compensate victims. 
The victims will be getting compensation because of this government. 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Hon Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has just made reference to a humanitarian settlement.  
All of them refused, Quebec included. 
That was Quebec's position. 
It was not a humanitarian one.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
We will arrive at a Canadian decision in the best interest of Canadians.  
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
The hon. member should address all questions through the Chair. 
If the hon. minister heard the question, he may answer.  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Others might refer to it as expropriation. 
The fair minded could legitimately call this political pork barrelling.  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the mint is celebrating 90 years of existence. 
There is an international market. 
The hon. member for Medicine Hat.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
That does not make any sense.  
All that is irrelevant. 
This is about people's lives.  
What position is the government taking into negotiations with the provinces? 
Is the hep C file open or closed?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
I do not see how he thinks he can get away with that.  
The fact is people have been waiting for months for a decision on this. 
The government says the file is open, it is closed, it is open. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
It is this government that has acted on behalf of victims.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
That was the reason for our success in the manpower issue. 
The Government of Canada promised to negotiate in good faith. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we in this House are chosen by secret ballot. 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, quite simply, we are not denying Canadian workers any right. 
We are protecting their rights.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Our legislation and the budget itself are very clear in this respect. 
I trust that the goals we have set for ourselves will be achieved.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
My question is quite simple:
What does the minister have to say to that?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We thank her for being open-minded. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
What I can say 
The hon. Minister for Human Resources Development has the floor for a few more seconds.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, in his opinion it is much needed. 
This bill is very undemocratic. 
That is unfair to business and it does not represent workers' democratic rights.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Does the Prime Minister find this situation acceptable?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
A couple of weeks ago we met with all of our provincial and territorial counterparts. 
We agreed to develop a strategy. 
We are working with all sectors of our economy and with the municipalities. 
We will achieve our Kyoto target.  
CANADIAN INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCY 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Can the Prime Minister stand up and confirm that this is his government's position?  
They will win as many as anybody else.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I find it passing strange. 
We are not like that. 
We are going to have Canadians involved in this decision. 
We will not make a decision until they are.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have put in a process. 
Once again colleagues, please address the Chair. 
The hon. member for Tobique-Mactaquac.  
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Will this minister immediately stop- 
The hon. minister of public works.  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, again I think the hon. member has all the facts mixed up.  
In terms of the plant in Winnipeg, a plant already exists in Winnipeg. 
This is an extension so we can save- 
The hon. member for Tobique-Mactaquac.  
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
It has nothing to do with the building of the plant. 
Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton, Lib.):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
General Ross has been in touch with provincial officials. 
We certainly want to be of assistance to the people of Alberta.  
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
The clock is ticking, or should I say the calendar is flipping.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I find the hon. member's question very interesting. 
They are looking forward to participating in the national forum in June.  
Mr. Rejean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Labour.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
This proves the resource is there. 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
Does the Prime Minister live by those words? 
Is that a change in position or just more confusion on the part- 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
The experts said he would reoffend. 
The hon. Minister of Justice.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have just received the Bombardier report. 
It is a long and complex proposal. 
I eagerly await the committee's recommendations.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am very proud of Statistics Canada. 
They knew their burden would be lightened.  
You answered it with bravery and selflessness.  
You are all invited.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Next Thursday shall be an allotted day.  
COMMENTS OF PRIME MINISTER 
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
It would mean a great deal to all- 
At first blush it would not be a question of privilege. 
I did hear the hon. member raise that as a question today. 
For whatever reason the question was not answered directly. 
I make no judgment on that. 
We have looked at Hansard , we have listened to the tapes. 
The words quoted by the hon. member are the words in Hansard . 
If there has to be any clarification, perhaps it will be forthcoming from another place. 
COMMENTS DURING QUESTION PERIOD 
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):
All members of this House are privileged to be elected. 
This Chamber is enriched by a wealth of individuals from a variety of backgrounds. 
We represent various regions and we all have unique accents. 
In my view this is not a question of privilege. 
Perhaps they were made. 
It does not help us in the course of debate.  
As far as I know, this is not a question of privilege.  
Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Lib.):
I do not know that this is a question of privilege. 
The hon. member for Langley-Abbotsford was mentioned by the member for Port Moody-Coquitlam. 
I hope we can settle this fairly quickly.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
I think the member should withdraw these comments. 
I do not recall saying anything like this.  
Surely this is a debate. 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Get those insignificant things out of the way and get to the real things.  
It is too bad it had to be interrupted. 
I am sure I would agree with the hon. member. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
However, the Reform Party refuses to talk about the amendments. 
It talks about everything else but the amendments. 
Can we please get back- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We have a call for quorum.  
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Resuming debate, the hon. member for Prince George-Peace River.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
If the Chair can see them, they are here. 
Mr. Speaker, I am sure the viewing audience at home this afternoon appreciates that explanation. 
It is sort of similar to groundhog day. 
I appreciate the comments of the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Labour. 
Was it 50% plus one or not?  
I have some personal experience in this. 
At that time the company was called West Coast Transmission. 
Those employees felt they did not need the representation of a union.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It was dealt with as a question of privilege. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will do my utmost to change the subject. 
I am sure you are in tune with that thought process as well, Mr. Speaker. 
This time I am speaking on the second set of amendments. 
This bill is all about industrial relations in the federal sector. 
This legislation fails the basic tests of democracy.  
It is not a requirement of this legislation.  
This is non-democratic. 
As an example, we are all here because we were elected. 
We all know that is incorrect, not appropriate, not proper and does not occur. 
Why should it occur as a consequence of this legislation? 
This government should not be doing such a thing or allowing it to happen.  
That is totally inappropriate. 
This takes us right back to all of those things we want to avoid.  
We want to do things that will prevent it if at all possible. 
We need to bring a balance into this package. 
It takes us back to where we do not want to be.  
We talked about the fact that the board will be hand picked. 
We can make other comparisons. 
These are issues where the public has been sadly let down. 
These boards are expensive. 
They are expensive to run and to maintain. 
The people who are supposed to benefit in essence are penalized. 
We must get this right.  
There are four motions grouped. 
Once again we are talking about Reform and Bloc amendments. 
The Reform motion is very supportable of course. 
With that I will conclude my remarks.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
This bill has been hanging around for quite a while. 
Frankly the legislation is flawed. 
But they did not do that. 
They had the chance but they dropped the ball.  
Our party is trying to make some amendments. 
That is what we are proposing.  
We want to make sure that workers have a voice in all of this. 
In this place when we elect the Speaker we do it by secret ballot. 
When we are chosen as legislators we are chosen by secret ballot. 
That applies when we are talking about labour unions as well. 
To me it is a fundamental right. 
Now we are stuck with a piece of legislation like this which is reprehensible. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I feel sorry for my colleagues. 
Obviously their conscience has been tricked. 
They have been stung by their own actions, and that is sad. 
What is wrong with using democracy?  
That is not democracy, that is tyranny.  
I point to a situation in Windsor, Ontario which occurred not that long ago. 
The initial vote was 151 to 43 not to have a union. 
That is the type of power that has been given to the industrial relations board. 
It is anti-democratic and it tells me a lot about this government. 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
She was kicked out. 
It is ironic, speaking about democracy. 
They all stand up like hordes of sheep and vote collectively. 
We rarely see those members stand up and vote according to their conscience. 
I have not seen that. 
Have other members seen that?  
Speaking about democracy, there are two faces to democracy. 
Now they are concerned about the workers of Canada.  
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
There are no Tories at all in the room.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
They wanted to call themselves fathers of democracy. 
They are not even distant cousins of democracy. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Obviously this is not a point of order.  
Every day in the House we stand up. 
Nothing is stopping them from doing that. 
This is their true agenda.  
I had an opportunity to listen to debates when public hearings were taking place. 
Frankly, I was ashamed to see that the level of debate had sunk so low. 
What do we call it? 
Is it sugar coated poison? 
This is absolutely terrible.  
They do not believe in it. 
It is not in their philosophy. 
We have a society that works. 
Germany is a perfect model. 
Unions have not bitten anybody's ears.  
Why is there this agenda of being anti-workers? 
I do not know what they think. 
They think we do not know that. 
Of course we do.  
They are trying to say that they are concerned about democracy. 
The bottom line of the agenda is anti-workers. 
Let us not beat around the bush. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We are the exact opposite.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
This is obviously a point of debate and not a point of order.  
Mr. Speaker, the proof is in the pudding. 
They are afraid of hearing the whole argument.  
We are trying to enlighten them by saying that we live in a democracy. 
In a democracy the majority has the right to rule. 
At every single corner they try to block the people of Canada from- 
Maybe this is Liberal democracy.  
I will sit now. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am at a loss for words. 
You always listen very carefully unlike our friends on the other side. 
That is why we have to keep repeating ourselves. 
That is why they are so afraid right now. 
While growing up I belonged to several unions. 
It is not like I am coming out of a vacuum on this matter. 
There are companies that deserve unions. 
I have seen them firsthand.  
I do not know why he would be so interested in having the unions named.  
Everybody is a human being. 
Obviously in society we have both. 
There are other collectivities as we know.  
This is the very essence of democracy. 
It is the right of the individual to choose. 
They do not fully appreciate the fundamental concept of democracy.  
I was in the finance committee this morning. 
We were going through the budget implementation bill clause by clause. 
That is just a load of hooey. 
I have never heard anything more ridiculous in my whole life.  
This is the government's view of democracy.  
Union leaders are not always the noble people they are made out to be. 
That is what this set of amendments is all about. 
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I just wanted a little clarity from the member of the Reform Party. 
Would the member name one or two of these unions? 
It is that simple.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, my point was purely for clarification. 
There were some allegations made in this House and I simply wanted clarification on them.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
We have the right and the freedom to do so. 
The hon. member knows very well that he never had that choice.  
When they have a vote, they count the ballots and then they elect somebody. 
That happens even in the elementary grades.  
I want to deal with thinking that is terribly flawed. 
I have never been introduced to that.  
I have chaired hundreds of meetings. 
What is management interference? 
We have labour on one side; we have management on the other. 
We never hear about labour interference. 
It is always management interference. 
We think it should be a balanced situation.  
We do not believe that 35% constitutes a majority.  
All we are saying is that it should be equal. 
However, this government does not want to do that. 
It does not want to deal with the realities of percentage.  
However, those members never talk about that. 
I am pro-democracy and that is what bothers these people. 
They do not want to look at a balanced scheme for employment.  
However, this is what happens. 
What is the largest petrochemical company in Canada? 
The answer is very simple. 
No, I am not ashamed to say that. 
We in the Reform Party do not believe that. 
However, the member does not believe that. 
That is too bad because that is where we stand. 
That is all we are asking for in this clause.  
What is wrong with that? 
They do not believe that and it is very difficult for us to understand.  
We also believe in individual rights right across the board. 
Go ahead and not believe it. 
That is your privilege. 
We are going to stay with the 50%.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I would ask hon. members to address each other through the Chair. 
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
It can be easily skewed one way or the other. 
I think that is a dangerous direction in which to go.  
No one said that.  
Someone did say that. 
The member at the other end of the House said exactly that. 
This bill has a lot of flaws and a lot of problems. 
The robbing of the democratic process is only one of them. 
This is a bad bill in many ways.  
Motion No. 6 proposes the removal of clause 6 from the legislation. 
My colleagues and I are opposed to the removal of that clause. 
I think this clause is important to the process of streamlining the CIRB's procedures.  
Again, it is a sleight to the democratic process.  
Therefore I think in good conscience I could not support this motion.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The proposed clause ensures that the wishes of the majority are heard and upheld.  
Motion No. 30 calls for the removal of clause 46. 
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or, NDP):
Think of the changes to the workplace since 1978. 
The stability our parents' generation grew up with has evaporated. 
That is a fact that no one can deny. 
Specific aspects of the bill are worthy of special mention.  
Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Bras d'Or has made her point. 
The hon. member from the other end, Blackstrap.  
Mr. Speaker, it is a point well taken, rest assured. 
I meant that it was to my far left.  
One thing struck me as being odd about the member's remarks. 
My wife is a school teacher. 
What it really is doing is affecting innocent third parties far more than anything else. 
It is the innocent producer of the grain who suffers most. 
I am all in favour of negotiation and consultation between unions and management. 
I know that without management, unions cannot exist.  
We all have seen companies that have taken advantage of their employees. 
A few minutes ago I mentioned the grain transportation system.  
September in Saskatchewan is a very important time of year. 
He crossed the picket lines and opened his elevator.  
I take my hat off to these people. 
It was very important and a very critical move by those people.  
There is no question about that. 
They had rather sheepish looks on their faces. 
What happened to that member? 
Those members over there knew that. 
What is more important? 
Why are we here as members of parliament? 
It is fraudulent to forget who elected us.  
We talked a lot about that in the campaign. 
In fact I was thinking about that yesterday. 
A year ago we were involved in a federal election campaign. 
The bottom line is that the people who elect us pay us. 
That very critical point of argument has to be dealt with.  
I will not support the bill the way it stands. 
They may find that the bill has some serious shortcomings.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Bill C-19 will only make that structural problem worse.  
Bill C-19 will ban replacement workers. 
It causes a decrease in the reliance of permanent workers. 
It causes an enormous amount of personal and economic uncertainty for Canadians. 
That is happening more. 
That is an infringement on and a violation of people's individual rights and freedoms. 
It will also cause an increase in union premiums and a decrease in investment. 
It is the members who pay the price.  
If labour costs are increased what happens? 
The employer is forced to increase the price it charges for goods and services. 
This causes a decrease in the competitiveness of that business. 
That causes a decrease in employment in that business. 
This is very serious.  
There are a number of things we can do. 
It is constructive to look at what the United States has recently done. 
In many states right to work legislation has been introduced. 
There are other things we can do that are constructive. 
How can we protect individual workers rights? 
Job advertisements cannot specify union membership.  
Five, make unions responsible for unofficial strikes. 
Unofficial strikers can be dismissed. 
We could establish a commissioner for the protection against unlawful industrial action. 
Hundreds of millions of dollars go into union coffers every year. 
Does anybody know where that money goes? 
Do the workers know where that money goes? 
Right now they do not have that choice at all. 
How can anybody argue with that? 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
We are speaking on the second group of amendments. 
I endorse the work unions have done in that area.  
Looking back through history I have found evidence where workers were not paid properly. 
It had a system that was completely and totally socialized. 
It was the unions. 
I digress a little, however, from the actual topic here.  
It generated media interest that was intense. 
It drew a person in a business suit and labelled them. 
The labels were devastating, two faced, no heart, spineless, gutless.  
They were placed in the position of being called all those things. 
I consider that action to have- 
I know the hon. member would want to comply with that rule.  
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for that timely reminder.  
I could not answer.  
I could list the opportunities. 
It is really quite tough. 
I feel in my heart that they did not want to do that. 
I could not explain it to the journalist. 
Mr. Speaker, I see you getting ready with Beauchesne's. 
I presume that means I should be moving into another area.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Obviously this is not a serious- 
I have corrected the hon. member for Macleod once. 
We would like management and workers to have the proper balance. 
We think it can be improved. 
We have made amendments to do so. 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
We have a concern with the democracy that is not being supported in the legislation. 
We even have young people who are union members. 
This is when employers are being blended. 
I have a problem with the way it is being dealt with. 
That should be automatic; that vote should be required. 
We would like to think that the government is open to those kinds of suggestions. 
However my experience tells me otherwise. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the suggestion. 
Do we have unanimous consent to see the clock as 5.30 p.m.?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Regional development agencies are big business.  
One billion dollars in one year is a major acceleration.  
I will show exactly how they are doing that.  
This wisdom is costly. 
It promotes inefficiency and fails to contribute to the growth of the economy.  
Do we need further evidence? 
But there are additional issues. 
There are two issues here. 
The labyrinth carries on. 
We are concerned here only with three agencies. 
That is a subject for another day.  
It is becoming increasingly difficult. 
The government has not improved the marketplace. 
Instead it competes with the private sector. 
The people in business who need access to capital are not getting it. 
It is time to eliminate them.  
In 1997 the auditor general reviewed those same things and asked what has happened. 
Here are three of the agencies he examined and gave a conclusion on.  
Let us review the history of FedNor.  
Three changes in mandate in nine years. 
Is the focus right now? Will it again be changed before it can be evaluated? 
Was it wrong the first time? 
Is it wrong now? What assurances do we have that it is right now? 
If it keeps getting changed we will never know.  
That is why these changes are such a useful vehicle for patronage, disposal of money. 
The government must be held accountable. 
For that reason if no other they should be scrapped. 
I will go on to the next thing.  
FORD-Q is the biggest spender of them all. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I do not see a quorum. 
I see only three Reform members and no Conservatives.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That was its main purpose.  
In 1997 the auditor general reviewed again to see what had happened. 
As in 1995 we were not able to find support for this assumption''.  
The very purpose for which it was set up was not being met.  
This is an abysmal failure in the way in which that particular agency is run.  
We go beyond that. 
How effective is another group? 
It is supposed to do new things. 
Now they are subsumed under WED.  
The notorious infrastructure was working, but now it is subsumed under WED.  
The community futures program was working. 
It is now under WED. 
What has been the result of all of this? 
In Kelowna the infrastructure program has never been less successful. 
The business development centres do not distribute any more information than they did before.  
What are the results? 
We have an organization. 
And the only jobs that were created on a permanent basis were for the bureaucrats.  
The regional development agencies are not doing what they were set up to do. 
They are costing taxpayers billions of dollars. 
They are duplicating the work of crown corporations. 
They are competing directly with the private sector. 
They are doing the exact opposite of what they should be doing.  
The wisdom is that we should eliminate them. 
There is a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of development agencies.  
I am very proud to be responsible for our regional agencies. 
Let me give members a few reasons for that.  
There are also community futures development corporations, commonly known as CFDCs. 
This goes to show that these centres are not serving only or mostly larger cities. 
Their primary focus is small towns and rural areas.  
I want to tell this House very briefly about some success stories. 
WED is a managing partner in the west. 
WD helps businesses fill in loan applications. 
Loans are administered by financial institutions at arm's length from WD.  
Let me give a concrete example of what this has done.  
It resulted in contracts with Nissan and Toyota. 
It is clear that WD is helping to build a strong economy in the west. 
I have given many examples. 
There are literally hundreds of others.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
Our Reform colleague is suggesting less intervention in the economy. 
It is certain that the rural and isolated areas need help. 
But this duplication of energies and of staff constitutes a problem. 
The federal government will be present because of its need of visibility. 
That was long the case. 
Such agreements are possible, therefore.  
One such one was renewed in the east. 
They have to show their maple leaf. 
This is for visibility. 
We must put an end to this situation.  
However, I will admit one thing. 
Over time, they developed an expertise in regional development. 
Quebec does not get its fair share in regional development funding. 
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
We are finally starting to see the true colours of the Reform Party. 
They will start, as they have shown today, by attacking the most unfortunate.  
They do not see a need to help the unfortunate of this country. 
There has been proof today.  
The Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency creates jobs. 
Not everybody in Atlantic Canada has big bucks to start small businesses. 
There is a need for it. 
The self-employed create jobs in the Atlantic provinces. 
There is the fixed link fund. 
There is a need for follow up. 
There is a need to make sure that the businesses are stable and can survive. 
That is not there right now. 
It is a start at dismantling regional development agencies. 
I was in that bracket. 
That is the part Reformers forget to say. 
It is all in there.  
The Reform Party has it very well laid out. 
It is just the start of it.  
That is how Reformers work. 
I am just showing their true colours. 
I believe that very much.  
My mom and dad have pensions. 
They can have a half decent life. 
It is all there. 
The day we start slashing and slashing, the services will be gone. 
It is very important for Canadians to remember that. 
The motion is showing me exactly what the Reform Party wants to do.  
Those are their buddies.  
Members in the Liberal Party probably have quite a few buddies. 
That is what happens.  
Maybe that would give them a reality check.  
When it comes to ACOA and when it comes to this motion it is disgusting.  
I would also like to say a few words in French. 
We need help starting up and developing small and medium size business. 
This agency is there. 
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Later in 1982 the department evolved into the Department of Regional Industrial Expansion. 
Since its inception ACOA has had a total employment impact of 82,000 jobs. 
Unemployment figures are still too high in Atlantic Canada. 
Unfortunately most aspiring entrepreneurs are incapable of meeting this demand. 
Therefore we cannot support the motion.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Is that to say that none of these programs have worked? 
Of course they have worked but at a cost and inefficiently.  
There have been some suggestions that we should have grants and subsidies. 
Let me just look at a couple of things that have happened. 
Some $11 billion of assistance was authorized over the last 16 years. 
It is not going to the poor people. 
In fact it was almost $1 billion. 
What has the repayment schedule been? 
Very little money has been repaid.  
We need to recognize that some serious questions have to be asked. 
We have no way of evaluating them. 
These are serious questions that have to be asked.  
It is bureaucratic entrepreneurship, and it does not build the economy.  
That is what this was about. 
In this way we will support the private sector.  
Taxpayers spend money better. 
Left in their pockets they will manage their money better. 
That is the principle here. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Yet the minister is comfortable with 60. 
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Everyone has made a very sound contribution to this very important issue.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.35 p.m.)
