Honourable Members of the Senate, 
Members of the House of Commons: 
In my functions, I visit with many units of the Canadian Forces. 
On June 2, 1997, the people of Canada renewed the mandate of the Government. 
More than ever, Canadians want their governments to work together in partnership.  
...For a New Century of Canadian Achievement 
We are poised for success. 
Our citizens have the qualities that are needed to succeed in the21st century: 
We have the values of sharing and mutual help.  
We welcome innovation and new ideas.  
We are an open and democratic society.  
We are a bilingual and multicultural country at a time of increasing globalization.  
Our federation makes the most of these talents. 
We Have Already Built a Foundation for Our Success 
It will balance the budget no later than fiscal year 1998-99.  
One in three Canadian jobs depend on trade. 
Canadians feel better about their own future and the country's future. 
We are looking to our future together with a new optimism. 
Our Challenge for the Future 
Canadians have already set these priorities for this new Parliament. 
These are the Government's priorities.  
Building a Stronger Canada 
The single most important commitment of the Government is to keep Canada united. 
The Government of Canada can have no greater duty or responsibility. 
It will require collaboration and partnership. 
It will require reaching out.  
Canada provides our common space and our common means for realizing our potential. 
A country that invests in its children successfully will have a better future. 
Together we are now building the comprehensive and effective National Child Benefit System.  
We can make a difference in the lives of all our children. 
Investing in Quality Care and Good Health 
The Government will play that role in a spirit of openness, pragmatism and innovation. 
It means responding to emerging issues in health care. 
Working with its partners, the Government will undertake the following initiatives: 
Canadians recognize that good health depends on much more than medical care. 
Our social and economic situations also help to determine the quality of our health. 
Some of the most urgent health problems today are found in Aboriginal communities. 
The Government will work with other partners and Aboriginal communities to: 
Creating Opportunity for Young Canadians 
Today's generation of young Canadians is the best educated in our history. 
No single sector of society nor any one level of government has all the answers. 
Internship programs have been particularly successful in helping young people get started. 
Investing in Knowledge and Creativity 
Support for knowledge goes beyond support for university research. 
Expanding Opportunities in Aboriginal Communities 
strengthen the capacity for good government in Aboriginal communities.  
Canadians both delight in our magnificent environment and fear for its future. 
It is an effort that the Government will make.  
It will also continue to address the serious international problem of overfishing. 
In this same Canadian tradition of internationalism, the Government will undertake the following initiatives: 
It will continue to move forward with reforms to the Canadian military.  
It will continue its campaign for liberalized trade. 
Many Canadians have creative ideas and suggestions for millennium projects. 
Moving Forward into the 21st Century 
By working together, we will build that future.
