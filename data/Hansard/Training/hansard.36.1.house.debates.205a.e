The House met at 11 a.m. 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1999 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
These are the fundamentals of the Canadian economy.  
It reminds me of what John Kenneth Galbraith, the expatriate Canadian economist, once said. 
The Budget Implementation Act addresses the issue of the reinvestment in social transfers. 
Some $3.5 billion of this money is being paid into a trust fund. 
This is more part of the government's Mother Hubbard approach to fiscal policy. 
Canadians need economic stimulus now. Canadians need a better health care system now. 
Last year the government had a vague whiff of a surplus. 
What did it do? 
The fact is the government continues to tinker with the Canadian economy. 
Of course the government tinkers with everything. 
This is a government that ducks the hard issues. 
Bill C-71 also addresses issues of human resource management. 
This is not good human resource management. 
The government continues to try to circumvent legitimate labour management practices. 
It will not use binding arbitration. 
In fact it will be another two years before it even addresses binding arbitration.  
That is clearly inappropriate.  
Madam Speaker, I am splitting my time with the hon. member for Markham.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am afraid that the hon. members' time has expired. 
I was not aware that he was splitting his time.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Julian Reed (Halton, Lib.]):
We were told that it was external influences over which we had no control.  
This government is simply doing its accounting in a different way. 
It is not spending what it does not have. 
I ask him, in all sincerity, if he considers that to be irresponsible.  
Madam Speaker, I think there is some confusion on that side of the House.  
It was an effort that began as early as 1984. 
They need it now and they need significant tax relief now. 
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Although I can understand some of the rhetoric, I challenge the Liberals. 
Is Sherry Cooper an enemy of Canada? 
Does the Liberal Party pollster not want Canada to succeed? 
Let me be clear. 
Canada needs to follow these wise words.  
High taxes hurt our economy and threaten future economic growth. 
In particular, we need to address the heavy tax burden of businesses.  
Corporations are often the target of people frustrated with the economy. 
Let us take a look at the facts about business taxation. 
The first myth is that corporations are getting off scot-free. 
Corporations have not been untouched by the tax collector. 
In short, companies are free to choose where to contribute to a productive economy. 
They are not choosing Canada.  
Let us look at the result of Canada's high corporate tax policies. 
Each of these lost jobs have an impact. 
The person is also not dependent on income security programs. 
It is a simple economic formula. 
The viability and profitability of private enterprises are essential to the Canadian economy. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
This bill is about spending money. 
Today we need to make it clear where the money is coming from. 
This money really comes from Canadians and from the work of Canadians. 
It comes from nurses and teachers. 
We need to keep that in mind.  
This bill is divided into nine parts each dealing with some different aspects of spending. 
The vote on the budget is about the whole budget. 
There were too many bad things in it. 
Parliamentarians now find themselves in a quandary.  
What does this budget say to the average taxpayer? 
Liberal governments are very expensive today, as they have been for the past 30 years. 
That is number one. 
That is a lot of work. 
In other words, 27% of what the government spends is deferred taxes. 
Even that is often wastefully managed. 
This is hardly value for money for today's taxpayer.  
I would like to help us do that.  
Here is another way to look at it. 
By that time we would have walked 5,514 kilometres. 
Each $20 bill is 15.3 centimetres long or about about six inches. 
The total value of those bills would be about $720 million.  
We would need 59 times those bills in order to pay the entire interest. 
What if we were going to the moon? 
The moon is on average 382,000 kilometres from the earth. 
That $50 billion is only about one-twelfth of our national debt.  
It limits our choices both collectively and individually.  
Jeffrey Simpson said ``Debt is the past's dead hand lying on the future''. 
We have mortgaged their future with this debt. 
We were calling for urgent and significant cuts in government spending in 1990. 
In 1995 we did something unprecedented in the House. 
We put out an alternative budget to the government budget. 
Our support for these programs has been consistent in our documents. 
This is unlike the Liberals. 
What were the Liberals doing in the back rooms? 
They were slashing $7 billion from transfers for that program. 
That is what they were doing.  
Canada's birth rate is dropping. 
It is one of the defining features of our country. 
It is a good program, but more can be done.  
There is a lot we do not like in this budget. 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
I would like to ask her a question.  
I would like to ask my colleague what she thinks about that meeting. 
How can we help Beverly Smith bring forward her concerns?  
It is far too important to our country's families.  
Families are so important and so critical. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Jonquiere. 
There are three key elements of particular concern to us.  
It will compel them to rethink their forecasting methods. 
That sort of runs contrary to the objective of the program. 
Quebeckers will have to learn from this.  
This fact is particularly true in a period of surplus. 
The federal government and the provincial governments are enjoying a surplus. 
The second reason is the increase in the child tax benefit. 
Still, the measure is a step in the right direction.  
There is a lack of logic with this approach. 
The federal government should have done more in that regard. 
But there are no such measures in this legislation.  
Many oversights were identified. 
For all these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois will be voting against the bill.  
Madam Speaker, I listened carefully to what the member had to say. 
He mentioned the child tax benefit. 
I think his comment was that it was a step in the right direction.  
It seems this is a serious mistake and a serious fault in logic. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for his intervention.  
I will remind him why the Bloc Quebecois finds the measure unsatisfactory. 
The impact needed to be far greater than that. 
According to the Canadian Council on Social Development: 
Negotiations were held between the provinces and the federal government. 
I think that was a worthwhile measure.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
My speech will deal with four specific points, which I will develop.  
Members opposite are getting all worked up. 
Quebec has the best loans and scholarships system. 
Our program adequately meets the needs of young people. 
That was a year ago. 
He did not want to be outdone. 
For weeks, he laid the groundwork. 
Now we are considering the budget and what do we see? 
What the minister is doing is no small matter. 
Workers and employers contribute to this fund. 
The federal government has not put in one red cent in over ten years.  
Where are the concrete measures in this budget to help them?  
This government has abolished the program especially designed for them, POWA. 
Many of them have never drawn benefits. 
This is an essential measure for them. 
Perhaps the answer is obvious.  
Where are the concrete messages to the middle-class taxpayer? 
Yet there is extreme urgency. 
And what about the elimination of 5,000 contaminated sites? 
Where is the money to get started on decontamination?  
What about highway rehabilitation? 
Where is the funding for this? 
It is always tomorrow, tomorrow, later, later. 
We see no willingness to act in this budget.  
Where is the money for this year? 
Another matter dear to my heart is regional development. 
I think this can be said of the Liberals. 
Find the discrepancies between the words and the figures.  
Canadians are not fooled. 
They know the real story, not what the government would have them believe.  
The final cost will be $1.4 billion over three years. 
What is the word for this? 
But I say to the Minister of Finance that it is not too late. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the hon. member for Jonquiere for her good speech. 
Would it not have been appropriate to include such initiatives in the budget?  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:
Mr. Speaker, let me first thank my Bloc Quebecois colleague.  
We will be very pleased to hear all their suggestions.  
It is not true that this issue is really a priority for the government. 
The government is not providing proactive measures for this group of citizens. 
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
The budget sets out a road map for the government. 
The budget did many things and omitted many things. 
That is a priority which is askew.  
There is nothing to address the unfair tax system. 
This hardly addresses the problem. 
It seems to make the problem worse.  
There are other things too. 
The more we make the better off we will be. 
The government made much of the budget being a health care budget. 
Only a couple of provinces have been able to fill that gap.  
What is the response of the Liberal government? 
There is nothing for child care. 
Again this is holding people back rather than enabling them to move forward.  
I mentioned the problems of our tax system and how unfair it is. 
There is nothing to address this concern. 
This is not something many people would be proud of.  
There is nothing in the budget for them.  
That is to be regretted.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC)]:
Then we could have a more vibrant private sector that would increase revenues. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the member's earlier comments. 
Of course I regard him as a friend as well.  
The point the member makes is an interesting one. 
There is no panacea to tax cuts as an instrument of ensuring economic success.  
Health care is perhaps the greatest example of this. 
Canadians deserve tax cuts. 
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about tax cuts. 
We pay the highest.  
We do not have that in this country. 
Those are the two leading economies in the entire country. 
They are not getting good value for their money. 
That support, no matter what the Reform Party says, is there. 
It is there solidly and it will not go away.  
Madam Speaker, I wish to seek consent for the following motion: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House to proceed?  
Mr. Richard M. Harris:
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
There is not consent at this time, so the House will resume debate.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
I will start by quoting from today's morning smile in The Globe and Mail . 
A small fee for cleaning. 
That is the livelihood of that small businessman. 
That sign talks about the economic conditions in this country.  
It is not a pretty picture.  
Canadians have been complaining for years, but the government has not listened to them. 
We have to know what is this burden. 
He asked me a very simple question. 
I asked the same question. 
What is happening to them now? 
These individuals run small trucking and cleaning firms. 
They also hire people to provide services on a subcontractual basis. 
It is not easy for them. 
They work long, hard hours. 
They make a small income, enough to provide the basics for their families.  
They say ``Sorry, but you have to pay EI. 
We do not accept these people as being subcontractors''. 
To make matters, worse it is backdated. 
Suddenly a successful business is facing a crisis. 
In the end it costs us more. 
Something needs to be done. 
Unfortunately this year's budget contains precious little for Canadians to smile about.  
Let me quote what some economists and tax experts are saying. 
``Our taxes are snuffing out innovation, investment and entrepreneurial spirit''. 
It seems to me that we cannot get the Liberal government off our backs.  
This year's federal budget does not address many issues. 
It was the usual pay more and receive less budget. 
There is the Ontario government. 
It is the first provincial government to do that. 
These figures are from Statistics Canada.  
Personal savings per taxpayer have fallen to an all-time low. 
The costs of social programs will rise dramatically early in the 21st century. 
Where has this budget failed on social programs? 
People work harder and pay more income tax. 
What have we gained? 
Can we trust that promise? 
The government's budget has been totally silent on homelessness. 
Unfortunately Canadians have nothing to smile about.  
The productivity gap is growing. 
The government's own minister talked about it. 
As a matter of fact the ministers are fighting over the issue. 
The government has reduced opportunities for many.  
Madam Speaker, I listened with some interest to what the member had to say.  
In my riding poor families looked forward to this with great anticipation. 
As a result there was no change in their income.  
Nevertheless, there was no change in the income of the impoverished families and children. 
The member represents a riding in Alberta. 
Madam Speaker, I am very happy to answer the hon. member's question.  
I will dwell on the first point, the child tax benefit. 
I tell him it is not in this budget. 
The member talked about his constituency and what it was looking for. 
The member in his second question talked about Alberta. 
That was one of the best things the Government of Alberta did. 
This government could learn from Alberta.  
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for bringing that point up.  
I have given members examples in my speech. 
They should look at those examples. 
They are real Canadians who are suffering. 
The government is sending them into bankruptcy. 
The government must get off the backs of Canadians.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I must interrupt the member. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the member for his very important question. 
I agree with him. 
I concur with the hon. member that this is an absolutely important issue. 
We know that the government has yet to do something about that.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
This budget is disappointing, for two reasons. 
First, the government failed to deal with the right priorities. 
What would they have been? 
The fight against poverty, naturally. 
There have never been so many poor in Canada. 
What is the government doing about this problem? 
It was one of the most interfering governments.  
I see the Liberals smiling. 
As they say, the fool laughs and the sage smiles. 
There is no lack of smiles on the other side of the House. 
They just waded in to do their dirty work, with no hesitation whatsoever. 
I will give some examples of this. 
At present, the federal government has a lot of money. 
Our population is aging, and seniors are living longer. 
The government will spend $25 million on this over a 10 year period. 
Of course, this excludes a good half of the membership here.  
I will give the example of the Montreal convention centre. 
Montreal is an international city, and a hub for the tourist industry. 
Now we must pay for this expansion. 
The Government of Canada owes Quebec exactly $58 billion. 
We would appreciate payment in the next few weeks.  
If the Bloc Quebecois were not here in Ottawa, who would represent Quebec's interests? 
We are still waiting for our $1 billion. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member- 
Madam Speaker, I had 20 minutes, not 10. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I was given to understand the hon. member would be sharing his time. 
We all need a little encouragement in this House.  
There are overdue payments with regard to the ice storm:
When will the Liberals play fair with the Quebec government? 
That is the question.  
We could talk about Oka. 
The Erasmus commission urged the government to do the same. 
She is like a breath of fresh air in an all too dreary situation.  
What has happened since that speech from the throne? 
Nothing happened in the case of the Government of Quebec. 
You will not believe what I am about to say. 
I would like to address my comments to all Liberal members. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
There are, of course, many causes of poverty. 
There is the matter of housing, the matter of outdated skills. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
What is social condition? 
Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):
I wonder whether the member could speak to us about that a bit.  
It is about telling the truth. 
The member may find it old hat to talk about poverty. 
The member is right. 
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, we have been listening to the Liberal spin on the budget since February. 
The fact is there are two stories. 
That is their story. 
At the same time Canadians are getting less health care. 
His nose is growing.  
Mr. Richard M. Harris:
I can hear them squealing over there. 
The truth really hurts.  
That is what this Liberal government wants Canadians to feel good about.  
That is the Liberal story.  
Here is the real story. 
Here is another one the Liberals will not tell us about. 
Is this the real story? 
That is the Liberal story. 
Here are the facts. 
Why have we seen our health care cut? 
Why have we seen these high taxes? 
What could we do with that kind of money, $42.5 billion? 
We could probably fund the entire health care system for about three years. 
The Liberals will increase spending by $7.6 billion.  
Let me say those numbers again. 
I could go on. 
Let us look at this one. 
The fact is we want our brightest and our best to stay in this country. 
They are going to spend $400 million. 
Here is the real story. 
They have continuously been asking our troops to do more with less. 
Of course, my colleague, you still have time left. 
I understand there are going to be questions and comments. 
THE LATE SENATOR PAUL DAVID 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the humanitarian situation in Kosovo is a catastrophe. 
They are trained, they are prepared, they are ready to serve.  
THE LATE OMER DESLAURIERS 
Mr. Reginald Belair (Timmins-James Bay, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Ontario Francophonie lost one of its greatest champions.  
French Ontario has lost a remarkable spokesperson. 
It goes without saying that he will be missed.  
I want to extend my most sincere condolences to his family.  
Mr. Ian Murray (Lanark-Carleton, Lib.):
Canadians have been shocked and numbed by this awful event. 
One brief eruption of madness has caused your lives to be changed forever. 
They are demonstrating tremendous courage and selflessness.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
THE LATE JACQUES GIRARD 
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
Mr. Girard succeeded Pierre-F. 
Mr. Girard was devoted to the democratic process. 
We extend our deepest condolences to the members of his family.  
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
I congratulate the GRCA on its ongoing success.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia, Lib.):
The response to this initiative was overwhelming. 
I look forward to our future visits to Saskatchewan, Alberta and B.C. 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):
Break a leg, as they say.  
THE LATE JACQUES GIRARD 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
MEMBER FOR WHITBY-AJAX 
Mrs. Judi Longfield (Whitby-Ajax, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, fellow members of parliament, I am back.  
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
The following people and organizations were honoured for their contributions:
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Does the government support these statements? 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
There was a resolution to that effect. 
This is one of the problems we are having with Milosevic and his government. 
In the meantime the government in Belgrade is run by Milosevic. 
That is the government which exists at this moment in that country. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
They have been there a long time. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Is the government considering sending Canadian ground forces into Kosovo?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
It is the number one concern of the military. 
It is the number one concern of the official opposition.  
Again my question is for the Prime Minister. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have replied to that question. 
We are not considering such a move at all at this moment.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are acting in concert with other countries.  
Our plan is to continue with the bombing. 
We must stick with this course of action.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, as the Prime Minister has said, we have one plan. 
We have an air campaign. 
We believe that the air campaign will work. 
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I invite the minister to listen carefully to my question. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Our ambassador in New York has been active. 
I have written to Mr. Yeltsin to that effect. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
He does not want to do that. 
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
This is the practice we have followed since we first formed the government. 
We have always had this sort of debate.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister should check his facts. 
What parliament needs is to speak officially. 
What is going on in Kosovo is serious.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
That is not true.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
They should resolve their problems and then come back to the House.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have developed a system that is working very well. 
We have consulted more departments. 
We have established this route. 
We are not there. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
I ask the Prime Minister again:
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We are not faced with that situation. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Then, there is the issue of Kosovo's political status. 
Kosovo enjoyed a high degree of autonomy until President Milosevic took it away in 1989. 
What will the political solution be? 
We are prepared to look at every option.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
I do not understand what the problem is. 
This is the most democratic Chamber in the country. 
Why is the Prime Minister refusing to allow this issue to be considered? 
Why is the Prime Minister refusing?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I said that at the beginning and there will be a debate.  
That is the goal of the government.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
A responsible government would show somehow that it is committed to democracy.  
Will he make that commitment?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
That is the debate we are having today. 
I can see the members of the opposition do not want to debate that. 
What they want to debate is a situation we do not wish to see occur. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
We do not want to be in that situation again- 
The right hon. Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have to repeat that they are asking a hypothetical question. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
It was very well done indeed.  
The process of building Nunavut has only just begun. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
The Prime Minister keeps saying he will do this or he may do that. 
Will he commit to that?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Saint-Maurice, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. members are all asking hypothetical questions.  
I said that I hope we will never be confronted with that situation. 
I want to make sure that the House is very united. 
On this issue we have been very united. 
At the same time, it will not be supporting- 
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Demonstrating democracy is a strength, not a weakness.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We are having the debate today.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
The opposition can have it.  
The Government of Canada has made commitments of a certain position to the allies. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my supplementary question is for the same minister.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
That is what is important. 
We need a military force there to ensure it. 
I believe we need a NATO led military force. 
That is the position of NATO.  
Can the United Nations help to resolve this problem? 
Can other countries help to resolve this problem? 
Yes, and I hope they would.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
My question is for the Minister of National Defence. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
We want the ethnic cleansing to stop and the atrocities to stop. 
That is why we are there with the air campaign. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Additional resources are being put there. 
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
That is why a conference was held on pharmacare.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We do not want to send ground troops. 
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have not yet reached that point. 
Troops will be sent and Canada will want to participate. 
We hope it will be under the aegis of the United Nations. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Will the Prime Minister give us this undertaking today?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
We will focus on that.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
That is not open to question.  
What is this government so afraid of? 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We made an agreement with the opposition to have more debates on that. 
Let us deal with the problem we are confronted with today. 
We want the air strike to work. 
The hon. member for Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans.  
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
However, the question is a purely hypothetical one at this point.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the right hon. Prime Minister.  
No one is asking for a premature debate on ground forces. 
No one is asking to debate hypothetical situations. 
We are just asking for a vote. 
We vote on all kinds of things in this place. 
We just want a vote on that, should it come to it.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are having a debate. 
I do not know.  
I said that I would seriously consider a vote at that time. 
I do not want to create an impression that we have divisions in Canada. 
If members want to vote they can do it tomorrow morning if they want. 
I thought the leaders of the parties were speaking for their parties. 
That is the way the government and parliament operate. 
The hon. member for St. John's East.  
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
That cost was put at roughly $100 million.  
Would the minister be a little more clear? 
Mr. Speaker, we have already responded. 
We have committed $22 million. 
We will continue to respond and work at the multilateral and bilateral levels. 
That would bring to a close our question period for today.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would seek unanimous consent for the following motion: 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
That is a statement and not a point of order. 
Does the hon. government House leader have permission to put the motion?  
And fewer than 25 members having risen: 
Fewer than 25 members having risen, the motion is adopted.  
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I wish also to salute the opposition parties in the House. 
Their constructive approach and their non-partisan attitude have been important examples to Canadians.  
These values must always guide our decisions at home and abroad.  
Who broke the agreements with moderate Kosovar leaders. 
By the time the talks collapsed, there were 100,000 more. 
All this before NATO took action. 
All this part of an obvious plan, and a clear, proven pattern.  
The international community made every reasonable effort to find a diplomatic solution. 
Scores of diplomatic missions were sent to Belgrade. 
The peace conference in Rambouillet was held. 
The Kosovars demonstrated courage by signing a compromise agreement. 
Only the Yugoslav President remained intransigent. 
Finally, Ambassador Holbrooke made the final appeals in Belgrade, face to face with Mr. Milosevic.  
Our goals now are what they were then. 
It will not happen overnight. 
It is important to understand that Canada is not acting alone. 
No one country can decide alone on operations or tactics. 
We are members of a team. 
We are contributing to a collective effort. 
And decisions are made collectively.  
Their pride in what they are doing for Canada was obvious. 
The conflict in Kosovo is a depressing reminder of the past. 
Toll-free telephone lines and faxes are being flooded with offers of help. 
They deserve our deep gratitude and thanks too. 
That is not how Canadians do things. 
What is going on there has to stop. 
We have an occasion to tell the government in Belgrade that this will stop. 
The homes of the people of Kosovo are there. 
They have the right to their freedom. 
There will now be a 10 minute question and answer period. 
I am going to limit the questions and the answers to one minute each.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
I am sure the Prime Minister would not want to repeat that mistake.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
Everybody will be recorded. 
Somebody could just get up and say I agree and sit back.  
I am just sad that he wants to formalize it in a different way. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
Mr. Speaker, we are not sending ground troops. 
If you prefer this arrangement, we will consider it. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
Mr. Speaker, I do not see a disagreement. 
That is why I referred to an international group. 
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Mr. Speaker, we often hear the Prime Minister talk about ethnic cleansing. 
We should no longer call it ethnic cleansing, but genocide.  
Often, the solution to genocide is war. 
Genocide is the worst crime against humanity.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
I should have said ethnic cleansing.  
We want these people to stand trial before the tribunal in The Hague. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
We went to Bosnia and became a police force. 
Now we are in Kosovo as a police force. 
It seems the original purpose of NATO was to be a defence mechanism. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
After that we sent some troops as peacekeepers. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
This initiative is from the Bloc Quebecois.  
This is what we want to know.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
Mr. Speaker, this is a purely academic issue at this point.  
There is absolutely no question- 
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
What is it we hope to achieve politically and militarily? 
This is the one issue on which there is universal agreement. 
This is the moral objective. 
The importance and urgency of pursuing it cannot be overemphasized.  
Or is NATO and our government now inclining toward supporting an independent Kosovo? 
If so, would Kosovo be partitioned? 
Would a UN or NATO patrolled safe haven be established? 
The motion before us is completely silent on this subject. 
The Prime Minister has not elaborated on that subject today. 
In fact he has tried to avoid it. 
That is the whole purpose of the military operation in the Balkans.  
Where does Canada stand? 
Where does the government and parliament stand?  
Our land forces have been especially neglected. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
That is part of the democratic process.  
I do not think that is unreasonable. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
My question is for the leader of the official opposition. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question.  
I suggest that the two options are not mutually exclusive. 
The two issues fit together.  
That would be the hope of every member in this House. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Obviously the current situation is critical. 
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Some of the concerns which he has are shared by all members of the House.  
It is a motherhood motion. 
We know what the vote would be without taking it. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the Leader of the Opposition for his comments.  
That is my understanding.  
The prime minister mentioned that he had written to the President of Russia. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
He has a unique opportunity to decide what the House will do tomorrow. 
This would have been more effective.  
Mr. Speaker, I have answered that question before.  
This is not a vote of non-confidence in the government. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
In this case, we got better information from RDI and CNN.  
The Serb aggression is unacceptable. 
It is simply an attempt to rewrite history.  
How can we achieve that? 
This could be done in two stages.  
So, this is a step in the right direction. 
The hon. member for Toronto Centre-Rosedale.  
Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre-Rosedale, Lib.):
The hon. leader of the Bloc Quebecois.  
That was obviously one drawback.  
We were asked if we had any questions.  
Mrs. McLaughlin, who was then leader of the NDP, accepted the invitation. 
Right now, this information is not available. 
We go after it- 
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. leader of the Bloc Quebecois. 
The member for Richmond-Arthabaska for questions and comments.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
It is an extremely important issue. 
There is a lack of information. 
We cannot be convinced of anything because we do not have the necessary information.  
During the first week of the conflict, I received one phone call a day. 
I was asked if I had watched the news on CNN. 
That is where the information came from. 
During the second week, I received one call every two or three days. 
During the third week, I received one call every four days. 
It has now been six days since I last received a call.  
How can I keep my staff informed? 
How can my staff keep my constituents informed?  
Let us get back to the information issue, which I think is a major issue. 
We just came back here today, and so did our counterparts in Washington.  
I say to him that he is weakening the position by not providing information.  
Those who are informed provide better support than those who are not. 
There is a lesson in that. 
This would strengthen Canada's position. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Here too, innocent civilians are losing their homes, their neighbourhoods and their lives.  
How did we get here? 
How did we get to this terrible place?  
The United Nations Security Council failed to act.  
To sit by and do nothing was simply not an option.  
As Tommy Douglas said about World War II: 
Not all Canadians support armed intervention. 
My caucus colleagues and I understand and respect such views. 
The government decided to focus only on military action. 
The Milosevic regime may refuse all diplomatic and political overtures. 
The objectives of the air campaign were imprecise and not achieved. 
In fact, the humanitarian crisis was worsened as the result of the air strikes.  
There is another reaction to this hypocrisy, a more hopeful one. 
We have to work at finding new ways of resolving conflicts in a peaceful manner. 
Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre-Rosedale, Lib.):
What precisely does she say we should have done? 
What has been said is we failed to pursue every diplomatic initiative. 
What else could we have concretely done? 
What would she have diplomatically pursued if she were in our place? 
How can she help the House?  
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Mr. Speaker, for all intents and purposes, Canada is at war. 
Canadian pilots are dropping bombs. 
People are being killed. 
I want to carefully restate that.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
They can only be explored if we can get to the negotiating table. 
We have to get to the table.  
It is absolutely critical for us to recognize that we have to move forward. 
We have to try every single possible avenue to reach a negotiated and peaceful settlement. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
War is not familiar to those of my generation. 
Sadly we find the atrocities of Kosovo dominating our mass media. 
Canadians have a proud record of international military service. 
His leadership helped define Canada's place on the world stage.  
The choices at times like this are never simple. 
Innocent people were being killed before the intervention, as they are now. 
With stakes this high, this real, it was incumbent upon NATO and Canada to act.  
And we did not fear consultation with parliament.  
Our foreign policy should not shrink from the world around us.  
We cannot forget that. 
Scores of Canadian soldiers were taken hostage in retaliation.  
First, there should be clear political agreement on objectives.  
Third, military action would have to be appropriate to the circumstances.  
Finally, due regard must be given to the disengagement scenario prior to deeper involvement.  
When will the NATO bombing campaign end? 
What is the criteria for any potential decision to employ ground troops? 
This is the American view. 
What is the Canadian government's view on these important issues? 
We have taken this path before. 
It has been said that the history of the Balkans always repeats itself. 
Thus far these repetitions have been nothing but bloody and tragic. 
However, we must not assume that reconciliation in this region is still impossible. 
The Chair will take the amendment to the amendment under advisement for a few moments.  
I just want to set the hon. member's mind correct. 
The House was not recalled.  
He talks about a vote. 
I remember that being a very major point. 
If my memory serves me correctly, the vote was on the UN resolution.  
I agree that the timeliness of the vote is important.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member, but the question is too long.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my learned friend for the comment. 
It is certainly something that might be examined as to modifying the existing act.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his intervention. 
There will be very little in the way of meaningful exchange. 
There will be very few ministers present. 
The Prime Minister will not be here. 
This is an instance where it should happen.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
He is here right now in the Chamber.  
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
The hon. member for Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
I respect his opinion.  
Certainly we are concerned.  
Perhaps they should have. 
I respectfully submit that is the way it should continue.  
The Chair is prepared to rule on the admissibility of the proposed amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Accordingly amendments are amendments. 
There is nothing contrary or repugnant to the main motion. 
They seek to amend it and clarify its terms. 
Accordingly the Chair has held them to be in order.  
Indeed it is common practice.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a further point of order in light of your comments. 
How do we dispose of it if we cannot vote?  
That is the short answer to your question.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
I find its complaints today to be absolutely groundless.  
Moreover, the House has debated the situation on two occasions prior to today in February. 
I looked at the notes. 
He continually broke his promises.  
I assure all Canadians that our objectives are clear. 
The NATO air campaign is now in its 20th day. 
NATO is engaged in a very deliberate and carefully planned air operation. 
Two conclusions should be drawn from these actions. 
First, our air campaign is having the intended effect. 
They are facing the dangers and the challenges of a military operation.  
Let there be no doubt where this government stands. 
We stand by them as well.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
These questions beg to be asked. 
First, we would like to know what this government is actually doing. 
Can it tell us how it is preparing? 
What sorts of circumstances is it planning for? 
There is a difference between those two roles.  
We need to know about the equipment that Canadians will be taking with them. 
Do they have what they need to get the job done? 
Will they be protected to the greatest extent possible by the use of that equipment? 
What other plans would the military enact to ensure that protection?  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I do not know what the hon. member is proposing. 
How many minutes is he proposing to extend it by? 
Perhaps he could clarify that.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
An extra 15 minutes, Mr. Speaker. 
Is it agreed to extend the time for an extra 15 minutes?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:
They would come from our base in Edmonton. 
They are, as our troops are expected to be, fully combat capable. 
They are able to deal with a range of conditions. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
I would like to hear the minister's view on this.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:
The military equipment being deployed is the CF-18 jet fighters, 12 of them. 
They are used frequently in carrying out the air campaign. 
They are well equipped. 
I might add that that is an important factor. 
They have been able to carry out their missions quite well. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
I remember all the efforts made by the former Prime Minister- 
I am sorry, but the hon. member's time has expired.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:
The Prime Minister has appropriately answered the question with respect to a vote.  
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
And we see their despair daily.  
This action was necessary because of the risks to which the refugees were exposed. 
Canada's legislation makes provision for such situations. 
The situation, I repeat, is in constant evolution. 
In the event the UNHCR decides to proceed with an emergency evacuation we are ready. 
Canada has a proud humanitarian tradition. 
Our partnerships at various levels have been the key to success in this initiative. 
They too have worked together and prepared to welcome refugees.  
We have received more than 7,000 calls and 1,000 faxes. 
Canada is a caring society. 
Compassion is a strong element of our national character. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Perhaps it could be extended to 10 minutes.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
They have offered to open their homes and their lives to refugees. 
That shows a generosity that is quite amazing in fact. 
It has left a very positive impression on me.  
I have a couple of questions for the minister. 
There is some concern in that regard.  
Mr. Speaker, I recognize the fear the Reform Party has of criminals all the time. 
We are here to speak about the help we can give them.  
It is clear that we will act in co-operation with the UNHCR. 
We have always done so in the past. 
When there is an international crisis we work with the UNHCR. 
It is the expert in the field. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, here is my question for the minister.  
I ask the hon. member to address his comments to the Chair. 
The hon. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
I know that he and the Prime Minister are both students of history. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
We stand united with NATO. 
Canada has several responsibilities in this crisis. 
Canadians will not tolerate that.  
Canada also has a responsibility to our NATO allies. 
Canada also has an historic responsibility to restore peace through diplomatic means. 
We also have a responsibility to our troops and their families. 
The government has a responsibility to put all the facts on the table. 
Canadians should be proud of their troops. 
They have shown a tremendous degree of professionalism and confidence. 
On behalf of the official opposition I congratulate them on a job well done.  
As I said earlier, our position is clear on this. 
We called for this debate for two reasons. 
There are a number of obvious questions raised by this crisis that need answers. 
We want to know that.  
We would like to know if this has changed the government's goals. 
Has the government changed its objectives since the beginning of the campaign? 
Are there projected timelines for Canadian participation? 
Are there anticipated roles for our troops? 
These questions beg to be answered. 
Are our troops outfitted with the equipment they need to do the job? 
Have these concerns been addressed?  
Let me elaborate on some of my earlier questions for the government. 
Has the government's role changed? 
Does the government have other plans? 
Does the foreign affairs minister have another agenda? 
We should know these things before more Canadian troops are committed. 
What are the expected time lines? 
Does the government have any idea how long Canadians will be committed? 
All of this depends on the government's goals. 
Does the government have a particular role in mind for our troops? 
I previously put a question to the minister after his presentation. 
We need to know about the equipment the Canadians will be taking with them. 
I understand there are some Griffon helicopters. 
Do they have what they need to get the job done? 
Will they be protected to the greatest extent possible?  
The men and women of the Canadian forces are well trained. 
They are brave beyond words. 
They are very professional. 
I want to be assured that the government knows what it is doing.  
I think we all hope that this will be a similar case.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
This is a unique experience, Mr. Speaker. 
I get to ask the defence critic a question.  
I want to also assure him that there are no commitments. 
I can assure him that is not the case.  
I want to ask the member a question. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for his questions.  
I certainly agree that is the place to start. 
That was our point right from the beginning.  
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Mr. Speaker, I have two quick questions.  
Mr. Speaker, the member speaks of an exit strategy. 
That is a major concern for me.  
We have to rely very much on the presence of our allies to do that. 
Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to what the member had to say. 
We know he has the interests of the armed forces very much at heart.  
What will that do? 
There is nothing hypothetical about that. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
In fact, it is an influential entity. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
One cannot be done without the other in many respects. 
We wasted no time to put it to work. 
Some members of the verification mission are now supporting humanitarian efforts. 
For example, civilian observers are helping to register refugees in the camps.  
I was remiss when I began my remarks. 
As we all know, the refugees' situation has reached tragic proportions. 
By the accounts of executions and torture. 
And we think of the children who have witnessed scenes of unbearable violence.  
These refugees can count on our compassion and our humanitarian assistance. 
I am particularly concerned by the information we are getting about their situation. 
Right now, information is sketchy and sometimes contradictory. 
We are hearing about thousands of people trapped in the mountains. 
We are even hearing about massacres, although we are unable to verify this. 
To date, Canada has provided $22 million. 
And let us not forget the generosity shown by Canadians. 
I want to extend my warmest thanks to them, here, today.  
Canada is one player. 
Team work is also crucial within Canada. 
We will continue to adapt our assistance to the situation. 
Even now we are in contact with other donor countries and multilateral organizations. 
Canada has been a lead supporter of the tribunal. 
We were there with humanitarian assistance and observers before. 
We are responding to the basic needs of refugees now. 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
I also thank the minister for having contact with the NGOs.  
We have already spent $22 million in trying to alleviate suffering. 
What does the hon. minister anticipate? 
It was just an estimate. 
I cannot say how much more it will cost. 
I know we will be doing more than we have done so far.  
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this debate. 
Bringing refugees over as they are undocumented would be a nightmare. 
They live in a terrible purgatory.  
It is not an easy task but together we are making a difference. 
My reports indicate that for the most part the camps are now better organized. 
Food is getting to the people. 
Canada will definitely do its share as a caring nation.  
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
I am wondering if the minister could spend a couple of minutes answering my question. 
They are the people we work with who are present in the area. 
We only transport those things that are asked for. 
We try to get the best price for everything.  
Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
We are witnessing intense images of horrendous suffering by the Kosovar people. 
Let us recognize the turn in the road we have taken. 
We have entered a considerably more destabilized international landscape. 
We must look very seriously at the consequences of this military action. 
Are we redefining our foreign policy strategies? 
The violation of human security in Kosovo is unacceptable. 
The total lack of regard for the rule of law is unacceptable. 
These are leaders for whom power is the arbiter, not the law. 
We were hosted by Yugoslavian lawyers. 
As Dylan maintained, God was on no warrior's side.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to what my colleague said. 
I was quite moved by many of the comments she made. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member opposite for his question. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, it is obvious how very moved my colleague across the floor is.  
Mr. Speaker, that is a good question. 
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Are we going to commit our young people to a ground intervention in Kosovo?  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.  
We are members of NATO. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
So far in this debate, we have had few answers to our questions. 
We have once again called the government on this question today.  
Intensifying bombing did nothing to stop the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. 
Therefore air strikes have their limits. 
A plane cannot differentiate a Serb soldier from a Kosovar passer-by. 
There has been a Crown prerogative in this area for long enough. 
Why break people's hearts 
Why strike down love 
While the drumbeat rolls?  
Who have done no wrong?  
Why is there always 
A country at war?  
Why can there not be 
Why do you fight 
Why all these bombs 
And these thousands of graves?  
Sometimes, too often in fact, because of cowardice. 
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
The two are incompatible.  
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
I think we underestimated that. 
Under these circumstances, we must anticipate, or at least consider, ground military action.  
The hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Solicitor General for a brief question.  
Mr. Speaker, on a point of order.  
I would ask that you give me the chance to do so too.  
It will be a 30-second question, and the answer will be just as short.  
This kind of operation is not a matter of hours. 
I have a hard time understanding the logic of it all.  
That would justify the dispatch of ground troops.  
Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):
It is a pleasure for me to take part in this debate this evening. 
Kosovo is a region that demands our attention. 
It has historically been subjected to many different types of conflict. 
Conflict has plagued Kosovo for hundreds of years. 
Time does not allow me to chronicle the history.  
At this time the Kosovars collaborated with the fascist state. 
Kosovo saw little stability in this period. 
Under the communists, Kosovars were still oppressed. 
Clearly the voices of Kosovars were not heard.  
Oppression of individual liberties is the hallmark of the communist regime. 
It was only 24 hours ago when women and children were raped and murdered. 
It is the present. 
NATO acted quickly in Bosnia. 
In 1992 a terrible conflict exploded in Bosnia-Hercegovina. 
In 1993 this monitoring shifted to enforcement. 
The operation was a success. 
NATO had an objective in Bosnia and it reached it. 
We have an objective in Kosovo and we must reach it too. 
The international community was quick to unanimously condemn this act of mass murder. 
We need action, not words. 
Acting is what we are doing.  
Following this massacre, Serb forces entered the village of Racak. 
This is absolute madness. 
How can we not support NATO air strikes? 
No, I think not.  
Our air campaign will allow us to meet this objective. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the hon. member for Hillsborough for his very articulate remarks. 
My question that I would direct to the hon. member is along these lines.  
I know the hon. member was present for the remarks made by the Prime Minister. 
I can think of none.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his remarks and his question.  
This is an ongoing debate among all parliamentarians. 
One does not want to lay one's cards out on the table. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Perhaps the hon. member for Hillsborough is a bit confused. 
We recognize that decision will be made at some time in the future. 
I am convinced that the air strikes will do the job. 
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
Why were we so unprepared to look after the refugees? 
We are putting up millions of dollars. 
We are sending people in to look after the refugees. 
We have offered to bring the refugees to Canada. 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
I had posed some questions to opposition parties during the first debate. 
We do not actually need a vote. 
Sometimes we get more consensus the other way.  
They are still there against Germany and Japan but they are anachronisms.  
That is explicit in Chapter VIII of the charter. 
Russia or China are the ones that have been fingered.  
I think that is a useful precedent. 
Admittedly it has some difficult antecedents. 
That is generally considered anachronistic. 
It could even be put under U.S. command. 
That would be the best and most productive way to proceed.  
I would also suggest the use of the world court. 
I listened carefully to the member for Beauharnois-Salaberry. 
I would also like to get a ruling on the limitations as to aerial bombardment. 
Why do I speak of law? 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Why are we not intervening, for example, in East Timor? 
What would happen if an altercation occurred between China and Taiwan? 
What would happen in the Basque? 
What authority is there?  
Surely, as a professor on this topic, he undoubtedly has some thoughts on this. 
It is even more limited than the normal regional security organization.  
We have been arguing for a reform of the security council. 
Mr. Gerard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):
How many women will be raped and killed while we have this debate tonight? 
How many seniors will die?  
How far will we have to go?  
There are only four planes, I think.  
Of course, we have no control over the rules of the game. 
But we must ask whether NATO is adapted to today's reality. 
That is the key question, in my view. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Therefore, we would have its co-operation.  
I am not sure that the OSCE is the answer. 
I would say that we should go back to the general assembly.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I value the opportunity to participate in this very important and significant debate. 
I listened with interest to the Conservative questioners. 
Today, 19 days later, where are we? 
What have they come up with in terms of new approaches and a new strategy? 
They have decided to continue the air attacks. 
Continue, keep going, make them even stronger.  
Their villages continue to be burned and they continue to be raped. 
Why bomb a Yugoslavian car plant which also involved the killing of innocent civilians?  
There is fear and uncertainty in not knowing what is happening to them.  
With those two conditions accomplished there would be a return to the table.  
That is fatal to any significant negotiated agreement in this area.  
It has been effectively sidelined, silenced and shut out. 
It proposed a G-8 meeting. 
We understand that may happen and we welcome that. 
What form will Kosovo take after negotiations? 
It is very difficult to say. 
There again, Rambouillet is likely a dead letter. 
We called for a special emergency meeting of the United Nations General Assembly. 
Once again, we are appealing for that.  
I am splitting my time, Mr. Speaker. 
I have a couple of minutes left, so I will try to be brief.  
NATO is clearly not the answer. 
There is a double standard in NATO's approach. 
It is silent, for example, on the appalling situation of the Kurds in Turkey. 
Then there is the approach taken by the United States within NATO. 
I want to again note our thanks to those groups- 
Perhaps in the questions and comments you could mention them. 
I will now entertain questions and comments.  
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
Early in the fall we passed another resolution. 
At the security council we had stoppage and intransigence.  
However, there have been some helpful signs, some from unexpected quarters. 
Russia has given some indication of wanting to involve itself in negotiations. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson:
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
Mr. Svend J. Robinson:
Certainly we could look within the umbrella of the United Nations. 
That is what our leader has called for today. 
That is what we are repeating at this time. 
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Mr. Svend J. Robinson:
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
It was a struggle. 
They talked about the legality of the action being taken. 
We talk about ethnic cleansing. 
I know many members use that phrase, including members of my caucus. 
I suggest that we are not dealing with ethnic cleansing. 
We wash our cars because they are dirty. 
We scrub our floors because they are dirty. 
We wash our hands because they are dirty. 
We try to cleanse these things. 
It is crime against humanity. 
That is what it is so we should call it that.  
We see the results of that. 
We see countless numbers of refugees fleeing their homes. 
These are the things that are happening and we must come to grips with them.  
There is another side of the issue that we do not hear about. 
In reality war has no winners. 
Everyone suffers as is evident by this conflict. 
We need to strengthen the UN for this purpose. 
Canada should be taking a leading in role in this measure.  
This is key to the whole thing, opening our hearts to other people.  
Mr. Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough-Agincourt, Lib.):
Does he feel we are achieving anything? 
Does he feel we are there as a lost cause?  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his speech. 
I would like the hon. member to comment.  
Many of them will be coming out violated, traumatised or have lost their families. 
The men have been taken, put in places and in many cases shot. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have two brief questions for my hon. colleague. 
I thank him for the work he has done on this very important issue.  
It is for that very reason I deplore the term ethnic cleansing. 
That gets to the very heart of the principle of self-determination. 
With each day that goes by, more and more lives are lost. 
Every time a person dies, we lose.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
How did we get to the point where we now find ourselves? 
Earlier this year the situation started to deteriorate again. 
This is offensive, this is wrong and this must be stopped.  
Since then we have been closely following developments in that part of the world. 
Over many years, Milosevic has done all of this. 
I know that Canadians want this to happen. 
In the name of humanity, it is the right thing to do.  
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
There are no rules in war. 
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Mr. Speaker, the question is at what cost? 
We agree that the atrocities have to stop. 
The hon. member talks about staying the course. 
The hon. member for Waterloo-Wellington.  
We worked diligently to that end for that objective. 
It seems to me that we have gone to great lengths to ensure that.  
We are not in a time of instant gratification and instant war starting and stopping. 
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
I see this in this situation.  
I welcome comments from the hon. member.  
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
Canada can play an important role in this respect.  
I ask this question. 
Russian participation would eliminate a roadblock within the UN. 
Canada is a nation of peace and freedom. 
This is what we must seek tonight. 
I hope that peace happens very soon in Kosovo.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
There was a lot of wisdom in that group. 
Today the Canadian Federation of Students issued a similar statement.  
There is a lot of wisdom in the country, in civil society. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Obviously both are involved in this conflict. 
It would seem to me they are involved for different reasons.  
From the information I can get many of the atrocities are associated with the police.  
I cannot say whether the blame is with the police or the army. 
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
In this case, it is to avoid needless losses of human lives.  
Well, I have some news for the people sitting in the first rows. 
The defence of the realm is a government's primary duty.  
We are not dealing with nice people in Yugoslavia. 
Withdrawal at this time would have major repercussions.  
But what is NATO's strategy? 
What is the strategic objective of NATO? 
Can we attain the goals NATO and this government have set?  
He is saving them for later. 
What is our objective? 
It is advice which is very simple. 
This was done having a regular force of 60,000 personnel. 
Can we do this today? 
That is the Liberal definition of urgent.  
We have not heard a thing about Sealift since.  
An army without a main battle tank will not survive in combat. 
We have enough of those for a good armoured reconnaissance regiment.  
That is the central issue. 
For instance, what are the objectives of the campaign? 
To create a safe area within Kosovo? 
To partition Kosovo and Yugoslavia? 
Or to invade Yugoslavia? 
How long does NATO make a commitment to stay? 
We do not know what the national command relationship will be. 
What are the rules of engagement? 
How will we sustain them in Kosovo? 
That is very important.  
This deployment to Kosovo could make Somalia look like a Sunday school picnic.  
Are we sending composite units that have never worked with each other before? 
Are they all from one brigade group? 
What size of contingent is going to Kosovo? 
Where are the relief or reinforcements going to come from?  
Will we also maintain our forces in Bosnia? 
Or does this mean that this is the end of the Bosnian commitment?  
No one can say that it is the same situation. 
These were all votes. 
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
The military objective of NATO has humanitarian or political consequences. 
How do I speak to them about this issue at present?  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the question. 
I was also in Bosnia. 
It is very interesting to look at the fields with nothing planted in them. 
They are all mined. 
We are talking about a different situation in Kosovo. 
We have to look very clearly at that and what our troops can do. 
Mr. Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough-Agincourt, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened to my colleague with great interest. 
I was baffled with the way he historically rhymed off some figures. 
He talked about Hong Kong. 
He talked about Dieppe. 
They were under the German boot. 
Can he tell me if he remembers which side they were supporting? 
I could go on and on. 
He mentioned nothing about it.  
The member talked about the Battle of Britain. 
I find what he is talking about to be completely irrelevant. 
It is his government that authorized the bombing. 
I do not understand where he is coming from. 
The hon. member is not very clear.  
So I do not understand.  
There is a long history in Yugoslavia on both sides. 
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will make a comment and ask a question.  
He talked about ``a rise in his popularity at home'' in referring to Milosevic. 
I would like to comment on that. 
How did this individual's popularity rise? 
I do not know if the member agrees or not.  
Does he agree with this to really move forward?  
It has helped his situation.  
The other question was about why there should be war. 
That is a question we asked today. 
On the war situation, Milosevic has declared war on NATO. 
So, like it or not, we happen to be at war.  
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
What would his view be on making the humanitarian effort on the ground? 
That is the debate today. 
It is not a debate on helicopters and equipment- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sorry, but I have to interrupt the hon. member. 
The hon. member for Compton-Stanstead, a short response.  
That is where we could be helping out. 
Those refugees need help. 
That money could be spent over there. 
Now is when they need it, not later on. 
These people are dying now. 
Mr. Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough-Agincourt, Lib.):
A lot of the members today came here with prepared speeches. 
The atrocities happening there have been by both sides. 
It is not something new.  
It was the Ottoman empire. 
Before that there was the Byzantine empire. 
Before that was the Roman empire.  
Somebody from New York City wrote to me. 
A civilian train was bombed off its rails today. 
Last night there was the killing of nine and injuring of 17.  
She was paying for their shelter, as many other Yugoslavs''.  
I will continue on with an E-mail I received from another constituent. 
That part of the world is in turmoil. 
NATO acted because NATO thought it had to act. 
NATO disrespected acting in previous times. 
NATO did not act when the island of Cyprus was invaded. 
It sat on its chair when genocide was happening in Rwanda. 
I have about 6,000 Tamils in my riding. 
Both groups on both sides are making comments. 
Both groups on both sides believe they are right. 
One has to ask why we are there. 
Will we go on from here? 
Will we go into Sri Lanka? 
Last week I had the opportunity of meeting with people.  
We do not want to see the residents of Kosovo live in peace and harmony''.  
I am supportive of our troops over there. 
I will support whatever action is needed in order to bring peace to the world. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
This is another reason for fighting to end the attack on Yugoslavia''.  
I am really concerned with the situation.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
I listened very carefully to the member's speech and I appreciated everything he said. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my hon. colleague for his particular question. 
I would give him the following answer. 
However, there was an organization that did go in to help. 
Maybe what NATO is doing today is similar to that time.  
After NATO struck, the number of refugees coming out jumped and quadrupled. 
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
We often say, for example, that our youth is our future. 
It brought back images of some documentaries I saw about the holocaust. 
I said that this was another holocaust happening. 
What did our military say? 
I am upset that unfortunately these atrocities are happening today. 
Here we are about to close the century with what? 
More genocide and more ethnic cleansing. 
What a shame to all of us who live on the planet including me.  
We talked about Rwanda. 
He did not hesitate for a moment. 
He took the bull by the horns to address that horrible situation. 
Later they said they should have done more. 
There is a political solution. 
It is an opportunity now. 
Why are we not calling them out on that? 
Maybe he is misleading us all. 
I am glad my colleague from Hamilton put me at ease. 
We know there are other hot spots around the globe today. 
We see what is happening with the Basque region. 
We see what is happening in northern Italy with the separatist movement. 
We see what is happening in Corsica. 
Maybe it has changed. 
Maybe it has been baptised. 
I hope it has but I do not know.  
Let us try to hypothesize. 
We are setting a dangerous precedent. 
NATO is showing today that it is not listening. 
Is it the United States or NATO? 
Why was Mr. Solana not the spokesperson on behalf of NATO? 
We as Canadians have set an example, historically speaking. 
We have a reputation, as a colleague from the Conservative Party said, second to none. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
I have a real problem. 
Does the hon. member agree or disagree with what the government will do?  
I merely took this opportunity to outline some of the dangers in this approach. 
I do not believe that we have exhausted every possibility. 
As the member mentioned earlier he has gained popularity unwarranted. 
I think mothers and fathers should be busy providing for households.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I have listened to the very passionate remarks of the member opposite. 
Have we done everything at the security council to get this message across? 
Has the Minister of Foreign Affairs pursued every possible angle? 
Has the member opposite relayed those feelings to him directly?  
Mr. Gerard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):
Right now we are hoping for a peaceful resolution.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
We really wonder who actually listens to take not debates.  
That is what democracy is all about. 
That is what the Canadian people deserve when it comes to an issue of war. 
As of March 24 I supported the current mission. 
President Milosevic underestimated the resolve of the western alliance. 
We will eventually be able to negotiate a settlement by keeping the pressure on. 
We should continue with air strikes to degrade the Yugoslavian military capabilities. 
That is good news for all of us and for the people of Kosovo.  
To convince Belgrade of the wisdom of negotiation will be the diplomacy that is involved. 
Canadians clearly want something to be done. 
There are many issues that the government and NATO need to address. 
I want to have some idea of the resistance the military is expected to face. 
I want to have a complete briefing on the potential casualties that we might suffer. 
We are proud of our troops. 
Most important of all, I want the government to clarify why we are in Kosovo. 
To date I do not have answers to any of these questions. 
The government has not made a case for such an effort. 
It is the government's job to make such a case. 
The entire Kosovo effort is also somewhat unsettling in another perspective. 
I see Russia's involvement as being critical in this whole issue. 
In fact, they are seen as being very threatening.  
We can dismiss as posturing much of the rhetoric now coming from Moscow. 
It will remember the disregard to its views that we are showing today.  
The principal questions still remain unanswered. 
What is NATO becoming? 
The 1991 strategic concept declares explicitly: 
In what region or in what conflict will we not intervene? 
What will be the priority list that we set?  
We have turned a blind eye to almost all of them. 
In Chechnya nearly 100,000 people were killed. 
Should NATO have responded? 
Should NATO have responded? 
Should NATO have been involved?  
We really need to know what the limits of NATO's activities will be. 
That is not the NATO we joined in 1949. 
I do not believe that such an alliance is sustainable in the long term. 
Let me be perfectly clear. 
I do not see our people supporting NATO as a global policeman. 
As NATO intervenes it risks becoming a part of the problem.  
The situation in Kosovo is a case in point. 
I am not at all certain that this is being done. 
A protectorate over Kosovo might demand that we remain there for a long time.  
The highest birth rate in any part of the world is in that area.  
That aim will pose a serious challenge for existing borders. 
When I was there I visited nine classrooms. 
I visited bars, hospitals and restaurants. 
I talked to the people. 
Only then did I understand just how complex this problem really is.  
I have raised all of these questions for two purposes. 
However, the stakes of our involvement are far broader. 
It wants a blank cheque to cover its own failings. 
Our opinions are no longer as respected as they once were. 
We are now marginalized. 
It is often remarked that crisis focuses the mind. 
Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre-Rosedale, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question for the hon. member is twofold. 
We are there because of a moral imperative to be there. 
I thought his leader put that very well. 
Is the member distancing himself from his leader on the issue?  
A second question comes to mind. 
Mr. Speaker, I am a supporter of NATO. 
However we should raise those questions. 
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
I ask all those questions and I come up with the answers. 
NATO seems to be the only body willing and able to do it. 
Did the hon. member not come to the same conclusion? 
Mr. Speaker, I agree with a lot of those things. 
We could go back to Rwanda and so on where it failed to react.  
I still hold that feeling. 
We supported that and continue to support that.  
However there may well be another step. 
All of the facts should be put forward. 
Mr. Gerard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):
People who are watching us at home have a right to be informed. 
What will become of the refugees?  
Mr. Speaker, this brings up a very important point. 
I think the member asked three things. 
I believe people are not well informed about the Balkans. 
We owe the Canadian public this information. 
A take note debate should be an information session. 
Do I think the 18 days of bombing have had an effect? 
I believe it is starting to. 
Tomorrow the G-8 is conducting negotiations. 
The G-8, with Russia as a member, is involved. 
The OSCE with 55 countries is also in full negotiation. 
Russia is a member of that. 
The combination of bombing and that can probably stop this thing. 
That is how I see it happening.  
Do I know that it will work? 
The meetings of the G-8 tomorrow in Bonn are extremely important. 
They might put on additional pressure. 
The hon. member also asked about refugees. 
Obviously Canada has a role in that regard as well. 
For a long time we have accepted true refugees. 
That has solved the problem literally in the very short term.  
I believe we are taking care of that. 
NATO is doing a great job in that area. 
Then we will solve that problem in due course.  
Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre-Rosedale, Lib.):
All hon. members of the House recognize that our action raises difficult issues. 
The hon. member for Red Deer just referred to some of them. 
The hon. member for Scarborough-Agincourt also referred to some of them.  
Finally, among many other issues is the suffering of many innocent people in Yugoslavia. 
The member for Red Deer raised issues of the complexities of life in the Balkans. 
It was planned by the government of Mr. Milosevic.  
We were therefore forced to face this awful choice.  
Have we not seen the refugee camps in Palestine? 
Yes, it raises difficult issues of sovereignty. 
We must deal with this because we are obliged to. 
That solution is that the Kosovars must go home. 
He may yet be able to bring some helpful resolution to this horrible problem.  
The first is that of Montenegro. 
I support her position.  
To intervene today and leave a totally destroyed society would be irresponsible. 
We cannot do that. 
Humanitarian aid will have to extend well beyond that of helping refugees in their place. 
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the hon. member on his presentation. 
It was a very good one and very well thought out as well.  
I want to make a comment and ask him a question. 
The bottom line now is that we are embroiled in a military conflict overseas. 
That would be irresponsible. 
It would be an extremely complicated and very difficult step. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, that is certainly a very fair question. 
We really have to look at it.  
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
The situation in Kosovo and surrounding countries is desperate. 
We had to act, we could not stand idle before such a disaster.  
That right was stripped away by Mr. Milosevic in 1989. 
It did not affect in any way the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia. 
The agreement demanded of both parties the courage to make compromises.  
In the end the Kosovars showed the courage to sign the agreement. 
However, Mr. Milosevic was only interested in gaining precious time. 
The diplomatic track has run its course. 
In fact, he continued the build up of his forces during the Rambouillet process.  
Now we have been forced to turn to a measure of last resort, military force. 
This was not an easy decision nor a hasty one. 
We are using both diplomatic and military means to reach our goals. 
Canada has contributed effectively and with determination to these military operations. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member for his question. 
Historically Russia has been an ally of the Serb population for several centuries. 
I would certainly hope that Russia would step in. 
I will put it in those terms. 
He is key to what is going on in that part of the world.  
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
Sometimes in this place we vote on the most absurd and silly things. 
It is my belief that that should never happen.  
I could not be more in agreement with that. 
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I would ask hon. members to please be a little more quiet.  
As I was saying, while NATO pursues its air strikes, the exodus is continuing. 
The massacres are continuing and the ethnic cleansing started a long time ago is intensifying. 
Lets us look at what has been gained from a few weeks of bombing. 
Most of the refugees are women and children.  
There are 25,000 refugees in Bosnia as well. 
There are 60,000 in Montenegro and 6,000 in Turkey. 
Over 100,000 middle aged and young men have disappeared. 
That is fairly close to 10%.  
They must be given all possible assistance.  
We should look at the benefits and drawbacks of such action. 
NATO must, therefore, liberate all of Kosovo. 
From a humanitarian point of view, consideration should be given to ongoing and unconditional aid. 
Canada is willing to receive those displaced persons wishing to come here. 
The human as well as financial and political costs of such chaos are extremely high. 
Tensions will remain very high. 
Yugoslavian, Kosovar, Albanian and Macedonian infrastructures will be either destroyed or non existent. 
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Tonight the debate takes place under different circumstances. 
We have concluded that the United Nations Security Council is impotent. 
We are participants in NATO's bombing actions.  
What do we wish to achieve through military action? 
The protection and care for those displaced inside Kosovo. 
Canada has experts in preventive diplomacy. 
Article 8 of that convention is quite explicit. 
The prosecutor, Louise Arbour, is playing a strong leadership role. 
The tribunal is making good progress and increasingly commands respect.  
Several speakers have raised that question. 
Hopefully we will succeed in stopping the ugly forces of nationalism in Yugoslavia. 
I am glad to share my time with the member for Peterborough.  
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
I think that, tonight, we must weigh our words. 
The night will not be long for us, because we do not have to suffer.  
But one thing is sure: it is still our brothers and sisters who are suffering. 
I would prefer to say he his sick. 
If he is sick, we must see that he gets treatment. 
If he is cruel, we must at least make him understand his cruelty.  
Ms. Beth Phinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
I had the honour yesterday to tour CFB Trenton. 
War may be noble but it is also numbing to the soul. 
War may be heroic but it is also horrifying. 
War may be glorious but it is also gore.  
Before victory comes violence. 
Before triumph comes tragedy. 
Before defeat of the enemy often comes much death. 
In the words of Milton, war truly is as terrible as hell.  
We know that pure evil must be driven out. 
He is seeking to empty Kosovo of its citizens by any means possible. 
Let us be careful not to demonize Serbian Canadians. 
It is tremendously difficult to plumb the depths of evil. 
We know the depravity. 
Now we see the darker side of human nature. 
If NATO needs to go further let NATO be prepared. 
Let readiness match resolve. 
Will Canadian troops have proper on site preparation and training? 
Will our troops have proper backup? 
I have absolute confidence in the Prime Minister doing so. 
Fine young Canadians are carrying on with that tradition as we speak now. 
We owe it to them. 
We owe them that.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
We have gone through wars in the past. 
Madam Speaker, I listened with great interest to what the member had to say. 
Could she share those two personal experiences with us?  
Madam Speaker, maybe I could first say a few words about Albania. 
I was there three or four years ago. 
They had the communist side and the democratic side. 
They won on their first vote. 
Some of them felt they did not. 
It is quite amazing what they are trying to do. 
The ones who are working earn approximately $50 a year. 
They showed me their food, their groceries for the week. 
They had brown bags and in them they had potatoes and onions. 
That is what they were eating that week. 
Mothers were taking their groceries home for their children.  
It was quite amazing.  
It was pretty exciting at Trenton. 
They are very prepared and we should be very proud of them.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Some members have certainly talked about this point already. 
Three objectives must be considered in this debate. 
The first is the moral objective. 
We cannot overstate the case on this issue. 
The moral objective is the halting of ethnic cleansing. 
Ethnic cleansing means killing. 
We must halt this ethnic cleansing. 
There is a great deal of value in that and hopefully, that can be accommodated.  
That has to be one of the military objectives. 
How do we accomplish the military objectives? 
That is where there has been a lot of disagreement in this House. 
I am really pleased at the level of support in this House for that objective.  
The job they are doing and the commitment they have shown are to be commended. 
There is a lot of agreement on the use of air strikes. 
Can NATO demonstrate that? 
Has it been able to do this so far? 
We do not know whether we will need ground troops. 
We do not know how effective the air strikes are going to be. 
We have heard differing opinions on that in the House. 
That is not good enough. 
We have to give it the time that is needed. 
That decision is to be made by the chief of the defence staff. 
That is the role of the chief of the defence staff.  
Those are some of the military considerations.  
What is the minister's position on this issue? 
It is unclear to me.  
They would come not as refugees but through normal immigration channels. 
I would appreciate clarification by the minister.  
It is very important that this be clarified. 
I look forward to the minister's clarification.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
If that has occurred, we know it will probably happen again. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
Madam Speaker, that is a very difficult question. 
In other words, is the bombing doing the job? 
Is this bombing going to do the job and force that to happen?  
I do not think that question has been answered yet. 
It still may be effective. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, if history has taught us anything, it is that we have learned nothing. 
And act we did, perhaps not in the best way, but we acted.  
There were a number of obligations and end points we wanted to accomplish. 
The first was the most important, to save the innocent civilians' lives. 
Our current objective has several goals. 
The moral obligation is to save people's lives. 
No one disagrees with that. 
It is also to engage in a diplomatic solution.  
The notion of an autonomous Kosovo will not happen. 
These people, quite frankly, are not going to live together.  
How are we going to deal with this problem? 
The first solution is to protect innocent civilians. 
First, it would protect the Kosovar Albanians. 
That simply is not going to happen.  
It would involve the partition of Kosovo. 
As I said before, these people are not going to live together. 
At best, it will be apparent victory. 
He is the one who is responsible for the slaughter in Bosnia. 
He is the one who engaged in a ground war with Croatia. 
We have to recognize that we are not dealing with a familiar creature. 
In fact, I would liken him to Hitler. 
We have to use a different framework to deal with a creature like Slobodan Milosevic.  
Therefore we have to get into the propaganda game. 
We need to use short-wave radio. 
Let us not forget that 10% of the population of Kosovo is Serbian. 
I have been in war situations. 
I have seen people with their legs blown off from land mines. 
These are innocent people who did not ask for this.  
I introduced a motion which will come up for debate on Monday. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Should it be the UN? 
Should it be the OSCE? 
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
We are lacking in leadership in the world today. 
There are three bodies that can do this. 
The first is the United Nations. 
Kosovo demonstrates the failure of the UN. 
They are engaging in bad economics. 
They do not have to. 
I might add that the United Nations is the toughest nut to crack.  
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I congratulate the hon. member on his speech. 
I thought it was very thoughtful.  
Clearly Mr. Milosevic was engaging in a process of ethnic cleansing. 
I do not think it has increased the hostilities.
