The Senate met at 1:30 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Day of Recognition for Braille 
Hon. Marisa Ferretti Barth :
Reform of the Senate 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
As Lord Wakeham, a senior Conservative politician and the commission chairman, said: 
I think this also applies to our nation.  
It will come to the Senate of Canada. 
Business of the Senate 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I wish to briefly comment in terms of granting leave from our side. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Status of Court Cases on Rejected Ballots in 1995 Referendum 
In some ridings, the rejection rate was extremely high. 
In one of these two trials, for example, the prosecution called no witnesses. 
A Court of Appeal judge said that: 
We have here, honourable senators, a lovely Catch-22. 
Nothing further will happen.  
Honourable senators, this is sad and disappointing.  
Day of Recognition for Braille 
He has just begun to learn Braille. 
Words and knowledge are for everyone - be they sighted or blind. 
You put them together and you are changing people's lives.  
I want to thank everyone who was part of that ceremony today. 
This program helps Canadians, and I am very proud to be involved with it.  
Job Creation Programs-Possible Mismanagement of Funds 
That is more money than even the NHL was requesting, which is impossible to believe.  
There are no consequences. 
There is no ministerial responsibility. 
Annual Report of Parliamentary Librarian Tabled 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Letter from Quebec Federation of Genealogical Societies Tabled 
Since discretion is the better part of valour, I will continue in English.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Why are you asking for leave?  
I am asking leave to table this document.  
It sounds like a petition.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Get some order over there, will you?  
Hon. W. David Angus :
Honourable senators, I revert to the subject of yesterday and these deplorable grants - the boondoggle. 
Honourable senators, the minister dodged this issue in the other place. 
My question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate:
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I note in the address of the honourable senator a certain frustration. 
Hon. W. David Angus :
This is an unbelievable boondoggle. 
Is that a Reform boondoggle?  
Frank McKenna's call centre.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
This was blatant pork-barrelling. 
Preserve jobs for whom? 
What is a billion?  
The honourable leader does not even know.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
As has the Prime Minister.  
I want to share with honourable senators the reason for my puzzlement. 
What is the position of honourable senators? 
Do they support these programs or not?  
I say freely and without reservation that I support these programs.  
How much did your riding get? 
Of those, only two project approvals were announced during the election campaign. 
Is that from Don Boudria?  
I rise on a point of order.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
There was great frivolity and laughter in the other place. 
This is no laughing matter. 
As parliamentarians we owe it to the public to act responsibly.  
I will ask the same question I asked yesterday. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I agree with my honourable friend that this is a very important issue. 
However, there are two elements of the issue that interest me. 
One, of course, is the normal response to an internal audit. 
Honourable senators, the Leader of the Government in the Senate is a member of cabinet. 
That occasioned great laughter. 
It was a big sideshow.  
That document was obviously put together by bureaucrats and politicians. 
Why can that document not be made public? 
The Leader of the Government says that these are legitimate programs. 
Why would that bother anyone? 
If you support it, you support it.  
Job Creation Programs- Possible Mismanagement of Funds 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I ask the honourable senator whether she supports such programs.  
No matter how they spend the money?  
Then we will decide whether we like these programs or not.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, seven programs were the subject of the audit. 
Now, who supports that? 
We support that program. 
We support that program. 
I support that program. 
Does my honourable friend support that program?  
Not the way you handle it.  
Youth Services Canada combines work experience and community service. 
We support that program. 
The Summer Career Placements Program helps students get summer jobs. 
Come on, guys, you are losing your enthusiasm.  
Now answer the question.  
Honourable senators, I fully support Senator Carney's statement. 
All senators on this side support that position. 
We do not support grants for jewellery and grants for Wiarton Willy.  
We cannot trust them. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I object to that, too. 
Or a groundhog in Ontario.  
In any event, we stand strongly behind our record of management. 
There is a question of credibility here.  
How can we trust the upcoming budget? 
That is from The Toronto Star of today.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Surely, there is no doubt about their credibility. 
We should allow this process to come to its natural conclusion.  
Can the Leader of the Government answer my question? 
Will he or will he not support an independent audit? 
This is like having the coyote in the henhouse checking on the chickens. 
He has got to be kidding!  
This seems to me a strange situation. 
Is my honourable friend telling us something?  
And the parable is?  
Agriculture and Agri-Food 
Farm Crisis in Prairie Provinces- Response of Government 
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Yes, but it was conditional!  
Honourable senators, the AIDA program has not worked. 
It's not working."  
The AIDA program has not worked. 
We have been at this for almost two years. 
This is a very serious national issue. 
Yet the government is not reacting. 
Will the Prime Minister take serious action to move on this issue? 
I think the honourable senator will agree.  
The Province of Saskatchewan cannot meet the federal government contributions. 
Manitoba has the same problem. 
Alberta can do it because they have oil money.  
It has been in a healthier fiscal situation than most of the provinces.  
On the backs of the farmers!  
Honourable senators, I think the honourable senator is correct. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
That might have created some of the difficulty. 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
It is needed immediately. 
These conversations and these meetings continue to go on. 
They will be gone. 
You will then be dealing with farmers who probably do not need assistance.  
These are not the inefficient farmers; they are the viable farmers.  
Is there any assurance that this money will come now? 
I am hearing the same comments each time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, time for Question Period is over.  
Delayed Answers to Oral Questions 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Cost Overruns in Capital Expenditures on Embassies Abroad 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Terry Stratton on December 1, 1999) 
That report is interesting reading. 
If the decision is to lease, then the site will be surplus. 
The Department has responded in a positive manner to the report. 
Recommendation to establish task force 
Plan to establish coherent foreign aid policy 
Composition of budget for foreign aid 
The Government has consistently surpassed that target.  
A CIDA Education Strategy will be released this year. 
Provision of foreign aid conditional on human rights record 
Each country situation has to be examined carefully and individually. 
Air Canada-Increase in Air Fares 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Donald H. Oliver on December 8, 1999) 
We plan to introduce this legislation in February.  
(Response to question raised by Hon. Mira Spivak on December 9, 1999.) 
Possible Regulations Regarding Addition of Caffeine to Beverages 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Mira Spivak on December 14, 1999) 
When caffeine is used as a food additive, it must be listed on the label.  
(Response to question raised by Hon. David Tkachuk on December 15, 1999) 
Restructuring of Airline Industry-Effect of Air Canada Monopoly 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Consiglio Di Nino on December 15, 1999) 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
This is a very good bill.  
There is a problem, however. 
The problem was also addressed by officials of the Department of Justice. 
I must admit that we are satisfied with the answers we were given. 
Honourable senators, I encourage you to support this bill. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to, bill read third time and passed.  
Nisga'a Final Agreement Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
Some are confused, some are fearful, and some want more information.  
Why was this agreement not done like the others? 
The die is cast.  
Here, he was referring to the House of Commons committee. 
This little song and dance is costing taxpayers $500,000.  
If it is not, it will be virtually impossible to change.  
Why is this bill here? 
Why is it necessary? 
There seems to be, really, no middle ground, unfortunately. 
I hope we can correct that.  
I believe that aboriginal people should have self-government. 
In 1991, the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples was established. 
We are really in uncharted territory. 
This is not the delegation of legislative power with which we are familiar. 
At present, we really play no meaningful role.  
However, what happens then? 
I come back to my original point. 
Is our investigation window-dressing? 
Can we effect positive change in regard to this agreement?  
I urge the Liberal leadership in the Senate - 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable Senator St. Germain, I regret to interrupt you, but your 15 minutes have expired.  
Does he not have 45 minutes?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Senator St. Germain has only 15 minutes. 
I refer you to rule number 37(3). 
I have no alternative but to interrupt.  
I request leave to continue.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
It refers only to the first speaker. 
Honourable senators, rule 1 refers to "customs" and "usages". 
Perhaps this issue should have been dealt with at the time. 
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
I rise on the same point of order, honourable senators.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I apologize for the confusion.  
I raise these issues because I believe we should address them. 
Either we are a meaningful part of the process or we are not. 
As well as complex, it can be explosive. 
The new Nisga'a law-making authority will not have to follow this process.  
This could bring the whole process into question. 
This policy has now been changed. 
The overlap situation still has not been resolved. 
This is not right. 
I am also concerned about the financial arrangements made among the parties to this agreement. 
Unfortunately, under this agreement there may never be closure. 
I will deal with the concept of accountability later.  
That in itself creates uncertainty. 
These people have worked at this for some 20 years.  
I believe a business plan is necessary. 
The constitutional foundations of this agreement could be in doubt theoretically.  
Uncertainty also extends to the harvesting of natural resources under the agreement. 
I do so in a positive manner. 
If it is not a template, then it will certainly be a guide. 
Believe me, this will be a benchmark for all that follows.  
My advice, honourable senators, is "let us get it right." 
Let us hold meaningful, in-depth hearings. 
In our hearings, I hope we will listen to every group intently. 
This has not yet happened. 
Everything has been polarized.  
The process has been horrific and degrading to our aboriginal peoples. 
I believe we have an opportunity here, as senators, to do something positive.  
Honourable senators, I have raised many issues today. 
I know they can be refuted. 
Honourable senators, this agreement is historic in nature. 
It should be reviewed as effectively as possible without emotion, but with articulate clarity. 
I use the word "clarity" from this side of the house with great caution. 
That word is nerve-racking. 
The elected legislatures became so emotionally charged that the public was confused. 
I say to the Nisga'a people that I want them to have a deal. 
We must come to an agreement in a manner in which everyone has confidence. 
That is the Senate's responsibility. 
Together, let us all exercise sober second thought.  
Would the Honourable Senator St. Germain entertain a short question?  
On motion of Senator Tkachuk, debate adjourned.  
Second Report of Committee adopted 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
Honourable senators, I move that this report be adopted.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
State of Domestic and International Financial System 
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Energy, the Environment and Natural Resources 
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
He was also inviting the participation of senators in the review process. 
The letter indicated that he is starting that process now. 
I believe that was the feeling of the committee members at the time. 
That is a matter that I hope to see addressed. 
Was that a question?  
Honourable senators, the committee has a full agenda. 
They do not receive the impact of many other toxins. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
