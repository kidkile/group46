The House met at 10 a.m. 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE-SPEAKER'S RULING 
Speakers' rulings are consistent in these cases. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I wish to thank you for that ruling, which I respect. 
I am always in the hands of the House in any case.  
Does the hon. member have permission to put the motion to the House?  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Charles Hubbard (Miramichi, Lib.):
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
They feel this is unfair. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have an additional petition that deals with international trade. 
Mr. Gerard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):
Mr. Gerard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
Is the House ready for the question?  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
Accordingly, the recorded division stands deferred.  
MARINE CONSERVATION AREAS ACT 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
But make no mistake about the meaning of that rejection. 
Let us see what this bill is all about.  
Let us look at how ridiculous that is.  
This government prefers to stir up trouble, ill feelings and even discontent in the population. 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):
Nothing could be further from the truth.  
Jurisdiction over the seabed in a specific area may be disputed. 
But that is a different mater entirely. 
The purpose of this bill is not to resolve such disputes.  
We have no intention of acting unilaterally in an area under dispute. 
This must be clearly understood. 
Saying otherwise would be misleading the House.  
We would have consultations to find a mutually acceptable solution. 
Let us be clear on this.  
We are already using the model proposed in the bill. 
That is the intent of the bill.  
On this note, I move: 
That the question be now put.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of clarification. 
We are debating the contents of Bill C-48. 
I hope that clarifies it for the hon. member for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I am glad I sought that clarification. 
I was somewhat confused earlier but I am no longer, essentially.  
These areas include fresh and salt waters. 
We in the New Democratic Party agree there are problems with the bill. 
It is in that context that I make my comments this morning. 
There are problems on the north coast and problems in the inland water system.  
We will continue to support Bill C-48 in principle. 
There is a compelling need for a better definition of proposed cost recovery measures.  
This is a crucial element. 
We look forward to seeing that appropriate access included in the legislation.  
We want to be sensitive about that particular interface.  
The coastal co-ordination between the different departments involved must be defined. 
This explains some of the nuances and points that I am making.  
We support the legislation. 
We certainly support the principle enthusiastically. 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
The federal government has forced us to become more and more distrustful in these areas.  
Give them a foot, they will take a yard. 
That is part of the problem.  
It would be hard to prevent it from doing so. 
In Quebec we are very sceptical about this.  
I believe the government should start its consultations all over again. 
I was not a member of the committee. 
She told us about the kind of consultations that took place. 
This is simply not enough for us, in the House. 
Words are quick and vain, we will need to get that in writing. 
This is often how we can be had.  
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
There are two major container ports in Canada. 
The port of Montreal and the port of Halifax. 
Halifax is number two. 
Members will understand what I am getting at regarding this bill. 
The list is too long.  
That is absolutely right.  
You should move along; you only have 10 minutes.  
Allow me to digress briefly to say a few words about this dialogue. 
Yes, it will be re-elected on November 30. 
Therefore, we have no choice but to oppose this bill.  
It is possible to reach an agreement. 
The federal government prefers to trample on Quebec's jurisdictions. 
Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):
Why are they opposing it? 
It is the same thing when we are working in the straits in British Columbia.  
It is really disconcerting to see them do that. 
They know full well this legislation does not infringe on provincial jurisdiction.  
It is important that all Canadians understand that. 
They are opposed to it for reasons that are simply not as they state. 
This is not an infringement on provincial jurisdiction. 
I thought that point needed to be made.  
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
I hope that the hon. members across the way will open their ears.  
But who is taking care of the fishers who have lost their livelihood? 
Who is taking care of the plant workers who have lost everything? 
It is an absolute shame. 
I would be concerned for my safety. 
All this to protect one species or take tourists on a boat ride. 
We did it in the past. 
I remind the House of the existence of three different names. 
All of them talk about conservation.  
DFO's biologists failed in their attempt to protect our cod. 
Imagine what the heritage minister's bureaucrats will do. 
I would be ashamed if I were in the Liberals' shoes this morning. 
What will the Liberals from the maritimes do? 
I am telling them they should get out through the back door. 
What will they do when they go back home? 
Christmas is fast approaching. 
There are just two weeks left before we adjourn. 
Will I have something to eat this Christmas''? 
It is a shame.  
It is really a shame.  
They have to make those calls. 
We cannot let the minister do this in the fisheries areas.  
This is an unprecedented attack against provincial areas of jurisdiction. 
Despite what the parliamentary secretary may say, there is a conflict. 
When we want to solve problems, we need dialogue.  
This is much worse than someone who does not want to dance with a partner. 
She might do better sitting this one out.  
What should the government have done? 
We saw the squabbling that went on last summer. 
Because there were squabbles all summer long.  
Oh good, it will be coming back.  
Someone has to put a stop to this farce. 
This will never bring peace.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
We will not support the bill, and I will explain why.  
This is another example of interference and duplication. 
I will tell you a story. 
A fisherman wants to go fishing on the St. Lawrence River. 
So far, so good. 
This fisherman has to ask the provincial government for a fishing licence. 
In order to launch his rowboat, he needs a federal registration.  
The fish swimming in the water comes under federal jurisdiction. 
This makes no sense.  
It borders on the absurd.  
Through Environment Canada, the federal government wants to create marine wildlife preserves. 
How can anyone make sense of this?  
Such overlap and duplication is ridiculous. 
Who will know what belongs to whom? 
But we know what this government wants. 
It wants to get its hands on the St. Lawrence River. 
This is how it hopes to invade our jurisdiction. 
This initiative could have served as a model. 
This resulted in the creation of Canada's first marine conservation area.  
But the Government of Canada is not happy when everything is running smoothly. 
They prefer to stir up trouble and sow discord. 
Quebec cannot and will not work in this kind of system. 
It is unfortunate that the government has not learned its lesson.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, we have to take part in this debate. 
We have to, because enough is enough.  
It looks like what we are saying does not make sense. 
It is, however, the plain and simple truth. 
That is the problem.  
Again, we have to fight. 
They could not care less about the law of the land. 
They thumb their noses at constitutional interpretation. 
They just make laws or use their spending powers.  
No, that is not what was done.  
This is what appears in clause 5(2).  
Something stands in the way, however. 
It is fortunate that the Quebec National Assembly has passed this legislation. 
It provides that Quebec cannot transfer its lands to the federal government. 
Quebeckers will not sit idly by.  
Mr. George S. Baker (Gander-Grand Falls, Lib.):
What is the principle of this bill? 
The principle is a particular type of conservation, marine conservation.  
It was in the area of marine conservation.  
They were very specific.  
Let me correct her. 
I will tell this House why. 
What happened to that resource? 
In the 1980s licences were given. 
To Norway, Sweden and some other European countries. 
It was the most outrageous thing that destroyed the spawning ground of the mackerel. 
The next year there were nine and the year after there were eleven. 
Because of poor management of our marine resource. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
He is talking to us about migrating species- 
Mr. George S. Baker:
They would say that for a very good reason. 
I will give an example of the importance of marine conservation. 
There were 6 Canadian vessels and 117 foreign vessels. 
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
Lawrence marine park, does just the opposite.  
It is always the same old story.  
This is no surprise coming from this government. 
This kind of interference is nothing new. 
Speaking of duplication, this bill tops it all. 
What a fine example of federal bureaucratic inefficiency. 
We need only look at the wording of the bill. 
Quebec is not for sale. 
This is another example of how unfairly Quebec is treated in this federal system.  
How stupid and ironic at the same time. 
These are becoming more frequent in the federal system and are becoming unbearable.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
I mention that because I know he is watching and listening intently to every word. 
This is a prime fishing area for all the east coast. 
By the way, the resource we are talking about in the fishing industry is renewable. 
I am a new politician. 
I know that politicians are a reactive bunch. 
They are not very proactive.  
The hon. member for Churchill River in northern Saskatchewan is Metis. 
His culture and his people look a lot further than the current generation. 
We have some particular reservations about the bill. 
We share the planet with many other species. 
Marine parks just add to the parks in Canada. 
It is an absolute explosion of marine aquatic life. 
Another area is the renowned area called the Flemish Cap. 
We are using long term draggers.  
It is good for very quick economic gains. 
If we do not, there will be nothing left for future generations.  
We have to get it out of here. 
My party and I are in support of the bill with some reservations. 
Some changes need to be made and we are hoping they will be made. 
We are hoping that the provinces, especially Quebec, would be very interested in doing this.  
We have the natural resources that were here long before we were ever here. 
I will conclude my comments. 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
However, the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to Bill C-48. 
The St. Lawrence Marine Park is a good model. 
Both governments will continue to fulfil their respective responsibilities.  
The park is made up entirely of marine areas. 
It covers 1,138 square kilometres. 
This means that a single site could find itself protected under more than one category.  
However, that is not the way it is done in reality. 
Of those responses, only one was in French.  
In view of this, it is impossible to talk about meaningful consultation. 
We suspect, moreover, that the organizations consulted were preselected. 
In conclusion, the Bloc Quebecois opposes the bill for the following reasons.  
Therefore, there is encroachment on Quebec's jurisdiction.  
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
Consultation is definitely not her cup of tea.  
We simply do not know. 
That is where the marine conservation areas would be established. 
But have those involved been consulted?  
Were these people consulted? 
Will these areas be open for certain periods? 
Will there be more control over fishing? 
I would like to digress briefly. 
What more could we do? 
We sent you the saviour himself to rescue the nation.'' 
I am referring, of course, to Jean Charest. 
What more could he have done?''  
Quebeckers have become fearful. 
Anyway, she has friends in this community, of course. 
Yet the Fathers of Confederation were no fools. 
This is a misappropriation of funds, nothing more and nothing less.  
And who could be against motherhood and apple pie? 
Nobody, and certainly not in my party. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
FIRST NATIONS LAND MANAGEMENT ACT 
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
This is a road to self-government. 
It is a road to self-reliance.  
These are important provisions. 
They speak to the sacred bond that first nations hold for their land.  
Certain minimum steps would have to be satisfied. 
Compensation would have to be paid. 
The people of those communities have a great deal at stake in how we proceed. 
This legislation is about much more than land management. 
I and the signatories to this agreement urge all members to support it. 
That the question be now put.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to the parliamentary secretary. 
Is this necessarily a bad thing? 
It is a failure of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. 
Top policy makers in the government give that impression. 
They cite examples of unbelievable graft.  
If this is the case, why isn't the government moving on it? 
We'd be accused of racism''. 
Thus political correctness takes it toll again. 
It is out of control''.  
These people came to me because they were very concerned. 
They did not want this to happen. 
Two and a half years later the roosters are coming home to roost. 
That is the problem.  
Do I blame the Gitksan band? 
Apparently those things are non-existent. 
That is why we have the terrible situation we are faced with today. 
I can give another example. 
We have testimonials from grassroots aboriginals from right across Canada. 
There are examples in Ontario. 
They hired a contractor. 
The contractor was aware that the money was in place. 
The contractor went to work. 
The band received the money. 
I could provide example after example.  
This is really not about aboriginal people. 
It is about a failed system. 
It has created an environment in which accountability is almost non-existent. 
If we go onto a reserve, no way. 
That is the reality that these people are living with.  
They know full well that there is no accountability with this bill. 
In response to that I give the House this example. 
During the last election campaign I met a young native lady in Prince Rupert. 
She was quite distraught. 
I asked her to explain the problem.  
Two of the children were not much more than babies. 
The oldest was only seven years old. 
Her children demanded a great deal of her time. 
Her husband had left her and she had no means of looking after herself. 
She was being forced to live on welfare.  
I understood her situation.  
I asked where the father was. 
She could go to court and force the father to pay child support. 
They effectively run the community.  
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
I want to make a couple of points. 
I believe that he has missed the point entirely in this piece of legislation. 
Members from the Reform Party requested that the minister come before the committee. 
Where is the grassroots there?  
They largely have their membership on side. 
That is not the case in many bands.  
I do not think that that support is there.  
That is all we have said. 
We did not say to cut anyone's salary. 
I think their members would have a bit of a problem with that.  
My friend from Wild Rose will not be saying very much. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
We know that they face some of the most desperate circumstances in this country. 
That frankly is wrong. 
I agree with the member. 
We have a responsibility and we should take it seriously.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Wild Rose for his question. 
I am very aware of it. 
The government can no longer hide from it. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We will now go to 10-minute presentations with no questions and comments.  
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
We know this act is not all encompassing. 
That agreement encompassed a number of areas, of which land management was only one. 
As we can see, it is progressing through the legislative process. 
Thirty or forty first nations have already expressed an interest in this framework agreement. 
We are all aware of the faults of the Indian Act. 
We will continue to support the first nations in this land management agreement.  
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
It is a privilege to be supporting Bill C-49. 
For that we must all be very pleased.  
It will also help to increase their own stewardship of their own environment. 
We support the idea that the framework agreement will be open to other first nations. 
We hope many more will do so. 
The NDP is fully in support of Bill C-49. 
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
In fact there was a veil of secrecy that surrounded the negotiations.  
These two concerns are disturbing in a country such as Canada. 
I would like to look at these two issues more closely. 
The first paragraph in the agreement in principle states: 
According to Indian affairs statistics the Westbank First Nation is comprised of 517 members. 
Yet there are 7,000 non-natives on Westbank land. 
They are voiceless on this bill and this issue.  
The 7,000 non-aboriginal residents will be largely excluded.  
Is the rule of law so little regarded by our political leaders? 
This is absolutely unacceptable.  
These are extraordinary powers given to a minority of people on Westbank land.  
It appears to be taxation without representation.  
I quote from the agreement in principle: 
This flies in the face of the principles of democracy. 
Bill C-49 is not the answer to this problem.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
I have been very supportive of a number of initiatives he has taken. 
I suspect my comments may be somewhat in opposition to his. 
Replaced in what way is what this discussion and debate is all about.  
There is a great deal of misunderstanding surrounding the issue of self-government. 
There is a great deal of misinformation being circulated about self-government. 
What kind of goofy system is that?  
This is a step in the right direction. 
Others perhaps may not think so. 
The first nations may acquire land for community purposes. 
That is an obvious thing to do in a free country. 
The government retains fiduciary responsibility. 
If not perhaps we have to relook the whole issue.  
This is a problem. 
However I want to add one or two short points. 
First nations are not above the Constitution of Canada.  
Whether or not it is adequate remains to be seen. 
We will see what happens in committee when we hear from some of the witnesses.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
What Bill C-49 is trying to accomplish is honourable. 
We expect a report some day soon.  
Comments like those of Roy Littlechief are being said across the country. 
The reason is that the dollars do not seem to be there. 
They concerned payments from the social department on the reserve. 
I looked down the list of these payments to the persons who were in receipt. 
They reached into their files and brought out a death certificate. 
In other words, let them solve it themselves.  
It is more than an internal problem when these kinds of things happen. 
There is something wrong with that.  
That is a pretty wise thing to say. 
The problem is like a revolving door. 
Those kinds of things are happening. 
My wife and I took tours into reserves. 
We sat in tar paper shacks. 
They have never had an opportunity to talk to a member of parliament. 
I will tell them what it is.  
That is what it is. 
It is a humanity issue. 
Get out there and start solving some problems. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
I agree with the hon. member for Wild Rose. 
I speak on anything related to my constituency. 
I am profoundly interested in what they say to me.  
Why do we have no self-government? 
What is it afraid of? 
It simply does not want to face reality. 
There is no accountability.  
I will give an example from the House. 
Here we have the Bloc that wants to separate from Canada. 
When it does so, it will negotiate the terms. 
It is completely backwards. 
The same thing exists with Bill C-49. 
We are creating land management. 
Shame on this government. 
Shame on this government for ever using the term partnership. 
This is the most important social issue facing Canada today. 
This issue is so profound that it is growing every day. 
And what is the government doing about it? 
I know the Liberal Party wants to condemn me for being anti-native. 
The member will have the floor when we come back. 
He still has four and a half minutes to make his point. 
It is almost 2 o'clock and so we will proceed to Statements by Members.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
On this we have made progress. 
Here there has also been some progress. 
On this subject there is absolute failure.  
Forgotten is the issue of compassion. 
The hon. member for Perth-Middlesex.  
Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Middlesex, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
The outpouring of aid is extraordinary.  
Friends has helped Honduran children for many years. 
Our thoughts and our prayers are with the hurricane victims.  
Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
The hon. member for Souris-Moose Mountain.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
That does not make sense in Saskatchewan. 
Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Canada has one of the best safety net systems in the world. 
In normal circumstances these safety net measures create income stability for farmers. 
The current farm income crisis demands an extraordinary response.  
I know some producers who are facing the loss of the family farm. 
He has my support and I hope he has the support of this House.  
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
The old rascal wanted to talk about independence, but behind closed doors. 
His approach raised the ire of the media, and the doors were opened immediately.  
Mr. Parizeau finally spoke the truth about the separatists' strategy. 
Jacques Parizeau has finally cut through the smoke screen over separatist strategies.  
We must give him credit: he finally revealed the truth of the PQ strategy.  
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the clock is ticking. 
There are just 400 days until the year 2000. 
Do we know if our government will be ready?  
We know that will not happen.  
We have seen little leadership from government ministers. 
They are all too willing to pass the buck. 
They offer no clear leadership or direction. 
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN QUEBEC 
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are in the home stretch of the Quebec election campaign.  
The PQ is trying to hoodwink Quebeckers. 
Next time, he will even invite us on an organized trip to the Rocky Mountains.  
I am not interested in Lucien Bouchard's renewed federalism. 
I will vote for true federalism. 
I do not want to hear about separation. 
I want nothing to do with tricks. 
I will vote for a stronger Quebec within Canada.  
On November 30, let us put an end to Bouchard's tricks. 
Let us vote for a better future for all. 
CANADA'S BLOOD SUPPLY 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, today marks the first anniversary of the Krever report. 
The telephone number to make an appointment is 236-0199. 
ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN QUEBEC 
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
A vote for the ADQ is simply a lost vote. 
On November 30, I will vote Liberal because I believe in my country. 
I believe in a strong Quebec for our children and our grandchildren. 
JOB CREATION IN MONTREAL 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Employment in Quebec is rising.  
In fact, job creation has not been this good in Montreal since 1987.  
We have had it with the arrogance of the Liberals. 
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
What is the government waiting for to act? 
For all the victims to have died one by one?  
NATIONAL AIDS AWARENESS WEEK 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
As most Canadians know, AIDS is a deadly disease. 
Many of these cases have ended in death.  
We must and we will defeat this terrible disease.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
I think it is time that Perrin Beatty resigned as president of the CBC.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
This is a very proud record. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
As we know we would all like to pay lower taxes.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
The Europeans are subsidizing unfairly $60 billion a year to their farmers. 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Perhaps he has had a little memory loss.  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, again I find this absolutely amazing. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the acting prime minister.  
It could take a year. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
I think that is an approach which is understandable. 
It does not mean that the panel will not continue. 
We do not know what the results will be. 
Let us wait to hear what the court says.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
They cannot have it both ways. 
We know delays do not help the situation. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I think we must wait for the federal court to make its ruling.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
That is what is not relevant, to use his word.  
It is ridiculous and no one believes it.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has made an inaccurate statement.  
RCMP commissioners do not report to the solicitor general. 
He plays no role, except that of receiving the report. 
The commission is independent, as set out in the legislation passed by this parliament.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the commission has been in operation for ten years. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
It is obvious that the commission intends to do what is necessary.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
He pretends that he wants Canadians to know the truth as quickly as possible.  
Now the commission has shut down for six months. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
That is speculation in the media. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, it is just not working. 
He knows it is fatally wounded. 
He knows the commission will never get to the truth.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's assertion is totally wrong. 
I thank her again for the vote of confidence. 
For a change she has said something right. 
The hon. member for Burin-St. 
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
The minister now can see that farmers have to resort to destroying their livestock.  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
We are going to do all we possibly can as quickly as we can. 
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
The hon. member for Medicine Hat.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Farm incomes in Canada have dropped 46% in the last year. 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the minister has known for a year that this problem was coming. 
Why does he not come up with some long term solutions for farmers? 
What he is proposing simply is not good enough. 
We need long term solutions.  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is refreshing. 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
If the hon. could simply put his question.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
It is obvious that the commission can and wishes to do its job. 
We ask that the hon. member let the commission do its job.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
I hope he understood the question and will answer it.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Trade.  
This year the European governments will pay their farmers over $60 billion. 
This has all the makings of an all-out trade war.  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we already did that a long time ago.  
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have the same faith in our farming community across the country. 
The Minister for International Trade, if he wishes to continue.  
We are hopeful that they will take heed.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, this is a false allegation. 
Quebeckers do not want to separate. 
It would be better if they did not elect a party that relies on mistrust.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
Canadians watched the news in disbelief last night. 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
As soon as it started to happen I met with my provincial counterparts. 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the situation at the moment in agriculture is very difficult.  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Charles Hubbard (Miramichi, Lib.):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Judge Krever suggested we compensate every single victim. 
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
We immediately established the national Blood Safety Council. 
We have two new blood agencies, Hema-Quebec and the Canadian Blood Services. 
The hon. member for Macleod.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the first recommendation was to compensate all the victims. 
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
We believe that people need care. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
My question therefore is for the Minister of Finance. 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
This government abandoned our producers by prematurely cutting federal support. 
Our farmers lost $320 million per year just in Saskatchewan. 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Canadians want the truth. 
When will they get straight answers and an independent judicial inquiry?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
We had an opportunity to discuss many subjects.  
GOLDEN WEST DOCUMENT SHREDDING 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Instead of shredding that information, it was sold at a profit.  
The privacy commissioner does not think so. 
He is launching his own investigation.  
Just how bad is the news?  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
We cancelled the contract and all the security checks the firm had.  
We did not hide anything. 
It was all in the paper. 
The member just realized it now, five months later. 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
I have to discuss the matter with my cabinet colleagues as well.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
I do not expect to call business other than those two items tomorrow.  
On Monday we will resume the list that I have just described.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Let us set the record straight. 
That is not the issue. 
Why do we continue to do that? 
The government is not helping them to attain that.  
To deny shows that this government is not really looking at reality. 
The government can hide from it. 
Obviously it does not want to take responsibility. 
This government is quite prepared to do that, but we are not.  
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Hon. members may recognize much of this legislation. 
It came before us in December of 1996 as Bill C-75. 
This legislation would apply to 14 first nations.  
Both the land code and the individual agreements require community approval. 
There is just so much that one can say in speaking to this agreement.  
Neighbouring municipalities and affected provinces will benefit from economic development spinoffs. 
Bill C-49 is a good piece of legislation. 
I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
I would agree with her that it is a good piece of legislation.  
This bill is all about accountability. 
Perhaps there are parts of the bill the member did not read. 
As the law exists now, there is no accountability at all. 
That sounds like accountability to me.  
Let me give a few more examples of accountability.  
The public has access to those laws at the first nation office during business hours. 
Any adult member can receive a copy of these financial statements. 
That is what the bill brings to the nation. 
There are five from British Columbia:
Westbank; Lheit Lit'en; Musqueam; N'Quatqua; and Squamish. 
There is one from Alberta, Siksika. 
There are two from Saskatchewan, Muskoday and Cowessess. 
The one from Manitoba is the Opaskwayak Cree. 
There is also Saint Mary's in New Brunswick.  
Are other first nations interested in joining this initiative? 
A number in my own province of Nova Scotia are interested in joining.  
The Indian Oil and Gas Act still pertains. 
This does not change legislation. 
I have looked at this bill. 
It does not change the Constitution of Canada. 
It is a good bill. 
I support it and I would ask other members of the House to support it.  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
She will be accused of going around the local elected representatives. 
The minister is caught in a bind in this regard.  
There is a concern.  
We are putting our warning voice on record in this regard. 
Why has the government not defined it? 
There must be greater accountability in this place. 
We want more free votes in the House. 
The degree of accountability in the bill looks good. 
Our duty is to place our concerns on record. 
I will give an example. 
She has been trying to get financial statements from her band. 
She has nowhere to go except to the minister. 
Laura is just one of many. 
She is continually asking us for help.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
MANITOBA CLAIM SETTLEMENTS IMPLEMENTATION ACT 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
This does not mean we believe there to be unanimous support for the agreement. 
Let us be clear about what these members are implying. 
This is not the type of allegation that should be made lightly.  
Virtually every road in Norway House is now paved. 
Imagine if Canada's creditors demanded immediate repayment of our national debt. 
It must be free to make this choice.  
There are members within the Norway House First Nation.  
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
There is some difficulty with that.  
They lived a hunting and fishing sustenance lifestyle. 
They have charged there have been profound irregularities and vote buying. 
The band then applies to have the land designated reserve status. 
Immediately the rural municipality has a reduced capability to collect taxes. 
This is happening throughout Saskatchewan. 
Haul roads are being built across the province. 
They are designated as haul roads and known as super grids. 
It receives 73% from the province. 
The band also contributed nothing. 
That is a very large tax increase.  
Rural municipalities have asked me to tell the government about the situation they are facing. 
As such there is no point in fighting it. 
Otherwise they will be taxed out of existence.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
However, there is another problem. 
The re-zoning is not subject to the rural municipality's objections. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
So they are fee simple lands, plain and simple. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for South Shore. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
We have two quite different pieces of legislation in one bill. 
The Norway House signed the master implementation agreement in December of 1997. 
The second part of the legislation improves the process of establishing reserves. 
I am not going to continue the debate at great length today. 
Actually, we are dealing with three issues. 
There are certainly two big issues. 
There is a certain danger in that. 
For example, the Northern Flood Agreement consists of 155 pages. 
That is just one part of this bill. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
I want to talk a bit about the referendum results. 
I believe this is critical to this issue.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I am very aware of the seriousness of the allegations. 
These people contacted me. 
Since I was not there I really do not know.  
I would like to ask the government if this referendum was overseen by Elections Canada. 
Canadians, I submit, would never accept that.  
I think the people on these reserves are absolutely beside themselves. 
We did not have this fairness. 
That did not happen.  
Was there a complete and proper enumeration done of all of the voters? 
Where is the evidence to support that? 
I have asked for that, but I do not have it.  
I submit right now that we do not have it.  
The same principle is involved. 
I want to talk about the Nisga'a agreement for just a minute. 
This is the first stage. 
The Nisga'a people voted for two days. 
The referendum started on Friday and finished on Saturday night. 
I waited all day Sunday and I did not get them Sunday. 
I started waiting into Monday. 
In two hours we know who the next government will be. 
We know on an individual basis whether we were elected or re-elected as parliamentarians.  
They were not final results, preliminary results.  
This is what happened. 
It is a little difficult to accept the veracity of those results.  
I was concerned about this matter. 
These people further made allegations that financial inducements were offered. 
I have also heard allegations that underage people were casting votes. 
In one case somebody made an allegation that a deceased person actually cast a vote. 
I do not know if that is true. 
I am not accusing anybody of anything.  
I submit there is no way the government can do that. 
I certainly continue to hear from people from Norway House who are beside themselves. 
I am told that is not the case.  
I cannot say with authority that the allegations are true. 
I do not think they have any solid evidence to support that at all.  
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
We have heard this talk all day. 
We have heard it on many bills, on C-49. 
The member again raises Nisga'a. 
I want to know whether they support it or not.  
I would like to read something into the record for the member. 
The federal court has ruled on this matter. 
That was the issue. 
Whether it is moral is quite another question.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
I am wondering if he has received any written confirmation of those allegations. 
Mr. Speaker, the answer is yes to both. 
They are concerned about that. 
They have to live in these communities. 
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
There is a time for us to set aside partisan attitudes. 
We can then move on proudly to a new era of Canadian history. 
I hope he will join the government in this initiative.  
Mr. Speaker, the wonders of Liberal spin never cease. 
That is completely irrelevant to the debate we are having. 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, that is an excellent question. 
I have been a member of a municipality. 
I have voted in municipal elections. 
I have voted in provincial elections. 
I do not understand. 
We have to make sure that there is democratic and fiscal accountability in place first.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
SPECIAL IMPORT MEASURES ACT 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Motion No. 1 will be debated and voted on separately.  
Motion No. 2 will be debated and voted on separately.  
Motion No. 7 will be debated and voted on separately.  
I will now propose Motion No. 1 to the House.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (for Mr. Benoit Sauvageau) moved: 
I therefore present to you the motions that we disagree with.  
First of all, Motion No. 1, which reads as follows: 
A number of witnesses expressed concerns during committee deliberations. 
This is why we propose Motion No. 1.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
I am thinking of the cattle industry where there are two way flows of product.  
But there are other countries that dump into Canada. 
In some cases it is shiploads of steel and other types of products.  
I think we want to keep this legislation at our disposal. 
No third party should be able to interfere in that process. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Some European nations recently have denied the MAI's going further. 
Unfortunately the MAI is stalled at the present time. 
Canada puts up its hand and says we did. 
They found a lot of problems with it. 
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Our position is clear: we are in favour of Bill C-35. 
I do not want to get into a long speech on this bill. 
We still have concerns. 
We have strong reservations about this. 
I will get in touch with my colleague from Repentigny. 
We tried to reach him today, but unfortunately he too is very busy. 
For the time being, we will be voting against Motion No. 1.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to also speak on Motion No. 1.  
From that perspective one can generally avoid third party submissions. 
I have heard from the other parties. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The question is on Motion No. 1. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The recorded division on the motion stands deferred.  
We will now go to Motion No. 2. 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (for Mr. Benoit Sauvageau) moved: 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
We think it is important to have competition. 
Therefore, we will not support Motion No. 2. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
In this regard, clause 27 is really a key component of the bill. 
It is really integral to the overall balance sought by the subcommittee. 
The balance is struck by the proposed legislation.  
That is a really good idea.  
I tend to agree. 
I thank the hon. member for that intervention.  
We certainly would not want to in any way diminish that.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The recorded division on Motion No. 2 stands deferred.  
I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That is very nice. 
Thanks to all the members.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (for the Minister of Finance, Lib.) moved: 
``important a l'entreprise ou aux activites de la'' 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (for Mr. Benoit Sauvageau) moved: 
For the purposes of subsection (3.1), 
For the purposes of subsection (3.1), 
``material harm'' has the meaning given to that expression by the regulations.''  
``( f.3 ) defining the expression ``material harm'' for the purpose of section 44;'' 
Motions Nos. 4, 5 and 6 concern the notion of ``material harm''. 
In our opinion, the definition of material harm is also problematical.  
For the purposes of subsection (3.1), 
For the purposes of subsection (3.1), 
``material harm'' has the meaning given to that expression by the regulations.''  
defining the expression ``material harm'' for the purpose of section 44;'' 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we support Motion No. 3. 
I understand this brings the French text into line with the English text.  
However, we have a more difficult problem with Motion No. 4. 
If there is some way to resolve that I would not have a problem. 
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
I hope not, but it seems like it.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The amendment proposed by the member for LaSalle-Emard seems somewhat vague. 
In fact, there was no conviction. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The recorded division on Motion No. 3 stands deferred.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The recorded division on Motion No. 4 stands deferred.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (for Mr. Benoit Sauvageau) moved: 
( a ) the price or cost of the goods is likely to fluctuate substantially; and 
( b ) the regulations so permit.  
We hope that Revenue Canada will continue to use the prospective method. 
(a) the price or cost of the goods is likely to fluctuate substantially; and 
(b) the regulations so permit.  
This may sound a bit technical. 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, Motion No. 7 would introduce an entirely new concept into the SIMA legislation. 
It really has to do with the retroactivity that we have a serious objection. 
I do not understand how this would work. 
Therefore we would not support this motion.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Mr. Speaker, we will support this amendment.  
It could be applied, we feel. 
We think it is a step in the right direction. 
It also sends a message.  
Once again, we are not inventing sliced bread. 
It happens rarely, but it has happened at Revenue Canada. 
We therefore support Motion No. 7. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
It would unnecessarily complicate the administration of Canada's trade remedy system. 
The government would not be supportive of this motion.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The recorded division on Motion No. 7 stands deferred.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Unfortunately it did not get up before that time. 
Our current system is to appoint them.  
This can be done without constitutional change. 
The confusion comes when we want to change the numbers of senators that represent provinces. 
Our first senator, Stan Waters, was appointed to the Senate without constitutional change. 
My bill is significant. 
They want to have a say. 
It is time we caught up.  
Originally our Senate was meant to represent the regions. 
That is what my bill would do.  
Last month Canadians witnessed a Senate election in Alberta. 
There are now two senators in waiting. 
Nearly a million votes is a significant number. 
There were a million Albertan votes for an elected Senate. 
These two senators beat that record.  
As it now stands it is simply undemocratic.  
In theory both houses have almost equal powers. 
Senators must be held accountable. 
Yet there is absolutely no accountability in the upper chamber and this must change. 
The Senate is exempt from any accountability to the people. 
Another issue is that many people say that it will cost too much. 
The cost is not great. 
It simply means printing another ballot.  
Very few Canadians want to leave the Senate as it is. 
This is not a wishy-washy issue. 
As demonstrated by the polls and by Canadians they want this to happen. 
He said that it was realistic to hope this would be achieved one day. 
This was done in reverse with the former government. 
They loaded it up with Conservatives. 
This simply does not serve the interest of Canadians.  
To whom are senators accountable? 
Originally they were supposed to be accountable to the provinces, accountable to the regions. 
This was historic, democratic reform. 
It is time to bring democracy to Canada's upper house.  
We as members of parliament answer to our constituents. 
If we do not do well, we are thrown out as we should be. 
This is the real wrong in our Senate.  
We get wrangling and haranguing, no change. 
Reform of the Senate is extremely important. 
The Prime Minister also said in the House: 
It must be a Senate that is elected, effective and equitable.  
Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise tonight to speak on this issue. 
That is the problem I have with this bill. 
Reform of the Senate is a very important issue. 
It is one that the Senate has wrestled with.  
I do not understand how that furthers the cause of democracy.  
There are a lot of very talented Canadians who work in the other place. 
They do good work on behalf of the country and they want reform. 
This is the example the Reform Party would put forward of how this should work. 
And the Prime Minister.  
We made provisions for aboriginal representation. 
What did the Reform Party do? 
I supported the Charlottetown accord for those very principles. 
They have 11.5% of the Senate seats. 
The Reform Party is proposing that we enshrine that, that we give that inequality legitimacy. 
There seems to be no particular advantage to be gained from that. 
I support the goal. 
We need to sit down and reform the Senate. 
That is the way we will get to true constitutional change.  
That is a process I hope all members would support. 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
I understand that attitude, and fully share it.  
What concrete or useful effect has it had on our lives? 
And you could go as far back as the day of your birth, Mr. Speaker. 
That is a lot of money. 
It is not necessarily needy people who are appointed.  
I can understand that. 
In Alberta, there is a very strong movement in favour of a new appointment process. 
Elsewhere, people are less concerned.  
In Quebec, the issue is basically settled. 
They are absolutely right, particularly in the current context.  
There is never any excuse for wasting money. 
It costs $50 million a year. 
Over the last 20 years, that adds up to $1 billion. 
How could we get rid of the Senate? 
In the meantime, we would at least not be throwing $50 million down the drain.  
I am sure this would meet with widespread approval. 
Ultimately, and this is where the problem arises, the senators themselves would have to vote. 
There is not a lot to do. 
The Prime Minister can add positions in the Senate as he likes. 
There is a problem there too. 
The other senators have designations. 
Do they even know who their senator is? 
At some point accountability gets a bit thin. 
There is nothing to indicate that things will be any different in an elected Senate. 
We are not for adding more levels, on the contrary. 
This could get things moving. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I am glad to enter into the debate. 
I have enjoyed the two previous speeches. 
The equal side of the triple E is where the real barrier is. 
That I could have supported.  
We have chucked that away. 
We chose not to avail ourselves of that opportunity. 
It is no longer there for us. 
I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of those polls. 
Do you want an elected Senate? 
Would you rather see an abolished Senate? 
Would you rather leave the Senate exactly the way it is?  
Forty-five per cent say they would like an elected Senate. 
We find that the current situation cannot be fixed. 
Some things are irretrievably broken. 
The figure is 57% or 59% for abolition. 
He was talking about the last parliament.  
Last summer a petition was circulated broadly across Canada. 
I believe that is the figure. 
We have not seen the tally yet. 
Again, that was done in the course of a couple of weeks. 
I will read some of the preamble from the petition.  
The petition is getting a lot of support right across the country. 
There is multiparty support. 
I would be happy to share the quotes with the member from the Reform Party.  
It is a very tangible, visceral issue. 
She is a champion of social justice in that regard. 
That is all within the realm of possibility. 
I would like to spend just one minute on the numbers. 
The province of Manitoba was cited in the Reform Party's speech. 
Those are the real numbers. 
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
I would like to get back to focusing on this bill.  
I would like to begin with a few comments. 
The hon. member of the Reform Party has spoken of polls. 
It may well be the only poll of interest to me at present.  
I would like to address the bill, a bill that unfortunately lacks credibility. 
That is absolutely false.  
The member should look further into this.  
Therefore, this bill is unconstitutional and out of order.  
However, we have something interesting to propose. 
Bill C-382 does not solve anything. 
The Reform member told us about the context in which the bill was introduced. 
It was on the eve of an election to elect a senator in Alberta. 
It was merely to put more emphasis on the election of an Alberta senator.  
So, the Reform Party has to go back to the drawing board.  
First, we propose to limit a senator's term of office to 10 years.  
This would not be a precedent. 
This would be the first step. 
If the Senate were abolished, the role of this House would change automatically. 
It would be a major change. 
Would the number of members be increased? 
The number of senators from Quebec is protected under the Constitution. 
Let us stop using senators as a political currency. 
Let us be serious. 
However, they are going about it in a negative fashion. 
Even in their document on a new Canada, it is incomplete. 
We did that here. 
We could take a step forward in the case of the Senate. 
It could be 10 years, 7 years or 12 years. 
There may be abolitionists in the Senate. 
We had reasons to do so. 
The Senate is important. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
He was going to reform it. 
It is a broken promise.  
Furthermore, there were a number of inequities in the accord.  
That is the way it looks. 
That is the perception of many people. 
I strongly think that we have to revise it. 
We have to redesign the way the Senate is selected.  
But with senators Canadians can never do anything. 
Senators are appointed by someone else. 
Our people find that offensive. 
Mr. Speaker, I think my time is up. 
I could speak a long time on this subject. 
I am certainly not finished, but I am going to stop.  
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
It has been done. 
It was done with Stan Waters. 
It does not fix all of the problems. 
Canadians are not ready for constitutional change. 
I believe my bill is doable. 
It has been proven to be doable by elections already held in Alberta. 
I would suggest that we move forward.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Shamattawa is facing horrific social problems. 
Current efforts to deal with this problem have proven to be inadequate. 
He said that the government was working diligently on these problems. 
A teenage boy, high on solvents, shot and killed another boy.  
All that is needed is a relatively small amount of aid.  
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
We did not stop there or our efforts will not stop there.  
To conclude, we are working very diligently in this regard. 
I thank the hon. member for her questions. 
We want to resolve them as much as the hon. member for Churchill does.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.33 p.m.)
