The Senate met at 1:30 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Erminie J. Cohen :
In the press release accompanying their new report, "Preschool Children:
As stated by John Murphy, Chair of the National Council of Welfare: 
Honourable senators, I could not agree more. 
Inaugural Celebrations for New Territory 
April 1 was a big, historic day for Nunavut. 
It was a first-class event. 
The elders can take pride in seeing their endeavours come to pass. 
The children are the beneficiaries of their knowledge of the customs.  
The first discussions began almost 30 years ago. 
Today, there is a newly formed Nunavut government of 19 elected members. 
That was the beginning.  
Therefore, the ITC office was moved to Ottawa in 1972. 
That was almost 30 years ago, and now the matter is settled.  
This is not the case now. 
We look forward to the future with great hope.  
I was appointed to the Senate 22 years ago, onApril 5, 1977. 
The poor huskies were sitting there sweating in the 80 degree heat. 
We still have quite a bit of work to do. 
That is a big area to govern. 
It will not be easy to visit the remote communities. 
Some can only be reached by airplane. 
Our future lies in our children and we have given them a wonderful legacy.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
A number of senators helped in this endeavour, I understand. 
The family of Senator Kroft made some contribution as did Senator Watt. 
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Thursday, April 15, 1999 I will move: 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the answer is very much in the affirmative. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
In that training process, you train for any eventuality.  
Honourable senators, I have one final supplementary question.  
I thank the minister for his response, although he was less than candid. 
I do not know why we play these games. 
These are the numbers we are talking about, not 800. 
Is it the same unit?  
Honourable senators, the numbers that I have heard range from 500 to 800. 
I have never heard the number 2,000 mentioned. 
Honourable senators, my question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Whatever initiatives he can undertake would be most welcome and supported by Canada.  
North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Will the government leader take it forward and personally present it to the government? 
How will the Senate know what happens to the motion? 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I can report immediately. 
Senator Roche had requested that the resolution be transferred to the appropriate authorities. 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
The black judge was Her Honour Judge Corrine Sparks.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I would like to summarize the new and disturbing developments that took place yesterday.  
The U.S. President no longer rules out the sending of ground forces.  
Is he really aware of what is going on in the region?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The honourable senator is absolutely correct:
There were incursions across the border into Albania yesterday. 
Apparently, it happened on two or three occasions. 
I have not heard any news of any incursions of that nature today. 
However, it is a very serious situation.  
Senator Andreychuk asked yesterday whether Russia and Ukraine would be consulted. 
There is a meeting of European Community ministers going on as we speak. 
It is not yet known what action might be taken on that proposal.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I did not say that, honourable senators. 
Is the Prime Minister afraid to advise us that a vote will be taken?  
We have just had a very useful debate in the other place. 
Honorable Marcel Prud'homme:
I do not think of Parliament as being only the House of Commons. 
No decisions can be made here. 
The House of Commons, with all due respect, will decide. 
That is my comment.  
I would be pleased to do so, honourable senators.  
We can take whatever action we wish to take, either collectively, or as individual senators.  
We have established a long-standing friendship with the people of Russia. 
I am sure the Honourable Senator Prud'homme attended, as did Senator Stollery.  
I chaired that meeting.  
Senator Prud'homme chaired the committee. 
Senator Roche indicated that he was present.  
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
I leave that with the minister.  
Hon. Michael A. Meighen :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I thank the Honourable Senator Meighen for his question. 
Perhaps I could just reiterate them.  
I wanted to again alert honourable senators to that initiative taken by the German government. 
Delayed Answers to Oral Questions 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Religious Freedom in Tibet Under Chinese Occupation-Government Position 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Consiglio Di Nino on March 18, 1999) 
The Canada-China Legislative Association will be holding its second meeting in October.  
Application of Allocation for Air Forces in Budget-Government Position 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Consiglio Di Nino on March 17, 1999) 
Not costed as a T.C. Mission* 
India, Pakistan and Malaysia 
Korea, Phillippines and Thailand 
Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and Chile 
(Response to question raised by Hon. J. Michael Forrestall on March 18, 1999) 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Pat Carney on March 25, 1999) 
Thus, any lifting of the moratoria should be coordinated.  
Thus, this matter is not under active consideration. 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
However, I managed to do so quickly that evening. 
Honourable senators will recall that there was some controversy surrounding the abstentions. 
This is maintained in the new Act. 
This point is not addressed by the Criminal Lawyers' Association.  
Honourable senators, I am not sure that I agree with Mr. Greenspan. 
I am not sure that he is right. 
Let us get this bill through.  
Honourable senators, I was put in this unfortunate position. 
I was not able to get the assent of my leadership to do that. 
The answer was four to eight hours. 
Let me start by telling honourable senators about one concern. 
It is not very complicated, but it is quite fundamental.  
My response is that that is not our concern. 
Hence, my first amendment.  
That is the minister's position. 
I tried to put it fairly. 
- I believe, honourable senators, that 26 states have the death penalty - 
- makes this a very real and pressing concern by us. 
and I will get into that in a moment.  
Honourable senators, I disagree with the minister. 
I disagree with the government. 
Who is on my side? 
I will tell you who is on my side. 
The Pope is on my side, and the American bishops are on my side.  
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Honourable senators, I should like to deal with the first amendment. 
It is not a long one.  
I move, seconded by Senator Joyal: 
(a) by replacing lines 28 and 29 on page 17 with the following: 
( c ) the request for extradition is made for"; and 
That is my first amendment.  
That is what Amnesty International wanted. 
This is a complicated matter. 
Is one murder co-equal to genocide? 
Yes, but should we not treat them somewhat differently, if possible?  
That is the past. 
The minister's response is that we defend the Charter. 
However, the same appeal provisions provide an opportunity for the person so indicted to appeal. 
Therefore, I do not agree with the minister on that point.  
Honourable senators, that is the substance of my second proposition; a two-track system. 
I did that after reading this brief statement from the minister. 
She goes on to suggest why.  
I will not be back in The Hague until 11 or 12 April 1999. 
I am unclear from your memo as to when you need to hear from us. 
Obviously, that is because I was unclear as to when I would require the information.  
He is one of Canada's outstanding experts in this field.  
Honourable senators, I return to my second amendment. 
I beg your indulgence. 
It runs several pages but it is all in aid of a fast track: 
(a) by substituting the term "general extradition agreement" for "extradition agreement" wherever it appears; 
(b) by substituting the term "specific extradition agreement" for "specific agreement" wherever it appears; 
(c) in clause 2, on page 2 
(i) by adding after line 5 the following: 
(ii) by deleting lines 6 to 10; 
(iii) by replacing line 11 with the following: 
" "extradition partner" means a State"; 
(iv) by adding after line 15 the following: 
" "specific extradition agreement" means an agreement referred to in section 10 that is in force.  
(vi) by replacing lines 29 to 31 - 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Do you by any chance have a French text?  
The French text will be available shortly. 
I am giving it now so that it can be simultaneously provided.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The interpreters cannot follow. 
You will have to slow down, please.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
On a point of order, Senator Bolduc?  
I acknowledge that the amendment will be translated. 
Otherwise, how are we going to understand?  
My second objection is much more serious. 
Senator Grafstein is a hardworking man and a model in the Senate. 
There is no doubt about that. 
Her role, however, is essentially that of a Canadian judge. 
She was asked for her opinion on a policy. 
We are in the process of forming policy. 
We would like to have your advice on that.  
I must say that this bothered me. 
I have enough experience to tell you that this is not acceptable. 
I think that Senator Grafstein, as we say in English - 
- got carried away by the case. 
Those are my two objections.  
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Honourable senators, if I may respond to that, I know it is unusual. 
I am in violent agreement with Senator Bolduc. 
The minister opened this door.  
It is not relevant. 
Quite frankly, it is tangential to my argument. 
I am not meaning here to be critical of Judge Arbour. 
If I have overstepped my bounds, I will withdraw. 
I agree with the honourable senator.  
Honourable senators, I do not question Senator Grafstein's ethics. 
There is no doubt that he meant well. 
Nor do I question Madam Arbour's ethics. 
This is very bothersome. 
"It's a mistake, a huge mistake."  
We often hear witnesses from the Department of Finance. 
I am always careful not to trip them up on policy issues. 
That is not on. 
I think she should not be saying that. 
If she did, it is a mistake. 
In my view, her opinion should not be sought. 
I consider her comparable to a deputy minister. 
They must tell him with conviction. 
Then, the minister decides. 
In the interests of our process, it is important that this not be referred to. 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
I agree with the Deputy Leader of the Government. 
There is a fundamental problem with the process. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
That practice is clear. 
It is outlined in Beauchesne. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, I think that Senators Kinsella and Carstairs have raised an excellent point. 
The Speaker could rule tomorrow.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
I would expect that there should not even be a debate on this point.  
First, on the question of the French text, I was concerned about that as well. 
The translator has been working on this for some 8 hours. 
I accept the fact that this matter is highly complicated. 
It was not my intention to be insensitive to that fact.  
Honourable senators, I have a point of order!  
Honourable senators, you cannot divorce Madam Justice Arbour from her position. 
She is Madam Justice Arbour. 
You cannot disassociate her from that office.  
We are getting into deeper and deeper difficulty. 
My heart could not go to the end of the debate. 
I am trying to be reasonable in making an intelligent proposal to Senator Grafstein. 
Senator Grafstein can then continue. 
In addition, we will have time to see his amendments in both official languages.  
The debate on the amendments is suspended ipso facto . 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Does Senator Kinsella wish to participate?  
Honourable senators, perhaps Senator Grafstein could adjourn the debate and continue with it tomorrow. 
It would obviate a decision from the Speaker on this matter.  
It does not solve the problem.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
It seems to me that that might be the best solution at this time. 
I could rule now. 
However, I would prefer to examine our precedents more clearly. 
On motion of Senator Grafstein, debate adjourned.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
I am ready and willing. 
There is no such a thing as an independent.  
I see all the interested parties are present today in the Senate. 
Will they be present tomorrow? 
I hope we will come to this question soon. 
I do not object to the suggestion of Senator Carstairs. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. James F. Kelleher :
Honourable senators, it is moved by myself - 
Honourable senators, might I interrupt what I think Senator Kelleher is attempting to do? 
Honourable senators, I rise on a point of order. 
Senator Carstairs moved that the Senate adjourn. 
Any other senator may say, "What about mine? 
Of course, she can say, "Stand," but we shall see.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
If he is agreeable to giving unanimous consent, then we will proceed to the adjournment.  
Is there unanimous consent, honourable senators?  
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
