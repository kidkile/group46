The House met at 11 a.m. 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent to proceed now to Routine Proceedings?  
GOVERNMENT SERVICES ACT, 1999 
YOUTH CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT 
That process is underway. 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
He told me that he had heard the fatal gun shot. 
I remember thinking ``Just what is our community coming to?'' 
I also remember thinking about the parents of the victim. 
A few days later the suspected killer was himself killed in an act of revenge. 
Again, I remember thinking about the safety of our streets.  
An hour later the phone rang again. 
My wife answered the phone. 
They wanted us there right away. 
Jesse had been stabbed.  
A single stab wound to the back had pierced his heart. 
Jesse would have been 23 years old tomorrow.  
There was an arrest within days. 
I make no apology for that. 
Obviously it was not a priority of the present government. 
What do we have? 
We have new spin-doctoring from the government. 
For every step forward there is a step backward. 
What has the minister been doing for the past two years? 
One would have thought she would have had this in place upfront.  
This was done to some extent with the February budget. 
We now have legislation. 
I assure them that we are quite prepared to flesh out the legislation. 
The government has shown on numerous occasions its unwillingness to listen to reason. 
No wonder we have problems in the criminal justice system.  
The committee listened to the provinces. 
The government failed to include the major concerns of at least some of the provinces. 
She characterizes the proposal as barbaric. 
Fortunately for all of us Shaughnessy did not suffer that fate.  
There is another example of failing to consult. 
It merely provides the opportunity for the provinces to bring in their own legislation.  
The government does not listen to its partners in the administration of youth justice. 
It does not participate in adequate consultation. 
The minister has decided to formalize the whole matter of police discretion. 
It is the same with most childhood pranks. 
He included it within his private member's Bill C-210. 
He understood the necessity to support the police. 
Many officers were already doing this without legislative authority. 
Others were afraid to use their discretion. 
It is really nothing new. 
This is the same for today's youth. 
This is all we are looking for from legislation.  
Nothing could be further from the truth in both respects. 
Furthermore, the government has shown little interest in correcting these misinterpretations. 
After all, it is now part of its legislation.  
I have had to cover the issue on a number of different types of media. 
The law has been around for a number of years. 
My proposal merely enhances the potential punishment. 
It has nothing to do with the crimes of the young person. 
Both the young person and the adult sign the agreement. 
The offence has to do with the court agreement. 
It has nothing to do with the ordinary responsibilities of the parent.  
There is only the obligation to supervise. 
His father had signed an undertaking to supervise some months earlier.  
Fortunately we have a committee process to go through. 
We have amendments to propose. 
At some time we will be back here to make comments at third reading.  
It did the same thing with adult conditional sentencing.  
There are many uses for conditional sentencing. 
What did the government use it for? 
It used it to reduce the cost of incarceration. 
It said the jails and the prisons were too full and were too costly. 
Killers got conditional sentences. 
Repeat offenders got conditional sentences.  
She requested the justice committee to review the issue. 
She will take much of her direction from the Prime Minister's Office. 
The word presume is key. 
Let us see how non-violent is defined. 
Pedophiles cause psychological harm to young children. 
Extrajudicial measures will be available to repeat offenders. 
There is no further limitation. 
Sometimes I wonder whether this government is interested in putting anyone in prison. 
It seems intent on doing the same thing with our young offenders.  
The definition is very limited. 
The adult sentence for murder is life imprisonment. 
There is no change.  
She is buried just a stone's throw from my son. 
I will illustrate further how this government just does not listen. 
Bill C-37 became law in December 1995. 
I commented publicly, saying I told you so. 
This is what happened. 
I will briefly mention the second half of the definition of presumptive offence. 
In practice it will have almost no applicability. 
Most courts will have difficulty in distinguishing between bodily harm and serious bodily harm.  
There are no words such as deterrence and denunciation. 
All young persons must be rehabilitated and reintegrated in a short period of time. 
There will be challenges in almost every case against their imposition. 
Lawyers will be fully and extensively employed. 
Judges will be permitted to continue in their lenient ways. 
Section 72 does not limit this discretion in any way.  
The whole issue of deeming of young persons is of the same nature. 
The youth criminal justice act will change nothing. 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Those who are applying it properly succeed where others fail. 
This legislation did not spring up over night. 
It is the result of several decades of reflection. 
In Quebec, that approach had been stressed long before, in the Prevost report. 
A lot has been done to reach that point.  
And the judge continues, a little further on in his extremely important report: 
Mr. Justice Jasmin probably already knew the current Minister of Justice. 
One such simplistic response is substituting get-tough measures for educational approaches.  
The Jasmin report is often mentioned by those who support Quebec's approach. 
As a member from Quebec, I cannot ignore it. 
The Young Offenders Act is getting very good results. 
Youth crime is steadily declining. 
The federal Minister of Justice failed in her duty to inform. 
He was very candid in his acknowledgement.  
All parties involved in Quebec viewed this with alarm.  
The Quebec bar association was bang on. 
Quebec's judges cannot ignore sentences handed down in other courts''. 
Those in doubt need only read the bill.  
Perhaps the minister does not know that.  
The minister cannot ignore the advice of these experts.  
They are the ones who will have to implement the new act. 
Again, the Young Offenders Act is a good act. 
It is effective and it gives good results. 
Therefore, why change it? 
Reformers are still not satisfied. 
They now want criminal justice to apply to 10 year olds. 
The government caved in pathetically.  
This government will never succeed in maintaining a balanced approach to juvenile crime. 
It is much too concerned by its election ambitions in western Canada. 
Who can trust such a flip-flop government? 
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
I follow some eloquent speakers, who have put forward concerns. 
I just remind him of that. 
I know he is cognizant of it.  
That being said, I would like to comment first about some statements that were made. 
I will deal with the bill and the minister's comments shortly.  
That is the job of the opposition. 
Unfortunately, members of the official opposition, the Reform Party, have forgotten that.  
The comments made by the member for Surrey North tended to defeat their own purpose. 
They are to be congratulated for their input. 
There are some good things in this legislation. 
It is important that we offer a balanced approach. 
Sometimes hysteria is put forward. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
That is a point of debate.  
I have enumerated some of the good things in the legislation. 
I understand how sensitive sometimes the Reform Party is to the truth.  
I go on to suggest some of the good things. 
My hon. Conservative colleague from Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough will understand this. 
They are down, as the minister has said. 
They are down in Canada as a whole. 
The bill also fails to deal with some of the concerns of the provinces. 
That has been cut back in recent years. 
Saskatchewan, Manitoba and British Columbia have sought that kind of funding. 
As I have indicated, all of the provinces have.  
Justice has to be speedy if it is to be just. 
Many of the concerns of the provinces have not been met.  
That will require careful examination.  
That will require careful examination.  
We know that and we cannot change that for young people. 
The Minister of Justice is right in one sense. 
They should be dealt with through social services in each province because they are children.  
Perhaps the penalty should be increased for those who do that. 
It is a section that will require careful examination. 
The difference is this change will make it a hybrid offence. 
The crime is clearly the failure to supervise. 
That is something we will check on balance at committee.  
As I have indicated, there are many areas to this act. 
There are over 101 sections that need to be examined carefully. 
The agenda has been pushed.  
What we have in this new legislation, in a way to balance, is tremendous discretion. 
It is in part a response to find that balance. 
At the end of the day we need legislation based on sound public policy. 
We need neither hysteria nor platitudes. 
We owe them a piece of legislation that works, that balances and that is fair.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, quite frankly, I am appalled at the hon. member. 
The real problem is exactly that. 
It is not hysteria. 
It is not just the official opposition saying that. 
The fact is we must include them if we are to help them.  
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond. 
I say commit crimes but they are not committing crimes, they are behaving badly. 
The member asked how we can remedy that. 
The suggestion came from his own party. 
We talk about ending child poverty in this country. 
I know we say it over and over. 
Sometimes I am puzzled at why some people take various stands on things. 
We need to improve schools. 
We have a crisis in education across the country. 
Governments are cutting back on teachers. 
We have kids going to school without sufficient learning tools.  
Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to the member. 
I understand the statistics are quite skewed. 
I understand New Brunswick has recently closed a number of prisons. 
The figures are quite different there. 
The rate of incarceration is much lower.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question. 
I go back to my concern about this legislation. 
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comment of the hon. member. 
What we tend to hear about is the person who is hurt. 
That is what I am saying.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
I want to begin with the purpose of the act. 
I think that is progress.  
I would remind the minister that there are really two kinds of simplicity. 
I turn to the victims of youth crime. 
These provisions all represent steps in the right direction. 
It is the story of the good samaritan with a Liberal twist. 
He was beaten, robbed and left half dead by the side of the street. 
Like most Liberal policy statements, their words reflect a half truth. 
My colleagues have already done this and will continue to do this. 
Section 109 of this bill covers the publication of the names of young offenders. 
Again, my colleagues will elaborate on these deficiencies. 
These are the deficiencies of half measures. 
That is why we say it needs a lot of corrective amendments.  
Nothing could be further from the truth.  
Let me confine my remarks to prevention. 
Instead what do we see? 
There are two huge reasons. 
It is the same story.  
Unfortunately bureaucratic information systems can only transmit certain types of information. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Durham.  
Eight per cent were sentenced to more than six months.  
I do not believe that sent out the right message. 
Criminal activity is an antisocial activity. 
Canadians have lost faith in the Young Offenders Act. 
The bill reflects the protection of society. 
Individuals who commit crimes should have their names published. 
It would be a warning and hopefully a deterrent to others. 
This is something Canadians have wanted and the government has responded to.  
Committing a crime is not a lark. 
It is not something one does for fun. 
There has been much public debate about the publishing of names of young offenders. 
This is a first in federal legislation. 
At some point these individuals will be back on the street. 
The follow up is crucial if the program is to be successful.  
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
I come to this debate with some new-found experience. 
It is the second time this has happened. 
Therefore, I speak with some experience today.  
I come to this debate today saying there is definitely a problem. 
I can now say that I am a victim of this type of crime. 
People are wasting their days away at the taxpayers' expense.  
We live in a very plastic society. 
We turn on the television set and see crimes committed. 
We do not believe there are any human beings behind the crimes. 
We have had some positive results. 
Youth crime has declined in these areas.  
I listened attentively to the Leader of the Official Opposition. 
These things often are not predictable. 
Parents understand that personalities can be very different.  
It takes the custody situation out of the family unit. 
I know of many dysfunctional families. 
There are limitations as to what we can do to empower families. 
Basically it takes two courses of action. 
We all have a tendency to wish there were simple solutions.  
The reality is that it is a societal issue.  
And I hope I do not have another incident like the one last week.  
Mr. John O'Reilly (Haliburton-Victoria-Brock, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the new name of the riding is Haliburton-Victoria-Brock. 
It reflects the fact that there is only one Haliburton. 
There are three Victorias and many Brocks. 
The name change reflects that.  
I have not gotten over the last C-68 we had in here. 
I listened to the member for Calgary Southwest, the Leader of the Opposition. 
He has a rather simplistic approach. 
He talks first about punishment and asks how society will be protected. 
I find that kind of offensive.  
As an officer in that role I came in contact with many police officers. 
That is what this bill tends to look at. 
It is not all of the problem.  
I do not think that should be taken lightly. 
If they are going to reoffend, they will reoffend.  
We came to our third judge before finally they talked about sentencing. 
I hear my lawyer friends getting upset about that. 
The fact is it is a good part of their practice. 
Bill C-68 is not perfect. 
Everything has to be tested in the court system. 
It puts an onus on people. 
Most of them fight their way into gangs. 
A lot of gangs are there. 
We are talking about poor, underprivileged, abused people. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Did the hon. member indicate that he was to be sharing his time?  
Mr. John O'Reilly:
No, I did not.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Haliburton-Victoria-Brock has an additional 10 minutes.  
Mr. John O'Reilly:
I do not mind doing 20 minutes. 
Reading was never your strong point.  
Mr. John O'Reilly:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Does that mean they have 30 minutes speaking time?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. John O'Reilly:
Ten plus twenty is thirty. 
The member is absolutely right. 
I am very glad he was able to work that out. 
It takes a fair bit of time.  
I appreciate that the simplistic approach applied by the Reform Party is well meaning. 
Some Reformers are very intelligent former Conservatives and Liberals. 
He got away from his substance abuse and alcohol abuse. 
He got away from the abusive nature that surrounded him. 
Today he is a productive member of society.  
We have to teach them values. 
We have to teach them the societal things expected of them. 
He could play any instrument. 
He was a very talented person. 
That same young man is now playing in a band and is very productive. 
These are a couple of examples the Reform Party cares to not notice.  
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Break the Cycle of Poverty''.  
Mass illiteracy has left them disadvantaged, vulnerable and impoverished. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
GIRL GUIDES OF CANADA 
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
To achieve the award Pathfinders completed challenges in a number of different areas.  
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
The 14 communities in Nunavik now have their Junior Rangers patrols. 
They are supported by the Canadian armed forces and by the senior Rangers. 
Nakuqmiik to the Nunavik Rangers.  
Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Middlesex, Lib.):
Canadians can be proud of the job they have done. 
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
Strikers are back to work today but with no contract. 
There are no assurances they will not again bring grain movement to its knees.  
Farmers can no longer afford these losses caused by government negligence.  
MAJOR LIONEL GUY D'ARTOIS 
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
Major D'Artois enrolled as a private during the second world war. 
I offer my most sincere condolences to the family.  
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
The Canadian government must take responsibility for this failed economic transition. 
Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
Mr. Jewison is also the founder of the prestigious Canadian Film Centre, in Toronto.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Second, the government sends him a reference number in the mail.  
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, today is World Water Day.  
For Canadians, freshwater has an important real and symbolic value. 
Nine per cent of the world's renewable freshwater is found within Canada. 
We must do everything we can to protect it. 
Freshwater sustains our life and health on a daily basis. 
It is a commodity worth preserving.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, today, March 22, is World Water Day. 
Without safe drinkable water we cannot survive.  
We must value and protect this vital resource.  
We must ensure that all Canadians benefit from our resources. 
Canada's water supply should not be diminished so that a few will profit.  
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Quebeckers have much to think about right now. 
Lucien Bouchard claims to be carrying on the tradition of Jean Lesage and Robert Bourassa. 
These men had a clearer notion of the word ``democracy''. 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
We must work together to make society a fairer and more democratic one.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Our position has been consistent since our 1996 policy conference. 
The best choices can and must be made by the people it affects, Canadian families. 
Unfortunately Liberals voted against it. 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Mutual has developed 600 jobs in four centres of excellence in Ottawa. 
BACK TO WORK LEGISLATION 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
It seems odd to us. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
He sits on his hands in question period. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
We were upfront and open. 
This is perfectly proper.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this is not about jobs. 
The Prime Minister's assistant personally intervened in the process.  
Why will he not release all of his notes and records on these transactions?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, these have not been private dealings. 
The Prime Minister, as the local MP, has worked for his community. 
There is nothing wrong with that.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we are not talking about jobs. 
We are not talking about local communities. 
We are not talking about the Prime Minister associating with his imaginary homeless friends. 
Why would the Prime Minister have dealings with these people in the first place? 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, these are unwarranted innuendoes and assertions. 
He is attacking the PQ provincial government of associating with crooked people. 
Those assertions are false. 
If the hon. member had any courage and was straightforward he would withdraw these insinuations. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
There is a difference. 
This is a conflict of interest. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
He looked into the matter as MP. 
He had a representative of his office attend meetings with officials. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
He has admitted misappropriating a million dollars from a company in Belgium. 
The Prime Minister must remember that place. 
After all, that is where he hosted the Liberal caucus last summer.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
CANADIAN EMBASSY IN BERLIN 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
This is another suspicious piece of business.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it was very simple. 
There were four very distinct criteria. 
Cost was another criteria. 
The fourth criteria was how it would work as an embassy. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is just being silly. 
We should all be proud of the work that Canadians are doing in this area.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
The hon. member for Roberval.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the minister is doing a very poor job of defending himself. 
Only one person was in favour of the Winnipeg project.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Canadians will make that decision.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
If it is concerned, what does it plan to do about it?  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Is this no longer on the government's agenda? 
Is that the situation we are in?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Mr. Speaker, Yvon Duhaime is a convicted criminal with financial problems. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
That is what it is on the books for.  
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Will the Deputy Prime Minister show some courage, show some integrity and ask- 
I want the hon. member to please go directly to his question. 
It is not a question of courage.  
Anything less smells of a cover-up to protect the Prime Minister.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
[ Translation ] <``No, no, no, there can be no favoritism''. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Is this the minister's definition of standard eligibility criteria?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
How can he explain that?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
It has been supported by the city of Shawinigan and the mayor.  
That is what the hon. member for Saint-Maurice did. 
He did his duty.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Women and young people are victims of discrimination. 
We already knew that, but we had to await the report. 
We waited, and now it is confirmed.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
That is one of the priorities of our government. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is not a question of study after study. 
What does the member for Quebec say to that?  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
That is the conflict of interest.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The mayor of Shawinigan was there. 
Some people were asking the Prime Minister to do more. 
The hon. member for Fraser Valley.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
He used to talk about the end of patronage and the ethics counsellor. 
Now we find out that the ethics code is secret. 
We cannot even see it. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Why does he not use it?  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Revenue.  
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
In addition, we are seeking legal action to stop the illegal activity. 
Canadians want us to resolve this issue and we will. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Let us look at the evidence. 
The Dow Jones hit 10,000 points. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Those are the facts.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's facts are simply wrong.  
Our productivity has improved in the 1990s over the 1980s. 
Of course we want our productivity to improve more. 
Of course we must invest in research and development. 
We must continue to eliminate debt. 
We must continue to get taxes so that it will increase. 
That is what we are about.  
BACK TO WORK LEGISLATION 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Second, the proposed legislation does not tell us what their settlement is to be.  
That is why they are included in the law.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
I challenge the government. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this has been looked into on the floor of the House of Commons. 
The questions and answers confirm that the insinuations of the hon. member are without foundation.  
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
He has been quite clear about that. 
I am sure all members of the House have confidence in him.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
This government recognizes the importance of all research. 
We have invested heavily and shall continue to do so. 
YOUTH CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
The parole provisions that exist in the Criminal Code will continue to exist.  
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau-Mirabel, BQ):
As well, it has recently worked with Corporation Espace 2002. 
There are also other projects soon to be announced.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
We will ensure that we maintain that safety through the coast guard.  
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
YOUTH CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
The hon. Minister of Justice.  
This is the party that cares about young people.  
MEDICAL USE OF MARIJUANA 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We shall be doing so shortly.

QUESTIONS PASSED AS ORDERS FOR RETURNS 
Question No. 124- Mr. Derrek Konrad: 
Question No. 183- Mr. Rick Casson: 
QUESTIONS ON THE ORDER PAPER 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
GOVERNMENT SERVICES ACT, 1999 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.) moved: 
During consideration of the said bill, no division shall be deferred.  
We agree this is important and urgent.  
It is urgent that action be taken immediately.  
Canadians are counting on us today. 
I ask the House to approve swiftly the motion before us. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
They did not bargain in good faith. 
Otherwise we would have had today a negotiated settlement.  
I hope the agriculture minister is following my speech very closely today. 
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:
You guys are worried, aren't you? 
You better send a few more task forces up there.  
Perhaps there could be a little more order so the hon. member could be heard.  
Mr. Speaker, it is behind by 1.2 million tax returns. 
They deserve that money and they deserve it on time.  
The government saw this coming. 
Here again it goes right back to those poor negotiating tactics. 
It attempts to squeeze the union people and farmers out of every penny they have.  
We also heard another member speaking today with regard to corrections. 
Why did they have to close that loophole, that little quirk? 
We can continue on about the incompetence of this government in its labour negotiations. 
We look back to when we were dealing with Bill C-19, a labour bill. 
I had to tell him it did not.  
Let us go back to March 18. 
The summation of everything I have said to this point is quite clear. 
This government since 1993 has not bargained in good faith. 
They failed in all those 30 years. 
That was when governments lost control of negotiations. 
I look across and I see the Liberals and I see the Conservatives. 
They have brought us here today.  
On Friday, March 19 the government came into the House to put forward a motion. 
This government has not taken care of farmers' interests. 
It has not taken care of the PSAC union members' interests. 
It does not rest on the opposition members. 
We sat here that night. 
It is all in Hansard . 
There were no solutions coming forward from the government. 
It threatened the union. 
It talked about hostages and that kind of thing. 
There were no details.  
The Canadian public bought that in the election of 1993 by electing the Liberal government. 
I do not expect to see them make that mistake again.  
Over the weekend I followed the newspapers. 
I have already covered some of the history. 
The freezes continued right through until the last two years. 
They were concerned about the movement of grain through the Vancouver port.  
Let us look at the government's previous history with respect to labour negotiations. 
The postal union strike was not settled. 
This country cannot be run by a dictatorial government. 
That is exactly what back to work legislation is. 
Once again the spin doctors came out. 
I am referring to Bill C-76.  
The time for his regret was back in January. 
I have to refer to it as simply being incompetence.  
That was a nice bit of spin. 
That was the gist of his remarks. 
I have already explained that we had no details on Friday. 
There was a comment by the House leader. 
Like they say in the old school yard, he started it. 
He also said that he did not want to see lost sales exports. 
The hurt for farmers will not stop today. 
It is a sad day but that is what will have to happen.  
Tomorrow we will have to continue on with two things. 
I am certainly looking forward to a Reform type government. 
We will see the truth of the legislation. 
It is not perfect but something is being done. 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
The government has, moreover, had its task made easier for it. 
I think we ought to deal with matters one at a time.  
It is called a special debate. 
That is what we must be discussing. 
It is a process recognized by the parties and by society. 
We support bargaining and civilized balance. 
This has been upset today. 
That agreement was accepted by the union, but rejected by the employer. 
The parties could find a solution, provided they negotiate in good faith. 
This is a serious matter. 
That is how we see it.  
I will summarize our position, which is clear. 
We believe the freedom to unionize exists in Canada for employees and employers. 
Special legislation must be used only as a last resort.  
This has not been shown to be the case here in our opinion. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
I was puzzled by the silence of members of the Reform Party on that issue. 
They were silent and now I know why. 
Who represents whom around here? 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
To date it has not done that. 
It has in fact reneged on that promise.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the NDP member for his question. 
This is very annoying.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to the speech by the member for Trois-Rivieres. 
We see this in the current situation.  
There are differences in salaries between provinces. 
I would hope we could speak in this debate in a civilized and rational manner.  
I would like the comments of the member for Trois-Rivieres on my remarks.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his question.  
It certainly shows us one thing about this government. 
Here we have an example. 
Last year, the government was not interested.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, this seems like deja vu to me. 
We probably heard many of the same debates. 
It is galling to those of us in our caucus. 
The government is piling insult upon insult when it comes to the democratic process.  
It is icing on the cake to the government. 
That had to end. 
The workers were pushed and pushed. 
They tried to negotiate their way out of it after bargaining year after year. 
It was not possible. 
It is almost unbelievable. 
There is no sense. 
The Liberals forgot Nunavut. 
They left it out. 
The people working in Nunavut will have none of it. 
They tried to slide the whole profitability issue in during back to work legislation. 
They wanted to use Canada Post as a cash cow. 
We caught that right away. 
We find it offensive from where we are.  
Certainly wages are part of it. 
These people have not had a raise in pay in seven years. 
They have not had a negotiated settlement in nine years. 
It has been imposed settlements all the time. 
That is not exactly catch-up money. 
They are not asking to make all that up. 
Where is the logic?  
The costing of this spread is $7.8 million. 
This is what is really irritating about this strike. 
We fully endorse and respect the right of workers to withhold their service. 
It is the most peaceful way of handling an impasse. 
In the old days things got rowdy. 
Heads were split open. 
It goes back to the ancient Greeks and Lysistrata . 
They were walking around with little tents instead of togas. 
That is the first reference we have to that kind of organized withholding of services. 
It is a time honoured tradition. 
We have seen those rights trampled on. 
I will not have anything to do with it.  
This is particularly grating as a trade unionist. 
Reformers would like to wipe unions off the face of the earth. 
They have said so publicly. 
One Reform member is the only professional union buster I have ever met. 
They do not even take phone calls from unions. 
They will not acknowledge or recognize organized labour. 
It is almost unbelievable.  
Let us get down to politics since we are in the business of politics. 
Public sector workers, by and large, support Liberals.  
It is trampling on their rights. 
Now they are being ordered back to work.  
The Reform member for Selkirk-Interlake was talking yesterday about a pig in a poke. 
Obviously we will vote against it. 
Are they allowed to go back to the bargaining table and keep negotiating? 
That is what was implied. 
Negotiations are not really over for them. 
They were designated essential a long time ago. 
In other words, it has nothing to do with back to work legislation. 
The government is trying to achieve some other, secondary objective.  
We have seen examples of it. 
That is a breach of trust that borders on theft. 
The government is trampling on their right to withhold their services.  
The other 4,500 must be as confused as I am. 
The 4,500 prison guards must be mystified by this. 
They do not strike.  
These are the increases being imposed on these workers. 
A bunch of us were calculating away. 
Again, stealth and subterfuge.  
It is almost inconceivable. 
I did not think I would see things like this when I came to Ottawa. 
As a trade unionist I went through a great number of issues like this. 
We had the right at least in the private sector.  
It is the only tool we have left.  
That is its next big windfall.  
It pays off its deficit there. 
That was always the excuse. 
Now it is targeting that, zooming in there. 
It was good money. 
The public sector carpenter makes $15. 
How can it be explained? 
Never mind the regional differences. 
It is added insult to injury. 
It is the most peaceful way to solve any kind of impasse. 
It is not violent. 
People look at it as economic violence. 
It is not economic violence. 
What gets foisted on workers is economic violence. 
The threat of layoff is economic violence.  
It will wake a sleeping giant. 
The government will regret it.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is very exciting. 
It sounds like the red flag is about to be waved. 
I am ready to strike into a chorus of the Internationale.  
I would like to comment on the hon. member's remarks. 
I have a great deal of respect for the member. 
I understand his frustration as a man with considerable background in the trade union movement.  
I think the hon. member perhaps got a little carried away in hyperbole. 
I have quite a bit of close personal knowledge of final offer selection. 
I have actually used it in my own negotiations. 
It was law in the province of Manitoba for a number of years. 
It was chucked out by the Tories when they got in. 
That puts a disadvantage.  
Suppose it is Roger Maris dealing with his baseball team. 
Final offer selection originated with pro ball. 
Those are my comments on final offer selection. 
It has its place. 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
How does he feel about the introduction of this bill?  
Mr. Speaker, I am not sure I fully understand the question. 
The translation was a little questionable.  
Our party's position is that it is fundamentally wrong. 
We are always opposed to back to work legislation. 
We are fundamentally opposed to taking away the rights of workers to withhold their services. 
I believe the comments of my leader have been consistent with that party policy.  
Some public servants are paid differently based on where they live.  
It is only that group, the 14,500 blue collar workers, that suffers this inconsistency. 
It is fundamentally wrong.  
How could we forget about Nunavut? 
It is in the papers. 
April 1 is the big day. 
One of the omissions is in the translation. 
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am quite interested in the comments by the hon. NDP member.  
They are paid at a lower scale. 
There are a lot of inequities.  
I liked his comment on final offer selection arbitration. 
There is some good in this. 
That is what western farmers want.  
Mr. Speaker, I am glad to have had this matter raised.  
Let us remember that is the Canada Labour Code. 
This is exactly what they have been asking for for decades. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Treasury Board has had two years to resolve this issue. 
Let me talk about PSAC. 
It is still on strike today but perhaps not in the next couple of days. 
There was a thing called the recession. 
I am sure most members will remember the recession of 1991-92. 
However, I digress just a bit. 
Let us go back to PSAC's position. 
Since 1991 it has not had an increase.  
They may very well have been small increases. 
PSAC table two has not had an increase for seven years. 
Of course those workers frustrated. 
Members of the House gave raises to themselves. 
We did it ourselves.  
When we ran for office we knew what we were going to be paid. 
They have not had it, but they should have a wage increase.  
As I said, two years is a long time. 
Fourteen days of negotiations with nothing happening is a long time. 
The frustrations of PSAC came to a boiling point and it went on strike.  
Unions have certain rights in negotiated agreements. 
PSAC has the right to strike. 
That is the right of PSAC and the unions.  
They are like the rest of us. 
They actually want to go back to work. 
They would rather be working than not working and on strike. 
However, they want a settlement which is fair and equitable. 
In my opinion they crossed the line. 
They went too far. 
When I met with these people I mentioned that. 
As members are well aware, the agricultural industry is in difficult straits. 
We have problems with commodity prices worldwide. 
Two issues were always being put on the table by our major partners. 
Remember what I just said. 
There is a lot of competition out there. 
We have good customers who depend on us. 
They depend on the delivery of that product. 
The delivery of that product has been impacted by the PSAC strike. 
That cannot be tolerated.  
The best solution is not back to work legislation. 
They are not asking for anything totally out of the ordinary. 
They are asking for fair compensation. 
That is all they are asking for.  
I said that they should not to be forced back to work. 
The process is something we would like to talk about. 
It should never have been a problem. 
The government had two years to solve the problem. 
It should never have come to the floor of this House. 
Now it is here. 
I would be more than happy to answer questions. 
I wish the motion would come forward quickly so that we could debate it.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I listened with intent to my colleague from the Conservative Party. 
It almost sounds like he wants to have it both ways. 
He is absolutely correct when he says that.  
The Conservatives, Reform members and the Liberals all sat down. 
That is the reason we are having this debate. 
My question for the member from Manitoba is this. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Maybe he could tell me where he has been getting these particular pieces of information. 
I will try to answer the question from the hon. member of the NDP. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
What does this government do? 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We have spoken about this with respect to the Reform Party before. 
Intemperate language is not appropriate. 
There are children watching this program. 
I heard words from that member's mouth. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The point of the government House leader is certainly well made. 
I will invite the hon. member for Cypress Hills-Grasslands to continue his dissertation.  
That is the only way I can describe it. 
I hope the hon. member for Brandon-Souris really had that in mind. 
I think that is what I got out of his speech. 
I would like him to confirm that.  
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is true to a point. 
Do not use my farmers as that badminton bird or that pawn. 
Nobody has total right on his side. 
The hon. gentleman is right. 
Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):
It is too little too late in many cases.  
They are actually situated in the same grouping as the grain workers. 
I have been in contact with them over the last few days. 
I feel for them. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
To try to understand the logic of the government is impossible. 
I am sorry but I cannot answer that question. 
I still go back to my original comment. 
I do not know why the Liberals would not go to binding arbitration. 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
The motion introduced reads in part: 
We can think of other types of legislation that have been brought into the House.  
The government absolved itself of the responsibility. 
How did it do that? 
Surely that is too much.  
Do you know about grain handling?  
The government member is asking if we know about grain handlers on this side. 
Maybe they do not over there, but we know that farmers are hurting.  
As we know, commodity prices have gone through the floor. 
Farmers are absolutely suffering a great deal.  
It is late March. 
If last year's crop does not work, there is always next year. 
Farmers are always hoping for next year, and next year is just around the corner. 
The cash is no good for them in late May. 
The seed cannot be put in any later. 
It has to be planted in the spring or it does not grow. 
It is that simple. 
We all know that.  
It is the most opportune time to put the squeeze on the government. 
That does not mean to say that we like it. 
It has had opportunities to negotiate in good faith. 
It knows these contracts expire. 
There are five different tables of ongoing negotiations with PSAC. 
The governments knows that ahead of time.  
They have a contract that expires at the end of April. 
The government knew that years ago. 
That is incompetence by the government.  
Let look at the labour relations with the government. 
First it legislates no pay increases for six years. 
Today Bill C-76 was introduced. 
The government is stonewalling on that. 
The whole message of the government is stonewall, ignore, disregard. 
Therein is the problem. 
We want to ensure that they cannot hold these people to ransom. 
We cannot deal with that.  
The government does not recognize and respect the democratic rights of very many people. 
Therefore, we will debate this issue as much as we can. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is quite simple. 
He makes it sound as if that is what these 70 members want to do. 
This government has legislated away binding arbitration. 
I can assure the member that they do not.  
They have no input in the debate. 
They are the ones who are greatly at risk. 
That is why we have to think seriously about helping them.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
They are being ordered back to work even though they are not on strike. 
It should not try to sneak it in under the table. 
I would ask the member to comment on that.  
Mr. Speaker, that is right. 
It does not matter who it is. 
That type of attitude has to be stopped. 
The member is absolutely right.  
That is not our responsibility.  
That is the issue that we have to deal with.  
Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):
Here we are, five years later, and we are still doing the same old thing.  
This government has abdicated its responsibility to a lot of people. 
It also has abdicated its responsibility to other groups. 
The government has abdicated its responsibility. 
It has done nothing in five years to change this.  
I have not figured that one out yet.  
Why are we dealing with the firefighters? 
I was not even aware they were talking about going on strike. 
I know they have a problem. 
As well, there are the general service workers. 
These are the people who have been wrapped up in this draconian piece of legislation.  
My friend is perfectly correct in saying promises, promises, promises. 
There is the millennium scholarship fund. 
Those are the types of promises. 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
However, I have a great many questions. 
I would argue that the workers are on a legal strike. 
Not only are they on a legal strike, they are on a rotating strike. 
They have not had an increase in six years. 
Their collective agreement expired two years ago, or a little less. 
Because the rules concerning essential services are not the same. 
What is the problem in this House? 
But they do not apply in this case.  
Why was this right suspended? 
Because they would have been wrong? 
What does this bill have to say? 
Under ``Collective Agreements'', clause 7 reads as follows: 
( a ) the terms and conditions of employment applicable to the employees: and 
( b ) the period during which those terms and conditions of employment are applicable.  
The same thing goes for correctional services. 
Why does the government not comply with the majority report? 
The truth hurts, Mr. Speaker. 
There was no real bargaining. 
There are balances of power in the public sector and in the private sector. 
It is a rotating strike. 
They used the means at their disposal under the law.  
It did not look any further than its nose. 
I used to teach labour relations. 
Nowadays, the government can do better than this mess.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
I know agriculture is very important in Quebec. 
We in the west as farmers have known this for over three decades. 
That was how much the Liberals cared for agriculture.  
I remember that we did not have an easy time of it with western members. 
But what did we say back then? 
What happened was that the code was changed. 
As far as I know, workers were in agreement with these provisions. 
There was agreement on the essential services provisions.  
We are told that 70 workers are involved. 
It will only come back.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member for Mercier on her presentation. 
I believe government members would be well advised to read it again.  
She mentioned the rail strike. 
This is an age-old trick: divide to conquer.  
Why, then, should we let those workers exercise their right to strike?  
In this case, I believe the government should have anticipated what is happening. 
Maybe we should ask the question differently. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
He did it from the point of view of working people. 
There have been rotational strikes. 
The rationale is that the government is moving to do something about grain. 
The farmer grows the grain and stores it on his farm. 
Then it goes by rail to the west coast or to Thunder Bay. 
It is clearly a Byzantine system.  
This is a grim time particularly for farmers on the prairies. 
Farmers have other acronyms to describe it. 
It is not helping very many farmers in our region. 
As has been mentioned by other speakers, spring seeding is just around the corner. 
They implicitly recognize that the government is playing off farmers and workers. 
That in the long run gets nobody very far down the road.  
The letter reads in part: 
We deserve to be treated fairly and equitably''. 
According to the letter, 97% of federal government employees are paid national rates of pay. 
Only 3% are not.  
Treasury Board's bargaining tactics have been counterproductive for the public service in Canada. 
The government has treated us as though we are entirely worthless and disposable''.  
And these are modest wage earners. 
These people are not asking for the moon. 
NOTICE OF CLOSURE MOTION 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a rather simple and direct question for the hon. member. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Cypress Hills-Grasslands for his question.  
There is some merit in what the member is proposing. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
I would like to share something with him which just happened outside in the lobby. 
I would like to share this with the member for Palliser.  
Are they going to be legislated back to work?  
It seems like a really sensitive and intelligent solution to an impasse. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question. 
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
What we are discussing here today is very important for workers. 
But at whose expense do they do that? 
At the expense of workers.  
They did, and now it wants to legislate them back to work. 
And it is totally intentional. 
This problem did not come about suddenly. 
These people have been asking for salary increases for a long time.  
It has been decided to wait until the very last minute. 
We will put an end to this''. 
But the problem is of their own making.  
Maybe I should tell you a little bit about my own background. 
During 20 years, I was a trade unionist with the CSN before entering into politics. 
I have had the opportunity to see what a government employer is. 
It behaves like the Liberals do. 
They sit at the bargaining table, and have negotiations. 
When it does not work out, they pass a bill.  
Just imagine the power they can wield. 
It is unfair, cynical and machiavellian. 
That is what the government is. 
It is not the first time we can see that. 
Members of parliament are here to represent constituents. 
This is what the government often does. 
We also have to look at what has been going on with wage parity. 
But not this government. 
But this is not what this government is doing. 
It is targeting workers. 
In Quebec, many have realized that. 
The Bloc Quebecois has always stood for these workers.  
We do not want our hands tied.  
Another example is the EI fund. 
Who pays for the EI fund? 
People will tell me it is partly paid for by employers, and I would agree. 
But workers put in a large amount. 
The government, which, in my opinion, is levying an indirect tax. 
Workers contribute every week.  
Members should take a look at the wording of the legislation. 
In the meantime, big corporations have it great in Canada. 
In my view, this is another blatant example.  
We told the government ``Look, this does not make sense. 
You were a trustee of the fund. 
Why did you allow the company to take money from the fund?''  
And what has the government been planning for the past two years? 
It has watched the public service pension plan grow. 
Public servants have been paying into this fund.  
Today there is a surplus. 
Is it defending workers, those who pay the bulk of taxes and income tax? 
I believe workers sensed, knew what was coming. 
There is also the issue of privatization. 
These officers are double dipping. 
What do we have before us today? 
So, if you do not accept our offers, we will impose special legislation on you''. 
You are not mistaken.  
My colleague from Chambly tells me I am not mistaken.  
There are those who claim to be the defenders of the worker. 
In my opinion, they are victims of this government, it is simple as that.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
This time, however, the process will not be easily manipulated. 
These are questions Canadians deserve to have answers to. 
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his intervention.  
I repeat: it is not up to the government.  
The commission determined the parameters of the hearing. 
This mandate was established by the public complaints commission, not the government. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
No one likes a picket line, especially farmers. 
No one likes a picket line, especially the workers who are on that picket line.  
Then it was regional rates of pay it refused to discuss. 
Now the government will go after its own workers' pension plan.  
Three strikes and this government will be out. 
The striking blue collar workers want one rate across Canada.  
That would make it inequitable for many in the process. 
That is simply not fair.  
In fact, 87% of PSAC has negotiated settlement. 
We believe in the negotiated settlement approach and collective bargaining.  
That would disrupt the local labour market.  
Why do we pay higher wages in Vancouver? 
Consider housing prices alone.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
It had to do with poverty measures.  
By way of background, Statistics Canada has a measure called low income cutoff. 
That is more an absolute measure of poverty. 
I do not believe that is the case. 
I hope the parliamentary secretary might be able to shed some light.  
That was used in the LICO measure.  
Canadians should be engaged in a dialogue about what constitutes poverty in Canada. 
Canadians have been exposed to what I think is called sympathy fatigue. 
If the numbers get far too large people do not believe them any more. 
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
These cutoffs calculate low income as compared to the average family income.  
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.48 p.m.)
