PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
In some cases this has proven to be fatal.  
I am pleased to introduce this bill today.  
CANADA BUSINESS CORPORATIONS ACT 
CULTURAL GRANTS ACKNOWLEDGEMENT ACT 
Non-compliance may result in the recipient's having to repay the grant.  
This bill would make home ownership a feasible option for more families. 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):
I missed it because the interpreter spoke too quickly. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I would prefer that this request be made tomorrow. 
Therefore, I would like this issue to be postponed until tomorrow, if possible. 
I refuse to give my consent.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Unanimous consent has not been achieved.  
ALLOTTED DAY-BUDGET SURPLUS 
What do we know so far? 
Again, I raise the question of whose money is this?  
That is a staggering amount of money.  
There was no acknowledgement of that in the throne speech. 
I will say more about that in a moment.  
There has been no definition anywhere about what constitutes, for instance, a tax break. 
That is a very important point. 
Those are the things that we know based on what has gone on before.  
Rather obviously, those solutions failed miserably at that time.  
I seems that is what the government is doing.  
I talked about the debt, taxes and irresponsible spending. 
I want to say a little bit more about that in a bit more detail.  
I want to address specifically the issue of debt. 
It is an absolutely astronomical figure.  
It is a tremendous amount of money.  
But that in itself really is not the problem. 
The problem with a debt that big is it has to be serviced. 
Interest payments on the debt have grown exponentially. 
They now consume about $47 billion a year. 
It is a tremendous amount of money.  
We argue in our paper that the government must pay attention to the debt. 
It is not just the issue of the debt that we are concerned about. 
We are concerned about the government's poor commitment to the issue of reducing taxes. 
There is one single mention in the throne speech. 
This is not an academic exercise. 
It has a profound impact on jobs. 
This is after we have paid for their education.  
This is not an academic debate. 
It has driven many Canadians out of business. 
1995 had record bankruptcies. 
That was not good enough. 
It makes it very difficult for businesses to compete. 
It is not only personal income tax. 
We have all kinds of direct taxes, payroll taxes for instance.  
Payroll taxes will claim more and more and more victims.  
It is as though the government has stuck its head in the sand.  
I do not hear a hue and cry across the country for more spending. 
I come from Alberta. 
Why is it that things never seem to improve?  
Let me touch on that a little bit more.  
We know that the government's record is on health care. 
The Reform Party wants to change that. 
We have posted it on the Internet. 
We argue that it is demand. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
This will allow us to have more debate and more interchange.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
If he wants to set an example, he should lead by example. 
What does he do? 
Not more than two days afterward, he said he consulted with the members and Canadians. 
He never consulted with us. 
As well he said the government should not assist small business in any way. 
We will give him the benefit of the doubt.  
What has happened since then? 
We have seen unemployment ratchet up and up and up and up.  
When is he going to get it?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I would just like to ask the member this one question again.  
Is he encouraging them all to move to Alberta? 
That is not the agenda of Atlantic Canadians, sir. 
It did extraordinarily well.  
We need to go back to that and renew infrastructure to make it happen. 
In some cases it means providing some training for people. 
In other cases it may mean that we will have to lower taxes. 
I do not think we can continue to rely on the solutions of the past. 
I hope that the member will come around to that way of thinking.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Reform Party member.  
This image of the Atlantic provinces is totally unacceptable. 
It is nature's fault. 
It is because of what is happening in our region.  
That was the fault of the government of the day.  
The things that are working well now in Atlantic Canada come from the private sector. 
That should be the model. 
In some cases people do become dependent on unemployment insurance. 
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
They cannot have it both ways. 
No party in the history of Canada has consulted more extensively with Canadians. 
Surely he does not condemn that.  
It is refundable and repayable to the federal government. 
I am very proud of this program. 
He can go on record and say that he would renounce that deal. 
Is this what the member is talking about?  
We believe this is a priority. 
It is a very valuable entry into the workforce.  
These are some of the priorities we have set out. 
They have been the subject of consultation through the election. 
Does he condemn what we have done in terms of innovation? 
We have given tax breaks for research and development in Canada. 
Does he condemn SchoolNet? 
Canada will be the most connected nation in the world. 
It will have access to expertise and knowledge throughout the country.  
These are priorities we have stated clearly and strongly.  
We will achieve that long before its target.  
Did he say consult Canadians or insult Canadians? 
The hon. member raised a lot of different issues. 
It will be difficult to touch on them all. 
I will try to be brief.  
That was a huge issue in the election campaign.  
The government's majority was diminished. 
It has the barest of majorities right now. 
I would conclude by asking- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Willowdale.  
Mr. Speaker, I welcome the member's question.  
You have obviously prejudged it. 
You have called for major cuts in payroll taxes.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, you are quite right. 
We are looking forward to hearing his contribution to this very important debate. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Which of these three is the right answer?  
Mr. Speaker, we had to cut spending. 
In 1993-94, our program expenditures amounted to $120 billion. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
What did the Minister of Finance tell us back then? 
But what did the Minister of Finance do? 
He fed us a line. 
This is why a public debate is so important.  
There needs to be debate. 
It has gone about reducing the deficit in four ways. 
That is why there should be a public debate.  
There are other ways to continue putting our fiscal house in order. 
It should give back what it has stolen from the provinces. 
That is the first thing it ought to do. 
Second, it must stop using the unemployment insurance fund surplus. 
UI premiums are job killers. 
Any payroll tax is a job killer. 
What they care about is the Canadian flag, federalist propaganda. 
Last year, we suggested three possible approaches. 
It is the same thing with corporate tax. 
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Mr. Speaker, if I may, I would like to congratulate my colleague on his speech. 
With all that we have at stake, we are going to proceed cautiously.  
My colleague is absolutely right.  
Such was the purpose of the GST.  
The hon. member was absolutely right when he raised this issue.  
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
The only thing different is the name of the person speaking. 
Otherwise, it is always the same baloney.  
I am impressed to see that many outraged members across the floor. 
When we took over, our country was going bankrupt. 
We inherited a deficit from the Conservatives. 
But we made the right decisions and now the deficit has almost been eliminated. 
Mr. Speaker, on a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Resuming debate, the hon. member for Qu'Appelle.  
Mr. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
I am really pleased to do that.  
However, I disagree profoundly with the emphasis it places on where we should go. 
It condemns the 27 years of spending by the federal government in the past. 
It condemns the size of government. 
Its members are the Fred Flintstones of Canadian politics. 
It is a party that is basically anti-government. 
It wants to go back to the past. 
It is a very right wing conservative party. 
These things just are not true. 
It is about time the Reform Party was taken on.  
Of that 6 percent only half of that is from social programs.  
That is not true. 
Who brought in high interest rates? 
Right wing conservatives like the Reform Party. 
Its friends like Brian Mulroney brought in high interest rates in Canada.  
We saw the exact same thing in Saskatchewan with Grant Devine and the Conservatives there. 
Again, this is the right wing politics of the Reform Party. 
That is the biggest cause in this country of the debt and deficit.  
That is back to the past, the Archie Bunkers of Canada. 
That is the direction we should not be going in.  
That being said, let us take a look once again at the Reform Party. 
Where does it want to do some cutbacks? 
Spending $1 billion on goods and services creates about 28,000 jobs. 
Spending $1 billion on infrastructure creates some 26,000 jobs. 
The question is where do we spend taxpayer money. 
It misleads the people of this country. 
It propagates myths around Canada. 
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
It was quite interesting.  
That is the first question.  
I certainly do not support what he is saying. 
Maybe he does not know what ordinary people are like. 
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood-Assiniboine, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I welcome your appointment to the Chair. 
I welcome the suggestions made by the member for Qu'Appelle. 
I believe that is a balanced approach and something that Canadians support.  
I would like to hear the member for Qu'Appelle comment on that.  
I believe it should be in the fields of health and education. 
I believe we should start with the GST, reduce it. 
That is the fairest way to go about doing it. 
It is also the way to create jobs in this country. 
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
This promise left me very sceptical, naturally. 
In the Atlantic region, we are used to fine promises from the Liberals. 
That is probably why so we elected so few.  
We have often pleaded with the government to reduce employment insurance premiums. 
This government has no mandate to impose an outright payroll tax. 
It is just plain wrong.  
In fact, the exact opposite is true.  
The Reform motion clearly demonstrates their lack of concrete ideas on the question. 
Taxes are quite simply too high. 
The problem must be addressed, now or never. 
Why wait for the near, or more distant, future? 
The Progressive Conservative Party is the only party willing to act today. 
Unfortunately I think he may be right.  
Specific benchmarks must be established now. 
Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay-Okanagan, Ref.):
Finally, I would like to ask this of the hon. member who just spoke. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
It spent extravagantly too. 
My colleague talks a lot about the deficit. 
They were supposed to scrap it. 
They did not scrap it, it is still there.  
We will be able to say thanks to the previous Conservative government, I guarantee it.  
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
It is all about priorities. 
How big of a government do we really want? 
This is the debate the country needs. 
I would also like to congratulate you on your appointment to the Chair.  
It is also critical to my riding of Peace River and its economy.  
Nationally one out of every three jobs is related to exports. 
I want to serve notice that I will be watching.  
We heard the Speech from the Throne on last Tuesday. 
One in every three Canadian jobs now depends on trade. 
In many cases borders between our provinces have been more daunting than the Himalaya mountains. 
This is absolutely absurd. 
We have an absolutely ludicrous situation that has to be corrected. 
They are not showing the vision on the other side to resolve the problem.  
Otherwise it would have tackled it long ago.  
The federal government has the power to demolish these internal trade barriers. 
It is a worthy objective. 
Has it examined payroll taxes? 
What is this for? 
They look at business dollars as savvy executives. 
Good business conditions is what they are looking for.  
If the conditions are right foreign investments and exports will follow.  
The Liberal government should take a major initiative. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The federal government is not standing in the way of internal trade barriers. 
However I want to make the point that the provinces are standing in the way. 
I certainly welcome any support he could provide in that instance.  
I certainly agree with him that initiatives are being made. 
There is an effort to try to dismantle interprovincial trade barriers. 
That initiative has been going nowhere. 
Clearly the federal government has the authority to make the change.  
Those are the kind of silly rules we have in Canada.  
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, congratulations on your appointment. 
The job looks good on you.  
I would like to thank the voters of Battlefords-Lloydminster for their support. 
That is where we run into trouble. 
Taxpayers do not need more grand schemes. 
There was a joke going around a few years ago which asked:
How do you make $1 million in Canadian business? 
First you start with $2 million.  
To be fair, we are not unique in the world for this. 
There are just as many regulations meant to protect as there are to interfere. 
What would it take to convince someone to hire that new worker? 
It is naive to think otherwise.  
Taxes of all kinds can also have a negative impact. 
We can see that potential entrepreneurs in this country are hit with a triple whammy. 
I do not wish to be dramatic. 
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
I would advise him to do a little better research. 
Its mandate has been expanded and it is certainly helping tourism in Canada.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his questions. 
We just do not see that out there.  
People are waiting longer and longer for less health care. 
We are here in this House to discuss them. 
I think of some of the things that we are going to have to do. 
We need a much more preventive medicine situation out there. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I welcome the comments from my esteemed colleague. 
He talked specifically of help to Atlantic Canada. 
Subsidies and grants have proven not effective over the last number of years. 
There are too few dollars for too many people. 
Those types of things will have to be addressed.  
There is a fisheries crisis in Atlantic Canada. 
He talked about us being regional. 
We have an agriculture crisis in the prairies. 
People are sending us here to address issues that are common to them.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The prospect of that tremendous turnaround raised an obvious issue. 
That proposal was made in the first week of the campaign. 
It allowed for weeks of debate and discussion by candidates and by commentators. 
Most important, this issue was debated by Canadians themselves. 
The single largest group of Canadians said that is the approach they want.  
I am sure the issue came up. 
I am sure he debated with other candidates who were seeking election. 
Perhaps he did not read our platform. 
Maybe that was it, I am not sure. 
Perhaps he just did not want to debate it. 
That is in absolute terms, real bottom line dollars. 
We also have to bring down Canada's debt as a share of our economy. 
We had to deal with the deficit. 
We have dealt with the deficit as we have said we would. 
We will be balancing the budget in 1998-99. 
They have been analysed, debated and critiqued for four years. 
This motion should fool no one. 
It is not even about irresponsible spending. 
Instead it is really an attack on a concept of balanced government. 
Clearly that is not good enough for the opposition. 
The motion obviously implies that any new spending is bad spending. 
Let me say that this reform motion is wrong and it is misguided.  
We are not prepared to nor do we accept that proposition by the opposition. 
We are talking about the way it is going to be. 
It is incumbent on a national government to take on that role. 
An example of that is the Canada foundation for innovation. 
It is about having a vision. 
It is about investing in Canadians in ensuring that the future of Canadians is bright. 
That is the role of the government.  
Unemployment for young people in this country is still too high. 
I go back to today's opposition motion. 
We will implement tax reductions and lower the debt. 
I submit that a balanced approach is the best approach. 
That is why the House must reject this motion and the philosophy that it represents.  
He stated that the government is playing games. 
Let us talk about the games the government is playing.  
We have announced that we will balance the budget in 1998-99. 
The debt is on a downward track. 
We are committed to reducing the debt to GDP ratio. 
The economy is growing and we are leading the G-7. 
I submit that we are winning this game. 
The member talked about irresponsible spending. 
This is not irresponsible spending. 
However, the Reform Party apparently disagrees.  
It is the essence of good management. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
The debt is now $620 billion, or thereabouts. 
He therefore owes the people of Quebec some $2 billion.  
He talked about jobs. 
The economy is benefiting because of low interest rates. 
With respect to the harmonization of the GST, Quebec has benefited from that. 
The member should clarify his remarks. 
I look forward to the continuing debate.  
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
I have appreciated working with him in committee. 
He talks about an attitude of let them suffer. 
I think of an elderly woman whose husband died last year. 
I am thankful for that experience.  
The hon. member made reference to an elderly lady in his constituency. 
As I said in my speech, Canadians want a balanced approach. 
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
Before I proceed, Mr. Speaker, I congratulate you on your appointment. 
This has been diluted more and more over the past years. 
This should be restored to the House of Commons. 
It is the third point on fiscal responsibility which I will focus on. 
Specifically, I will do two things. 
First, I will outline where massive government over spending has led our country. 
I am sure that we can all agree with this. 
There is a real need for this national discourse. 
It chose to run deficits year after year. 
Where did this course take us as a country? 
How can we ever avoid going that way again?  
Allow me to outline the magnitude of this debt. 
It is 74 percent of gross domestic product. 
Canada owes 25.3 percent of its debt to foreigners.  
Three and a half trillion dollars we are in hock.  
That is how one financial analyst started to tell investors around the world about Canada. 
We could say so what, and many people do say that. 
So what if our debt is one of the biggest in the world? 
So what if government keeps borrowing?  
We pay bankers $46 billion a year. 
There is a means of handling this situation. 
What should a balanced budget look like? 
There should be legislation to prevent a government from increasing the deficit. 
They must be dealt with as they arise. 
These would be a release valve.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
I want to spend a good deal of time on this. 
I always use a litmus test. 
Is it really the prerogative of government to make that kind of decision? 
Does it not represent us in Ottawa? 
Is that not the question?  
These are legitimate concerns.  
Are these people even going to get to read this sort of study? 
I ask the House, does that make any sense whatsoever? 
I am not the only accountant in the House. 
This is economics 101. 
I have a few notes here. 
That is a great stack for a government. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Stoney Creek, Lib.):
He talked about the performance of the government with respect to the debt. 
The government is committed to reducing the debt to GDP ratio. 
It will eliminate the deficit in 1998-99.  
We are moving out. 
I want to draw an analogy on which I invite the hon. member to comment. 
It is the same with a country. 
We need to reinvest in the priorities. 
I want the member to acknowledge that we are on a more prosperous track.  
The fact is that the deficit is on a downward track.  
That is a deficit. 
It is a matter of how one rebuilds one's house.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabasca, PC):
I will of course get myself a copy of the document he mentioned.  
I want to say a few words about my riding. 
It is a reflection of what Canada is all about.  
These various people in my riding have learned to work and celebrate together. 
It is a lesson that we can share with other Canadians. 
I want to extend my best wishes and my congratulations as well- 
[ Translation ] -and to my colleagues of every political persuasion. 
I wish them good luck.  
September 29, 1997-Mr. 
When I read such a motion I have to ask the following questions:
I see a big grin.  
Obviously, you know what they do.  
If he had, he would not have made that motion. 
He did not see the key themes.  
Let me share with the House the key themes. 
I wish that would have been acknowledged by my colleagues.  
We have important new initiatives. 
We will expand the aboriginal head start program.  
Are those the kinds of programs that my colleague is condemning? 
For some reason, he missed that. 
He did not take the time to listen to or read it.  
We will be preserving and enhancing medicare. 
Is that what he wants us to eliminate?  
We will be renewing the national AIDS strategy. 
Are those the programs he wants eliminated too? 
Are those the programs he wants eliminated, rejected and put aside? 
Building safer communities is one of the government's key objectives. 
It is hard work, it is complex. 
Progress must be made a step at a time, with healthy programs. 
That is what we intend to do.  
I hope my colleague does not want that program eliminated as well.  
That is surely not the case.  
We will secure the future of our young people. 
That is a critical priority for the welfare of all. 
They often need that second chance.  
Is that what he intends? 
Another program he wants to see eliminated?  
Here is another theme that we have heard nothing about.  
We must invest in knowledge and creativity.  
Let him stand and say so. 
We want to continue partnerships between private and public sectors. 
We as a nation have a decision to make. 
We have made some important investments.  
It has been applauded by most Canadians.  
Perhaps he is not speaking for his party. 
Perhaps they will stand and denounce this kind of irresponsibility.  
We have stabilized with funding to the centres d'excellence.  
Perhaps the hon. member does not enjoy being first. 
Perhaps third, fourth or tenth is good enough for him. 
But not for us.  
Is that an insensitive way to spend money? 
I am surprised he did not talk about that.  
We know we must improve opportunities for aboriginal communities. 
Is this what he wants to do? 
We are working to further their progress toward achieving self-government. 
We believe it will provide additional well-being and economic independence. 
Here are other initiatives the government may want to consider. 
Here is how to improve them''.  
No, we do not hear a positive word from any one of them. 
I give them an iron clad guarantee. 
We are here to oppose.  
Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:
One colleagues has just said that they are here to oppose. 
Another notion is that the government is there to protect no matter what. 
I do not know if these people have any political affiliation. 
It is an important initiative. 
I hope that this leadership will be followed by the provinces.  
We have not heard a whole lot about that. 
It is a marvellous submission for the next millennium. 
``A billion dollars for brains'' was another in the Ottawa Sun on September 25, 1997.  
Again it is mentioned. 
I say shame on the opposition.  
That is not all that has been said. 
Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:
I heard somebody say ``bingo''. 
I hope that person will jump up and include that as part of his speech. 
It is from Toronto Star columnist David Crane and reads: 
It will take more than government programs to build an innovation culture in Canada. 
What does the opposition do? 
It tries to pretend that the spending is not appropriate.  
I would love to send this over to my opposition colleagues. 
He showed that the Liberals are able to balance a chequebook''. 
They go on to discuss the budget. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, congratulations to you on your appointment as Acting Speaker. 
I would like to congratulate my hon. opponent from across the way. 
That is fiscal responsibility. 
Could he tell us?  
Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:
I will get the information for him.  
I know that a substantial portion has been repaid. 
I know that there have been in some instances rather interesting interest rates. 
However, I will get the specific details for him. 
What is my colleague saying? 
That is what I am trying to get at.  
My suspicion is that there is something behind it. 
That is what I think is happening.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, congratulations on your appointment to the Chair.  
I was interested in the comments which the member made regarding aboriginal people. 
What is he talking about?  
Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:
That is the point I was making.  
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:
Mr. Speaker, I welcome the question. 
I will try to explain.  
Not everywhere in Canada.  
Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:
For me, Canada is also Quebec, dear colleague.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
These pressures are pervasive in all walks of life. 
The impact of these new technologies is changing the way we relate to one another.  
Canadians understand that this is a global phenomenon. 
But you only find that out after you have lost.  
The CRTC does this in pursuit of what it calls sustainable competition. 
I wonder what is meant by the new term creative partnerships. 
This does not serve the best interests of Canadian consumers.  
This government says it wants to support Canadian culture. 
It seems like more of the say one thing, do another approach of this government. 
It is now doing more harm than good.  
We see that with the reality of today, the current CRTC is obsolete. 
It costs far too much and delivers far too little. 
We only protect what is weak. 
That which is strong can be promoted. 
Mrs. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
It was very clearly stated in the platform. 
The people of Canada have been consulted.  
We have already begun on a number of these.  
We know there will be a need to seek more input. 
I expect it and Canadians expect it. 
This government is no stranger to consultation. 
Some suggestions may indeed be hard to assign. 
The optimal size of government cannot be arbitrarily determined. 
We are at an exciting time. 
Corporations are learning that social marketing is good for business. 
SchoolNet is an excellent example. 
There is no vision in the Reform Party's narrow agenda. 
On June 2 Canadians chose the balanced Liberal approach. 
They were offered two tier medicine and they declined.  
We have seen those results in Ontario. 
As it is 2 o'clock, I would like to proceed to Statements by Members.  
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
I have pledged to make this government accountable to them.  
HIGH PERFORMANCE HOCKEY PROGRAM 
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
Canadians from across the country were impressed with the calibre of our athletes.  
Member spoke in Inuktitut ] 
NATIONAL AIDS AWARENESS WEEK 
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
MINISTER OF INTERGOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS 
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
That was enough to get the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs into a panic. 
Yes, and none other than him and his government. 
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
Ordinary Canadians are still waiting to be consulted.  
This agreement must come before the treaty is signed, not after.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE 
Ms. Claudette Bradshaw (Moncton, Lib.):
Crime in costing Canadians $46 billion a year.  
I will work on behalf of my constituents- 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
People in my part of Canada are still seething over that legislation. 
Talk of civil disobedience is rampant. 
We prairie people are Canadians too. 
Our devotion to individual freedom is our unique characteristic. 
MEMBER FOR RIMOUSKI-MITIS 
Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard-La Prairie, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
Once again he is putting his own interests before those of the Quebec people.  
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
INTERNATIONAL DAY OF OLDER PERSONS 
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton, Lib.):
In all cases, they have the right to be treated with dignity.  
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Our government has determined that youth employment should be a priority. 
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, national unity is a very important issue for Canada. 
I was frustrated too. 
Of course we are trying to find a solution but it is not easy.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the prime minister missed the point.  
Again the prime minister dragged his feet.  
What is so hard about mailing a letter? 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The Reform Party complained that we were spending money.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the prime minister is doing it again. 
Brian Mulroney damaged the national unity effort by his arrogance. 
This prime minister hurts the cause by his apathy.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have made a lot of decisions with respect to national unity. 
We got out of tourism. 
The member wants us to mail a letter tomorrow. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
The government is always a step behind. 
It refuses to be proactive. 
If so, what did the president say?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Today there was a statement by Prime Minister Jospin that was very clear. 
I have discussed the problem many times with President Chirac. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I made my views very clear. 
I can cite for the hon. member what Prime Minister Jospin said today: 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
the premier replied: ``That is a detail''. 
This detail is the key to the whole question.  
These questions must be asked in Quebec, and more broadly in Canada''. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
That has never been done. 
And the list goes on.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, this is getting annoying. 
Secession is not a right within a democracy.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member's question is very important. 
We are working with the provinces, students and lenders. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We are already going a long way to do what we can.  
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
My question is for the minister of human resources. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the minister's answer is simply not good enough.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We invest more money in our youth programs as well.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
The people said pay down the debt. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
This government actually had its mandate diminished. 
I think the minister could find a stronger point to hang his argument on.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the fact is we did consult during the election campaign. 
We actually think that an election campaign is when Canadians should be consulted.  
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
What is behind this political decision by the minister- 
The Minister of Transport has the floor.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
I believe it is a decision that makes sense.  
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, all this is very suspicious. 
He knows that there have been two international airports in Montreal since 1975.  
What is behind this political decision?  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I cannot understand why the hon. member is so angry. 
I have given the reasons.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We will find out in due course what the privacy commissioner thinks.  
That explanation has been made in full.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
It is interesting that kind of information is public, open and available to all. 
Guess where it is available? 
It is available from the justice department. Amazing.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Mr. Minister, the ceasefire called for- 
My dear colleague, you must always address the Chair.  
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
No, this is not the way.  
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
It is indeed his first question.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, Bombardier retains its cosy relationship with the current Liberal government. 
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, why will the letter not be tabled?  
The prime minister sent a letter to Mexico. 
The hon. Minister for International Trade.  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, what does the Reform Party have against successful Canadian companies?  
This individual runs down a Canadian company. 
That is not our style and that is why he is on that side.  
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the President of the Treasury Board.  
The government has no unpaid debt at the present time. 
On the contrary, we offered, during these negotiations, over $1.3 billion.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
My question is for the Minister of Health. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We are determined to do that.  
The hon. member for Kootenay-Columbia.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the last time I looked, money is money. 
Money in an organization may be used in many different ways. 
A simple yes or no.  
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
The hon. member for Sackville-Eastern Shore.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
The question once again is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's knowledge of history of the TAGS program is defective. 
I should remind him that this was done with the agreement of the individuals concerned.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the Environment.  
To date, the minister has refused to make the same commitment.  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
We have a commitment to reintroduce that legislation into the House. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
However, we cannot do this alone. 
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
We recognize that there is a need for amendments to the act. 
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the solicitor general.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question. 
The National Parole Board and Correctional Service Canada- 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Trade.  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Second, we are doing no such thing in terms of undermining Canadian sovereignty. 
I think he knows that perfectly well.  
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Community organizations help the poorest people. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
They are our partners and we are very proud of that.  
Have we changed infrastructures? 
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the solicitor general.  
Canadians are clearly asking for a parole system that is earned, tightly monitored and limited. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
They will be doing a report and will be reporting when it is available.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
I brought along with me to the meeting citizens of the Stony reserve.  
I have given notice to the minister of my intention to ask such a question.  
In conclusion, I would like to address the issue of ministerial responsibility. 
The then Speaker said: 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my colleague from Wild Rose. 
The official named, in my view, is in contempt of Parliament for his actions.  
Erskine May's 21st edition describes contempt as: 
I look forward to your ruling.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my suggestion to you, respectfully, would be as follows. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the intervention of the House leader.  
I appreciate also that the minister will get back to us promptly. 
I would like to get a little more information. 
Maybe there is an explanation. 
And that is precisely what I mean, the earliest possible moment. 
I do not want this dragged out.  
We now have an undertaking from the leader of the Government in the House. 
At that time, if it is necessary, I will make a decision.  
ALLOTTED DAY-BUDGET SURPLUS 
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
Mrs. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, on June 2 Canadians were consulted. 
Canadians expect us to do what we said we would do. 
We will balance the budget by 1998-99. 
They expect us to demonstrate vision and values. 
They also expect us to reinvest in a stronger society. 
We said we would and we will.  
We can do this without financial risk. 
Members of the official opposition keep talking about shell games. 
I dare them to go and pick up all the shells at once. 
They will be disappointed. 
There is not a tax and spend Liberal to be found.  
Canadians are counting on us, especially those less well off. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her presentation.  
I understand the hon. member is a physician. 
Any physician would agree.  
We are not there yet.  
We actually have to realize that our ultimate success is a net cost. 
We would love to be able to put more efforts into training. 
We are excited by the kinds of programs we see.  
They were able to get out there and go to work.  
How can we create jobs if the federal government takes them away?  
We are big picture people. 
We need to have a goal of putting Canadians back to work. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
We already have a tremendous example of consultation. 
As much as we are creating jobs, there are other people being laid off. 
The underwriters feel the amount in the EI fund is appropriate. 
We have to deal with the experts. 
We need to have appropriate and realistic reservoirs for the future. 
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Madam Speaker, congratulations on your appointment. 
Canadian families have been struggling to balance their household budgets over the last several years. 
Canada is expected to balance the budget shortly.  
Madam Speaker, I wish it was that easy. 
It is a very good question for people of means. 
It is not very good question for people who do not have means.  
They do not see us as being particularly overtaxed. 
Canadians want value for their tax money. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I congratulate the hon. member. 
However my question focuses on another area. 
Scientists understand that we will do the right thing. 
I do not think tax cuts have any relevance. 
That is bad for business. 
It will be exciting when we start choosing where to reinvest. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
We will correct the mistake at this point.  
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
I welcome them to the House.  
This poll was published in the Financial Post on September 27. 
I can give members a couple of examples from this poll.  
The article shows Canadian household savings are on the decline. 
At this point the savings rate is running at about 1 percent. 
That is a full 9 percent lower than it was just a decade ago.  
It preceded today's income tax. 
It received royal assent on September 20, 1917. 
They certainly throw it around very freely.  
Some of it was mentioned today during question period.  
There were some examples:
Gilles Champagne will sit as a member of the Canada Post board of governors. 
We read about them regularly.  
Mr. Regan landed on his feet.  
And where is she now? 
No one would ever dare suggest that maybe it is doing something wrong.  
It got struck off the register. 
These are the sorts of things that go on constantly with our taxpayers' money. 
It is the voters who decide who will be in Parliament, not us. 
What a waste of money.  
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, congratulations to you on your appointment as Acting Speaker. 
I thank the hon. member for North Vancouver for his comments. 
I gather the member is originally from New Zealand. 
He might have some wisdom to share with the House.  
However by North American standards, all governments in New Zealand were socialist. 
They were all tax and spend governments. 
They were the first with a welfare state in the world. 
They really set the stage for the total collapse of a welfare state.  
Then the World Bank stepped in and helped them to recover. 
The country is functioning better.  
New Zealand's GST has no exemptions. 
It was at a lower rate across the board. 
It makes it very difficult and very competitive. 
I thank the member for his questions. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
It is an honour to be able to do so. 
I unfortunately do not know which constituency he represents. 
I am absolutely convinced that is true.  
The hon. member for St. Paul's could not answer that question. 
I do not believe that she even believes that particular answer.  
I want to get to the substance of this debate. 
That is critical and that is really what this debate is all about.  
As individuals we are tired of the tax burden that we carry. 
As families, we are tired of the tax burden that we are carrying. 
The average family today has real problems. 
There are two difficulties with the infrastucture. 
My hon. colleague from North Vancouver alluded to a survey in the Financial Post . 
There is a very interesting observation here. 
Women want social programs more than they want tax cuts. 
This is very interesting. 
There is a marked difference here. 
That is very significant. 
The women have it right. 
They understand what matters. 
They can spend money very wisely. 
They think they can spend it more wisely than the government. 
It is about time we got some balance into this society of ours.  
We need more women in Parliament.  
I am a man who said the right thing. 
That is a fantastic way to live in this old world.  
I want to go back to research and development.  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
Madam Speaker, this is very interesting. 
Now we have another man in on this. 
Now we really have a balance. 
That is what the House is really all about.  
I want to move into the technology partnerships Canada program. 
This program is supposed to help build innovation, research and development in Canada.  
What is wrong with that?  
There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. 
The only difficulty is the contrast. 
If the contract is a secret one, this does not prove anything. 
There is no accountability here. 
That is very serious.  
I think we have to say that the DIPP has become tipsy.  
I think we have to be very serious about exactly what is going on here. 
Where is the truth in what is happening here?  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
There have been a lot of cuts. 
Tax relief, that is what we are talking about.  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
No, it is not in a tax cut. 
They were victims, in my judgment, of extreme cuts.  
The member talks about the brain drain. 
Madam Speaker, I guess the admiration is mutual. 
I have a lot of respect for the hon. member opposite. 
They will have the money that they are now paying in taxes. 
That is very significant.  
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
It had no idea about the actual number of jobs created. 
I think it is time for a remedial math course.  
You fill out the forms, you get the money. 
There is more they will not want to hear.  
I guess that does not matter either. 
This should come as no surprise. 
These effects only stand to reason. 
The government should not be injecting money into the private sector. 
Wherever this is done an unlevel playing field is created. 
This should worry us though. 
We have endured it for over 20 years. 
It is a win-win situation. 
As long as they are dismissed, unemployment will remain unacceptably high. 
Canadians want smaller government. 
They want lower taxes and they want real jobs. 
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, the hon. member got his wish. 
There was not too much heckling.  
Madam Speaker, congratulations on your recent appointment.  
The Liberals have rejected our suggestions for parliamentary reform time and time again.  
That brings me to the point he raised about negative remarks. 
There are no negative remarks coming from members of the Reform Party. 
We lead the way in providing alternative solutions. 
If it was not for us it would not focus on the debt.  
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour, Lib.):
I am quite concerned. 
I do not think they are buying into it any more.  
In 1993 when I was elected, that was a very big concern.  
Madam Speaker, the hon. member obviously was not listening to my speech. 
That is an exact quote from the text of my speech.  
They cut health care funding from $19 billion to $10.5 billion. 
I just do not understand this thing about negativity. 
On national unity they have kept their ears covered. 
It is time to uncover them.  
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I am a bit surprised by the motion today. 
The Reform Party is attempting to suggest that a balanced approach would be fiscally irresponsible.  
Nevertheless, Canadians are worried about the prospects for youth. 
Education matters more than ever today.  
This is also not true.  
He heard what the youth who came before us had to say. 
We know what also works. 
We know that higher education is the key to getting a good job. 
Knowing what works is just the first step. 
The Speech from the Throne has done just that.  
In our second mandate we will continue to build on what works. 
All Canadians have a stake in meeting these challenges. 
No single sector could have all the answers. 
The federal, provincial and territorial governments will also continue to address the problem. 
We must also ensure that they have access to education.  
This can, will and must end. 
We are still not meeting that growth and demand.  
This will give them a better chance.  
We will do this in partnership with provinces, communities and employers.  
It is good social policy too.  
Our young people of today are our future of tomorrow. 
I believe this is responsible.  
Half will go to investment in social and economic priorities.  
We will consult with Canadians as we have in the past. 
He also sat in on many meetings in Ottawa. 
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
It is quite a lot of money already.  
We will help by offering career planning and employment opportunities.  
I do know that in Ontario there are members who represent large aboriginal areas. 
They supported the Liberal members on this side. 
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
Do you know what the people there are calling for, are demanding? 
They should get that money back.  
I am asking that the people of Matapedia-Matane get that money back.  
Next Tuesday I will be seeing the fishers of Tourelle. 
They are 50, 40 or 30 hours short of eligibility for unemployment insurance. 
What is to be done with them? 
We do recognize that the disadvantaged in Canada and the poor in Canada need assistance.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
That is the state of affairs in this country. 
I have to concede, hesitantly, that they have made some progress. 
That is what it is. 
I ask the member what she said in the campaign.  
Now they are talking about spending money. 
They have not even heard the question yet. 
What are the needs? 
Where do we have to spend the money? 
If that does not stop then Canadians are doomed. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's question. 
In fact, we will balance the budget no later than the fiscal year 1998-99. 
I congratulate you on your appointment to your new position.  
Without their support, the results might have been different. 
I come now to the motion before us. 
However, I disagree totally with its means to this end.  
Fifty-four per cent of the cuts were to provincial transfers. 
Our friends across the way have got it all worked out to fool the public. 
I am not making this up. 
As for the increase in tax revenues, where does the money come from? 
The Liberal approach to putting our fiscal house in order is totally unacceptable. 
Yet, during the election campaign, the Liberals promised they would root out waste. 
It is not as if he did not know what the people want. 
This resolution comes from the City of Saint-Eustache.  
It is therefore his duty to distribute them equitably.  
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):
The member spoke about cuts in government. 
It was the defence department and the Canadian government. 
It is important for the member to acknowledge that to all of his electors.  
The government did a very important constructive thing.  
For starters, just recently Intrawest invested $500 million in Mont-Tremblant. 
In Saint-Eustache-Sainte-Therese, the rate is 14 per cent. 
In Matane, it is over 22 per cent.  
We invest $34 billion in Canada so we are entitled to some compensation. 
The member for Richmond-Arthabaska has the floor.  
The Acting Speaker (Mrs. 
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Madam Speaker, I will keep it brief.  
It is simply a matter of redistributing surplus money equitably, as it should be.  
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
That is what is hateful about the situation.  
This business started years ago. 
We need to look back at our history. 
The provinces, Quebec in particular, are tired of this situation. 
In the beginning, it was supposed to cost some $260 million. 
This is where money could be saved. 
Quebeckers can see through all that. 
So do Canadians as a whole. 
This is called showing respect and making better plans for the future.  
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour, Lib.):
He has had to try to balance the books. 
As I understand it right now, he is falling dramatically in the polls. 
This is not surprising. 
See what is going to happen. 
That is what the federal government will do. 
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
It is because of the orientation the government had toward its fiscal agenda.  
The agenda is very clear in my mind. 
We are going to continue to keep our fiscal house in order.  
There is some room to manoeuvre. 
I believe most parties can agree with that.  
The operative word is future. 
More important, what is the nature of the tax cut? 
How is it physically done?  
This whole debate talks about spending. 
It is very simple.  
There is another point missing from the debate. 
Everyone knows that Canada's population is aging. 
That is not so bad. 
In other words, there is a great elasticity. 
As a nation we have to spend money wisely and efficiently. 
They have expanded it in many communities. 
More services are being delivered to assist these people.  
We cannot create smart parents. 
I do not think everything we do will create better parents. 
We need people in the communities who try to assist these people. 
This is the balance we need. 
I will give a definition. 
They have entered into a trust agreement with us.  
The other side of the spending equation is investment. 
That program is oriented toward some very positive things. 
When the money comes back in, all Canadians will benefit from it. 
The money did not actually disappear. 
Those people will be less of a threat to our criminal justice system. 
There is some relationship between our tax system and that of the United States.  
Another aspect of the economy is that our supply of those graduates is very low. 
There is a bidding war. 
It will only hire half of them in Canada. 
The bottom line is that they could all get those jobs twice over. 
This is a very positive statement about how we want to invest. 
I keep coming back to the word invest as opposed to spending. 
As in the previous parliament we have the Canada Foundation for Innovation. 
We are going to give them the tools to meet the 21st century.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
They cut their taxes but increased their total revenues.  
Let us look at job creation. 
These are numbers that exist. 
The hon. member can find those numbers himself. 
They are very significant.  
The hon. member opposite has had exactly the same kind of experience. 
He has become wealthy because people spent their money. 
The suggestion that is being made here is that when people spend money is disappears. 
Investment money comes back.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question. 
Obviously I do not have the statistics that the member has before him. 
However, I am sure that there is a plausible explanation. 
It was started by Ronald Reagan. 
The bottom line is that they went out and bought Japanese cars. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
This is exactly what the present government brings to mind. 
This is exactly the image that comes to mind.  
I would like to ask the member a question. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question. 
The member is talking about duplication and overlap. 
I do not think, frankly, that there is enough money to go around. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
But because of a profligacy in the Congress, the deficit did increase.  
I wish we could reduce them to a nominal amount.  
The reality of government funding and government financing is that is not possible. 
We have been reducing them, by the way.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
We do not hear anything coming from their side on that aspect of it.  
At the time I was only eight months old.  
Because of that, he had a lifelong dream to come to Canada. 
We came to Canada in 1956. 
She asked where he was headed. 
It was quite contagious. 
My father is under palliative care. 
The hon. member for Durham should understand that my parents' laughter is now gone. 
The cuts to health care have taken away their humour.  
Where are the political parties when it comes to health and education?  
It is simply scandalous that this rhetoric can go on and on.  
Average Canadians are the real heroes in the war against the deficit. 
They are the ones who should benefit from their struggles.  
People who have worked for 20 or 30 years are now insecure in their jobs. 
They do not know if they will have a job tomorrow. 
They do not know if they will be able to meet their payments. 
They do not know if they will be able to send their kids to college.  
It is an absolute scandalous mistruth.  
It's a fish story.  
There is more to it than that. 
We will give you a major tax cut on the HST''.  
He was appointed by the Liberal Party. 
To us it is simply scandalous that this goes on and on.  
The member for Durham was talking about giving money to these programs. 
It is only good when it is spread around. 
When it concentrates in one pile you know exactly what it does''.  
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Vaughan-King-Aurora, Lib.):
We have made headway and positive change has occurred.  
Does the hon. member believe that every member of Parliament should participate in that process? 
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
Yes, indeed, I will be holding townhall meetings. 
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I was really impressed with the hon. member's speech. 
Just recently I was an election observer in Bosnia. 
For the two of us it cost 36 Deutschemarks. 
The same breakfast could probably be bought here for $6.  
If he does, why does he not tell us? 
Madam Speaker, I would like to speak on and on. 
Yes, we have another agenda. 
Perhaps he would like to have a copy of it. 
It is just one example of our agenda. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
The port is being used now after it was sold to an American company.  
Some were only short by a few hours. 
The government should not be proud of this. 
I have often felt that I am from a generation that has not done without. 
I want my children and their children to have those same benefits.  
Let's pay the dues.  
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Vaughan-King-Aurora, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I would like to congratulate the hon. member on her speech.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I will certainly respond. 
I thank the member for his comments. 
I too want to acknowledge Rod Murphy and all of his help.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Vaughan-King-Aurora, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I noticed with a great deal of interest the Reform Party's motion: 
The debate spoke to the renewed confidence that Canadians have in their government.  
I also want to bring something to the attention of the Reform Party members. 
We also set some very good objectives. 
What are our priorities? 
Youth is a priority. 
I have dedicated my political career to advancing the cause of youth. 
We also invested heavily in technology. 
We understand the multiplier effect that investing in technology has. 
There is a strategy in place. 
We inherited a financial mess. 
We have cleaned it up. 
Now we are entering the second phase and we need to identify our priorities. 
What do Canadians hold sacred? 
Budgets and throne speeches must reflect Canadian values. 
One of them is health care. 
What did we do? 
We reinvested in health care. 
Because that is a part of the fibre of Canada.  
What else did we do? 
We reinvested $350 million on youth employment projects. 
How did we do that? 
Did we do it the old fashioned way? 
We invested in areas where there was growth. 
We identified 33 key areas of growth in our economy. 
Gone is the old way of pork barrelling. 
Gone is the old way of throwing money at problems without getting results.  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the motion defeated.  
(The House adjourned at 6.47 p.m.)
