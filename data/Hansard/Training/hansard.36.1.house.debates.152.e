EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 152 
Monday, November 16, 1998 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
The House resumed from October 1 consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
These individuals volunteer because they want to do good. 
These people contribute thousands of hours on an annual basis. 
These people volunteer because they want to. 
We have a system which treats political contributions differently than charitable contributions. 
I will tell members how.  
But that is not the whole issue.  
Therefore, the government created a balance. 
It created a sliding scale. 
This is not what all of these men and women are giving to charities.  
I would say that the measures which have been taken by the government are fair. 
Are they the best things we can do for charities? 
Are we doing more for charities? 
Should we do more for charities? 
There are over 80,000 charitable organizations across the land. 
The motion as proposed by my colleague would not solve the problem at all. 
It would be a complicating factor rather than solve the problem. 
What we have before us is a balancing act.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Information is flooding our senses. 
Boom and bust cycles are shorter. 
We live in a time of dynamic and exciting change all around us. 
Reform has long recognized this point. 
The federal government should only address key national issues. 
I appreciate Motion No. M-318 because it parallels this philosophy. 
It is not a limitless supply. 
The needs of the community vary. 
They are more likely to cost more and deliver less. 
I know what the answer would be in my riding. 
I think we all do. 
It is time to support the motion.  
Calgary is second only to Toronto in the number of head offices. 
Calgary's rate of volunteerism is one of the highest in Canada. 
Families have been restored through this program. 
The volunteers have as much fun as the guests.  
I also note that this idea is not foreign to the House. 
It was a suggestion made by the finance committee in 1996 which recommended: 
For sake of time I move to my summary and note that change is everywhere. 
They are closer to the community. 
The finance committee recommended it two years ago. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Mr. Jerry Pickard (Chatham-Kent Essex, Lib.):
This is a motherhood issue when we stop to think about it. 
That is a given and is very true. 
Every one of us sees it in our communities.  
I commend all charitable organizations and all the work they do. 
The government is no longer spending $42 billion more than it is taking in. 
We came out of that. 
We are doing better on the employment initiatives. 
We are doing better on delivery of service to Canadians. 
At this point it is important that the government maintain the course we are on. 
We have to do the best we can for those making political donations. 
All those arguments are there, but that will inevitably lead us to our own defeat.  
We must maintain a course of being as prudent as we can be. 
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
The timing is certainly right. 
We are in the middle of prebudget consultations. 
Examples have been stated before. 
It is not really a cost but an investment in communities. 
Governments are actually helping to create the problem.  
That is a huge gap to fill'', he said.  
The government can play with the numbers and make them fit as it sees fit.  
Government members have recognized this disparity in the past. 
We as legislators must be aware of that and continue to support their efforts.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I am glad of the opportunity to speak to this issue. 
Various legislation controls the transparency of how government bureaucracies operate. 
I will give a classic example. 
The administrators are not hurt. 
The administrators actually raise their salary.  
I suggest to members opposite that they do that. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there unanimous consent?  
Madam Speaker, it has been a pleasure to bring forward this motion. 
However, the intend of the motion was much more serious than that.  
Everything cannot be done in this one motion. 
The motion I think does have wide support. 
The accountability is no more stricter here than it is for charities.  
The motion is very timely in view of the current budgetary situation in Canada. 
It is very doable. 
For that reason I am pleased that this motion has come forward. 
I look forward to the vote tonight. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
It being 11.52 a.m., the time provided for debate has expired.  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there unanimous consent?  
(The sitting of the House was suspended at 11.53 a.m.) 
The House resumed at 12 p.m. 
Motion No. 1 will be debated and voted on.  
I will now put Motion No. 1 to the House.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP) moved: 
``peared on the facility on June 3, 1998.'' 
My amendment deals with a very significant issue in the package before members this morning. 
It is a significant development. 
It slipped through committee. 
There was no justification. 
There was no explanation. 
We know that every year 250,000 young people get hooked on smoking. 
It also flies in the face of what other jurisdictions are doing.  
It is time for the government to show leadership. 
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
We had a good and thorough discussion at committee. 
The government proposed several amendments. 
Bill C-42 amends the Tobacco Act. 
That is a very significant and important component of Bill C-42.  
At the end of five years there will be a complete ban on tobacco sponsorship. 
We propose to accomplish this through a transitional process. 
During the following three years we want to tighten the limits significantly.  
In five years there would be no more promotions of tobacco sponsorship. 
We heard from the arts, sports and other groups that would be affected these changes. 
Bill C-42 recognizes that reality.  
We also heard from the health community. 
Health organizations look at what we were doing in the bill. 
For those reasons we listened very carefully to what witnesses had to say at committee. 
We launched the tobacco control initiative in 1996. 
We started by setting aside $50 million a year over five years. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, here we have good old Bill C-42. 
The answer was really quite specific. 
The patient was a veteran, a fellow who had emphysema from smoking. 
I admit to having a very strenuous bias in this area. 
There is no other way to say it.  
The Tobacco Act was really a pretty good act. 
My own teenagers are keen mountain bike enthusiasts. 
This is a youthful activity, an activity that is directed at kids. 
His response was very illustrative. 
It is very difficult. 
The overspill is immense.  
Quebec's tobacco legislation is stronger than Canada's. 
Bill C-42 is weaker than the law in Quebec. 
Formula 1 racing was the issue that pushed this bill into position. 
Canada is weaker than Australia.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
The amendment proposed by the New Democratic Party reads as follows: 
``peared on the facility on June 3, 1998''.  
This clause will take full effect, under the current bill, in October 2003. 
This is where the amendment under consideration comes in.  
A total sponsorship ban will come into effect on October 1, 2003.  
The Bloc Quebecois doubts it will. 
Bill C-42 must be taken as a whole. 
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
Bill C-42 does nothing to toughen the Tobacco Act. 
It was the first and basically the only thing it did. 
The government simply adds to the problem. 
This bill does nothing at all to change that.  
The government now has an opportunity to do something but it has done nothing. 
It was not the right thing to do.  
This is absolutely bizarre.  
They do not argue that figure.  
That is putting it in perspective. 
What would we do in the House of Commons? 
Excuse the pun, it is dead wrong.  
We just had Remembrance Day. 
What they are advertizing is lifestyle. 
They are not advertising reality. 
They are advertising lifestyle and spending millions of dollars to do it.  
It was introduced in the Senate by Senator Kenny. 
It will be introduced in the House by a Liberal backbencher. 
The bill will be killed by the government. 
That is true of any product. 
Unless those ingredients are present in a bill, nothing will to change. 
We will continue to lose 40,000-plus Canadians a year to smoking.  
Let us call that a levy. 
Let us be realistic. 
That is what we have to do.  
We need real dollars to attack these people. 
Examine who owns Shoppers Drug Mart. 
What we have to do is fight this with every resource we have. 
This amendment speaks for itself. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
This motion gives some teeth to the bill.  
I commend the member from Winnipeg North Centre. 
The question of addiction does not apply only to the users of tobacco. 
This government and previous governments have been addicted. 
They are addicted to alcohol.  
The region could not afford it.  
The tobacco industry must advertise. 
Why does anyone advertise? 
It advertises to sell more cars. 
Why do tobacco companies advertise? 
To sell more of their products. 
To whom are they advertising now? 
What is their target area? 
Their target area is youth.  
Yet we find the government reluctant to give up the addiction it has to taxes. 
This is a good amendment. 
Is it not worth it? 
It is a question of putting something first. 
Then curling associations across Canada said ``No, this is a healthy lifestyle. 
Is curling going downhill? 
Did it take five years to phase in? 
The opposition knows what it wants. 
The government should let its members have a free vote on this. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The question is on Motion No. 1. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
MARINE CONSERVATION AREAS ACT 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
These laws led to the creation of Canada's first marine conservation area.  
The two governments will continue to exercise their respective jurisdictions. 
The park is entirely a marine setting. 
Why, then, is Heritage Canada acting so arrogantly today? 
In our opinion, the environment is a shared jurisdiction. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
We are glad to say that we can support Bill C-48 in principle. 
NMCAs are not parks as such in the usual definition. 
Marine protected areas are associated with an open ecosystem and are large and dynamic. 
We do have some reservations and concerns, however, with Bill C-48.  
There has been extremely slow progress in establishing the NMCAs. 
We encourage government to move swiftly in this for the 29 identified areas.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
My friend no longer chairs the fisheries committee. 
Salmon stocks on both coasts faced similar devastation to that suffered by the cod. 
Salmon stocks on the east coast have already been devastated. 
Migrating salmon are blocked. 
That study reveals hydroelectric dams are silent killers of our rivers. 
Marine parks will not halt the devastation to marine life caused by hydroelectric dams.  
Disease is at the heart of the controversy over fish farming in Canada. 
That does not mean the end of fish farms. 
There is lots of room for aquaculture operations which respect the marine environment.  
The study classified 58 of those streams as being threatened.  
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
The park includes only the marine environment. 
These are among the main legislative provisions adopted in 1997.  
Let me briefly remind members what happened.  
But there is more. 
This means that the quarrelling is far from over.  
Quebec is still a province.  
This same legislation provides that Quebec cannot transfer its lands to the federal government. 
What a fine example of co-operative federalism. 
God knows which waters the fish will choose. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Such legislation is far overdue. 
The Bay of Fundy is home to many different species of marine life. 
The lucrative lobster fishery still remains, but this is also being threatened.  
Recently our coastal regions have been facing another menacing attack. 
Clause 18 of this bill explains the application of the act. 
The Progressive Conservative Party has long been concerned with preserving our ecosystems. 
In 1986 the PC government approved the national marine parks policy. 
There must be a balanced approach taken when exploring in an area. 
Our fishers must have a direct say in the management of their industry. 
It is also important that aboriginal peoples be involved in the negotiations. 
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
However I have several major concerns with the bill. 
The first is with the structure and wording of the legislation. 
The second is with the potential impact of the legislation on natural resource development. 
The opportunities that these projects are providing to Atlantic Canadians simply would be disallowed. 
That is absolutely unacceptable and quite irresponsible on the part of the government.  
It takes only an order in council to add a conservation area. 
This requirement will have serious impacts on natural resource industries. 
This leads into the last point I wish to make. 
The act is clearly intended to fulfil preservationist and not conservationist objectives. 
National parks normally allow relatively free public access.  
I reiterate that I support the goals of the legislation. 
Too often Reform members of parliament are portrayed as enemies of the environment. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. 
I am a firm believer in conservation and responsible development. 
I understand the necessity for environmental responsibility.  
I also advocate participation in the world community of agreements. 
Unfortunately I cannot support the bill. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak to this bill.  
Much of the bill is not clearly stated. 
Where the responsibility crosses over to the provinces is not spelled out. 
There are many things on which this bill needs some genuine bookkeeping and homework done.  
This bill changes the previous concept in Canada as to what is a park. 
Traditionally a park was an area relatively free for public travel. 
A park was established in some cases for heritage purposes. 
This adds to the meaning of the word park. 
We do not believe in that. 
This is a classic example of the government sidestepping the usual legislative process. 
The majority of the members on a standing committee are from the government side. 
That is a dangerous precedent in the bill.  
This could all take place at the minister's discretion.  
We see all kinds of difficulties in this when the provinces are not consulted.  
There is another item in the bill which is terribly dangerous. 
It violates all the Canadian principles I have ever read. 
As I read that, it is without a warrant. 
They have that right.  
There seems to be something missing in the bill. 
As my colleague said, we agree to the polluter pay principle. 
There is no question about that. 
We would strongly support the bill in that regard. 
However, the bill violates the principle of the democratic process so much. 
It violates the rule of law. 
It violates the longstanding principles of justice. 
It violates the authority of the House as the legislature.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):
They worked together in a way to strengthen and enhance rural life. 
My thanks goes to Jan and those other Canadians who attended this conference. 
MEMBER FOR DAUPHIN-SWAN RIVER 
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Sadly, this family's ordeal is not over yet. 
ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN QUEBEC 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
Which Lucien Bouchard will show up at the leaders debate tomorrow evening? 
Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):
It was in following those passions that Michel tragically perished.  
ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN QUEBEC 
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
I will be voting Liberal- 
The hon. member for Yukon.  
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
He died for his convictions, his country and his people.  
It is time to right the wrongs.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
The credibility of the Minister of Finance is getting pretty thin.  
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Clark is a man of integrity. 
He is a proud Albertan. 
He has proven himself to be a man of vision. 
He was a fiscal conservative before it was popular to be a fiscal conservative.  
He is a consensus builder. 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Whose money is it anyway? 
It is the taxpayers' money and the citizens of Mississauga West- 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Why is he trying to hide overtaxation?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
It is called having the highest personal income taxes in the western world. 
It is called punishing employers and employees with unreasonable payroll taxes.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is very clear that six months does not a year make. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, Canadian taxpayers want a reward. 
Where is the tax relief?  
He has an option to return those dollars to Canadians.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
It is doing well and it is going to continue to do well.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
They have paid billions of dollars into it. 
He owes them money back.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let us understand what members of the Reform Party are advocating.  
They are advocating $9 billion worth of tax reductions. 
What they are advocating is $24 billion to $25 billion in cuts.  
Where is that money going to come out of? 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, our real agenda is to give tax relief. 
It is Canadians' money, not his own personal fund. 
When will he give it back?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Reform members talk about their agenda. 
They would not support research and development.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
We were also the only ones to put forward anti-deficit legislation. 
He should speak seriously.  
There will be nothing left of this legacy at the rate the minister is going.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Your comments should reflect the decisions made by your head office.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
That is the truth.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health.  
Two hundred and fifty thousand young Canadians start smoking each and every year. 
That is a human tragedy. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, who is the health minister kidding? 
Smoking related illnesses are costing Canadians $5 billion a year.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the finance minister's budget projections are bogus. 
The Canadian standard of living continues to decline as taxes rise.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We have made it very clear that it is our intention to reduce taxes. 
We did so in the last budget. 
We would hope to do so in every budget. 
We would also hope to continue to reduce EI premiums. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
These payroll taxes are regressive and punish the poor in Canada.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We want to reduce taxes. 
We have demonstrated that. 
We want to reduce EI premiums. 
We have demonstrated that. 
This is not the issue. 
We are not prepared to do it by gutting the health care system.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
That is the government's record when it comes to taxation of low income Canadians. 
It belongs to workers and employers. 
When will he give it back to them in the form of lower premiums?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let us simply take a look at the facts.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
However, we still have another six months to go.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is just what we did in the last budget. 
They want Canada to be back in a deficit position. 
This is certainly not what Canadians want.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
The hon. member can count on us to keep our word.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I guess the best defence is a good offence. 
They promised to preserve it. 
They delivered $7 billion in cuts. 
They promised to cut waiting lists. 
They are trying to look after the brain drain. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
This member speaks of twisting the facts. 
This man and his party should be ashamed of themselves.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Finance. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Is this not immoral?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
I would ask members to be very judicious in their choice of words. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we will preserve the health care system in this country. 
We will preserve the social safety net.  
That is where they have probably chosen their social model from. 
This is an advanced and progressive country and we will not listen to Reform.  
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
For him it may well be. 
I want the hon. member to go to his question.  
The hon. member for Drummond.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have already taken action. 
The hon. member for Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia.  
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia, Lib.):
Is this efficient use of taxpayers' money?  
Mr. Speaker, WD is bringing a service to the people. 
It is good business.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Now Blood Bank Corporation has shut its doors and is being sued by creditors. 
Why did the government not do the same?  
We are not ashamed of that.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, that is unacceptable. 
The Reform Party does not like it. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
CANADIAN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ACT 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health.  
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Canadians want to know what the Minister of Health has to say about the issue.  
But they need the government's support. 
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member's question is a bit out of line. 
It is an important piece of legislation. 
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
That is why I am pleased- 
The hon. member for West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
The solicitor general and the APEC inquiry have come under a cloud. 
The chairman of the commission has come under a cloud. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
It is accountable to this House, as was determined in 1988 by this House.  
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
I take this exercise extremely seriously. 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
We have yet to receive those details. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have another question for the solicitor general.  
A judge is totally independent, unlike the public complaints commission. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
This is not the case with the public complaints commission. 
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Cooperation.  
I hope more can be done as time goes on.  
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege. 
I categorically deny having made such a statement. 
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on the same point of privilege.  
I never did any such thing. 
I said that Ethyl Corporation used Canadians as guinea pigs. 
I never accused the Minister of Health in any way. 
I would like the member to retract his statement.  
Many times we have in the House statements and counter statements. 
This is not a point of privilege. 
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I along with some of my colleagues attended the meeting in question. 
I listened to the entire debate. 
My member's statement reflected my understanding of what the two members were saying. 
I stick with that position.  
Now the record is straight on both sides. 
It is an interpretation of the facts, not a question of privilege.  
STANDING COMMITTEE ON PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):
It is noted in Beauchesne's sixth edition at paragraph 9 on page 5: 
Briefly, these changes to the standing orders are for private members' hour. 
Beauchesne's also notes on page 5, paragraph 9: 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
I accept that there is a leadership in the House. 
The first is Private Members' Business. 
I would discount that.  
A supply motion would do the same trick to some extent. 
I believe the timing of these changes is crucial. 
Prorogation is a bill killer. 
However, if it wants to kill this initiative it will have to do it democratically. 
He is going to lose this one. 
The private member is going to win.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, first of all, the Chair has ruled on this issue previously. 
It's not for negotiation.  
The hon. member opposite says that it is not for negotiation. 
I could not do so, nor would I have the intention of doing so.  
Finally, something has just been raised with regard to private members' items and prorogation. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
The point he raises is very interesting.  
At the outset, the Conservative Party is in favour of the 13th report.  
The member for Sarnia-Lambton is quite correct to feel aggrieved. 
I do not welcome being placed in this position myself, nor does the Chair. 
Frankly, this all came about as a surprise. 
I support the objections of the member for Sarnia-Lambton. 
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
I support the member's question of privilege on this issue.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
We have no choice. 
The House has spoken. 
It is time to move it forward.  
I want to make that understood at the outset.  
I reserved a decision on the other points. 
The House had clearly decided to proceed. 
That was a decision made by the House. 
Therefore, on those matters which could be changed at the time, I acted on them.  
On the others I had to seek advice. 
I presumed that the House leaders would have discussions with members of their own party. 
I believe that there are methods by which grievances can be addressed.  
However, I repeat that the decision will not be taken by the House leaders alone. 
The decision will be taken by the House.  
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
As a rule the Speaker does not give explanations for his decisions. 
I judged today that we were getting a little bit close. 
The question still had the preamble and that is why I intervened.  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
It is with pride that I present this petition to the House.  
Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
I am happy to present this petition on behalf of my constituents.  
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we will be answering Question No. 136 today. 
Question No. 136- Mr. Jean Dube: 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
This is an increase of about 10% on their benefit level.  
Currently, 18 of the 22 regions in Atlantic Canada and Quebec participate in the projects. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
FIRST NATIONS LAND MANAGEMENT ACT 
Is the House ready for the question?  
The question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
MANITOBA CLAIM SETTLEMENTS IMPLEMENTATION ACT 
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Hon. members will recall that when this government unveiled ``Gathering Strength:
This is not a goal that can be achieved overnight. 
It will involve many steps, large and small. 
Bill C-56 is one such step.  
These exemptions from the Indian Act will have two strategic outcomes. 
Gathering Strength calls for the development of vibrant on reserve economies. 
In order to do that we need to expedite the process of establishing reserves.  
It will also significantly reduce the time required to add lands to reserves.  
There is nothing controversial about the proposed legislation. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
With that in mind, I think we will find support from the official opposition.  
We agree that there are historical obligations. 
There is no question about that. 
We in the Reform Party are no different. 
We agree with that as well. 
We have these historical obligations. 
The term self-reliance is a very important one. 
However we do have some questions. 
I have some questions in particular within my own constituency. 
I believe they are being sincere about that. 
To me partnership means a new understanding as well.  
I support the bill wholeheartedly. 
It was a long time coming. 
That is nothing anyone can be proud of.  
I have five reserves in my constituency and I know these people. 
It just would not work. 
I think the hon. gentlemen opposite understand that.  
Until that is clearly spelled out that partnership is an unknown quantity. 
I was there with my wife. 
It was a great time. 
They were great people. 
I made a return visit there. 
I had more hair then; I needed a barber. 
I asked them at that time what they wanted from self-government. 
They were not quite sure in this partnership. 
For instance, one chap was very interested in an economic venture.  
I think he understands that. 
It would not be healthy for any first nation not to have some consistency.  
They want to break from their traditional past. 
We agree with that. 
Then there would be continuity. 
They are crying out for accountability. 
The further government gets from people, the less accountability there seems to be.  
Are we negotiating self-government with each individual parcel? 
These are questions Canadians are asking. 
They cannot be sovereign unto themselves. 
That is not what Canadians understand. 
Canadians understand that the Government of Saskatchewan is not sovereign unto itself. 
I wish we could have some. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Let us discuss the first part. 
They had to learn new ways and adjust to a totally different way of life. 
In short, the spirit of co-operation was very much absent. 
More than 20 years passed without any clear definition of the mechanisms. 
This proposal served as a starting point for negotiations with each first nation.  
This type of agreement is not new. 
The Bloc Quebecois is, therefore, in favour of the underlying principles behind this bill. 
First, a problem with the voters' list was cited. 
On the contrary, it was manna from heaven just before the holidays. 
It seems that the federal government simply bought votes.  
Rather ironic, is it not?  
Obviously this sort of practice raises some questions. 
Is vote buying common practice? 
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I to rise to support this bill.  
It is important to be willing to renew an partnership. 
It will strengthen aboriginal governance. 
First nations people have suffered disproportionately for the last 150 to 200 years. 
They cannot afford to have government make any more mistakes on their behalf.  
They develop very differently culturally than Europeans. 
In Yukon land claims are not such a scary idea. 
It has been a real benefit to Yukon. 
It was a long struggle. 
Implementation is not easy. 
They have to answer to their people. 
This gives them the opportunity to redress it.  
Part two is the reserve establishment. 
This document provides a guide to the future. 
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
I express my reservations about the combination of bills this legislation represents. 
Instead, first nations will have greater control over how and where this money is spent.  
These 19 first nations signed the agreement in May 1997.  
The same problems occurred there. 
These entitlements have never been settled with some of the first nations. 
That is an important point.  
With the creation of a reserve, however, they would fall under federal jurisdiction.  
Accommodating this change in jurisdiction is a very time-consuming process. 
This is something we look forward to doing at committee stage.  
Part 2 requires further study as well. 
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
That is something that has to be determined up front, not some 21 years later.  
In other words the government sometimes goes into these negotiations in the wrong way. 
Taking the member very seriously, he is absolutely right. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Nobody gets the same deal. 
This is not a sensible way to do business.  
Mr. Speaker, I could not agree with the member more. 
It is a good question to ask.  
I see that we do have the justice minister in the House this evening. 
Those are legitimate questions that have to be answered by the government itself.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
I have some personal knowledge of the hydro dams in northern Manitoba. 
I worked on them as a carpenter. 
They actually thought raw land could be flooded without clearing any of the trees first. 
They were flooding whole forests. 
It completely underestimated the damage from what it was doing. 
It just was not true.  
It is a huge revenue producer. 
Those are things that are left for others to clean up and deal with. 
It goes back to what some of the other members have mentioned. 
This is a legacy we do not want to leave. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
That is no surprise. 
These are only some of the recommendations made by task force members.  
The fact is that none of the task force members are Reform Party members. 
However, that is not important.  
What is important is that the recommendations came from the aboriginal people themselves. 
I was very disappointed however by some of things she said. 
My disappointment will become evident as I read through part of this letter: 
I will read more of the minister's response: 
I agree with part of that statement. 
Aboriginal people are speaking up to hold their leaders accountable. 
They are saying how they want leadership to look. 
But the aboriginal people have not been listened to at all. 
She has really missed the boat.  
Over the first couple of dozen calls I started to see common themes developing.  
They do not necessarily follow the guidelines that are laid out by Indian affairs. 
I heard one story after another of extremely crowed living conditions. 
Many of these people called for a forensic audit. 
They felt that the current audits being done on the reserves were virtually useless. 
Furthermore, they would only make available a summary and in some cases nothing at all. 
The accountability was not there.  
As a member of parliament it is my job to represent my constituents. 
Then we laid out guidelines that would guide us in our process. 
That is what we did.  
Throughout the process we heard from about 300 aboriginal members. 
I thought that was a pretty sad statement. 
They said that people listened to Phil Fontaine all the time. 
The minister listens to Phil Fontaine but nobody has ever listened to them before. 
We did listen and we did it in three stages. 
We started in the first stage with private, confidential consultations. 
We held these consultations at various native friendship centres around the constituency. 
They did not feel that they would be detected easily. 
This was very common. 
Some of them did pay a price.  
Mr. Charles Favel was there more than once throughout the process. 
I heard from him before we started. 
He was banished from the reserve. 
The letter is quite unbelievable. 
I have copies of it for anyone who would like to see it. 
They invited me to a tribal chiefs council meeting. 
Of course they are. 
I am going to represent them.  
Then I may get through all the recommendations. 
It is not happening now. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
I have listened to it for about as long as I care to. 
Some comments have been very revealing of the true attitudes. 
I have a copy of it if anyone would like to see it.  
I hear people laughing. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
He should be thoroughly ashamed of himself. 
In some cases charges were laid and guilt was affirmed through the justice system. 
To say that it is across the country, I do not believe that is true. 
We are trying to rectify the problem by calling for proper accountability. 
In the report we certainly were not attacking chiefs and councils. 
Does that sound like we are slamming chiefs and councils? 
We deliberately took a very conciliatory tone. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Selkirk-Interlake is located in the centre of Manitoba. 
I agree that no doubt the member has some knowledge. 
I will deal with the bill in two parts. 
It was land they had occupied for thousands of years. 
They should be compensated for that land. 
There is absolutely no problem with that on my part. 
We share this land together. 
Our national boundaries are well known from coast to coast to coast. 
We and the aboriginal people share this common land.  
For just a minute I would like to show that is the case. 
They suggest some solutions. 
I could support that on my part. 
I will deal with that in a moment.  
Co-management of resources is exactly what I have been talking about. 
It will be a good aspect of the agreement. 
We conducted an investigation. 
Many thousands of dollars were taken contrary to the trust agreement. 
They needed to find out what was going on.  
These are the non-elected people. 
That is why my colleagues and I speak out so strongly on this matter.  
Accountability should be included in these agreements. 
Certain things make for accountability in government. 
I would certainly be pleased to answer questions after my speech.  
It is in Hansard . 
It was not the member for Provencher. 
It was the Indian affairs minister David Newman from the province of Manitoba government. 
The second is an independent auditor general. 
That is the one that would provide for accountability of the financial funds. 
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
I appreciate the comments made by the member of the New Democratic Party. 
It is a bill about compensation. 
The member for Selkirk-Interlake talked about the fact he lives on the inlet. 
We spent a summer there.  
Some of his colleagues have referred to that. 
The hon. member for New Brunswick Southwest has spoken to it very clearly. 
This is an agreement about compensation. 
It is an agreement about a contract and a breach of contract. 
He referred to the cottage owners in Lake Winnipeg. 
They all signed the agreement.  
The accountability problems deal with much more than this one agreement. 
They are average people who are getting elected to these things. 
I take pride in speaking out in my riding for my constituents. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
I am saying they probably are well founded incidents.  
I made a number of connections with anti-Indian organizations like FIRE. 
The hon. member can deny any connection to them if he likes. 
He did not want that crossover too public I guess.  
It is a play on words instead of our home and native land. 
I would very much doubt that. 
In fact I know it is not true.  
People in the House have made some pretty wild promises over the years. 
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
This is for a variety of reasons. 
Now we are focusing our attention on righting this historic wrong in Manitoba.  
Typically the hydro company would require the first nation's consent to continue the easement.  
Here is the catch. 
Hon. members can no doubt see the dilemma. 
The answer is this. 
It could serve as a legislative template for similar efforts in other provinces. 
Manitobans want this legislation.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
I think it was a wonderful job. 
I wonder if the hon. member was gambling. 
We have taken a deficit of $42.5 billion down to zero in five years. 
I can understand the hon. member's frustration in making a statement like that.  
Mr. Speaker, I wonder if the hon. member would reply to my question.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
On questions and comments, the hon. parliamentary secretary.  
I certainly enjoyed it.  
The member and I share this very personal interest. 
I do not know what the reason is. 
We are now getting very close to voting time. 
They keep mentioning the matter of accountability. 
They raise the spectre of accountability of first nations.  
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member for Peterborough for his question. 
Yes, is the simple point and the answer.  
The hon. member across the way wants to know why I was chosen. 
My interests concern all of Canada. 
We are a national party.  
That is the point. 
My interests concern the nation.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
On questions and comments, the hon. member for Wetaskiwin.  
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
This agreement is an attempt to bring to a close 21 years of negotiation. 
Who does he think have been the- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey.  
I think we have done a darn good job of it.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
That is basically what this is all about.  
It is about a government trying to go ahead by buying votes. 
That is what it is about.  
Maggie Balfour is the former chief of the Norway House reserve. 
They were going to put forward their challenge to what had happened.  
Ms. Balfour described it as bribery in the article. 
There was complicity between the federal government and the band council.  
They were continuing to call referenda until they got the results they needed. 
The federal government asked questions about the accuracy of the voters' list at Norway House. 
It even admitted that the rules could be changed for the second vote. 
Some 186 band members signed the application to the court.  
She acknowledges that later she signed the affidavit because she wanted the money. 
The first challenge to the referendum was rejected by the federal court. 
In light of this, what does the Reform Party propose as a solution? 
It was a thousand dollars a pop to have dissidents drop a legal challenge. 
I think that is only fair. 
It is only fair that their type of consideration be heard in the House. 
These types of consideration should be taken into account.  
Let us think about how this plays with the Liberal strategy in other areas. 
It is not only a strategy they keep up with aboriginals in this country. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sory but I must interrupt you now. 
The time for debate has concluded. 
And the bells having rung : 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.

Mr. Speaker, the Conservative members present vote yes on this motion.  
(The House divided on the amendment, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the amendment defeated.  
FIRST NATIONS LAND MANAGEMENT ACT 
Is there agreement to proceed in such a fashion?  
See list under Division No. 262.] 
I declare the amendment defeated.  
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Water is our most important natural resource. 
It can come at the expense of another watershed. 
The central message of the inquiry's report, in the words of Peter Pearse, was: 
It has been 14 years since the Pearse report. 
We know there is broad support for the gap to be filled. 
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
There are no bulk exports taking place at the present time. 
The company to which my hon. colleague referred has had its permit revoked. 
There might be effects on levels and flows of lakes and rivers. 
We want to take a cautious approach.  
Ontario is one of those that is suffering greatly at the present time. 
Both federal and provincial governments have a role to play in deciding the outcome. 
I can assure my hon. friend we will proceed with the utmost caution.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
We often call it Senator Kenny's bill.  
We were saying the bill does not have enough teeth in it. 
Bill S-13 does something about this. 
It would levy 50 cents per carton of cigarettes at the manufacturing level. 
I mentioned that 40,000 Canadians die every year. 
I have a very simple comparison but very graphic. 
To be exact, 36,500 people. 
We want to see something done. 
We are saying that Bill C-13 would do something about that. 
Senator Kenny's bill does something about it. 
Mr. Speaker, I share the concern of the member regarding smoking. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 7:41 p.m.)
