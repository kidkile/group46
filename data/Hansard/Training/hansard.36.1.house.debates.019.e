Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a final petition regarding the national highway system. 
PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS COMPENSATION FUND 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I suggest that all questions be allowed to stand.  
ALLOTTED DAY-CANADIAN FISHING INDUSTRY 
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC) moved: 
The issues we are dealing with today have developed over many years.  
If the answers were easy, frankly, we would have solved a number of problems. 
I scarcely need to point out that the entire Canadian population is affected.  
That in itself tells a story.  
Poor resource management tops the list of reasons for the decline. 
The issue of overcapacity is not new. 
For a number of years various commissions of inquiry have studied the issue. 
Less obvious is the question of the best way to make it happen. 
They told the government that this plan was a mistake. 
The Liberal government chose to move ahead with its plan.  
What has it meant? 
The result is that we now have zero salmon stock conservation benefits. 
That is the net effect of the Mifflin plan.  
They cannot walk away from it. 
They cannot walk away from their commitments. 
They cannot walk away from their licences. 
That is the net result.  
There has been no indication of any allocation to the traditional commercial sector.  
That is the sector most affected. 
For the longest period the east coast has been dramatically affected by this issue. 
He does not report to any particular department in government. 
He does not report to cabinet. 
The auditor general is at arm's length from the government.  
Debate continues about the contributing factors. 
There are many, as I said earlier in my remarks. 
If we were able to do that I would feel better. 
Then we could fix the problem overnight. 
Literally hundreds of fishing communities have been seriously affected. 
What answer was cooked up? 
That was the government's answer announced with a great deal of fanfare in 1994. 
It was to ``call for partnerships with all stakeholders''. 
In his recent report he drew the following conclusion: 
That is a real indictment of the government. 
They have had to reorganize their families. 
They try to plan for the future. 
You may have wanted to continue on to school but it is over. 
Tough luck is the message they are getting from the government. 
That is not new. 
Maybe we should not be surprised.  
She went to the Liberal caucus. 
There were 31 members of the Liberal caucus from Atlantic Canada out of 32. 
Not one member would sign the petition. 
This was over and above everything else.  
The same is true for the fishing industry.  
Certainly from my own experience I freely offer some advice to the government today. 
I do not know whether it will be followed. 
We did it in only six months. 
But we were successful for a reason. 
I look forward to that. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this motion certainly is a very straightforward motion. 
That is not the point.  
The point is that this leader has a tremendous amount of gall. 
This leader was in government. 
The problem has been created by successive Liberal and Conservative governments. 
The people in the area should have had the input. 
It was drawn into Ottawa. 
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
I sincerely appreciate that.  
I am disappointed he does not. 
What we got instead, I do not want to comment on it. 
I do not understand what that does for them. 
That would be the first thing to do. 
In other words keep the issue on the table.  
Second is the matter of the treaty. 
This is a treaty which our government signed in 1985. 
No treaties are perfect. 
The member was alluding to what had been done. 
In 1985 the government of the day was able to secure this treaty. 
In the years that followed there was a management plan. 
That is even more important.  
The principle of equity that is found within the treaty is extremely important. 
They have kids in school. 
They have bills to pay. 
Some money should be put toward that end.  
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to the words of the hon. member for Sherbrooke. 
The fishers tell us now it was a fiasco. 
I, however, agree with him on two points. 
When he says decisions are made in Ottawa, that is true. 
What would he do?  
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
Mr. Speaker, I travelled extensively in the Gaspe area. 
I can see the hon. member nodding his head in agreement. 
That is what I was talking about earlier.  
I think that approximately 40 signatures were needed. 
Forestry is also important in the Gaspe region.  
They can certainly not make winter disappear and privatize seasons in Canada. 
I will finish with a little word of poetry. 
There is no position coming from the Reform Party. 
There is the plan of the Reform Party for the fishery of Canada.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
The member for Sherbrooke criticized that there is not a plan for the future. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. 
As has been indicated this issue did not happen overnight. 
We challenged the issue and got some agreement. 
The voice for the fisheries at the cabinet table would disappear along with it. 
That is the kind of background the individual comes from.  
One such area is fisheries management itself.  
Another priority is Atlantic reform. 
Arctic fisheries are also a priority of this government. 
These fisheries play an integral role in the lives of northern Canadians. 
We are showing leadership in dealing with difficult choices.  
I would like to propose an amendment. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
We have people who are hurting today. 
I had fishermen in my area come in to see me on Monday this week. 
They said: ``We were loosing everything. 
We have lost our home and we are loosing the boat. 
We have no way to earn our living anymore''.  
The people in the other districts have longer periods. 
All they are asking is that DFO please treat them fairly. 
Will it please look at it, change it around? 
They want their dignity. 
Let us deal with the present and the future.  
We recognize there is an over harvesting capacity. 
We have to reduce that capacity. 
We know they are not.  
It was no such thing. 
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I am concerned about the amendment of continued planning. 
Conservation does not exist when it comes to fishing. 
Fishermen are now speaking on lobster because the cod is gone. 
They are now speaking out about the conservation of lobster, but no one is listening. 
There are no consultations. 
There is only so much volunteer work that can be done. 
People have no money to give. 
How are they going to make sure that the lobster will still be there? 
We are taking those recommendations of the fisheries resource conservation council seriously. 
We are working in partnership with fishermen for the future.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
What do these Canadians have to do with commercial fishing, many are possibly wondering. 
What did it take to get him not to run? 
I think we all know now. 
Why did Mr. Fewchuk have to be appointed? 
The Chair has very great reservations about the admissibility of this amendment. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
I appreciate the fact that the hon. member may disagree with the amendment. 
I do not think that is the point in issue. 
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
I would ask you to consider that, sir.  
With great respect, I have considered the matter. 
The subamendment sought to move that back in effect to the original position. 
That is what is out of order. 
That is what I am ruling out of order. 
I think we should move on.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
I am not disposed to hear more argument on this point. 
If it is a different point I will hear him.  
Citation 923 deals specifically with allotted days. 
Citation 923(3) states: 
I hear the hon. member for Elk Island. 
When an amendment is moved, the amendment must be to the main motion. 
A subamendment must amend only the amendment. 
In this case the subamendment is negating the amendment. 
The amendment is not negating the main motion. 
That is a matter for interpretation by hon. members. 
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question.  
Problems have arisen out of this appointment. 
Mr. Fewchuk will be receiving a president's salary. 
These fishermen are not wealthy by any means. 
Native fishermen on the lake have no alternative employment. 
A precedent in this government? 
It is only a precedent for the FFMC. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
I take the liberty of pointing out that this is nothing new for me. 
They want us to say that the government will maintain the same approach.  
The Liberals have much the same attitude today. 
A lot of clarification is needed.  
It is the government's fault. 
I did not see any of that. 
This, I think, accurately illustrates the current problem in Canada. 
Today we are looking at a terrible failure.  
The federal government has never managed to achieve this degree of fine-tuning. 
But three years have gone by and nothing has been done. 
The only result we see is that the subsistence program will have to be extended. 
People cannot be allowed to starve to death. 
Today, in the fisheries sector we are faced with the same failure.  
Do you think their evaluation was wrong?  
The last federal election sent a message. 
Some regions of Canada sent a clear message to the government. 
The Liberal government cannot use the Conservative government as an excuse. 
The population of the Atlantic provinces has judged them, and the government must acknowledge this. 
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I take issue with some of the remarks of the hon. member. 
Nothing could be further from the truth.  
So we are moving forward.  
The member basically made allegations that we are not taking the region into consideration. 
There is all kinds of discussion. 
We are on track for the future.  
I would remind him of certain things, however. 
In Quebec alone, the situation affects 4,000 people. 
Then a serious error was made. 
This strikes me as a poor show.  
I think the answer is right there for all to see. 
A change in direction is absolutely vital.  
This agreement provided for reasonable management. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
I commend the leader of the Conservative Party and his caucus for the motion.  
It is simply scandalous that it would try to do that.  
We might not be in the state we are in today. 
That is old history.  
We have a new government that has been in power for over four years. 
Regarding the auditor general's report. 
This is most unfortunate.  
I look at Newfoundland. 
In less than 50 years it is completely destroyed. 
It is the typical thing. 
This is why the west coast is so upset now. 
It simply does not work anymore. 
This is why I have constantly asked for the inquiry. 
I could give example after example of what has been going on with these people. 
and getting an overwhelming yes to that response. 
I find it very difficult if that happens.  
We go on and on with this. 
It gets almost to the sound of a broken record. 
This government does not have the capability of instituting a national policy on its own. 
What they know is fishing.  
We have trawlers out there now that are still dumping by-catch. 
We still have fish being dumped over the side as we speak today.  
It is simply unacceptable that we would do that. 
I am not saying that every single person will get back into the fishing industry. 
Obviously there has to be reallocation of some of these folks to other areas.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
Madam Speaker, it is certainly nice to see you in the chair. 
Of course, that is the one I am concerned about.  
It is forcing individual fishermen out of the business.  
It is absolutely insane.  
The same applies to wharves and the reconstruction of wharves. 
This is absolutely ridiculous.  
The answer is very clear. 
They cannot survive under those kinds of circumstances.  
That is not the end of it. 
However, there is no co-ordination between the two departments. 
Neither department knows what is going on. 
They have no long term strategy. 
People are at a tremendous disadvantage now because of that lack of co-ordination. 
It is unfortunate because there is a lot of infighting among the fisheries. 
I expressed the same frustration that the member is speaking about.  
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time. 
Yesterday I travelled to the riding of Burin-St. 
Out migration is a terrible problem. 
On and on the problem goes throughout Atlantic Canada.  
A parallel crisis is looming on the west coast with the Pacific salmon situation. 
What will that do to salmon stocks on the west coast? 
They will be obliterated, wiped out. 
That is what I ask of the government.  
It is too restrictive. 
Fishers cannot make a living under that system. 
Why does government not look at the suggestions that have been made? 
Why does it not consider these suggestions? 
Why is it so stubborn?  
These people know best. 
These people have made their livings for 20 or 30 years from those fisheries.  
We all know the situation on the east coast. 
Our east coast is in crisis. 
What choice is there? 
The government is saying to them ``Get out or go on welfare''. 
That is the question the government has to answer.  
They had good suggestions to make. 
They know better than the officials in the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. 
They know the real science. 
Why is the government not listening to them? 
I would like to direct a comment to members of the Reform Party. 
Every second day they change their message. 
They have to make up their minds. 
That is the choice they have to make.  
They do not understand the issues of Atlantic Canada. 
That is because I am sincerely interested in it. 
I bring passion to the issue. 
I grew up with this issue. 
I have family in the industry. 
I have friends in the industry. 
I worked in the industry to help put myself through school. 
They do not have a clue what the solutions are for Atlantic Canada. 
It was a mistake. 
Just as it is a mistake and is wrong today. 
Let us rise above that. 
We could live in the past forever. 
Madam Speaker, I guess I have to sit down.  
You are sharing your time with me, so if you want to continue- 
Is that all right, Madam Speaker? 
We can go for 20 minutes, can't we?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
If the House agrees, I have no problem with it. 
Are we in agreement?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
That is exactly what the hon. member has been requesting so we shall proceed.  
Madam Speaker, I thank the members for their concurrence. 
Now I have forgotten where I was. 
I know where I am, but I have forgotten where I was.  
You are here in Ottawa.  
I will support the people of British Columbia because there is an identified problem.  
It was created by people who sat here in successive governments- 
How about John Crosbie, did he know anything?  
Yes he did and he still knows a lot. 
There is one thing I can stand in this House and say about John Crosbie. 
I am not shy about defending John Crosbie. 
John Crosbie was always a man who if he made a mistake he admitted it. 
And TAGS is a part of it.  
Having said that, TAGS was necessary. 
I say that quite sincerely. 
We are hearing many suggestions. 
We are preoccupied with it these days in Atlantic Canada. 
Many people there have very good suggestions.  
I am sure people to my right know who I am talking about.  
These people have been only kept alive. 
They have not been able to live in mansions. 
They have not been able to drive new cars. 
They have only been kept alive.  
Why has there been a year cut off the program? 
I want members to listen to this. 
We should already know the answers, we should know what will follow. 
There are certain components that are going to be compulsory. 
There is going to have to be early retirement. 
That is where there has been a big failure.  
Can you blame us for wanting to make a living, for trying to stay alive?  
I am not saying that just for the sake of saying it. 
But I question the department. 
I do not take great comfort that it has the ability to deal with it.  
It does no good just to pay lip service. 
Why have Glen Clark and British Columbians become the enemies? 
The Americans, the Alaskans are the problem. 
They are the ones who have consistently overfished. 
Why didn't he go?  
You will have to ask him that. 
He may have been fishing.  
It is a very, very complex problem. 
It is the role and responsibility of the federal government to find solutions.  
This country is so diverse and our problems are so different. 
In concluding, I would like to move the following amendment. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Madam Speaker, he has proposed a subamendment.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In the meantime I think we should proceed with questions and comments.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, what solutions does the hon. member for Burin-St. 
He had a lot of criticism in his remarks. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. 
We are dealing with that issue and we are making progress. 
It surprises me that the member for Burin-St. 
We tried to be there to support the communities and the fisher people. 
And we have in fact. 
I think the hon. member agrees with this point. 
I have not heard anything in terms of solutions.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Madam Speaker, I listened with interest to the parliamentary secretary asking about solutions. 
We are talking about a national policy for a sustainable fisheries.  
Therein lies a big problem. 
Excuse the pun, but we have been floundering around too long.  
We can blame that on the minister. 
Do you want to spend money or cut taxes?  
I have not met the hon. member. 
Maybe I should never meet him. 
They would keep on making the same old mistakes. 
They would let the stocks go down the tube and more people would be unemployed.  
What is wrong with spending some money to do that?  
Are they going to cut spending money on everything? 
Maybe that is the member's solution. 
If they do that they will wipe out Atlantic Canada.  
I am trying to help.  
He is not trying to help me. 
He is not trying to help Atlantic Canadians. 
He is trying to help Paul Martin and his quest to become prime minister. 
He has lost sight of his priorities.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I have been making gestures to the hon. member who was speaking. 
I have been striving to do that. 
Perhaps we could proceed with the next question.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
I mean that with all sincerity.  
He talks about the mismanagement of successive governments. 
The government will have to change the assistance. 
It will not be able to go on paying people for doing nothing.  
I could have said other things.  
I want to respond to the hon. member. 
I have been here since June 2. 
I am new to the House of Commons. 
That is not my role. 
That is the way it is with me.  
What is the new idea?  
I know the member's new idea. 
He would cut us off. 
There would be nothing in the east. 
The elitists from the west cannot identify with the problem in the east.  
Are they really gaining ground in Atlantic Canada? 
Is there any doubt about that?  
For three years you can let them dry back there.  
What are you talking about? 
The time for questions and comments has expired.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
The light is not working in the front row. 
That is why it is not on. 
The lights are not working today, just so that he is aware.  
The member was a former minister in Newfoundland. 
He is as responsible as any member here. 
I wished to explain to the hon. member of the Reform Party.  
I refer to the problem Mr. Crosbie outlined in his new book. 
Indeed they were the cause of the collapse of the Atlantic fisheries. 
I refer to the motion before the House: 
The hon. member, typically Conservative, forgot one basic. 
He talked about from coast to coast. 
There are three coasts to Canada. 
The Arctic coast is also important, with important fisheries. 
Recently I had the opportunity to travel in the Arctic region. 
They come here because we do the best work in the world. 
They are cheap shots at our good scientists. 
I know the hon. member has experience with that. 
We have learned that the stocks are not inexhaustible. 
We proved that wrong in Atlantic Canada. 
We have had to recognize that we need to change our ways. 
Studies have dissected the failings of the past. 
Prescriptions have been put forward as the way for the future. 
We have all attempted to face the future with new prescriptions.  
Some of that raw material comes from the Bering Sea. 
Opposition members come into this House and call for a national fisheries policy. 
So let us look at what does constitute a national fisheries policy. 
I have met with fishermen from coast to coast to coast. 
First in the national policy we must develop an environmentally sustainable fishery. 
Conservation must be first. 
As a nation we have been blessed with a diverse and valuable marine resource base. 
That means there must be a recognition that the fishery will be smaller.  
The fishery of the future must be internationally competitive. 
We must continue to focus on quality. 
The warning is clear.  
Let me quickly turn to the west coast. 
I have no apology to make with respect to the west coast. 
We are reducing the number of fishermen. 
I have here the list of targets and achieved targets. 
The escapement target is expected to be achieved. 
In Area D, allocation is very closed to being achieved. 
In Area F allocation has been achieved. 
We are meeting targets. 
That is easy to do. 
We have adopted the measures that are most likely to achieve success. 
I want that understood. 
I would be happy to answer any questions he may have.  
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
I share those goals very much.  
I would like to ask the minister two or three questions in that regard.  
I live in an area on the upper Fraser River. 
Yet these spawning channels have remained closed. 
The hon. member spoke about hatcheries. 
They do have remarkably successful results in some instances but not all. 
Genetics is a problem that we are facing with hatcheries around the country. 
I will have to check on that. 
I am happy to do it on the member's behalf.  
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
I do not believe this is a point of order. 
It is the only time you will recognize me, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
He wants to balance the harvesting capacity with the biomass production capacity. 
His ultimate goal is preservation.  
What does his department have in mind? 
He may want to consult his predecessors. 
Perhaps the federal government did not co-operate enough with the provinces.  
Why do I make this point? 
Why is it important to talk with the provinces? 
Co-management means ``you will help me pay operating costs''. 
So, here are my two questions:
Mr. Speaker, I am happy that the hon. member has asked these questions. 
Our discussions were very constructive. 
The hon. member has put his finger on a specific problem. 
We can also get together to discuss the changes sought by the hon. member. 
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
George's as a former minister. 
He was never ever a former- 
I think the hon. member will recognize that that is not a point of order.  
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
It is called democracy.  
The federal government has prime responsibility for one natural resource and that is fish. 
Without a doubt, it is the worst managed resource in Canada. 
It has a terrible track record.  
The politicization of the fisheries puts the resource at risk. 
Newfoundland and Labrador lost 25,000 people in the last year. 
No one seems to be accountable.  
The Pacific salmon treaty was a rushed document produced during the Mulroney era in 1985. 
Well if it is true I would like to have that on the record. 
We have a window of four or five months this winter to get that resolved. 
We do not know right now. 
People are questioning who is the accountable party.  
That is not clear responsibility. 
Somebody has to take the lead. 
I would like to hear that too. 
I never used that word. 
Vigorously is the word I used.  
That is a quote.  
Why was the moratorium put in place for two years only? 
They hoped the problem would go away. 
Now we have one set of information and two opinions. 
This is not a happy story. 
We have fleet overcapacity on both coasts. 
What is he waiting for?  
We understand that there are some enlightened proposals in there.  
We need a vision for the fishery. 
There is a better way. 
We need to depoliticize the licensing process. 
We had many scientists sign on. 
This is total politicization and it is unacceptable.  
We know that disposable income is an important concept. 
It would be money delivered in a much more focused and much less wasteful fashion.  
Mr. Speaker, I understand I have three and a half minutes left. 
I would like to use that time for questions and comments. 
I appreciate the hon. member's wishes. 
We will start with questions and comments.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, now you are sitting down and my mike works. 
It is the part of your body that activates the mikes that intrigues us all.  
I want to ask him this question. 
It has nothing to do with the $30 million that was promised.  
These are the best numbers I have. 
The minister is saying it is $21 million and $7.6 million. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
I reiterate two points for the member from the Reform. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the questions.  
In some cases the coast guard has been the loser. 
In other cases DFO has been the loser in this amalgamation.  
We do not think there has to be a loser. 
They have a mutually exclusive mandate. 
We think the coast guard should be a part of the military. 
That would fix the whole problem. 
We think this is absolutely and totally inappropriate.  
The public should know what the science is. 
That is a more practical and immediate way for us to go. 
That is what I would promote.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
I wonder if the hon. member would be willing to speak to that particular item.  
Mr. Speaker, I certainly spoke about tax measures which could be taken. 
We have seen a strong report from the port of Halifax. 
It has become a real problem.  
This is a major employer. 
Those are some very strong ideas. 
It is just not working. 
We need major structural, systemic change. 
We need to re-focus.  
Mr. Charles Hubbard (Miramichi, Lib.):
I come from a community in which the fishery is very important. 
There are three fish plants relying on the resources from the sea.  
For almost 500 years we have had a successful fishery.  
Many of them sold them back to the government. 
Historically they were traps made of wood approximately three feet in length. 
We also have to think about what fish really are. 
We think of the Americans, our neighbours. 
In other words, they have tremendous pressure on the Atlantic fishery.  
We think of the tremendous tuna resource we have today. 
It is worth as much as $30 a pound to some of our Atlantic fishermen. 
We have to recognize that there has to be better communications.  
I showed that report to some fishermen in the area of Hardwicke. 
Today we hear of the many changes happening within DFO. 
We hear that fees are being charged. 
We hear there are observers out there and that various methods are being used. 
We commend the department for some of those steps it has taken.  
Many people have relied on that source of income. 
Certainly many fishing people, especially in Newfoundland, relied on TAGS and are concerned. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
I want to speak for the sharks. 
Mr. Speaker, I certainly want to try to reply to the hon. member. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the member mentions a good point. 
Our committee will certainly be visiting the east coast. 
I hope we will hear input from all.  
I think we will hear from all groups. 
I know the minister will be interested in hearing our report.  
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
We do have 10 wharfs. 
A significant amount of money was granted to the wharf at Saint-Louis. 
Mr. Guy Saint-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
Now he has his own stamp.  
Real Caouette was born in Amos in 1917. 
Thank you, Real, and thank you, Suzanne.  
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
He got one year because he was drunk. 
He was released on early parole and they were not told anything. 
This woman and her family are terrified of him. 
They were merely told that they would be notified.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Women are increasingly achieving success in these areas. 
Mr. Julian Reed (Halton, Lib.):
Some 1,300 students will participate in this event along with teachers and supervisors. 
I wish them much success in this endeavour.  
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, what is the real cause of dwindling fish stocks? 
Is it greedy seals or is it overfishing?  
To achieve sustainable development we need long term sustainable solutions. 
The recovery of an endangered species does not justify the destruction of another species.  
The problem lies not with seals but with us.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Anything short of this will simply result in more senseless deaths.  
Mr. Raymond Bonin (Nickel Belt, Lib.):
We thank them and applaud them.  
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
This ceremony officially launched Small Business Week.  
Congratulations to the young winners.  
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
Congratulations and hurray for our Quebec marine pilots.  
Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-East York, Lib.):
Violence costs the Canadian economy approximately $4 billion every year.  
I am proud to offer my support to the YWCA- 
The hon. member for Yellowhead.  
Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):
Sadly the saga of Liberal justice continues. 
Can it get worse, Mr. Speaker? 
You would think not, but it does.  
Recently Albertans were shocked. 
What did he get? 
Life in jail, a few lashes, the noose? 
No, he got day passes for heaven's sake.  
Canadians are pleading for the justice minister to fix the Criminal Code. 
Canadians are begging the solicitor general to overhaul the parole board. 
For God's sake, do something.  
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or, NDP):
Why do those jobs always disappear when the polls close?  
As for the byelections, Nova Scotians will not be hoodwinked again. 
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
This illness is devastating for victims, their families and their friends. 
These statistics are a reminder to us of the importance of prevention.  
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
Founded in 1959, Alumicor Limited is a great Canadian success story. 
Currently the company has grown to employ 200 people. 
Colleagues, I would like to give you a few pieces of information. 
It will be all right.  
The second thing has to do with microphones. 
We have a small technical problem.  
We will now go to oral questions.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we too have noticed that the lights are out. 
The conference board states that it is going to cost thousands of dollars per family.  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
The international community agrees with the science on this issue. 
The economic fear-mongering on the other side of the House is totally unrealistic. 
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
That is all we are asking. 
That is the 10th non-answer in a row.  
It is a Liberal instinct: if in doubt, tax.  
There are measures to support energy efficiency. 
There are renewable sources of energy. 
There are joint implementation plans. 
There are emission credits and trading.  
Only the Reform Party is fixated on taxation.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Talk about gaseous emissions, Mr. Speaker. 
Perhaps the finance minister will be the author of the new national energy program.  
It reads: ``It is worth consideration. 
That quote is attributed to Premier Ralph Klein.  
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
Is this the minister's idea of reasonable costs?  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
In the challenge there are many economic opportunities. 
I would like to know what Reform is proposing. 
What is its resolution of this?  
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
QUEBEC-FRANCE AGREEMENT ON CHILD SUPPORT 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
But this is just one problem.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.  
Mr. Speaker, article 26 of the Canada-France agreement provides the following: 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs did not answer the question.  
I repeat my question:
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
It is a two way street and we need to protect that.  
Insofar as labour and environment- 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, that is the problem. 
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
We never said that they would be used as bargaining chips. 
You cannot judge a position from one set of meetings going back to 1995. 
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
He is supposed to bring a report back to me in December.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Oh, excuse me, not you, the member would withdraw that.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
I have to ask, why is she not doing that?  
Ordinary Canadians will be paying for this deal. 
The provinces will now likely have to administer it. 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the provinces are working with me in discussing this very important issue. 
There are many thousands of Canadians who are very concerned about this issue. 
The Reform seems blind to that reality. 
They are saving 30% of their- 
The hon. member for Nanaimo-Alberni.  
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, she simply will not answer the question.  
This is clearly unacceptable to the provinces. 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
FRANCE-QUEBEC AGREEMENT ON COLLECTION OF SUPPORT PAYMENTS 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the master agreement between France and Canada exists. 
The basis for that is international public law.  
I apologize for interrupting the hon. member. 
The member for Roberval.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
I do not want him to dodge the issue, I would like him to answer. 
How can he do that?  
I would add one thing. 
We keep trying to practice empty-chair politics. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
This inmate has full blown AIDS.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
I think they do good work. 
I support them regularly. 
I will take under consideration the suggestion of the member.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, they have been asking for these things for a long time. 
They had better turn the lights on in the second row as well.  
They heard the plea and guess what? 
Isn't that neat? 
The knives can cut the cord.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
QUEBEC-FRANCE AGREEMENT ON SUPPORT PAYMENTS 
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
The juridical force of judgments of Canadian courts in France depends on this umbrella agreement.  
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Can the solicitor general explain why he has placed the community at risk?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the lights are still not on in the second row.  
He has been diagnosed an incurable pedophile by Correctional Service Canada.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Transport. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering-Ajax-Uxbridge, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Natural Resources.  
The hon. member for Blackstrap.  
Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):
What will the solicitor general do to change this preposterous system?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
I visited these facilities. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
The cuts have been devastating, including in my own riding of Vancouver East.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, no one can remain impervious to the terrible scenes of homelessness. 
The hon. member for Vancouver East.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, that is not good enough. 
Its child tax benefit does not help the poorest of the poor.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Don't be misled by politicians who make expensive promises. 
Saskatchewan followed that path in the 1980s and- 
The hon. member for Compton-Stanstead.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
There are 30 people in lifeboats waiting to be rescued. 
When are we getting our helicopters?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Canada is not properly equipped for today's operation. 
However we have waited long enough.  
I ask the minister of defence again where our helicopters are. 
When are we going to get them?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
My question is for the minister of agriculture. 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the solicitor general.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the Environment.  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
It is a serious issue.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Is that what partnership means to the government?  
My question is for the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs. 
There are great needs and great hopes within the first nations.  
No one is happy with what is happening right now with the status quo. 
In the near future we hope to have a full response to RCAP. 
The government wants to address all the problems of the first nation.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.  
The hon. Minister of Industry.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Next Thursday shall be an allotted day.  
I will now deal with the points of order. 
The first one is from solicitor general.  
COMMENTS DURING QUESTION PERIOD 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
I inadvertently referred to inmates rather than guards. 
I would like to correct that.  
The record will show that.  
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
Under standing orders, I would ask that she table that document in the House.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are endeavouring to verify the point. 
That will be taken care of as soon as we find out.  
COMMENTS DURING QUESTION PERIOD 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
I believe I heard that and I should have responded quickly. 
The point is well taken. 
Orders of the day.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Forgive me, I did not have the note up here.  
Yes, we are going to have tributes to two of our members who passed away. 
THE LATE FRED MCCAIN 
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
Mr. Speaker, you served with him, as did the leader of our party.  
He loved his country and certainly dedicated his life to that end.  
Let us not divide the voters of this nation. 
Always the gentleman, Fred was always the gentle man.  
These attributes exemplified Fred McCain.  
In closing, I offer to this House these thoughts. 
Fred was my mentor. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would also like to rise today to pay tribute to Fred McCain. 
I know they were heartfelt. 
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
He had a genuine concern for his constituents.  
He did what he promised. 
This was evident as he remained in politics, in elected life, for 34 years. 
May Fred McCain rest in peace.  
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
This vision of political accountability does him credit.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
We had occasion to renew our acquaintance and talk about Canadian politics.  
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Fred was a man who became the yardstick by which all other politicians are judged. 
It is an honour for me to pay tribute to him in this House.  
THE LATE RODRIGUE BOURDAGES 
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Mr. Bourdages, who was of Acadian descent, was born in Halifax, in 1924. 
In addition, he decided as well to run as a candidate in the 1958 election. 
He served in the House of Commons until 1962. 
After that he was, of course, very active at the municipal level.  
That is not so long ago. 
He instituted simultaneous interpretation and bilingual government cheques. 
As I mentioned earlier, Mr. Bourdages then became an organizer for our party. 
And he was an exceptional one. 
Mr. Bourdages has left us something, fortunately, an autobiography. 
I have an indelible memory of Mr. Bourdages from election time. 
Today, on behalf of us all, I thank him and his family.  
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
He married Evelyne Arsenault, a native of Saskatchewan, and they had three children.  
He was also a Knight of Columbus. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
As a long time member of the Knights of Columbus, he achieved the fourth degree.  
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Madam Speaker, first I would like to salute Mr. Bourdages' family. 
Mr. Bourdages was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, on October 22, 1923. 
He is the son of Mr. and Mrs. Adolphe Bourdages.  
He studied at Brebeuf school and then became a general contractor in Montreal. 
ALLOTTED DAY-CANADIAN FISHING INDUSTRY 
The House resumed consideration of the motion and the amendment.  
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Today B.C. has not yet come up with the funds.  
I can go on and on. 
We have initiated many programs. 
This is a commitment to the resources.  
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
It works out to something like a 30% success rate. 
I recognize direct comparisons like that cannot be made. 
Certainly I am a proponent of that. 
All of this, of course, has a very human dimension to it. 
That announcement was made in January. 
We have some older fishermen who were very much interested in that. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the question. 
We are definitely sticking to our principle of conservation. 
The priority of DFO is conservation.  
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
I note that the Conservative Party has made it an opposition day topic. 
I agree that the fishery should be discussed every day. 
Well yes, there are serious problems in fisheries. 
And hooray for them, the Conservatives have woken up and realized it. 
I must also point out they were part of the problem.  
They accept the ones that suit them.  
The problem is that they are both judge and accused. 
We are in favour of one as well.  
That is a free translation of what was said: continue the implementation of.  
The auditor general's report is still fresh in everybody's mind. 
The auditor general was not exactly kind to the Liberals. 
What mark does he give them? 
Hearings started this morning in fishing communities. 
The program is still needed.  
He spoke of what, in his view, could guide a national policy. 
He wants to try to make coastal communities and fishing associations self-sufficient. 
I still have not seen the benefit of this. 
But let us wait and see how this will be done.  
But there was not much consultation with fishers. 
This is a serious problem. 
Some will argue the harvesting capacity is too big. 
Let us start by looking at my four prerequisites. 
First, the downsizing, or reduction of the harvesting capacity. 
I will elaborate on this in a moment. 
How will we achieve this streamlining and why do we have to do it? 
This was the ultimate goal. 
An assessment of the situation must be done.  
Some will suggest using more ecological fishing gear. 
I know there are several schools of thought on the issue. 
Some will say that only longlines should be used. 
That is one approach.  
Each of these year classes has a mortality rate. 
I am indicating an approach, and I am open to other suggestions.  
Why is variety so necessary? 
Our activities depend on the seasons.  
Why am I talking about variety? 
But it is important that we go in that direction.  
They do not, therefore, have access to diversifying their catches.  
Why suggest an individual transferable quota? 
Why did the provinces not want to get involved? 
I am now prepared to entertain questions and comments from my hon. colleagues.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):
We want to change that. 
That was the allegation from the member in the back row. 
I am particularly interested in his comments on transferable quotas.  
I will continue to provide those opposite with a little adult education.  
It is possible to go even further. 
And here I will go a little further. 
Things could be organized not only by province but also by coastal region. 
Some licences are for processing plants. 
Some have a grandfather clause. 
There is always some give-and-take in negotiations. 
We want fishers to have access to that process themselves. 
All this can be included in the system of transferable individual quotas.  
Some things must be included in the package. 
I had this discussion with many associations. 
Sure, I still have to establish some contacts. 
We must always be prepared. 
This is why we have everything to gain by examining the process.  
I am still prepared to answer questions from the parliamentary secretary.  
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I enjoyed listening to my colleague from the Bloc. 
It is important that we tell all of the story when we talk about transition. 
All of the transition strategy cannot be based on income support.  
People leaving Newfoundland, for example, is very sad indeed.  
I am not in agreement. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.):
You see how enthusiastic the members opposite are.  
I will give a report on the famous Fonds Quebec Cotier. 
The results are so good that the members opposite are already excited.  
In this sense, I must say that the motion has some merit.  
It was necessary to act immediately, on an urgent basis, to help these families.  
In May 1994 my colleague introduced a multi-faceted program. 
I must say it is rather an eloquent one. 
They knew how to roll up their sleeves and work together.  
These figures clearly attest to the quality of the Canadian government's commitment.  
They were stakeholders in the program. 
They helped deliver the front line services of the Quebec Cotier program.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
We have a self-congratulatory secretary of State. 
It is quite remarkable.  
He must do more than that.  
He did not say a word about that.  
Mr. George S. Baker (Gander-Grand Falls, Lib.):
Let us set the record straight on one thing. 
They travel up the coast of the United States in a thin black line. 
The fishermen call it the trans-Canada highway of the squid. 
Mr. George S. Baker:
Yes, the fishermen used to call it the panty hose zone. 
The fish plant workers called it the hair net zone. 
Mr. George S. Baker:
Mr. George S. Baker:
It was the Tory Party of Canada.  
If you want to catch a codfish using bait, you first of all try squid. 
You would then go to a fish called capelin. 
In 1991 was it the Liberals who were the Government of Canada? 
No. It was the Tory party of Canada.  
Who was the Government of Canada? 
The Tory party was the Government of Canada in 1990 and 1991.  
That was the Canadian government in January 1991.  
Was it the Liberals who were in power in 1991? 
Mr. George S. Baker:
Yes, the Tory leader has a selective memory.  
That is four or five disasters. 
It was called an underutilized species. 
It was identified as a Greenland halibut. 
That was the year 1991.  
Was it the Liberals who were in power in 1991? 
Who was in power in 1991? 
The mistakes continued until the year 1992. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
I think it is important for us to recognize the real issue here. 
I know the hon. member respects that comment. 
He has spoken often with respect to the fishery in Newfoundland. 
I know he is a very respected member in Newfoundland. 
That is the issue.  
I will point to my colleagues on this side of the House as well. 
Mr. George S. Baker:
We have a ridiculous situation which again is a leftover from the early nineties. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member for Vancouver East on debate.  
Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time.  
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
I would like to refer to section 566 of Beauchesne's.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The motion has already been accepted by the Chair. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
Point of order, Madam Speaker. 
Madam Speaker, I have the floor.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member for Malpeque.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, the point of order of the member opposite is out of order. 
The Speaker has already ruled. 
It is as simple as that.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Madam Speaker, I will now attempt to make my point. 
Citation 567 of Beauchesne's says this with regard to amendments: 
That is substantially different.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
He has made a specific reference to Beauchesne. 
I would encourage the Chair to take this under consideration. 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
There is no appeal to that ruling.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The time for making that objection has passed. 
The Chair has already ruled on this and it is time to resume debate.  
The hon. member for Vancouver East.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Pacific salmon stocks have been depleted to crisis proportions. 
In fact, the plan that the federal government has put in place is woefully inadequate.  
The Mifflin plan has been an ecological and sociological disaster. 
However, what is the federal government doing? 
Even the promises that have been made about transitional funds have been a disaster.  
The fishers of the west coast and the east coast have been more than patient. 
So Canada's position was not at those hearings.  
The leader of the NDP raised this issue in the House on September 25. 
Why will the federal government not do the same?  
We believe this must be the primary goal of the federal fisheries policy. 
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I stand in amazement at what I have just heard.  
That is in fact what we are doing. 
Nothing can be learned in the House if members do not listen. 
The minister met with Premier Clark, as well as Minister Eggleton in Vancouver. 
The task force reported to the minister. 
Mr. Speaker, my mistake. 
The Minister of Fisheries and Oceans has been engaged in soft peddling this issue. 
Yes, it is important to listen. 
That is what this issue is about.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
We all agree that there is need of action, a real concern on this issue.  
What was the prime reason for creating the Tatshenshini? 
They have been sitting there watching this whole drama unfold without taking it seriously.  
Mr. Speaker, I think the member is confusing the issues. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
The fishery is a very important industry for us. 
Entire villages are dependent on the viability of this industry. 
And who is responsible? 
Our Liberal friends, yes, but also our friends in the Conservative Party. 
They should have been concerned by these issues when they were in power.  
This government does not always react, and when it does, it reacts badly. 
This undertaking needs to be guided by certain basic principles. 
Communities like ours will then disappear. 
A long term preventive approach must therefore be the primary objective of the forum.  
This forum must address the sharing of resources. 
This problem will not be resolved by going it alone.  
Fishers and plant workers are looking for work. 
The Liberals did not meet that challenge. 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the hon. member for Acadie-Bathurst for his speech. 
I have a question for the hon. member. 
Mr. Speaker, I would say it is both. 
What they call that now, down home, is ``the black hole''.  
I will educate you a little, if my predecessor has not.  
In May and June, we catch crab. 
In July and August, there is nothing to fish for, where we are. 
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
He was down to the joint meetings on fisheries.  
He talks about New Democrats. 
We have shown leadership on resource sharing with foreign interests. 
The turbot question is a prime example.  
We are showing sensitivity to the individuals, families and communities that are affected. 
TAGS was an example. 
What new solution will the member propose rather than misrepresenting the real facts?  
I will tell you something. 
What did he do? 
He investigated 150 people. 
We want you poor people to give us $40,000''. 
That is what the Liberals have done.  
It being 5.30 p.m., it is my duty to interrupt the proceedings.  
(Division deemed demanded and deferred) 
Copies of the revised Standing Order 95 are available at the table.  
We all know that dieticians and nutritionists are specialists in nutrition.  
The public hears and reads a great deal about nutrition. 
Dietitians and nutritionists are experts in nutrition. 
For example, milk has been provided in certain schools for over 20 years. 
For example, polar exploration requires very specific nutritional logistics. 
Everything has to be calculated. 
All the other provinces and territories have associations recognized by their respective provinces and territories. 
Reduced mobility often leads to difficulties in obtaining and preparing meals. 
Malnutrition, even low level, may upset this immunity balance.  
Osteoporosis patients must pay continued attention to the way they eat. 
This alarming trend can be altered.  
We are all convinced of that value. 
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
It also provides a needed preventive measure against illness.  
Reformers and I are definitely in support of preventive and holistic measures. 
However I cannot support the bill for a few reasons. 
Reformers also know that supporting such a program requires a great deal of funding. 
In order for that to happen across the country, the funding needs to be there. 
I would say that the answer at this point is no.  
The provinces will simply not ask how high when Ottawa issues the command to jump. 
Those people are more concerned about the shortfall of funding in those areas.  
We have big concerns in other areas. 
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
Nutrition services can be of great help to Quebeckers and Canadians. 
That having been said, Bill C-202 is not without raising a few questions. 
We must therefore be clear. 
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Health care is about much more than hospitals and doctors. 
About 1.4 million children live in poverty in Canada. 
These cuts hit poor Canadians and seniors hardest. 
A national pharmacare program would reverse this trend.  
Unfortunately the Liberal promise on pharmacare rings hollow. 
We have had no assurances that Liberals intend to follow through on their election rhetoric.  
We appreciate the spirit of this motion. 
My mother would not go into one of these homes, that is for sure. 
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
I hope to illustrate that over the course of this intervention.  
These critera are the cornerstones of Canada's health care system. 
I think everybody in this House would agree that these are laudable objections.  
Time and time again, polls demonstrate high public support for medicare.  
This is not the purpose of the Canada Health Act. 
It does not forbid provinces and territories from providing coverage for these services as well.  
This does not mean that the federal government has no interest in the nutrition issue. 
The proposal put forward by my hon. colleague and friend is very commendable.  
Therefore I will relinquish my position now. 
Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):
Poll after poll indicates great public support for these national principles. 
Provincial and territorial ministers of health share this support. 
This is of particular importance as delivery methods, as well as venues, change over time. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
We have about a dozen minutes left. 
Madam Speaker, it will not take me five minutes.  
I present this motion in the interest of all Canadians.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to take part in the adjournment debate. 
While the terminology may be different, he said essentially the same thing.  
The government is keeping our money in a separate account. 
The auditor asked the very same question. 
Will it be $20 billion, $22 billion or $25 billion in a year? 
One can see a pattern developing.  
Will there be enough money for training? 
All these questions remain unanswered for the time being. 
We do not really know how the amount in the reserve will be determined. 
We do not know how the government will make rational choices.  
Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
The reserve itself can vary at any given time. 
It goes up and down with the payment of benefits. 
As for the interest, it is credited to the employment insurance account. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member. 
The hon. member for Scarborough East.  
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
I would submit that the two are inextricably linked. 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
The Prime Minister has just spent five days in Russia. 
This is not all. 
The Kremlin has given assurances that minority confessions will not be adversely affected.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
(The House adjourned at 6.31 p.m.)
