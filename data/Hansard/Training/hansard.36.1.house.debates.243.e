COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 243 
Friday, June 11, 1999 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
FIRST NATIONS LAND MANAGEMENT ACT 
MOTION THAT DEBATE BE NOT FURTHER ADJOURNED 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
That the debate be not further adjourned.  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would ask that you delay question period by five minutes.  
At this time of the year my eyesight does get a little bad. 
Is there agreement to proceed in such a fashion?  
SECOND READING AND CONCURRENCE IN SENATE AMENDMENTS 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
I find that very unacceptable.  
Is the House ready for the question?  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
(Motion agreed to, amendments read the second time and concurred in) 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH 
Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):
Annually an estimated one in twenty adolescents contracts a sexually transmitted disease.  
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
Canadians are proud of their culture. 
Canada is a very rich and diverse multicultural society. 
We are the envy of the world. 
Canada produces some of the best in the world, like Celine Dion. 
INTERNATIONAL ORDER OF THE KING'S DAUGHTERS AND SONS 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
This organization has performed countless charitable acts within the community. 
THE LATE SARAH NINGIURUVIK 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
She was well known and very involved in her community.  
Six airlines were unable to get to Kangiqsujuaq because of these regulations.  
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Most of all they want lower taxes, lower taxes, lower taxes. 
AIR AND ARMY CADETS 
Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam, Lib.):
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
I wish to congratulate Thabo Mbeki, Nelson Mandela's successor, on his victory.  
The challenges facing the ANC are many and daunting. 
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
The waiting lists for subsidized housing are long and getting longer. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Yesterday was the ultimate violation. 
Spousal homicides are far too common in our society. 
There are on average 100 spousal killings a year in Canada. 
I urge all members to support this important cause.  
Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):
Make no mistake, our efforts are paying off. 
Canadians are seeing the benefits of our government's sound fiscal and social policies. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
As we approach the 10 year anniversary, are we any closer? 
Are children in poverty any better off?  
There is one sign of hope. 
I look forward to the committee continuing its work.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
His first collection, Partir est ailleurs , was published in 1997. 
His most recent collection, La nuit voyage seule , is a universal tapestry rich with experience. 
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
Anything less would have been a bombshell. 
REFORM PARTY OF CANADA 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
That is what reprehensible is and it is time that it stopped in the House.  
Let us look at the Reform's own record. 
That is what reprehensible is.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, did you ever hear such fear in your life over there?  
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, recently 13 Jewish Iranians were arrested in Iran on charges of espionage.  
The arrest of these individuals is unwarranted and unacceptable. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is almost silly season again in Shawinigan, is it not? 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's question is unworthy even of the Reform Party.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
The Prime Minister has done it all wrong in the past. 
Perhaps the heritage minister could help us out? 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
I would ask the hon. opposition House leader to go directly to his question, please.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Windsor West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is an inaccurate and misleading premise to the question. 
The Prime Minister has no shares in the company in question. 
He has been doing so and doing so properly. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
In the case the member refers to, someone was asked the right questions. 
Apparently the man was dishonest in responding. 
They have traced the blood. 
They have tested it and it has tested negative. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Unfortunately, another point was made:
The blood system has a problem with its screening procedures.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
This is nothing less than shameful.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
We have differing opinions, however, on the consequences of social union. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, no one can seriously claim that Canada is a centralized federation. 
I shall take the hon. member literally, however. 
He is calling for clear questions to be asked of Quebecers. 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
Fine opening message, Mr. Speaker. 
The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is impressed by authoritative arguments. 
Yet, he quoted Claude Castonguay this week in defence of the social union. 
My question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
Mr. Speaker, it is not a centralizing vision. 
They have varying opinions. 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.  
Mr. Speaker, all the Bloc does is hurl insults.  
You are the one hurling insults.  
I would like to say one thing. 
He is saying any old thing.  
Hon. Stephane Dion: -I will quote him, with respect to federal spending power.  
I am not inclined to question this power in principle for two reasons. 
First, the spending power is an essential power of sovereign states. 
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Farmers are not interested in the media splash. 
What they really need is urgent cash.  
Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
They cannot have it both ways.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Now flooding is causing a natural disaster. 
Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
It is not our role. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Second, what was paid was simply the legal costs.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
He seems to be a rather slow learner. 
We went through the same process in the House last night.  
They are the ones that continue to impose the head tax on refugees. 
They continue to tax refugees and they know it.  
In 1996 the Liberal Party called for the elimination of the head tax. 
Why is the government intent on ripping off refugees? 
I understand that the Reform Party has an identity crisis. 
It does not know if it is coming or going. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We have been saying that for a year now. 
They are our priority, not those people over there.  
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
They were not willing to engage in a true substantive debate. 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
The hon. member for Calgary East.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
I ask the minister where is this report.  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
It will soon come, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
My question is for the current Minister for International Trade. 
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE 
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
The province, on the other hand, is paying its fair share.  
When will the solicitor general reinstate core funding for the RCMP?  
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member is a bit out of touch. 
An independent firm is helping us carry out this study. 
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
The member neglects to mention this.  
The hon. member for Sherbrooke.  
Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
There is a national interest within which the provinces certainly participate, consult and advise.  
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale, Lib.):
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
That is really what we are focusing on.  
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, that department is good at leaving people hanging out to dry.  
Yesterday the standing committee finally received a recommendation. 
A previous Liberal government was present at the birth of this flawed deal. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
You broke your word.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
This is the essence of what Premier Bouchard wants.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Over 135 days later the minister sits silent.  
Or is the minister being silenced by the top military brass?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
It has taken some time to process that through. 
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. 
I have appealed to the information commissioner.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the premise of the question is absolutely wrong. 
The government respects the laws of this land concerning access to information. 
That is what the law says and we respect it.  
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
The Prime Minister claims he is innocent but offers no independent corroborating evidence.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
I think that is quite appropriate.  
He has acted with the utmost integrity. 
He has answered every question clearly, carefully and fully. 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Cooperation.  
Mr. Speaker, much needs to be done.  
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
That is the real story.  
Why is she willing to let thousands of children suffer in needless custody disputes? 
The joint committee gave the plan. 
Where is the legislation?  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
My question is a very simple one. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question.  
This legislation was greeted warmly by the legal community. 
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
Women are most likely to be murdered when they try to leave a marriage.  
Will the minister responsible make sure that the kidnapped children go back to their mother? 
Mr. Speaker, violence against women is a very serious matter. 
The government has in fact taken measures.  
Obviously the problem has not yet been alleviated. 
Violence against women is unacceptable and has zero tolerance in terms of our society. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
The response suggested that the department was indeed concerned with the safety of our fishers.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mrs. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
Research has a definitive part to play in beating cancer.  
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. secretary of state.  
I have notice of a question of privilege which I will hear. 
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
The question is why these members were singled out from all other members. 
However, that is also true for many other members of parliament.  
Why then are they being singled out? 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
I am referring to Senator Eugene Whelan.  
I wish him good luck in his appointment to the Senate in the future.  
We have an allegation and we have an apparent explanation for it. 
This is not a debate. 
I do not know who issued the particular memo. 
In the meantime we will revert to Routine Proceedings.  
SALES TAX AND EXCISE TAX AMENDMENTS ACT, 1999 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
All parties except one agreed to it. 
My understanding is that the party concerned has also agreed to it. 
This is not some trick or anything of that sort.  
I would ask that you seek unanimous consent for the following motion: 
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
These 3,500 signatures were collected readily on June 6 and 7. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP) moved: 
There is a certain closing of the circle on this motion. 
I want to take the House through what the developments have been since then.  
Her name is Lori Foster.  
She had contacted the party in question. 
It was the Reform Party that ran that ad. 
It was not true.  
I want to quickly go over the technicalities. 
I do not want what happened to me to happen to others''.  
I agree entirely with the sentiments expressed by Ms. Foster in her letter. 
One party presents an attack ad. 
I hope the debate today will focus attention on this particular issue. 
The issue is of importance in Regina. 
That is not my intent. 
I think we do have to state the historical facts. 
We cannot rewrite history. 
I am anxiously waiting for the committee's report on this issue.  
The report from the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs stated: 
It is not a flavour of the month. 
Political parties can respond to attack ads in a matter of hours. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
I am in favour of that. 
It is important for us to hear once again what the motion is. 
I know that I am going to be held accountable in this place. 
I know from time to time I am going to be on television.  
Consequently, I personally am not on television very much.  
I think that is fair game.  
The hon. member over here is objecting.  
I repeat what I said. 
It is part of fair debate. 
What happens if we do make an amendment? 
Who draws the line? 
What about one of my staffers? 
What if he or she says something? 
What about my wife or my family? 
I have a little more of a problem with that. 
I would speak against this motion because it is unworkable. 
First, it is too inclusive. 
Second, it is unworkable. 
Who is going to determine where the line should be drawn?  
I really think that as Canadians we are strengthened by dialogue.  
Quite often they come from Quebec, but they also come from eastern Canada. 
Therefore, I again urge members of the House to vote against the motion. 
The last thing I want to say relates specifically to the case of Lori Foster. 
I know she was upset because what she said she obviously believed in. 
I respect her for that. 
I think I understand why she would be disheartened by this use of her likeness. 
However, the fact of the matter is that I do not believe she was misquoted. 
That is judgmental and prejudicial. 
I wish we could move away from that. 
We did that in all sincerity and in all honesty.  
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
They are my thoughts and not the thoughts of anyone else.  
I am not photogenic at the best of times. 
That alone should give me reason to support this idea.  
That too should give me reason to support this idea.  
He does not also deal with incomplete quotes. 
Not only was it out of context, it was incomplete. 
He took half a sentence. 
That kind of thing would have to be dealt with in the member's motion.  
It is a restrictive and negative type of approach, as opposed to a positive one.  
I have tremendous respect for the intelligence of the electorate. 
It will see through things like that.  
The member for Elk Island made an interesting point.  
He fails to cover that. 
He fails to cover other things which I am sure other colleagues will mention.  
To be able to represent people in this House is an honour. 
Politics is an honourable profession. 
I think we should be fighting back.  
I urge the hon. member to use a very positive approach. 
Then I think he would have much more success in getting our support.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Motion No. M-97. 
It raises some ethics questions. 
This is something the House should consider.  
In my opinion the motion is vague. 
Since then there has been an ever increasing level of negative ads.  
The ads showed the faces of Quebec political leaders with crosses marked over them. 
The motion could be broadened to look at other products as well. 
There has been a growth in the political organization industry. 
I commend the hon. member for having brought forward this motion. 
I do not see a downside to supporting the motion. 
It sends out a worthy message. 
I believe the motion should be supported.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
Second, there is the choice of the verb ``refrain''. 
The political advertisement was for the Reform Party.  
This motion does not take that into account.  
We could agree with him on that.  
I wish you all a good vacation and especially, a fine summer in your ridings.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Is there unanimous consent to revert to motions?  
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Does the hon. parliamentary secretary have unanimous consent of the House to propose the motion?  
Is the amendment agreed to?  
Is the motion, as amended, agreed to?  
(Motion, as amended, agreed to) 
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
I wish all members a fine vacation.  
(The House adjourned at 1.21 p.m.)
