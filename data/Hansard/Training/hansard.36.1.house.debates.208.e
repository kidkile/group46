Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
PUBLIC SECTOR PENSION INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
This would prevent that from happening. 
We could retain people such as Fernand Auger, who murdered Melanie Carpenter. 
That is one example of the 2,234.  
I encourage the government to support this bill.  
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
At the moment, 16 to 20 people are living in three room houses. 
The Inuit are extremely upset by the housing conditions in Nunavik. 
They consider the situation intolerable. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
This request is made on behalf of the Clayton McGloan family of Calgary.  
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
QUESTIONS PASSED AS ORDERS FOR RETURNS 
Question No. 142- Mr. Bill Gilmour: 
Question No. 149- Mr. Rahim Jaffer: 
Mr. Speaker, I suggest that all remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
INCOME TAX AMENDMENTS ACT, 1998 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
We have some definite objections about Bill C-72. 
I know a young woman who is presently raising two children. 
This young lady has not seen her husband for three years. 
I am sure everybody has. 
This is not right for the Government of Canada.  
I have 12 other cases on file. 
There is never a thank you. 
I have advice for dealing with Bill C-72. 
We can be strict or severe. 
The department says it cannot do this because it deals with money. 
Well I say it can.  
I really hope all of Canada is listening to this. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I certainly agree with the point my hon. friend makes. 
I suspect we have all had similar experiences, too many of them.  
Could he clarify this? 
He seems to be antagonistic about somebody, but surely it is not the bureaucrat. 
Mr. Speaker, the member is quite right. 
Sometimes it does not get back to the department. 
That is part of our problem.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
It is their overall policies that actually filter down to the bureaucrats. 
I am glad the member asked that question. 
They do make errors occasionally. 
I have never seen one. 
I understand they have written letters to say they are sorry. 
I have never seen one. 
Occasionally the clients, who are citizens of Canada, get something in return. 
I have not seen that either.  
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague spoke about complexity and our convoluted tax code. 
We have dehumanized the system. 
The fairness is missing, as he has alluded to.  
That fairness initiative is not being implemented in the tax system. 
Would he care to comment on that, please?  
Very few people in Canada today file their own income tax. 
It has become so complicated that everybody has to have it done. 
The member mentioned tradespeople. 
A young fellow is hired for the first time as a journeyman mechanic. 
In order to work he must equip himself with tools; he cannot work without them. 
That is absolutely insane. 
I could talk about carpenters, electricians and so on. 
It is time we had a total overhaul of the tax system. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
They voted against it.  
I know his constituents have. 
I would ask him to stand and agree.  
Bracket creep probably looked after everything.  
That is not right. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Bill C-72 just adds to that convolution.  
It creates all sorts of confusion.  
I have previously addressed this situation in the House. 
Many of them did. 
However, it was 100% consistent on the part of all 10 firms that were involved. 
All of a sudden these constituents were reassessed. 
Now the government is taking it forward to a higher court of appeal.  
I can think of a situation of some people who are now into their 70s. 
They have a very large piece of property and a residence on the property. 
They received this income. 
They went through the procedure as specified as good Canadian citizens. 
In other words, what I am saying is that the money is gone. 
I said that there were two cases. 
The answer to that question is partly yes and partly no.  
That was in 1996.  
Why did it not reassess immediately for the 1996 year? 
The department is now getting around to it. 
Why would it wait? 
I say to my friend from Kamloops, that is why he is partially correct. 
What do they do with their income tax the next year? 
It is an ever growing and an ever encroaching problem.  
Let us deal specifically with Bill C-72. 
Clause 18(3) states: 
(A + B) X C 
C is the total of 
This is just one very infinitesimal part of what we are dealing with. 
Give people proper basic exemptions. 
Why not simply do what is right? 
The Liberals often accuse us of coming up with simple answers. 
It is they who make all sorts of purchasing decisions. 
Those people of necessity circulate the money back into the economy. 
This act is simply a layering on of convolution. 
This bill makes the onion that much bigger. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
I know my friend is concerned about the growth of the underground economy. 
This results in a significant loss of revenue to the national treasury.  
I am the lamb.  
I could not agree with the member more. 
The way the federal government chose to administer the GST is convoluted.  
Our system of taxation is grossly convoluted. 
I know I am getting a little repetitious with the word convoluted. 
I will have to go to a thesaurus to find a better word.  
No, convoluted is bigger than complex. 
This government is doing absolutely nothing to resolve the issue.  
However, I do not think we will get it from this government. 
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
That is the nature of the beast.  
I have sympathy for the member with respect to the convoluted nature of our system. 
I agree with the member about the sections he quoted. 
Inevitably there will be debate and complexities. 
Also there is great opportunity for members of parliament to intercede. 
We can intercede on behalf of our constituents. 
I understand that the member has been doing so. 
My question to the member is a bit more general than that. 
I know the tax system is designed to collect money. 
In addition they can get a grant. 
That is very complicated and it has to be put into writing.  
Mr. Speaker, that is a very valid question and I appreciate it.  
The Reform Party sees that as being dead wrong.  
I think that is wrong. 
The Reform Party stands for freedom of choice.  
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
Let us look at a little history about income tax. 
We will let those rich people pay it''. 
The need for a flat tax is greater now than it has ever been.  
I do not believe that is going to do the job at all.  
They are going to take the risk. 
It is simply a matter of people judging whether or not the risk is worthwhile. 
I believe that a flat tax rate would do a lot of things. 
A flat tax would lower the tax rate for everybody. 
All services have to be paid for. 
That is the way we run our households. 
Their tax obligation is more than their house payments. 
It is more than their car payments. 
People are going to rebel in various ways. 
I am in no way condoning non-compliance with the tax laws. 
The government's answer to that was to reduce the taxes on cigarettes. 
I would question the methodology in that case.  
Fairness is certainly the way to go.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
I will give an example using gross figures. 
That is a pretty big figure. 
Canadians are paying much higher taxes. 
That is what is essentially wrong with this taxation system. 
We have the cart before the horse in that area.  
It is the farmer's money in the first place. 
We see another problem. 
It is always designed so that does not happen.  
I am referring to the family trust provisions.  
I suspect the figure is actually much higher.  
Certainly the government deserves credit for that. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
When people cannot understand something, they begin to lose confidence in it. 
That is only common sense.  
We need tax reduction, and the government knows it. 
The government came out with a program, AIDA, the compensation package. 
The forms we have pulled off the Internet are 50 pages long. 
It takes an accountant quite some time to fill it out. 
The same is true of income tax forms. 
It is very costly for people to have somebody fill them out. 
Another thing the government has done is to go to a gun registry. 
It is another example of how complex things have become. 
It does not improve public safety. 
The Income Tax Act is not simple.  
I listened to the defence the government has made for this complex system. 
Look at all the things in the tax system that make it so complex. 
We need to go to a very simple tax system. 
Some serious study must be done on a flatter tax system. 
The federal government should do the same. 
The benefits from that would be enormous. 
People would again gain control over their lives. 
They would be able to direct their money.  
We have to do some serious study on how to reduce taxes.  
In my constituency farmers are grossly overtaxed. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
And the bells having rung : 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas-Charlottenburgh, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1999 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we seem to be dealing with money all day today. 
He should seriously look at it. 
This type of paying up front by the government has to stop. 
That is only one part of the bill.  
We wonder the civil service got a little bit upset at the collective bargaining process. 
We have a government that does not want to enter into good faith bargaining. 
I would suggest this is pretty one-sided.  
Why are we going through this farce of union negotiations? 
The government has made up its mind on how much it is going to offer. 
It is a sham. 
How can that lead to good employee moral?  
It is courtesy of the employees. 
We cannot get this information out on the table. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I am glad to have an opportunity to speak to the budget. 
We all thought that the bad news was over. 
Stoically, Canadians suffered through years and years of cutbacks. 
We were all sold that bill of goods. 
This year was surplus time. 
They really thought there was a surplus. 
No, there was none of that. 
How long have we been waiting for a national daycare program? 
How long has it been recognized as a necessity? 
No, there is no mention of that.  
No, that simply was not to be.  
Yes, the feds are making a gesture in the right direction. 
It is being clawed back. 
We lose dollar for dollar, at least in our province. 
It is small consolation.  
That is the whole scope of their life. 
I will put this into context so people will understand. 
This is how the fund has arrived at a surplus. 
It is not going back. 
There is no trickle down. 
It stole $25 billion from the EI fund. 
The man has more gall than Ceasar. 
It is absolutely atrocious. 
The same piece of legislation, Bill C-78, also jacks up the premium.  
Should it not use the surplus to increase the benefits to these people?  
That would improve the quality of life for our retirees and our senior citizens.  
We go there at our peril. 
The same thing is going to happen here. 
My phone has been ringing off the hook. 
It is going to lose. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
I do believe we are talking about Bill C-71. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That is how we arrived at that. 
I will talk about Bill C-71. 
It is leading up to an election year.  
We could use the tax system for the redistribution of wealth. 
It is one of the most effective tools. 
However, there has been no effort to do that. 
It is a despair budget.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
I was intrigued with the member who just spoke. 
We have heard a number of different presentations. 
On the weekend I was at a trade fair at Sherwood Park. 
The people who came by stopped to talk to their member of parliament. 
People are depressed by it. 
I am going to get right to Bill C-71. 
That is a digression. 
However, the government does it, even though the auditor general says it is not permitted. 
Members may be surprised at that. 
How could I, as a Reformer, commend the government for this?  
It is like the day I was being robbed. 
The guy was beating me with a stick. 
That is what the government is doing. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I would like to draw a picture for the House. 
I wish we could do that here. 
All we can do is gesture with our hands and hopefully communicate in that way.  
That seemed like a good number. 
Government members had to do better.  
This budget is an annual budget. 
It does not communicate.  
I want members to visualize a graph. 
It is putting in $2 billion. 
It has nothing to do with this year's budget. 
It is a projection for years two, three, four and five to follow. 
Then it is being increased by half a billion. 
What did the press release say? 
I cannot use that word. 
It is not accurate. 
Can I say that? 
It is not accurate. 
It is a miscommunication. 
It is a deceptive way of communicating with the Canadian people.  
Part of Bill C-71 concerns the implementation of the money. 
It just ain't so. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
It is time that it sat down to take a look.  
Decisions are being made that have real negative impacts on other regions.  
I think back to the red book. 
I will never forget the red book when the Liberals were running. 
A lot of those parents are living in poverty. 
He did not just say it once. 
He told it year after year that it had to change what it was doing.  
The government is telling us how wonderful everything is. 
The hon. member who just spoke referred to health care. 
He is absolutely correct. 
The government talks about putting the money back into health care. 
Then I look at the shipbuilding industry. 
The government and all of us want people to pay taxes. 
People want their dignity and they want to pay taxes. 
The only way they can do that is when they are working.  
They offered 200 jobs and the men are going to have to go.  
I said, ``Where are you going, darling?'' 
I have to leave my nanny and my grampy and all my cousins. 
But that is the only place daddy can get work''.  
I do not know what has happened to us in Canada. 
I really do not. 
It is time for the Liberals to sit down. 
I am really upset.  
Quebec is a shipbuilding province. 
Quebec also wants to put its people back to work. 
Just this past week we had the world curling championships in Saint John. 
This is a most serious situation.  
Where did free trade and NAFTA come from? 
It certainly was not from the Liberals. 
It came right from the PC party. 
Something happened today in our local Telegraph Journal that has never happened before. 
He will not even talk to them. 
He will not even meet with them.  
I do not want to be negative. 
I want to be positive. 
We will continue to fight for our people. 
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
It kind of makes us wonder why we are here.  
I will refer to some specifics of this myth of prudence. 
No one else in Canada can have that option. 
It is not $2.5 billion in reality. 
I guess no one else can get their fingers on it that way.  
So much for listening to Canadians.  
The projection for 1998-99 was for revenues of $144 billion. 
The next year it was revised upward to $151 billion, found cash. 
Back in the hands of the original owners? 
The Liberal government finds ways to spend it faster and faster. 
Mr. Watson called it disgusting and I am inclined to agree with him.  
The lesson we learned from this is simple. 
Given money, the Liberals will spend it for us. 
Now the government is talking about putting $11.5 billion back into health care. 
Let us break that down. 
I had a discussion with Dr. Hal Baldwin from Saskatoon a short time ago. 
He is the treasurer of the Canadian Medical Association. 
These people are working handcuffed. 
The nurses association is on strike right now in Saskatchewan. 
Do these people qualify for any of this aid? 
Not on your life. 
There is no part in the equation for a zero, zero, zero balance. 
It is all puff and mirrors. 
There is no substance here at all.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
And the bells having rung: 
YOUTH CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
You are very good at statements of the obvious.  
Statements of the obvious sometimes escape the government.  
I am pleased to take part in this debate for a number of reasons. 
As I mentioned, it has a very ironic namesake.  
The public wants to know, because this bill was supposed to consider their opinions. 
I am sure the Chair will recall that particular act. 
It is back to the future and back again. 
How will we ask our police forces to take on this additional responsibility? 
We know there are further projected cuts for the coming year. 
Why were certain offences left out of the legislation? 
It seems a glaring omission to me. 
Why did the minister refuse to act? 
That begs the obvious question. 
There has been a misconception about this issue from the outset. 
That is not the suggestion at all. 
We hear this repeatedly from officers. 
In recent correspondence he noted the following facts. 
To prove that it is necessary the onus is on the crown. 
Jail sentences have, in fact, in many cases been reduced.  
This negative commentary is not only limited to politicians. 
York Regional Police Chief Julian Fantino had this to say: 
This bill is very soft with respect to deterrence.  
In no case is an adult sentence automatic under this new legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, there seems to be another debate going on at this time.  
Of course I am enjoying his remarks, as I am sure all hon. members are. 
His remarks may be provoking the debate.  
I know you have the ears of a hawk in that chair.  
That is absolutely shocking.  
That again is built-in discretion.  
There should be a built-in victim fine surcharge for those types of property offences.  
Sentences such as this do not send the proper message to our communities.  
I appreciate the indulgence of the Chair.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Is this the all new Conservative Party? 
Why did the Progressive Conservatives not do something about it? 
However, I wonder why his party did not get around to doing it before?  
We are certainly hoping that he will be back to support us. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, those who do not learn from history are destined to repeat it. 
We in this party are looking for new ideas, new invigoration. 
He suggested that we call it the New Progressive Conservative Party. 
However, we are going to work past that. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
We have a justice system which is limping along. 
They were not getting it from the government.  
We finally have the bill before us but it is inadequate. 
I would far rather concentrate my efforts on the Liberal government. 
I agree we are talking about criminal justice. 
Let us forget about what it said before. 
This is an evolutionary process. 
That is where the government has been falling down. 
It is running out of ideas to borrow from the previous government. 
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
I said ``thinking of''. 
Clair allowed those two parties to fight over 6% of the vote. 
We think the people of Windsor-St. 
Clair have a certain element of wisdom in their insight.  
In some respects that is my reaction to the hon. member's speech.  
The figure when it comes to adults is entirely reversed. 
The United States incarcerates adults at six times the rate we do.  
Is our crime rate lower or higher? 
Will ``toughening up'' this system of youth justice make our streets safer?  
I would submit that is frequently lost on the other side.  
Subsection 37(2) states: 
(a) an offence under one of the following provisions of the Criminal Code: 
(i)...first degree murder or second degree murder...  
(ii)...attempt to commit murder, 
(iv)...aggravated sexual assault- 
The minister has attempted to add to the list subsection (b): 
I turn to subsection 41(8) which states: 
Section 69 deals with presumptive offences and states: 
We set out a presumptive offence. 
Instead of a presumption youth justice can make an order. 
The scheme is coherent, rational and proportionate. 
The ball has moved over to that court.  
In some respects the minister puts her money where her mouth is. 
My submission is that this is a balanced approach. 
This recognizes the concerns of Canadians to their safety. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
I do however question some of the statistics that he cites. 
That was built into the intention of the act, that we treat young people differently. 
The first obligation of the justice system is to protect the innocent.  
That is simply not the case. 
Why would we omit some that obviously are violent by their very nature?  
There are numerous options currently available to judges. 
That is why we have set up these five categories.  
I would submit that is an additional amount of money.  
All money out of the taxpayers' pockets.  
All money is out of the taxpayers' pockets. 
There are no strings attached to that money.  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed the intervention by my hon. colleague across the way. 
I always appreciated his voice in the justice committee. 
It always had a logical and sound ring to it. 
I would like to ask him this brief question. 
This is as a result of the cry across the country from concerned people. 
Does the member have any concern about that?  
It is also at the discretion the courts.  
In so many cases this procedure has been left to the discretion of the courts.  
Mr. Speaker, the short answer is no.  
I am not a great fan of fettering judicial discretion. 
We go for the verdict first then we go to the sentence.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Our youth deserve better from this government. 
Canada has been saddled with inadequate young offender legislation for a number of years. 
First off the youngest offenders are left out. 
They can have their characterizations.  
In certain situations, that is inadequate.  
The government is leaving them to child welfare. 
We are talking about only the tiniest fragment of the youngsters of that age. 
They can either be rehabilitated or indeed, habilitated. 
Often we get mixed up between rehabilitation and habilitation. 
A Liberal across the floor says to hang them high. 
That is the kind of inane characterization I was referring to. 
In British Columbia we are very conscious of the issue of home invasions. 
Unfortunately some young offenders are involved in home invasions. 
Home is the place of sanctity. 
The place where Canadians feel comfortable is in their own homes. 
Unfortunately the maximum youth sentences remain light.  
Let me be very clear. 
They are Judge Waurynchuk, lawyer Glen Purdy and the sergeant. 
These are real numbers.  
Even repeat and violent offenders may avoid jail terms.  
Sometimes it is simply not appropriate. 
When you have to be tough, you have to be tough. 
Unfortunately this government has not shown the backbone to handle that.  
Here is the Reform position on youth crime. 
I said serious offenders. 
They choose not to understand. 
I think they have some intelligence so let us try it on them for size. 
Let us be very clear. 
It does not say that. 
That is where there has to be some responsibility. 
It is very clear and straightforward. 
For every step forward, there is a hidden step backward.  
I had occasion to have an extended discussion with a defence lawyer. 
This legislation has the potential to be an absolute money maker for defence lawyers.  
The Minister of Justice has promised legislation over a period of almost two years. 
The government talks about a balanced approach. 
Why does the government consistently lean in favour of the criminal? 
Why does the government not put the protection of society first?  
The bill is a massive disappointment after the tour parliamentarians made. 
Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):
Why is it that the member finds that objectionable? 
What is it the member is seeking? 
Precisely what is it that the member is looking for?  
I was at the Drumheller Institution last July or August. 
I am taking a look at it in the context of this act. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest, as I always do, to my friend's comments. 
That might be just paraphrasing, but I think is a fair comment to make.  
Mr. Speaker, the comments of my colleagues are well taken. 
There are jurisdictions from which we can learn a lot. 
The province of Quebec has different societal values than other provinces. 
I think that maintaining a degree of flexibility is important.  
There is too broad a scope still involved.  
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
I have a great deal of respect for the Reform member. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of my colleague. 
It is only their goodwill that is keeping our streets safe.  
The government continuously cuts off the resources to them. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
They have no monopoly on criminal justice issues. 
Members should address their questions and answers to the Chair.  
That is exactly what I just finished saying.  
It is just about 2 p.m. so we will proceed to Statements by Members.  
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
Member spoke in Punjabi and provided the following translation: ] 
The Khalsa (pure) is of the God.  
The victory is of the God.  
Happy 300th birthday of Khalsa, the Sikh religion. 
Member spoke in Punjabi and provided the following translation: ] 
The Khalsa (pure) is of the God.  
The victory is of the God.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Fraud, nepotism, intimidation and theft are the orders of the day.  
When will the minister finally listen to the grassroots? 
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
No wonder the House gets a little bit raucous sometimes. 
Sugar, as we know, is one of the main causes of dental problems.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I signal the achievements of a distinguished Canadian medical scientist. 
She combines world class expertise in pediatrics and genetics. 
Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):
They are the sensible ones.  
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
Such studies only get in the way of stealing the lunches of weaker students.  
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):
We in Canada are celebrating the 17th anniversary of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
For six years the Reform Party has been pressuring the government.  
Six years; why did it take so long? 
And, still we are only half way there. 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
It seems to be time this project was shelved.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
The grandfather did not lose custody for neglect. 
The court based its decision on money. 
This is yet another betrayal by the Liberal government. 
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the sovereignists have most decidedly understood nothing about the choice of Quebeckers. 
In the past two days the Bloc Quebecois has made public a series of documents. 
The sovereignists are willfully deaf. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
The flight of Quebeckers' savings was his last issue. 
He followed in the steps of the great leaders. 
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
I hope that there will be numerous representatives from Quebec among them.  
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
BATTLE OF VIMY RIDGE 
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
For Canadians, however, it marks the birth of our nation.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
It is ludicrous and offensive.  
The fishing industry is the lifeblood of Canso. 
Seafreez has exhausted all possible- 
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Certainly no one wants a repeat of the tragic accident that occurred yesterday.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I hope that he listens.  
We were talking to a lot of people this morning. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
They emerged, as the member calls it, with the German proposal.  
That discussion is ongoing and I hope we will have some positive results. 
In the meantime, we will continue to work actively to secure those results.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Therefore, it is very difficult to get any independent evaluation. 
We are in a democracy and we have a wide variety of opinions being expressed.  
We will get that information through to the Serbian people as much as we can.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
In fact, we did bring down taxes substantially in the last budget.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
There we go, Mr. Speaker. 
The Minister of Finance says ``I want to cut taxes, but...'' 
He always has an excuse. 
``This surplus is not big enough''. 
``The dog ate my homework''. 
We hear lame excuse after lame excuse.  
When is he going to give us substantial tax relief?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That is substantial tax relief.  
The Reform Party is now revealing its true colours. 
That is not an excuse; that is Canada's priority.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Unfortunately, those military vehicles also contained refugees.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Since China is on the security council, I would like it to take part. 
I have made arrangements to speak with them as soon as possible.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
The word ``deliberately'' is a bit strong. 
I ask the hon. member not to use such words.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the statements made by the hon. member are false.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
The people are entitled to know this.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I want to stick to today's reality.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Unfortunately Germany's proposal has stalled.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has it wrong. 
I do not think anything has stalled. 
I think the proposal has now been made public. 
As I said, there is a series of discussions going on. 
I am engaged in discussions with my counterparts. 
We are actively engaged to see if we can find a solution.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I am truly surprised. 
The casualties of war are mounting. 
There is evidence that this peace plan has stalled. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not know where the hon. member gets his assessment. 
That is the essential ploy. 
We are trying to get that agreement. 
That is the issue. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member does not seem to give up. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Will the Minister of National Defence confirm the following facts? 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
That ought to be a crime.  
Why would that be?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Three quarters of our spending was on health care and education. 
Would she not do that? 
We spent money on medical research. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
She would still have to pay over $600 in her taxes this coming year. 
I would like the minister to get up and give a supplementary answer. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is not the issue at all. 
And that woman's daughter will get decent prenatal nutrition. 
The Reform Party wants to cut taxes. 
It wants to cut taxes on the backs of the poor and low income people. 
That is its agenda and we will never follow it.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
There is no agreement at the moment. 
A group has put forward ideas. 
It is very important to develop a negotiating process. 
The hon. member for Roberval.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Those were my words.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That is not the question. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, let me tell you what I was against. 
It is two to one, two dollars out and one dollar back in. 
That is not a very good record as far as I am concerned. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We heard the question. 
We will hear the answer.  
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
It has not constituted a major intervention. 
We will not in any way accept any interference or any transgression across those borders. 
We guarantee the safety and security of Macedonia and Albania.  
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
The only plan is in terms of a peace implementation force.  
That is our objective. 
That is our effort. 
Every effort is also made to avoid civilian casualties. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
We consider the matter closed.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is again confusing two different pieces of legislation. 
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
It shows the mobilization of support we can get against this kind of violence.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
As soon as the applications come in the government will expedite the payout.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to talk a bit about western Canadian farmers. 
How many application forms have come in from them?  
The application forms were not even available on the Internet until March. 
How much money has gone out to western Canadian farmers?  
Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
The minister said yesterday that 11,000 application had been sent out. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Let me read from its letter: 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
That in itself is a very important moral stand to take.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Will Canada do that?  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I recognize the good intentions of members of the New Democratic Party. 
The secretary general himself is actively working to secure agreement on those five points. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I did so about a month ago.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
We had 4,000 men working at our shipyard. 
We are now down to 200. 
He refused to meet with them. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
I am prepared to work with the industry. 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the Environment.  
What are the government's intentions with respect to endangered species? 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his very reasonable question. 
The government is very concerned about protecting species at risk. 
It will be law. 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
How can he deny his responsibility?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
The provinces undertook to use all that money for health. 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Spring seeding is approaching and farmers are in dire straits. 
The AIDA program is indeed a disaster.  
Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
It is a very simple operation. 
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
The seal population is some six million and growing rapidly. 
It poses a direct threat to the re-establishment of a viable cod fishery. 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health. 
Many Canadians rely on alternative medicine. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We will appoint an executive director of natural health products. 
That person will understand natural health products and homeopathic- 
The hon. member for Skeena. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thought I had answered the question previously. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
PRESENCE IN THE GALLERY 
Welcome to your House of Commons.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
I do not propose to call any other bill tomorrow.  
Monday shall be an allotted day. 
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
I ask that an order of the day be designated for consideration of this motion.  
THE LATE EDMUND TOBIN ASSELIN 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
He died of a stroke at the age of 78 on Wednesday, March 24, 1999. 
The dashing MP, businessman and lawyer had politics in his blood. 
His father, Joseph Omer Asselin, was the chairman of Montreal's executive committee. 
Mr. Asselin's daughter, Nicole Asselin, said: 
He was more than a politician. 
He was a man with a very big heart. 
He loved to take care of people. 
He wasn't a receiver. 
He was easily re-elected in the election of 1963.  
He was eventually appointed to the bench as a municipal court judge.  
In his younger years he was a star football player at Loyola College. 
Eddy Asselin is survived by three daughters, three sons and his fourth wife, Carmelle. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
He did not seek re-election in 1966. 
Edmund was a prisoner of war during World War II.  
It is said that he had politics in his blood. 
He came from a family that did not shy away from civic duties.  
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
On his return he became a businessman.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Asselin was no ordinary individual. 
I think those are good words to describe him.  
I never heard anybody call him Mr. Asselin. 
He was always known as Eddy. 
He was also called later to be a judge.  
He will be missed by all who knew him. 
He leaves a great blank in the city of Montreal and in Canada. 
He will be truly missed by his friends and his family.  
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
I think this was an important part of his personality. 
I am told he was forever receiving invitations to one event or another.  
As a young man, he fought in World War II. 
That must have taken exceptional courage. 
YOUTH CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT 
Mr. John Maloney (Erie-Lincoln, Lib.):
That process is underway.  
Certainly in my consultations this was a very important factor for consideration.  
Again, this is a very important aspect of the legislation.  
Prison is a school for crime. 
We owe it to Canadians and most especially to Canadian youth.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
It has to have a list that applies to everything. 
Now we come out with Bill C-68. 
I am afraid to use that name. 
Neither one of them is very good.  
It is severely restrictive. 
Why is there just this restrictive little list? 
Would he support adding more violent crimes to this all important Liberal list?  
My friend is criticizing us for having a list. 
He has his own little list. 
All offences are serious. 
At what point do we allow discretion? 
Where do we draw the line? 
They are young and impetuous. 
He should realize that; he taught them for years and years. 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to what my colleague from Erie-Lincoln had to say. 
Mr. Speaker, the member asks several questions. 
First I will deal with the publication of names. 
Canadians have been demanding this and it contributes to public confidence in the system.  
We are also concerned about the safety of the public. 
They will go to a youth facility.  
Sometimes for the safety of the public they have to be dealt with accordingly. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
These are all positive steps.  
There are many more positive aspects to the legislation which will be of benefit. 
The aims and aspects of it are very worthwhile. 
There is good emphasis on the protection of the public as well.  
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
In more simple terms, this bill will replace the current legislation on young offenders.  
These are not imaginary statistics. 
These figures are from Statistics Canada's Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics. 
They are not just a product of wishful thinking by the Bloc Quebecois. 
I see he persists with that.  
It merely addresses the consequences of underlying social problems. 
That is two years sooner than under the current legislation.  
This measure, specifically, raises a number of doubts. 
We still do not have an answer. 
The legislation as it stands is serving its purpose very well in Quebec. 
She said, and I quote: 
Clearly, the police do not all think alike. 
The consensus in Quebec on the issue of young offenders is clear.  
That will not surprise anyone. 
This is why the Quebec model does not advocate incarceration.  
In 1996-97, its share of the funding represented no more than 36%.  
This is not the first time Quebec has not received its fair share.  
For all these reasons, I move: 
Mr. John O'Reilly (Haliburton-Victoria-Brock, Lib.):
Does she not agree that public safety starts with prevention?  
I wonder if the member for Laval Centre could comment further on that.  
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral:
One such simplistic response is substituting get-tough measures for educational approaches. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The amendment by the hon. member for Laval Centre is in order.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
My question to the hon. member is this. 
Is she aware of that report?  
A lot of it is just pressure.  
I would like the hon. member to respond to that. 
A fear exists among young people. 
I think there is a big connection. 
Would the hon. member agree?  
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral:
Mr. Speaker, the problem of suicide among young people is a serious one. 
It is possible, I am no expert. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
I have been putting forward a provision in my home province. 
This bill continues to make sentences much harsher for juveniles. 
This bill of course is government legislation. 
The hon. member referred to a lot of statistics. 
There will be provincial changes. 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral:
We are capable of recognizing that.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not know why it is. 
I stand to be corrected but I do not think so. 
A very close friend of mine when he was 21 years old committed suicide. 
We struggled with trying to understand. 
I can give the assurance it was not fear. 
It was lack of hope. 
I find that absolutely despicable.  
I frankly find that scary. 
I welcome that any time. 
That is a plus. 
It is truly an unfortunate attitude.  
Again, another Reform MP's statement.  
And Reform members wonder why people react negatively to their remarks and comments. 
They cannot figure that out. 
Why are you throwing the Reform Party in the dump?''  
I drew the short straw. 
I was there as a Liberal representative. 
It was like sticking a thousand needles in my eyes to spend the weekend there. 
It was like scraping one's fingernails down the blackboard. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
I would just like to correct that.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
He's the guy who beat up PSAC single-handedly.  
Their cry used to be that the west wants in. 
Well, the west is in. 
The west has tremendous representation at the cabinet table. 
We have to do their work. 
Here is another marvellous statement about how they would deal with young offenders. 
It says here ``except in cases of very young offenders''. 
I would like to hear that definition. 
I think I know what it is. 
We should think about that. 
A youngster gets in some trouble. 
No, that is the point. 
The Reform Party member says ``like murder''. 
Eighty-seven per cent of the crimes committed by young offenders are not violent offences. 
Reformers know that, but they consistently want to somehow showcase the ones that are violent. 
That is what the bill does. 
I am astounded that members opposite did not stand and give a standing ovation. 
This is what they have been asking for.  
Maybe tragically he got involved with drugs. 
They would somehow do the scarlet letter on this 10 year old child.  
It is truly frightening, frankly.  
They had better think before they say them.  
That should address their concerns. 
I want to refer to some good stories. 
It was a wonderful establishment, by the way. 
Open for Business is like the Planet Hollywood of youth entrepreneurship. 
Her answer was astounding. 
She said ``My parole officer told me''. 
I will not go into details about her business. 
Obviously second chance is what this bill is all about.  
This young woman came in and met with the counsellors. 
She met with peers. 
She met with young people. 
It is another second chance program. 
This is absolute cutting edge stuff. 
This is stuff that we should be spreading the gospel about throughout the land. 
The young woman I met in Nova Scotia has turned her life around. 
She now has a business that has been open for eight months. 
I do not know what her crime was. 
She has a parole officer. 
I suspect it must have been fairly serious. 
That is what has turned her life around.  
I will be right back.  
I will not go away, trust me. 
I understand fully that there was a generation which believed in that. 
I attended a Catholic boarding school. 
That is what happened to me. 
It has had lasting, damaging effects. 
It is wrong, but in the 1950s and 1960s it was commonplace. 
It was the way of dealing with things. 
It is the way we were brought up. 
I do not blame people for that. 
It was a mentality that came out of that generation. 
I do not totally understand it.  
I grew up in a family of 10 kids. 
My dad was a labour leader. 
He was just as likely to cuff me across the head as not. 
He was a tough man. 
That was the mentality that he grew up in, that I grew up in. 
It is not the mentality of my sons. 
I think that is what the bill does. 
It has a mind and it has a heart. 
They will have to stay drug free and alcohol free. 
It probably makes sense. 
It gives them a chance.  
There can be some changes. 
That may well make sense. 
However, some policies have been espoused against the bill. 
Obviously I support the bill. 
It is about time we amended and reworked the Young Offenders Act. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
I spent a number of years there. 
I never doubled my fist and neither did anybody else. 
We had a kids at risk program that worked very effectively. 
We were able to identify kids as low as grade one who were at risk. 
It did not take anything but good common sense. 
That is Liberal legislation. 
What does he say about that?  
I do not know why he said these things. 
I do not know why. 
I made the point that when we speak in this place we are accountable. 
Maybe that was the problem. 
I do not now, but it does not surprise me.  
Just answer the question.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am going to use my prerogative and recognize the hon. member for Matapedia-Matane.  
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
I myself have hidden delinquent students in one office or another. 
I have taken some of them home with me. 
I was listening to my colleague from the government party. 
He wondered how people could be in difficulty. 
How could some become delinquents?  
He said something very true. 
Very often, it is because of hopelessness. 
These young people are given nothing. 
They are not challenged. 
They are 12, 14 or 15 years old, and their parents do not work. 
There is a major problem.  
The child is at home and can see what is happening. 
This is a problem for society. 
Fortunately in Quebec there is a challenge offered: sovereignty. 
Young people in the CEGEPS and universities are following us. 
Our clientele is essentially the young people.  
I would like to put a question to the hon. member for Mississauga West. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate what the member is saying. 
Thirteen percent of young offenders who commit crime commit violent crime. 
That is one of the changes which this bill will effect.  
There also has to be, and should be, an ability to protect society. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
He started something that was called the Lieutenant Governor's Foundation for Youth. 
I was a member of its board prior to being elected to this place. 
They would make good apprentices.  
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of the member who just spoke. 
He called me a pro. 
The member who spoke before him said that I was stupid. 
I think I will accept the latter definition.  
I asked a question and I was really surprised at the answer. 
There is proof in Manitoba. 
I congratulate the province and the member for that. 
I met with the young people.  
Come and meet these kids to see how they are turning their lives around. 
That is what this bill is about.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Does the member for Blackstrap have a specific time in mind?  
Mr. Speaker, I think another 10 minutes would be sufficient.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
I want to make a couple of things quite clear. 
I would like the member to come to some of the class reunions. 
I go to them every year. 
I will tell him about a couple of incidents.  
These young people would transfer into the school. 
We had to admit him. 
I had no right to that information.  
I will have to give the Conservative government one bit of credit. 
It will be very small. 
Please tell me how that prevents crime. 
As a parent, would that not be a good thing to know? 
It is not all the fault of the act. 
In my opinion, there was always a place for that in the schools. 
Government members would not understand those kinds of preventive measures. 
Nobody dislikes abuse more than this guy. 
We do not want to lash them or cane them. 
Nobody has ever said that. 
He would then go out and do it again. 
When did this young fellow stop stealing cars? 
He stopped on his 12th birthday. 
The government knows about that. 
That is not an isolated case. 
It also happened in Vancouver. 
Stealing cars is not a normal thing to do.  
There are surely better ways. 
Nobody can disagree with that. 
Lord knows the government taxes us enough. 
I do not know what is wrong with the Liberal government. 
It really likes making lists. 
We just do not like him so we want to get him. 
What does the list consist of? 
I really do not understand what is wrong with the government. 
That is the key word. 
Community sentencing is a nice word. 
The government recently came out with Bill C-41. 
I agree with that. 
There is something wrong with that picture.  
All of a sudden we have cases under the section dealing with sentencing. 
There are a number of things that we must consider before passing a sentence. 
That is discrimination in the worst kind, in the most subtle way.  
Why do we allow that?  
I looked at the Liberal wisdom. 
This cannot be any more than just Liberal wisdom which is no wisdom at all. 
We are talking about the youth criminal justice act. 
We will name it Bill C-68.  
Let us keep the public confused and then they will not question us.  
There is no doubt about it.  
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I guess I will have to repeat my speech. 
I thought I had clarified that quite nicely.  
I talked about that a great deal. 
Maybe the member's earplug was not in. 
I do not know.  
I thought I had covered that but maybe I did not.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I listened with interest to my friend. 
Could the hon. member give some thought to the causes of crime? 
In his experience, why is it that certain young people go afoul of the law? 
Is there any commonality in their backgrounds? 
It is a difficult question to answer, but not in all cases.  
I can only give examples. 
I tried to bring in the family, the mother and the father. 
I said we had to begin the process of helping this young fellow out.  
He had no supervision. 
No supervision is not good for young people, especially at six years of age. 
It is a cry for help.  
The list can go on. 
Sometimes some kids are just rotten to the core and I do not know why. 
There is no excuse for it. 
We tell him he can't go out. 
It goes on and on. 
Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):
Could he be a little more explicit about that? 
What does he really mean?  
The process and the way we handle business is wrong. 
It is a shame. 
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
It shocked me when I sat here and listened to the members before him speak.  
That is what is wrong here. 
We cannot do anything. 
The government has taken the right of parenting away from us. 
I would like the hon. member to comment.  
Madam Speaker, the hon. member is absolutely correct. 
We involved the parents, we involved the police and we involved the school authorities. 
We were very successful.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there consent to extend the time?  
Mr. John O'Reilly (Haliburton-Victoria-Brock, Lib.):
A lot of thought has gone into it.  
We look at the answers and the simplistic approach of the Reform Party. 
Certainly, I found that not a way I could agree with. 
She deals with people who are in trouble at a very early age. 
That is what we have to look at.  
That is what we are trying to do here with Bill C-68. 
Basically the amendment would gut the bill and make it worth nothing. 
People are like that in society. 
He even attended their UA convention. 
Jurassic Joe Clark must be having a field day. 
Have not all the right wing fanatics gone out of the Conservative Party? 
Have they not all gone to the Reform Party? 
Mr. John O'Reilly:
He just threatened to punch me out.  
Mr. John O'Reilly:
Well, no doubt, and that is how they would cure you.  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. John O'Reilly:
I know the hon. member wants to be leader of the Reform Party. 
He has indicated that. 
Let us go back to the main talking points on Bill C-68. 
That is not true. 
My wife asked me to have that corrected. 
There are the very young first offenders who commit a crime and are caught. 
Sometimes it is the very first crime they have committed and they are caught. 
It is more than that. 
They could be sitting in front of them in a classroom. 
I am not taking about an elementary school system. 
It is very easy to tell if someone is dangerous. 
That will not happen.  
Well, it will not. 
No matter where it is one is too many. 
Bill C-68 is a good start in addressing our criminal justice system for youth. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, extensive comment was made about the United Alternative. 
There were 1,500 delegates from all over Canada. 
These delegates were not associated with a given political party. 
Mr. John O'Reilly:
I thank him for that. 
I know he is a strong supporter of the youth justice system.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to raise a question of privilege for you to consider. 
He challenged me to a physical encounter of some description. 
``Come on, let's go'', he said and clenched his fists.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It will not be taken lightly and should not be taken lightly. 
A very serious accusation has been made by the member for Mississauga West. 
It will be dealt with in a very serious manner.  
We will start with the member for Okanagan-Shuswap.  
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am one of the members he is talking about. 
I took great exception to that. 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I thank the hon. member for St. Albert for his sage advice. 
I will recognize the hon. member for Blackstrap.  
Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):
I completely agree with you.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Are there any other members who have anything to add to this?  
You're a liar, Stinson.  
Did you hear that, Mr. Speaker? 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We are going to try to resolve this right now. 
Would the hon. member for Mississauga West please do so immediately?  
Mr. Speaker, out of respect for you, sir, I do.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We will now consider the other very serious matter. 
This will be taken under advisement. 
I will be quite happy to take this up again. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
He did not say that he would move any particular motion.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I thank the hon. member for St. Albert. 
His comment is already on the table. 
I thanked him once for his advice, but I will thank him again.  
We will now proceed directly to Private Members' Business.  
Those sentences referred to in section 85 currently are to be served consecutively. 
In other jurisdictions similar laws are being passed. 
Since 1934 in Canada we have had a handgun registry. 
It has been a requirement that legally owned handguns be registered. 
There are three main points I would like the Liberal government to understand.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mr. Speaker, that is very unfortunate for many reasons.  
I do not think that is relevant. 
Why are they refusing to allow this bill to be votable? 
They will not have to vote on it. 
Why does she not introduce bills like that?  
I will answer that question. 
COMMENTS BY MEMBERS-SPEAKER'S RULING 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I compliment you on your ruling.  
To say that I oppose this bill is to be minimalist in the matter. 
In some respects it is a fettering of judicial discretion. 
That is fundamental to our system of law in this country. 
(a) to denounce unlawful conduct; 
(b) to deter the offender and other persons from committing offences; 
(c) to separate offenders from society; 
(d) to assist in rehabilitating offenders; 
That is the essence of the flaw with this bill. 
This absurdity would lead to further absurdities.  
The Criminal Code already provides for consecutive sentences. 
There are not simply concurrent sentences. 
I heard endless numbers of speeches from members opposite about this issue. 
In other words, there are no volume discounts. 
I will repeat this. 
The Criminal Code provides for minimum sentences in limited circumstances. 
The bill needs to have a short and quick death. 
I could go on to other significant problems. 
They put the discretion where it belongs: with the judge.  
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
Section 85 currently states that: 
Every person commits an offence who uses a firearm 
This is what is set out in the Criminal Code at the present time. 
It also calls for these sentences to be served consecutive to any other sentence. 
So, what amendments does our Reform colleague want to introduce? 
This is no small change.  
Let us look now at its effects.  
Another important principle is flouted here. 
A person cannot be charged twice for the same offence.  
In the bill before us, this principle is set aside. 
In any democratic system, the Kienapple principle is very important. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
What is behind this legislation? 
That is how we could summarize this legislation.  
What are these offences? 
I will name them because I think it is important. 
All these are dastardly crimes.  
For various reasons people participate in these activities. 
They will be shot. 
Very serious bodily harmed will be caused. 
It adds another dimension to the process. 
I like the legislation. 
I do not know if these are the appropriate terms. 
The purpose of this debate is to move the legislation forward. 
This is sort of a first draft or a first run through. 
It is the result of somebody's gun going off. 
It is the result of a domestic dispute. 
It is the result of a hunting accident. 
We are not talking about whether firearms should exist or not. 
However, will this be effective? 
I might add that is a consecutive penalty. 
It is added on after the first penalty. 
I would question whether it would act as a deterrent. 
I suspect it probably would. 
It is something we have to take a lot more seriously. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
In noting this inevitable confrontation, we feel that the following problems will ensue.  
However, these problems are not as easily dealt with. 
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
That comment is insulting and is typical of Liberal arrogance. 
Why do they insist on protecting criminals instead of law-abiding citizens? 
We have been pressuring them to remove section 745. 
That is a Liberal policy. 
Then there is the Young Offenders Act. 
I live in a nice community in Saskatoon. 
What could be more straightforward?  
We do have fear. 
When they see a group of young people approaching, they get scared.  
What kind of culture have we created in our society? 
Why do we not act now to implement laws which change that? 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
In addition, under the employment insurance program we have provisions for parental leave. 
The minister is quite right. 
I am going to ask for her comment.  
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I welcome the hon. member's question. 
The message we have heard is loud and clear.  
Their parents are coming home to live with them. 
These same families also have disabled persons that they are looking after. 
The issues are not only about the income tax system. 
There were some answers there. 
The hon. member is absolutely right. 
We need to talk about pensionable earnings. 
How do families plan for pension? 
The Canada pension plan is one way. 
Other forms of pension would be another way. 
How do we look at parental leave, at a caregiving subsidy of some kind? 
It is a complex issue. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.44 p.m.)
