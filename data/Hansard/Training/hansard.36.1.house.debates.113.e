The House met at 10 a.m. 
COMMONWEALTH SPEAKERS AND PRESIDING OFFICERS 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk-Brant, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I was most honoured to attend that conference representing our parliament.  
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
NATIONAL SYMBOL OF CANADIAN UNITY ACT 
(Motions deemed adopted, bill read the first time and printed) 
CORRECTIONS AND CONDITIONAL RELEASE ACT 
The purpose of this bill is to prevent such decisions.  
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE 
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
It is right and the Liberals agree.  
Canadians also export our Constitution and Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
Canada must not wait for Japan to act. 
Certainly we should claim costs from Japan but at a later date.  
This list contains 361 names. 
I ask that you pick up the torch. 
I ask that you not fail in the task lest we all forget.  
I want to recognize the human element of a well documented statistical history.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
That compensation will be claimed from the country of Japan.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the question.  
They would like $18 a day, which would be reasonable. 
The $1 a day was totally unacceptable. 
Canada now has an opportunity now to correct this wrong.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the kind comments from my colleague.  
It has been far too long. 
Christmas day 1941 was the first day of their internment. 
It is now 58 years later and there are still questions.  
We should give them this sign of respect.  
I phoned Mr. Wilbert Lynch in Edmonton yesterday. 
There is a sense of urgency to give this sign of respect.  
Mr. Speaker, I move: 
That the House do now proceed to orders of the day.  
Mr. Speaker, will we not be given an opportunity to present our petitions this morning? 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
There is not unanimous consent. 
We will now go to orders of the day.  
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):
I would like to speak about this amendment today.  
That said, the debate took place May 12. 
What was said in the debate is important. 
That was clear during the debate.  
The issue was discussed and clearly understood. 
The amendment was passed by a majority of committee members.  
I felt disappointed that he did not praise the committee. 
That was the intent. 
It is very disappointing to see such misrepresentation of the intent of the committee.  
That is what the government did. 
That is what was intended. 
That is what the reformulated amendment does.  
I would like to congratulate the government for showing such flexibility. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member has requested unanimous consent to present petitions. 
Does the hon. member have unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member does not have unanimous consent.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Nice try, but it is not a point of order. 
We will resume the debate.  
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
That is something that we should be moving away from, not entrenching further.  
I think this is a disturbing trend. 
It leaves many members of the House feeling powerless and ineffective.  
It is a name that has international recognition. 
Unfortunately, one part of the bill is drafted very poorly. 
It is in fact redundant. 
What is wrong with that? 
Why is it there? 
He was also discussing whether it was a Liberal dominated committee. 
In fact it is. 
I invite anyone to look back at the record to see how the voting went. 
As far as I know, I am the only person who voted against the amendment.  
They were obviously admitting that they were making a mistake.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That is a point of debate.  
At committee stage the amendment passed. 
The wording of this clause is lifted straight out of the Official Languages Act. 
It is poor legislative draftsmanship.  
The Liberals do not seem to mind. 
The agency will also have its plate full with respect to parks issues. 
This is a monumental task considering the cutbacks that Parks Canada has had to face. 
Furthermore, funds from this account are repayable to the crown with interest.  
The new agency structure provides much needed flexibility. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am wondering if I could present them at this time.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
As for the additions, they fit for the most part into three categories. 
A second type of addition is for the purpose of improving the bill. 
Our amendment read as follows, and I quote: 
I have to say we have a real concern. 
We all know about the lure of money. 
Unfortunately, our amendment was rejected.  
We also proposed another amendment which made a lot of sense. 
So, in this case as in others, the government is opting for the status quo.  
This account will be used to finance new national parks and historic sites. 
These advances must be repaid with interest.  
Their present jobs are guaranteed for two years by Treasury Board.  
It is not the intention of this government to either privatize or commercialize Parks Canada. 
In this regard, a number of witnesses appeared before the committee to express their concerns. 
Developing the 15 remaining regions in two years sounds like sheer utopia. 
It would appear we have guarantees here too. 
We will support Bill C-29, which creates the Parks Canada agency. 
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
This is of particular importance to the people of Cape Breton.  
The Cape Breton Highlands National Park is contained in my riding. 
I acknowledge the applause from my colleagues from Nova Scotia. 
I would go further and say that they be given free rates to the parks.  
The land represented their livelihood. 
Their land bordered the coastline. 
They farmed and fished all summer. 
It was expropriated for a good reason. 
It is important to preserve that area. 
Those individuals were relocated. 
They pay taxes to the Canadian government for the preservation of the parks. 
I know it will raise the hackles of the constituents in my riding. 
I have already received complaints about that very process.  
As well I want to talk a little bit about the advisory council. 
We are creating an agency to manage the parks. 
We have heard that this is not a step. 
I recognize that the minister will have some authority. 
I still have great concerns when it comes to the personnel in Parks Canada. 
They have had their wages frozen and rolled back. 
They have had their work increased for less money. 
I have concerns about the increasing fees at Parks Canada. 
Let us not forget that we have a number of parks across this country. 
They determine our identity. 
Those are the things that define us. 
Why in heaven's name would the minister do this? 
Why are we handing over the authority to manage those parks to another country? 
What does that mean in terms of Bill C-29?  
But these are our national and cultural heritage sites.  
It causes me concern as to where we are going with the national parks.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Nothing could be further from the truth.  
I cannot imagine where this member has come from with his comments.  
I understand the Reform Party will support this piece of legislation. 
He asks if we are in the 1950s or the 1920s. 
We know where the Reform Party would like to go with Parks Canada. 
It would like to have a Disneyland and McDonald's on every corner. 
That is its mechanism for making money and becoming cost efficient in Canada's parks.  
I am very aware of and have a personal commitment to parks. 
Mr. Speaker, the member may not have been in the House last night. 
He obviously missed that.  
It is a win-win-win. 
There are new ways. 
Mr. Speaker, I find that an interesting analogy. 
I know that is his position. 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
If you ask, I believe you would find unanimous consent of the House.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
There is no consent.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
It would also amend related acts.  
The bill establishes the Parks Canada agency as a distinct legal entity. 
I urge all hon. members to support the bill.  
Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
There is no question that it is a very positive step forward. 
We can look back at our heritage and understand some significant adventures in history. 
We are designating sites to recognize great accomplishments of Canadians.  
We look forward to making certain the legislation moves along as quickly as possible.  
I am pleased with many of the comments I have heard from the opposition. 
I am pleased with the comments I have heard from my own colleagues. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
It is a very special place as are all national parks. 
I have no question about that.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
(Motion agreed to and bill withdrawn) 
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
The legislation creating the new agency will support and will possibly strengthen the existing mandate. 
This is why we are bringing in the new Parks Canada agency into existence. 
In turn, Canadians gain a greater appreciation of our country and its natural beauty. 
Our national parks are indeed a national treasure. 
They link us to our history, our heritage and the Canadian landscape.  
Banff remains one of Canada's premier and most loved national treasures. 
Its natural beauty and resources must be preserved for generations to come.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
It gives me great pleasure to rise in support of this legislation. 
I have four national parks in my constituency. 
This is a far more efficient way of working. 
I think that is excellent.  
It is not only redundant, it is bad law.  
If it did not exist what would have happened? 
It was totally and absolutely unnecessary.  
I guess that is part of the political game the Liberals like to play. 
The reality is there is absolutely no necessity for this. 
What did the Liberals do? 
Last night the Reform Party came forward with an amendment. 
The amendment said strike this unnecessary amendment created in committee. 
It already applies to this piece of legislation. 
It was simply a piece of face saving. 
The reality of the situation is this. 
Let me add one caveat. 
That would be an absolute shame. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my hon. friend brought up a number of excellent points. 
He brought up bilingualism.  
There is something called an opportunity cost. 
Mr. Speaker, clearly the answer to that question is yes.  
The situation is even more confused than what the hon. member has outlined. 
It is unclear what this redundant clause will actually mean in enforcement. 
We do not know what impact this is going to have. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Yorkton-Melville does not have to go any further. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member does not have unanimous consent.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House is forever indebted to the hon. parliamentary secretary for his pearls of wisdom. 
We will resume debate.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
The answer is no.  
I fail to see where those individuals need to be bilingual. 
The government has simply not presented an idea of why that is so.  
Furthermore, there is the current situation with respect to our law. 
While our law provides for some serious penalties, those penalties are not being enforced. 
What kind of message does that give to potential poachers? 
That is an embarrassment to our country.  
They are wholly inadequate because of a lack of resources.  
There are other issues we have to deal with. 
The current legislation protects habitat. 
Animals and birds do not know provincial boundaries. 
It requires federal and provincial leadership in order to do that. 
Here are some solutions. 
It is absolutely weak and as a result our species are paying the penalty.  
We can apply that same lesson. 
It could be done in a sensible way without destroying the parks at all. 
We have seen where this has been done in places around the world.  
Sixth is the aspect of differential fees. 
There is an enormous challenge in front of us. 
Many of the species in this world are harbingers of things to come. 
What happens to them may ultimately happen to us.  
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Skeena. 
The national parks, after all, belong to the people of Canada.  
As a former mayor of Dauphin I attended. 
Lo and behold, when the report came out, guess what happened? 
In fact, I complained about this very issue, but to no avail. 
Obviously we did not have a meeting. 
Surely this type of behaviour is unacceptable.  
What it did reflect were the views of the parks officials and the bureaucrats.  
This it certainly did after the report was released.  
Who will be the watchdog of the new Parks Canada Agency? 
He states in his letter: 
As a result, the working environment has suffered considerably. 
I say again, who will be the watchdog of this new parks agency? 
The legislation says that it will report to the minister. 
What does that mean? 
Another area I would like to talk about is cost recovery. 
I agree that we need to practise this principle. 
Even here there are limitations. 
There is probably no town site that could be compared to Banff National Park.  
Their water supply comes from the park. 
They were there before the park came into existence. 
Obviously they should have some historical rights to water.  
I thought parks were to preserve our forests.  
This was done without any consultation with the local people. 
One of the problems is that the park superintendent has too much power. 
After all, it is the taxpayers of Canada who own the parks.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
It almost appears as if they are trying to keep these people busy. 
That is my biggest concern. 
If the process is flawed, where does one go? 
Does one report to the minister or to the deputy minister? 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
They are run almost like a fiefdom. 
The Riding Mountain National Park is an absolutely classic example.  
The town site has basically been isolated. 
The commercial ventures in that area are suffering dreadfully. 
Mr. Speaker, the member pointed out that it is very frustrating. 
Problems seem to go around in circles and circles. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
There was to be no other human activity in those areas.  
I am referring to towns being created and so on.  
It is inaccessible areas that are rugged and difficult for human beings to access. 
For all intents and purposes it will be left alone for all times. 
I have a great deal of difficulty with that.  
They are lost for all time.  
I have another example to give, Moresby Island in the Queen Charlotte Islands. 
It was a blatant lie.  
That is the kind of thing the environmental movement engages in all the time. 
It has been largely successful, particularly in large metropolitan areas of the country.  
Is this going to be a wonderful thing? 
Is this going to be great? 
We can go to Sandspit and ask the people there how much tourism they get. 
They have a beautiful lodge. 
They have made it difficult for anybody to access the park. 
They have a waiting list. 
They only allow 2,000 people a year or thereabouts into the park. 
That is why I have a difficult time supporting the legislation. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Since there are no questions and comments we will continue with debate.  
Mr. Speaker, I am little bit slow today. 
Would that require unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I could not follow the hon. member's comment. 
I want to know what he said.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Does the member for Elk Island have unanimous consent?  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
I was waiting for them to rise but none of them did. 
I have a national park in my own riding. 
A lot of seniors were involved in that park from the beginning. 
Some of them are unable now to ride bicycles. 
I would like my colleague to comment on that.  
They care more about bugs and slugs than they do about people. 
That is the reality of it. 
That is the kind of attitude that pervades the bureaucracy at Parks Canada. 
It is the kind of attitude that pervades the environmental movement. 
That is the reality of it.  
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
The St. Leonard's Society is already co-ordinating justice circles in the London vicinity. 
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
This neighbourhood has been plagued with unemployment, poverty and daily incidents of violence.  
The teens have had enough. 
Most important, these young people have provided the initiative. 
Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard-La Prairie, Lib.):
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Mr. McCain is a leader in his field. 
Being a former teacher, I can appreciate the impact teachers have on our youth. 
Teachers have the responsibility to prepare their students for life. 
Mr. McCain obviously excels at this aspect of teaching.  
A YEAR IN REVIEW 
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne-Blainville, BQ):
It now has a population of more than 40,000.  
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
Not long ago, the issue of Quebec's linguistic school boards remained unsolved. 
Now, the Liberal government- 
The hon. member for Calgary Southeast has the floor.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Shame on these MPs. 
What a disgrace to this House and to this country.  
REFORM PARTY OF CANADA 
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
What we need from the Liberals is a commitment to farmers. 
The hon. member for Beauce.  
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
These two parties will now even share the same meeting rooms. 
Will Lucien Bouchard rise or will he forever hold his peace?  
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Colleagues, a year ago today, all of us here were quite anxious. 
They are the class of 1997. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
The whole thing was hammered out behind closed doors.  
Last November the official opposition sought access to documents on this deal. 
We filed an access to information request. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
There was a public announcement at that time.  
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
We are getting fairly close, my colleagues. 
Be quite judicious in the choice of words. 
I ask the hon. Leader of the Opposition to put his question.  
It bypassed the rules on competitive bidding. 
It bypassed the rules on public disclosure of sole source contracts. 
What is it about this deal that the Prime Minister is endeavouring to hide?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
No wonder the private sector was anxious to get this deal. 
I will ask the Prime Minister again. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we followed all the rules. 
It was examined carefully and approved by Treasury Board. 
It was in the best interests of creating economic activity in western Canada. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, there is another rule bender. 
The hon. Minister of National Defence.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
This was handled in the proper fashion. 
There was no lobbying done by that individual anywhere within the period of time.  
Furthermore, this decision was taken about two years ago. 
It was offered to Reform members and they refused to do that. 
The hon. member for Calgary Northeast.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the facts speak for themselves. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
All those things are watched very closely.  
We had a time deadline in which to get this in to NATO. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
I appeal to you, my colleagues. 
We are having a tough time.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, this government specializes in making bad choices.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The hon. member for Rimouski-Mitis.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Its only project in this regard has been the millennium scholarships. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We have managed the country very well.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Not surprisingly the talks broke down today. 
The health minister has one more chance. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member ought not to think the talks have broken down. 
There are no negotiations going on in Edmonton. 
Those talks are going very well.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
Their position has not changed. 
The only casualties out there will be the hepatitis C victims.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member does not understand the process. 
As for the rest, let us await the process.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
Mr. Speaker, indeed I understand the process. 
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is a good process in place. 
Discussions are under way among officials in Edmonton. 
They are examining and fleshing all options which ministers will then consider. 
I suggest the member await the conclusion of that very good process.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
It asked that the do nothing option be taken right off the table.  
The federal representatives said they had to consult with the Minister of Health. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, yesterday the victims were really quite jubilant. 
They thought progress was being made. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I think the member has touched upon something here. 
Yesterday the representatives of certain groups left quite happy with the process. 
Today they are saying something else. 
This is not a negotiation in Edmonton. 
That is the way governments act when they act responsibly.  
I urge the member to let this process come to a conclusion. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Is it a bad choice to decrease the taxes of the self-employed? 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The Bloc Quebecois position is simply ridiculous.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
The product was not formally banned until 1993, years later.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will tell the House what is inappropriate. 
We see that happening- 
The hon. member for Edmonton North.  
When will he admit that they are wrong?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, what I have stated is our government's position.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am always pleased to co-operate with the Minister of Finance.  
That is what people expect from us.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
It goes on to say: ``Funds from this reserve would be applied against the deficit''. 
Why the flip-flop?  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Let me speak further to the minister's confusion. 
Last week he said that cutting premiums would not create jobs. 
Next he will be telling us that cutting premiums will somehow kill jobs.  
What are the voices in the minister's head telling him today? 
When are we going to get a straight answer from the minister?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
After all, this was written before the marriage with the Bloc.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the Environment.  
Canada's north continues to encounter problems with toxic waste. 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for this very important question.  
However, we are also concerned about historic toxic waste. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Why was this allowed to happen?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will look into the particular case that the member has just raised.  
The the transitional jobs fund has been very well used by this government. 
There have been many consultations. 
Provincial administrations are being consulted on every project. 
There are objective criteria.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
How can the minister allow this to happen?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Our government has objective criteria and we follow the process very closely. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Why did the minister not launch an investigation? 
Why has it taken so long to get to the bottom of this tragedy?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
It is being investigated. 
That is basically all I can say at this time.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Let us face it, there is a mess in the minister's department. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
She declines to listen to the answers we give. 
She ignores the facts when we lay them out before her. 
We have explained each of these issues and she pays no attention to the answers.  
Public safety is a priority for this government and it will continue to be.  
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
No, Mr. Speaker, on the contrary.  
I am prepared to raise the issue with my colleagues.  
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my simple answer to this supplementary is yes.  
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member for her question.  
Originally it was thought that would deal with this issue. 
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
We are continuing to work on it. 
THE LATE ROBERT LORNE MCCUISH 
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
The measure of a member of parliament is not something easily expressed. 
I am sure Mr. Speaker remembers that. 
He had a wonderful sense of humour. 
We recall one of the famous incidents. 
I believe that Lorne at one time was a member of the consumer affairs committee. 
It is a famous story. 
That is just one of the many things he did. 
Lorne loved his work. 
Lorne represented a very large riding, 322,000 square kilometres. 
He was like the travelling representative. 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
He was raised in Vancouver before moving to Prince George in the 1950s. 
It was there that he became involved in public service to his community. 
Lorne had a solution to that problem. 
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
He was an alderman for the city of Prince George from 1973 to 1977. 
His integrity and devotion to work were an example to all. 
Lorne made in his career and in his life many friends and acquaintances. 
Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):
He had been elected in 1979.  
That was more than a mission; it was a passion. 
He did not have national ambitions as he told us repeatedly. 
His sole ambition was to serve his constituents well. 
In that sense he had a rather unorthodox approach to the duties of an MP.  
He liked to say ``There are no government offices in my riding. 
I am the office for all the departments, by bringing services to my constituents''. 
He was passionately fond of meeting the people of his riding. 
He was a fervent supporter of Joe Clark. 
He leaves his four children and their children to mourn his passing. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
I learned a great deal from Lorne McCuish. 
He was elected in 1979 and I was elected in 1980. 
We shared a hallway. 
I spent many an evening with Lorne McCuish. 
I can recall countless evenings in Vancouver. 
As others have indicated, I remember Lorne as a very humourous individual. 
He always wanted to play a joke. 
He told me a secret. 
He would say things like that continuously. 
He was a man of great humour.  
I was talking with him one day about doing constituency work. 
He was a very approachable individual. 
We got in a little trout fishing at the same time.  
He knew every single person by name. 
He was very popular and popular for an interesting reason. 
I had not met anybody like that. 
It was very refreshing. 
I can think of a great number of things I learned from Lorne McCuish. 
On top of that he was a very genuine, nice person. 
He often spoke of his family very warmly. 
I know he wanted to spend more time with his family. 
A lot of people just say that. 
We remember him fondly. 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Wild Rose.  
Canada is a nation blessed with natural wonders. 
In this case I see some merit in the establishment of the parks agency. 
It belongs to them.  
A parks agency is one such proposal, although we do have some reservations on this. 
Because of these reasons, national parks are very dear to me. 
This is why this is very dear to me.  
It saddens me when I see that happening. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
At first glance there are a few positive aspects to this bill.  
Second, the new agency will fall under the Access to Information Act. 
Obviously the government felt that more power must be kept within the cabinet.  
Fourth, the agency will be more efficient. 
This is one amendment that should have passed. 
I wish it had passed.  
The people of that area are not happy. 
Seniors groups are extremely unhappy.  
Tourists from all over the world have noticed a big increase in fees.  
All of this detail will not be known until the agency is set up. 
I believe that detail should be taken care of prior to that happening.  
These immigrants come to Banff. 
Probably nine out of every ten are of oriental background. 
There are numerous people who want to make that area their home. 
They are immigrants and they speak neither French nor English.  
They want to work there. 
How ridiculous are we going to get in this parliament? 
A number of people out there do not speak French. 
There are number of people who do not speak English. 
I think of the days when I was on the farm. 
Immigrants continually come to this country. 
Many settle in the west. 
Many of them land in Banff National Park. 
What kind of mentality would come up with that kind of regulation? 
When is this government going to come to its senses? 
Is that not so? 
They have to be bilingual.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
If so, how would he preserve our parks? 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question.  
But the government squanders money on areas like bilingualism. 
Those who are not bilingual will be totally confused and very upset. 
That is why they were attracted to the mountains and to the parks. 
But this legislation will prevent that from happening.  
They do not know what they are talking about. 
I live in that country. 
I congratulate those members on their big blunder.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
We already have official bilingualism in the House. 
Mr. Speaker, I could not agree more. 
The hon. member is right about one thing. 
There are some old animals in this House.  
They are getting tired of it.  
The Liberal members should shake their heads and wake up.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I really enjoy listening to my friend from Wild Rose. 
Mr. Speaker, that is a brilliant question. 
Is the House ready for the question?  
The question is on the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
This legislation will transfer powers to the new Nunavut assembly. 
Should the people who represent the people of Nunavut be appointed or elected?  
We have asked for that repeatedly. 
I implore him to do that.  
For decades we have created an institutionalized welfare state. 
We have circumvented that by creating a separate act for a separate group of people. 
Integration will enable them to become integrated, functional members of Canadian society.  
The community is stronger. 
Individuals have a sense of community. 
We in the House are members of different ethnic groups. 
We would suffer from sexual abuse and violence. 
Our communities would be in tatters. 
As a result the society the person lives in would be eroded as well.  
The situation on some reserves is appalling. 
It is alleged that those moneys are being taken by members of the reserves.  
What should that woman do? 
Such people are caught between a rock and a hard place.  
This is not uncommon. 
They come to me. 
I go to the minister. 
The Canadian taxpayer would be completely appalled by that.  
We are pursuing a course that will balkanize our country. 
What has been the outcome? 
I have worked in emergency rooms and visited aboriginal reserves. 
The unemployment rate can be 50% or higher. 
The incidence of diabetes is three times higher than that for non-aboriginals. 
The tuberculosis rate approaches third world levels. 
Does it not realize that will only fail? 
What is so wrong with that? 
Will the moneys be generated there? 
Aboriginal people want their culture and language to be preserved. 
They want to be able to work. 
That is the objective we should have. 
Furthermore, it is simply not necessary that this occurs.  
We have to change our attitude. 
We have to move forward and look forward. 
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
I am very disappointed in my colleague. 
I am not sure how much he knows about the bill. 
I was in Nunavut two weeks ago today. 
The weather was a little colder than here. 
Much of what he says is quite true. 
I do not suppose he is going to admit that.  
That is what this act does. 
That is what the department has been working toward. 
I would like the member to acknowledge that.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for the question. 
Who will pay for the development of Nunavut? 
Who will pay for its establishment and bureaucracy? 
Where is the accountability?  
Aboriginal people want to be masters of their own destiny. 
As a result, we have created an institutionalized welfare state. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Last night I found myself in a very difficult situation. 
I would love to have supported the Reform amendment last night.  
They should not decline the progress of a very important bill. 
That is not constructive politics.  
They have the ability to work. 
They have the ability to earn money. 
They have the ability to take care of themselves and their families. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member from the NDP asks some very good questions. 
We omitted petitions this morning. 
These petitions deal with the repeal of Bill C-68. 
I would like to get consent to take a minute to present them. 
There are quite a number of petitions.  
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Canadians are really sick to death of this. 
It is very important that we engage Canadians in this debate. 
The member understands that well. 
I certainly understand it well. 
In effect it does create a new province in everything but name.  
That is right in the constitution. 
Did it take a week? 
Let us consider for a moment what this bill does. 
I am sure my hon. friend from the Progressive Conservative Party would be interested. 
I hope he is listening.  
This is it, it will never happen again. 
Where are we now? 
It is likely to happen here as well.  
There is $300 million to implement Nunavut. 
Can you get any more ridiculous than that. 
It is going to create a legislature. 
All those buildings are going to be somewhere, probably in Yellowknife. 
Why have they done it?  
That is really what this is.  
That department has had a demonstrated track record of failure for over three decades. 
This department has no interest in the truth. 
It is the simple things. 
No private property rights are in there.  
We do have as a foundation to our economy the notion of private property rights. 
We do follow that in most areas of the country.  
There is not the right to private property on reserves. 
That is a huge impediment for aboriginal people. 
They cannot mortgage their property. 
They do not own their property. 
They do not own their own house.  
That does not happen in aboriginal communities.  
A person cannot open a grocery store or a corner store. 
I have a simple question. 
I would like to know the answer to that.  
We would like to see more careful husbandry of scarce resources.  
In the last election we sent 60 members to this place.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
What he wants to do is to elect a senator from Nunavut. 
We have been stuck with an appointed Senate for a long time. 
How do we put a round post into a square hole?  
New Brunswick and Nova Scotia have between them 20 senators. 
We have 24 in the four western provinces. 
Are we not better off trying to abolish the Senate? 
I would be very interested in knowing how he would square that circle.  
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. 
The member is being honest in his question. 
He honestly believes in what he is putting forward, which is unlike the Liberals. 
They do not honestly believe most of what they say. 
They come in the House with these canned speeches and read them off. 
Half the time they do not even know what they are saying.  
It is like going to heaven for them. 
It is exactly like going to heaven. 
That is the only way I can describe it. 
It has no legitimacy whatsoever.  
Abolishing the Senate has an appeal to it. 
I agree we should get rid of it. 
It could be much more. 
It will be when Canadians decide it is time.  
One of the four pillars is democratic institutions being reformed.  
I ask him to stay tuned and he will see it happen.  
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
The Reform Party says that we have to listen to the grassroots people. 
This is what they want. 
They have also stated that they want to be able to make their own decisions. 
The member talked about the department of Indian affairs in Yellowknife. 
Yellowknife is not even in Nunavut. 
That is exactly what we are trying to get away from in creating Nunavut. 
We want to be able to make decisions because we know what the people need.  
He talked about the Senate. 
We already have a senator. 
I do not see why this has to be an issue with the Nunavut government. 
Who knows where we will be in 20 years? 
I am a little puzzled as to where the member is coming from. 
Perhaps he could answer that.  
The riding I represent has approximately three and a half times that population. 
What about the people who have to pay the bill? 
That is the crux of the issue.  
That does not add up. 
She cannot do that.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
He spoke for nearly two hours on the Senate. 
This legislative election will precede the installation of the legislative assembly on April 1, 1999. 
What will the purpose of this election be? 
Its purpose will be to elect people to represent the Nunavut Inuit. 
As many have said, 85% of Nunavut's population is Inuit. 
The Nunavut parliament will therefore be largely Inuit. 
The purpose of the election will be to make the legislative assembly operational.  
The bill will also allow the transfer of government services, and this is important. 
The Inuit are not covered by the Indian Act. 
Ottawa will no longer be in charge. 
This is very important.  
There is much talk locally of an extremely decentralized system. 
I shall be stating the clear position of the Bloc Quebecois on this. 
We have already called for the abolition of the Senate.  
The Bloc Quebecois' other reservation concerns the Senate. 
In the present context, I think that people must be treated fairly. 
Our position differs radically from that taken by the Reform Party.  
It is an institution that is costing us $50 million a year.  
Not only is our position clear; it is based on representativeness. 
When you mention senators to the people of Quebec, they are not interested. 
I repeat what I said earlier. 
We all wondered if he had the wrong bill. 
Today I must also correct my two colleagues who spoke earlier. 
That is not what it is all about. 
The Nisga'a were claiming a huge territory. 
They settled for 7% of their claim. 
Then he told us that the territory will leave Canada. 
That is not the case at all, either. 
To my knowledge, Nunavut will still be Canadian territory. 
It will still belong to Canada. 
I find this particularly regrettable.  
It is also a vote of confidence in the aboriginal peoples. 
That is not our approach. 
They had legal, political and financial systems. 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciated the remarks of the member for Saint-Jean. 
He is familiar with the Inuit situation.  
The people in the south are always questioning the financial support they are given.  
So that means the cost of living is really four times greater. 
These people have only half our income as well.  
I think we must get to the bottom of this. 
It is part of economic development. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
I have a great deal of interest in this debate. 
I am not interested in the term Balkanization. 
I think it is time to quickly summarize what this debate is about. 
This process was initiated in the 1960s. 
It has been a long process and it has been a long debate. 
Some of those early participants are still here.  
The official language will be Inuktitut.  
We made some changes. 
These are the specifics of the bill. 
These are the nuts and bolts of what we are talking about here. 
This is an historic event in the development of our country. 
Nunavut will encompass 2,242,000 square kilometres. 
This is not one huge land claim.  
I have listened to comments today. 
How much have we taken from Yukon? 
How much have we taken from the NWT? 
How much have we taken in taxation dollars? 
How much has been contributed? 
We are talking about maturity here. 
We are talking about the maturity of a nation. 
We are talking about having three territories. 
I think it is an historic occasion and a wonderful event.  
On those words I take my seat and I hope the filibustering has stopped.  
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
There is a senator from Nunavut, Senator Willie Adams, in the other place. 
He was appointed in 1977. 
He was not appointed by the present Prime Minister. 
There is a Yukon senator, Senator Lucier. 
I am not prepared to be quite so gentle. 
We have tried scrapping the Indian Act on more than one occasion. 
We tried to scrap it two years ago. 
The aboriginal community do not want to scrap it.  
That is what this act is about.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Oxford for his question.  
That is an important statement they will be able to make when this is over.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Does the member have unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Unanimous consent is not forthcoming.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on the same point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That is not a point of order.  
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
(Bill read the third time and passed) 
LIEUTENANT COLONEL WILLIAM BARKER 
Unfortunately this bill was not made votable. 
First I thank the members who will be speaking on behalf of this motion today.  
This review was on the book written by Wayne Ralph called Barker VC:
William Barker, Canada's Most Decorated War Hero which was released this past fall.  
Is that not appropriate when we talk about Lieutenant Colonel Barker, VC? 
This has been a personal project of mine since 1996. 
Yet we are not familiar with his name.  
I wrote to the historic sites and monuments board. 
I received a negative response from the executive secretary, Mr. Friend. 
Unfortunately no one on the side of government took an interest.  
He is a household name in England but not in his own country.  
Yet no one seems to know who Lieutenant Colonel William Barker is.  
That is a fair question.  
Barker seemed to shun publicity about himself and his exploits. 
There are no known definitive biographies of him or even of the RCAF. 
Each victory spurred him on to new goals. 
However, once out of the cockpit he seemed more withdrawn, sombre and reserved. 
As the squadron commander, Barker was always concerned about his charges. 
He was anxious to teach them the combat tactics that would enable them to survive. 
Few airmen have left such a legacy.  
Mr. Warren raises this question: ``Somebody out there help me explain''. 
Government after government has forgotten his contribution.  
We are a relatively young nation. 
As a young nation matures we need to recognize and learn from our history. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
There is not unanimous consent.  
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
Again, for that, I think the member deserves congratulations.  
The book struck me as portraying a very sad story. 
However, tragically, after the war he ended up having some personal problems. 
The Americans have popularized their heroes over the years. 
We do not have that in Canada. 
What was Lieutenant Colonel Barker's record during the first world war? 
The hon. member mentioned 58. 
He lost consciousness after this and his machine fell out of control. 
However, he has been all but forgotten.  
I think this nation must in some manner commemorate his name. 
Mr. Maurice Godin (Chateauguay, BQ):
We agree in principle, but all the facts must surely be checked. 
Surely, he deserves recognition by future generations.  
I do not doubt the facts, but personally I cannot verify them. 
These are a testimony to its dedication to educating the public. 
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
Billy Barker was born in Dauphin, Manitoba. 
He died in Ottawa on March 12, 1930. 
He was a cohort of Billy Bishop. 
We have many heroes today in the military.  
We have to be aware of them also when we are talking about recognizing heroes.  
How do we recognize our heroes? 
I again say that we have to recognize people in the here and now. 
They are heroes of the here and now. 
As well let us remember by example Billy Barker in the present.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I remind the House that this is Canada. 
I welcome the opportunity to speak to the motion. 
I appreciate why the member for Dauphin-Swan River wants to celebrate a local hero. 
They were legends in their own time. 
It was a different era. 
It was the last era of military chivalry. 
The best knights of the air were Canadian pilots Billy Bishop and Billy Barker.  
I have read the autobiography of Billy Bishop. 
Certainly that was the case with the fighter pilots of the first world war.  
They describe the struggles these two men had. 
I will digress for a minute. 
There is a ride available on a Stearman biplane. 
For $40 one can fly over Ottawa.  
We flew over the parliament buildings and over the river. 
We could see what inspired those Canadian pilots of so many years ago. 
I agree with the member. 
It does not matter a fig what Billy Barker did after the war. 
It does not matter a fig what Billy Bishop did after the war. 
They were heroes during the war. 
They were heroes who were admired the world over. 
I hope the minister is listening to this. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Memorials are an important means by which we learn about and remember our history. 
Will never let him down.  
But Barker wanted to fly the plane.  
On February 14 Barker was graded a flying officer.  
The normal time for ground training alone was six weeks. 
No flyer died under his command.  
I liked him, more than liked him, I practically adored him''. 
The closing paragraphs of Wayne Ralph's Barker VC go as follows: 
It took us 19 years to put up a national war memorial. 
Outside of Canada, however, he is still remembered. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Dauphin-Swan River has the last five minutes. 
If he speaks, that is it. 
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
The point was brought up that other people have been discounted. 
That is not the intent of this motion. 
I would welcome an amendment to include all air aces. 
I have no problem with that whatsoever.  
We had almost thrown that out the window as well in terms of history.  
Lieutenant Colonel William Barker played a large part in Canadian history. 
His name is Dr. George MacKay from Oxford county in Ontario. 
He had a huge influence in the development of that country. 
Does anybody in this country know who he is? 
The regional airport was dedicated and renamed in his honour. 
I really do not want to take up much more time. 
This is long overdue. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In order to have a motion moved, it would be moved on debate. 
He will be finished within 30 seconds to one minute.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Unanimous consent is not forthcoming.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
There is a new math in Canada. 
It is the math of mergers. 
It is not the math we learned when I went to school. 
Here is what it adds up to for the people in my riding.  
Lesson number one in the math of mergers is bank branches. 
The Royal Bank has nine branches in Regina and the Bank of Montreal has eight. 
Will the new bank really keep 17 branches in Regina open? 
Will the second megabank really keep 16 branches open? 
These are the questions people are asking. 
When some of those branches close, jobs will go with them.  
Lesson number two in the math of mergers is executive's salaries. 
Once the mergers are approved, the tellers lose their jobs.  
Lesson number three in the math of mergers is bank profits. 
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
The government is concerned about the level of competition in the financial services sector. 
The hon. member has the opportunity to participate in that debate.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
This was not a case. 
He is saying it has actually increased his business.  
The minister also wrote me a letter. 
Amazingly enough, I received it today. 
It is dated May 25 but it arrived today. 
Yet this man is allowed to continue doing his business. 
That is because there is no regulatory body.  
The near future is not good enough. 
We have been looking at the near future in this department for years and years. 
Innocent people are coming to Canada. 
The federal government immigration office is in downtown Vancouver. 
We all know he is not in business for free.  
They get sucked into this man's office. 
He sucks them in. 
He finds out where their money is and he is making lots of money. 
It is time the minister acted.  
I think that is pretty clear. 
This is what the department is attempting to do as we speak.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Some 5.2 million Canadians are living below the poverty line. 
It eliminates the benefit to families on welfare. 
It is not indexed. 
It has more to do with keeping wages low and unemployment high.  
We need a fair taxation system. 
We need proper income distribution. 
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
This is the basis for the national child benefit system.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 7.16 p.m.)
