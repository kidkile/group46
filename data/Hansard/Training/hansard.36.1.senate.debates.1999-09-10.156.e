Friday, September 10, 1999 
The Senate met at 9:00 a.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Sixtieth Anniversary of Canada's Entry into World War II 
Hon. Norman K. Atkins :
Canada's military was small at the outset of war. 
The Canadian Army permanent force had 4,200 men backed up by 51,000 militia. 
It was to be a war of great sacrifice. 
Victory, in the end, was our only choice, our only option. 
Canadian soldiers liberated Holland. 
The Canadian Francophonie Games 
The Department of Canadian Heritage made a major contribution to the games. 
Changes Under New Government 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, Nigeria is open for business again. 
More than 100 senior Armed Forces officers have been retired. 
Honourable senators, they are vast. 
But what about Africa? 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
Investigation into Sale of Airbus Aircraft to Air Canada-Notice of Inquiry 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
...your client is not affected...";  
Public Sector Pension Investment Board Bill 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, my question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
The preparations for this national caucus have been in progress for a year now. 
It is a major policy gathering for the opposition side.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I will have consultations with the Minister of Transport. 
I shall do so and I shall make every effort to accommodate the chamber.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The industry has been in difficulty for some time.  
As I understand it, the main concerns around the 10-per-cent rule were two. 
Honourable senators, it is that phrase "responsible groups" that concerns me. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
What is being hidden?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The seventh day would be Wednesday next. 
I shall attempt to table the document as soon as possible. 
Senator Kinsella first raised the question yesterday. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
There is difficulty in the airline industry. 
A proposal has been made by Onex in this particular instance. 
Honourable senators, I sympathize with the minister's travel difficulties. 
My question has nothing to do with that. 
Take Canada's side.  
We should all take Canada's side in the end. 
At one time, the precursor to Canadian Airlines, Pacific Western, was financially healthy. 
It was a regional airline. 
They purchased Canadian Pacific and stayed healthy. 
As a result, that airline has had problems ever since.  
We now have a proposal to merge the two airlines. 
Canadian Airlines is heavily debt-laden. 
Air Canada is operating in a profit position, albeit a slim one. 
It is a relatively healthy business in an industry which is very tough. 
Would the minister care to comment?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, we are dealing here with private industry. 
It was the decision of the government several years ago to privatize Air Canada. 
I understand that the new company is to be known as Air Canada. 
With American borrowed money.  
AMR would own 14.9 per cent and public shareholders will own 54 per cent.  
You have just made the west feel wonderful.  
Air Canada wants to let the market play. 
If Canadian Airlines survives, it survives; if it does not, then it does not. 
Honourable senators, we cannot have it both ways. 
This is the market system at work and Onex has made a bid. 
It is not for me to debate the bid. 
We can debate how the government should intervene at the appropriate time. 
I think he is speaking on both sides, too. 
In 1956, Air Canada's headquarters were in Winnipeg. 
The Liberals appointed a president for Air Canada from Montreal. 
What happened to the headquarters of Air Canada? 
It went to Montreal.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I certainly have not met with Mr. Schwartz.  
I would make just a few comments, honourable senators. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The honourable senator made reference to Mr. Schwartz being associated with the Liberal Party. 
They hired Bill Fox.  
However, when I ask the question, there are different standards.  
I will ask that question again. 
Honourable senators, I do not know of any assurances that were given to anyone. 
It is the market-place at work.  
Honourable senators, presently they are compelled to have the headquarters in Montreal. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, as senators from Quebec, we have some very major concerns. 
In my view, this was a big mistake. 
History will bear this out and you will see changes. 
Other bases could have been closed in Quebec in order to maintain Canadian unity.  
This is an urgent matter. 
We will be adjourning in a few days.  
We are entitled to be vigilant.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I am quite sensitive to cut-backs. 
It is a tough fight.  
I have a supplementary.  
Hon. Jean-Claude Rivest :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I thank the honourable senator for raising this question again. 
I do not believe my honourable friend was present in the chamber at the time. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I would like to introduce to you some distinguished visitors in the gallery. 
We are welcoming a delegation of the Canada-France Inter-Parliamentary Association. 
On behalf of all senators, I welcome them to the Senate of Canada.  
Public Sector Pension Investment Board Bill 
Third Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
This provision was originally motivated by the existence of children in common-law unions. 
In dissent, Mr. Justice Gonthier said, at paragraph 155: 
Plainly, this appeal raises elemental social and legal issues. 
The majority's decision makes further claims not only foreseeable, but very likely.  
Justice Gonthier's dissenting opinion is very important. 
He condemned Justice Iacobucci's paragraph 135, where Iacobucci said: 
The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary defines "conjugal" as: 
That same dictionary then defines the word "conjugate," then "conjugation." 
It defines the word "conjugation" in grammar, botany, mathematics, physics, chemistry and in biology. 
In biology, conjugation means genetic recombination, a recombination of genetic material. 
Conjugation is a mixing of genetic material. 
Such genetic mixing invariably produces offspring in the human species, called issue. 
This is the process of genetic recombination. 
It is a recombination of genetic materials from both a man and a woman.  
The two homosexuals, as the prefix homo dictates, belong to the same mating type. 
Legislating in this way demeans homosexual persons. 
It is subversive and, I would say, corrupting of constitutionalism itself.  
Justice Gonthier did predict a raft of claims. 
She stated, at page 611: 
Is this a good marker? 
The government then changed as a result of the election in 1995. 
Honourable senators, that is a political statement. 
She said at page 619: 
This is political, not legal, reasoning. 
Honourable senators, these profoundly political statements abound. 
Studied empirical research on this point is scarce. 
My research revealed one study.  
Hon. Fernand Robichaud (The Hon. the Acting Speaker) :
Is it agreed that Senator Cools shall continue?  
Entitlements accrue from personal, social and formal commitments to relationships, not from sexual activity. 
Rights and obligations are not determined carnally. 
They are determined in mutual-commitment responsibility and time-based formalism. 
We owe this to future generations and to all our progeny.  
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Honourable Senator Cools. 
I know Senator Cools has done a significant amount of research on this question.  
Can that person claim an entitlement to a portion of the pension of the deceased? 
Has Senator Cools done any research on what would happen in that instance?  
I thank Senator Tkachuk for his question. 
That is why I cited the particular quotation from Madam Justice Gloria Epstein. 
These are profound questions. 
I often inquired about the meaning of "conjugal relationship." 
I agree that it is a mess and it will continue to be a mess. 
That is your language, not mine. 
The entire issue is very complicated. 
Divorce is an issue which I have more fully studied. 
We are talking here about foundational notions of society. 
What is a man? 
What is a woman? 
What is a marriage, and what is not? 
The issue has been advancing by stealth. 
That is my fear.  
Hon. James F. Kelleher :
Eaton's has been on and off the ropes for the past decade. 
It could not simply dip into the account. 
The federal government, of course, is not subject to any kind of regulatory test.  
The plan sponsors had to make up the deficit. 
It said, "We do not care."  
It does not matter what risks have been assumed. 
Far be it for me to malign the legal profession. 
I know Senator Kirby will be happy to hear that. 
Funds are set aside that the employer cannot touch. 
Here, again, honourable senators, we have a double standard.  
This government's plans are a matter of benevolence, not a matter of trust. 
Its surplus results from market investments that have exceeded actuarial requirement. 
CMHC is acting in accordance with the Pension Benefits Standards Act. 
One also must wonder about what will happen in the government's other Crown corporations. 
Are they also in surplus? 
Will they also be paying out the surplus? 
Will the employees benefit from a premium holiday? 
In other words, is CMHC just the tip of the iceberg?  
This, honourable senators, is not fair.  
Hon. James F. Kelleher :
Honourable senators, this bill is far from perfect. 
We have heard this again and again, both in committee and in this place. 
Hon. Michael A. Meighen :
I second that motion.  
I will repeat my motion. 
I move, seconded by Senator Meighen: 
(a) on page 74, by deleting clause 94; 
(b) on page 75, by deleting lines 1 to 48; 
(c) on page 76, by deleting lines 1 to 14; 
(d) on page 127, by deleting clause 150; 
(e) on page 128, by deleting lines 30 to 48; 
(f) on page 129, by deleting lines 1 to 47; 
(g) on pages 177 and 178, by deleting clause 197; 
(h) on page 179, by deleting lines 1 to 48; 
(i) on page 180, by deleting lines 1 to 19; 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion in amendment?  
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
He stated, and I quote: 
...the bill does not create an entitlement. 
The government believes it is entitled to the surplus. 
That was not the end of the injustices, however. 
In February 1995, that court ruled in favour of the former employees. 
However, this is nothing new. 
Honourable senators, in these situations the government always seeks to protect workers. 
This legislation was also a get-tough move. 
I would say to you that the federal government has contracts. 
The Supreme Court therefore agrees with the Appeal Court ruling.  
Hon. Pierre De Bane :
Yes, it is in agreement. 
I do not need the honourable senator to tell me that.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I am sorry, but that is not a point of order. 
You will be able to make this point after Senator Nolin's speech.  
He stated as follows: 
We are anxiously awaiting the answers to these questions.  
Unfortunately, this is not how things work. 
The Supreme Court may refuse to hear a case for a number of reasons. 
The number of hearings is limited to 125 per year. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those in favour of the motion in amendment please say "yea"?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those opposed to the motion in amendment please say "nay"?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
In my opinion, the "nays" have it.  
And two honourable senators having risen.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The whips have agreed on a half-hour bell. 
The vote will take place at 25 minutes after eleven o'clock.  
Motion in amendment negatived on the following division: 
On motion of Senator Christensen, debate adjourned.  
Canadian Environmental Protection Bill, 1999 
Third Reading-Motion in Amendment-Vote Deferred 
There certainly has been plenty of time to discuss the issue.  
On the other hand, senators opposite do have a point. 
It was first passed in 1988. 
Thus, it is always a moving target.  
Different environmental groups found that the bill did not go far enough. 
After all, these are organizations which depend upon charitable donations to fund themselves. 
This is a difficult and multi-faceted bill. 
It has 356 clauses and four annexes. 
It was 11 years in the making. 
It does not take much for a critic to find some faults with it. 
He was a little fed up with having nothing to do. 
Someone asked him why, to which he replied: 
Nothing could be more apt when talking about the environment. 
Its margin fades forever and for ever as you move.  
Clauses on equivalency have been tightened up. 
The precautionary principle was also tightened up. 
Measures for consulting with provincial and territorial governments have been tightened up. 
The bill also tightens up environmental emergency plans. 
Consequently, cost effectiveness measures have been introduced in this bill.  
They now have that by virtue of this bill.  
I have mentioned cost effectiveness. 
That was not the aim of cost effectiveness in this bill. 
I will take a simple example like sulphur. 
The new bill also introduces the concept of virtual elimination. 
How do you know you can reduce it to zero? 
However, that is a side argument.  
However, we have found a number of problems in biotechnology.  
That was a result we had not perceived.  
There was another problem that we heard about. 
It was killing the butterflies. 
As you can see, we have some issues looming on the horizon. 
I do not pretend to be an expert on it.  
Would the honourable senator entertain questions?  
Is that what he said?  
I think the honourable senator abbreviated my comments a bit. 
Could he just correct that?  
Was it the Sierra Club, or other groups? 
In my personal opinion, they were exaggerating.  
Is that the view of the government?  
I do not know the view of the government. 
The government position is that they listen to all groups, environmental and industrial groups. 
That is what we did. 
I am merely remarking on the evidence which was heard. 
No, but they will.  
They used to donate more to the Tories than to the Liberals. 
This is a kind of win-win situation:
This is a fund-raiser.  
You also say that the environmentalists exaggerated their claims in order to raise money. 
This is a heck of a way to run a government. 
It seems Senator Tkachuk has answered his own question. 
Both sides exaggerated their claims in order to maximize their position in society. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, the time period for this speech has expired.  
Bill C-32 offers that challenge and that hope.  
They emphasized the importance of our work in this chamber. 
These are difficult observations for me to make in this chamber. 
I very much believe in the importance of the Senate. 
I respect the tremendous talent and wisdom that are so evident here. 
Southern Canada could be next.  
No amendments were forthcoming. 
We debated Senator Nolin's amendment which would have allowed for such involvement. 
All the Liberals voted against the amendment. 
In committee, Senator Nolin proposed an amendment to allow for such involvement. 
Every Liberal voted against the amendment.  
I affix no blame or criticism to my friends Senator Adams or Senator Chalifoux. 
They are committed, wonderful, dedicated, honourable senators. 
It is the system that is wrong. 
It is the partisanship that is our failing. 
How unfortunate and tragic for the people of Canada. 
Clause-by-clause examination alone in the House committee took 93 hours. 
Approximately 90 of the amendments were moved by Liberal members.  
The answer, of course, would be conjecture. 
That is okay; and so they should. 
Nevertheless, what industry sought, industry got from the Prime Minister. 
What was it that industry sought and got?  
The lawyers will have a field day in determining what is meant by "cost effective." 
The lawyers will have a field day. 
The ambiguity is obvious, and that is what some want.  
Comments made from Liberal senators confirmed that position. 
They were invited to appear, and were planning to do so. 
What a mockery of our committee system. 
What an insult to the Senate. 
It was legislation by exhaustion. 
We are not happy with the bill. 
It has many flaws, but let's get on with it. 
It has taken too much of our time already. 
If necessary, we can live with the 1988 bill."  
What does that tell us?  
We were told that we are better off with the existing bill. 
In the view of the Canadian Health Coalition, and I quote: 
Then he said the following, which I found quite amazing: 
That was a first from that man's point of view.  
He says, in conclusion: 
What a statement to make, honourable senators. 
They tell us that we should not hold the bill over.  
It took 11 years to review the 1988 bill. 
This side is honestly suggesting that we should do it here. 
What are we about? 
Why not let the Senate of Canada do its work? 
The government is completely failing Canadians.  
Under the heading "Balanced Policies for Jobs and Growth:
The Greening of Industry," the Liberal Party of Canada in 1993 said the following: 
This approach has had only limited success. 
Timetables must be set for phasing out all use of the most persistent toxic substances.  
Oh, if it were only so. Oh, if it were in this legislation. 
We were denied that opportunity in committee. 
Honourable senators, I move, seconded by the Honourable Senator Cochrane: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Senator Taylor, do you wish to speak to the motion?  
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
No, I simply wish to ask a question.  
What is the point?  
At that time, there was a different understanding as to what was happening. 
They did not know that the Senate would be emasculated as it has been.  
No, they did not.  
Again, that is not the case. 
After those amendments were moved, the public hearings were over. 
No witnesses were able to speak to those amendments.  
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
No, they were members of the Liberal Party, Senator Di Nino.  
Honourable senators, I should like to speak to Senator Ghitter's motion. 
I listened carefully to Senator Ghitter. 
I leave it to you, honourable senators, to envisage something that is that bad. 
As I recall, there was a Liberal majority in opposition. 
I chaired the same committee that Senator Ghitter chairs now. 
We heard from the extreme reaches of position from industry and environmental groups.  
I will refer to that in the body of my comments.  
The history of the bill has been referred to. 
It is long and complex. 
We received written briefs from many people. 
We had a number of concerns relating to the bill. 
I should like to address some of the major concerns that were raised. 
The bill thus codifies what the ministers have been doing for years.  
The decision was a tight one, however: five judges to four. 
Bill C-32 confirms that principle. 
I have trouble with this broad proposition. 
It is also the approach taken in the existing CEPA.  
Bill C-32 retains this approach. 
It would preclude action under CEPA where another statute applied.  
The current CEPA is totally silent on these matters. 
I do not share this concern. 
The Governor in Council will thus be responsible for making the determination. 
It is an approach which I can support.  
Senator Taylor has also alluded to them. 
It is an important issue. 
A related concern had to do with the wording of clause 65(3). 
The previous version stated "when taking steps to achieve virtual elimination...," 
The fundamental aspect has not changed. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
May I have leave to continue, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
A further area of concern relates to the aboriginal peoples. 
The key is the negotiation of self-government agreements. 
I am sure that Senator Chalifoux will be expanding on this matter further.  
It would seem unlikely that the bill could derogate from this constitutional imperative. 
- and I emphasize the word "cost" - 
- measures to prevent environmental degradation...  
Opinions are diametrically opposed on this issue. 
It is doubtful that consensus could ever be reached. 
It is also a definition that is widely accepted within the international community.  
I have come to the conclusion that it is not. 
Senator Nolin may argue the opposite. 
I have checked whether governments have remedied those discrepancies. 
I am told that at least 25 of the 30 have been remedied. 
As honourable senators know, there is always room for improvement. 
The bill would provide specific authority to deal with environmental emergencies.  
I could go on; however, I will not. 
I appreciate the opportunity to have done so this afternoon.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those honourable senators in favour of the motion in amendment please say "yea"?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those honourable senators opposed to the motion in amendment please say "nay"?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
In my opinion, the "nays" have it.  
And two honourable senators having risen.

Business of the Senate 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is that agreed, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I thank Senator Kenny for bringing the matter to the attention of the house. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
The Senate adjourned until Monday, September 13, 1999, at 4 p.m.
