The House met at 10 a.m. 
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1999 
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, we will respond today to Questions Nos. 170 and 172. 
Question No. 170- Mr. Guy St-Julien: 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Question No. 172- Mr. Howard Hilstrom: 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
REQUEST FOR EMERGENCY DEBATE 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
I speak here of foreign subsidies that drive commodity prices down.  
Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak to the application for an emergency debate.  
In the circumstances the Chair has considered the hon. member's request. 
ALLOTTED DAY-CRIMINAL JUSTICE 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
That was stated by a law professor who is well respected in Canada. 
It is not the Reform Party saying that. 
This should not come as a surprise to the government. 
We all know by now that a ten year sentence really means three years. 
I think members get the picture. 
It is like winning the lottery.  
There is no compelling initiative in the Criminal Code to deal with them.  
Petty criminals need not apply. 
This is reserved for the truly heinous.  
It is a litany of indignity, abuse of the system and no retribution.  
Allow me to begin with the issue of child pornography.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The motion before the House has to do with the defence of provocation. 
We are now talking about child pornography. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank you for that. 
Some may argue that the judgment may not always mean justice. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am not dealing with relevance. 
I ask our Chair to direct his attention to that.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
You just referred to temperance. 
He referred to our country, Canada, as this bloody country.  
He seems to have disappeared for the moment. 
Perhaps the hon. member would refrain from using such intemperate language in the House. 
There is an appeal going on. 
I am not trying to influence it. 
I am talking about a case that happened and he knows that. 
It is quite legitimate.  
They have no shame left at all. 
Decisions are not made to go into a void. 
There is a fallout and there are long term consequences.  
In British Columbia there have been two very real consequences. 
For now it is open season for pedophiles in British Columbia.  
Four had the resolve and did what they said they would do.  
There are some glaring omissions and some glaring shortcomings to this act. 
I will identify some of those. 
This leaves a lot of violent and frightening offences out of the loop.  
The opting out provisions are also a concern for us. 
Simply put, there has to be universality in the provisions of the law, period. 
The announcement of $206 million is over a three year period. 
The parliamentary secretary said it is true. 
I will tell her it is an absolute lie. 
The hon. member will not want to start using that word. 
That is what everybody wants. 
We want them in the system. 
That is what this system is about in terms of 10 and 11 year olds.  
This government wants to put no money into it. 
You want to cane us.  
That is why we have problems in this country. 
It is just like the health program. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I think my hon. friend has made an error in his comment. 
He was suggesting that funding for health care was 50:50. 
Is he suggesting that the government is not holding up its end?  
I am afraid the hon. member knows that is not a point of order.  
In my province it is about 14%. 
In Ontario it is even less. 
It cannot take the heat.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope they will stop making these serious interruptions. 
I hope you are not taking this out of my time.  
It will be added on.  
Thank you very much, I appreciate it. 
Maybe now that they know that they will not get up as often.  
Let me now tell them about the attorney general in Ontario. 
Another friend of yours.  
The people I am talking about are respectable. 
They do not like this bill. 
It is a bad bill and should be changed. 
Hopefully we will do that in committee.  
It's a shame Ottawa refused to listen''.  
This is the Ontario government. 
I could go on for long. 
Conditional sentencing is a serious issue and needs to be addressed. 
One of my colleagues will talk in more detail about it.  
The whole issue in the justice system today is that this government is not listening. 
They still have not done it. 
They still do not have health care where it should be. 
It has served its time.  
What do those members do now? 
I have seven children and seven grandchildren. 
We need some changes in this law and we need them now. 
We need them and we need them bad.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
That was one of my favourites. 
Spanky and his gang was the term going around at that time. 
Reform is still advocating and promoting the whole idea of boot camps. 
And longer prison sentences. 
I would argue that there is no connection between those two things. 
That is a way to slow down property crimes. 
There are two different views for the same set of circumstances. 
The NDP would rather deal with the root causes of crime.  
She also killed the dog. 
That is why I put the motion before the committee. 
I will give the minister credit. 
The committee has not handled the problem.  
The SPCA would have created a big furore about it. 
Two gentlemen in Montreal were convicted of a brutal rape. 
That is what is wrong with conditional sentencing in this country. 
The committee knows that. 
We are the opposition. 
We point out the faults. 
My friend from the NDP talked about boot camps. 
The Liberals want to throw them all in jail. 
The Liberals want to put young people in jail. 
There have been two parliamentary reports on penitentiaries in this country. 
The other was done in 1987. 
We still have a rotten system and it is not working. 
I suggest that the member visit the one in Ontario.  
In my speech I did not get the chance to talk about prevention. 
There is no prevention. 
I agree with him. 
They are serious issues. 
We want to look at those issues too. 
The member talked about British Columbia and we have heard some discussion about Manitoba. 
Who put them there? 
That is the whole point and they do not understand. 
The system we have right now came from the Liberals and the Tories.  
We are talking about a system that works with young people in the system. 
Put some money into prevention. 
There is no money from the government for prevention. 
There is no money from these Liberals.  
The hon. member mentions 10%.  
The Liberals are the government. 
They are not making them. 
They try to blame their faults on the opposition. 
In this area it is not the opposition's fault. 
We have been offering good solutions. 
The motion itself is reflective of that. 
That is exactly the type of society they want to promote.  
I believe Canadians do not share that vision of our justice system. 
I believe Canadians believe in the due process of law. 
Those are all the things this side of the House also believes in. 
Today I would like to deal with one aspect of the motion. 
It also emphasizes prevention and rehabilitation. 
I think we all agree on that. 
Meaningful consequences is the number two priority. 
The way to accomplish this is to address the very causes of crime. 
We cannot wage this battle alone, however. 
This is a concern. 
I am sorry but the hon. parliamentary secretary's time has expired.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
How can we reconcile these two things with the parents' responsibility?  
Yes, Mr. Speaker, I believe my speech is very consistent in this regard. 
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
It is rather a phony, hollow play.  
Unfortunately that is not the case on the other side of the House. 
A justice committee did a consultation. 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
That is not the case. 
All systems need to be modernized and improved. 
It would be easy to intervene. 
It does not go as far as we would like. 
Then there is the victims element.  
There must be compliance with the Canadian Constitution as well. 
It sets out responsibilities. 
Perhaps it should set an example.  
The Young Offenders Act is something I take a great interest in. 
But I am afraid this is not about to happen. 
They are from Statistics Canada, which means they should be precise numbers. 
One should look at the actual figures before saying things that make no sense.  
We have excellent success rates for rehabilitation and reintegration into society.  
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
I understand that the opposition has to oppose. 
In this case, I am being told what Quebec's president of the bar said. 
Quebec's president of the bar represents his peers. 
I am a member of the bar, and therefore he must represent me. 
He is also supposed to represent his committee, which has examined the issue. 
Other members of this committee include Ms. Toutan, Me Bois and Me Trepanier. 
They will apparently sort this out among themselves. 
I will leave the Quebec bar to sort this out among themselves. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
I think there are improvements that can be made to the bill. 
We can therefore learn from them.  
These are issues we have to discuss and consider.  
One would have to ask what other use there would be. 
It is obviously for personal use.  
This is obviously an issue of concern because we are hearing it today. 
The parliamentary secretary ought not to take these criticisms personally. 
If it requires new legislation, so be it.  
There is also the issue of impaired driving. 
Perhaps we need to get a little tougher on them.  
The driver does not get it back under any circumstances. 
That will slow people down and make people think twice. 
On a personal basis, there is the issue of illegal immigration. 
This is something we have to take more seriously.  
They do not make enough money.  
They do not make enough money. 
We all have to be part of the solution. 
People look out for one another. 
If they see a suspicious character they call the police. 
This brings me back to the whole issue of adequate funding for our police forces. 
As a result Canada's security has suffered to a certain extent.  
Often we see justice being set aside for all kinds of spurious reasons. 
I want to make an appeal in my closing comments. 
Why do people break laws? 
I suspect there are two fundamental causes. 
One is people do goofy things. 
They are not criminals; they just do something stupid. 
I am not linking poverty and crime. 
Mr. Speaker, I listened to the member from Kamloops. 
I wonder if the member has some independent thoughts on them. 
I would like him to share them with the viewers and listeners. 
I have never actually seen a study that links those two statistics. 
Does the member from Kamloops want to make any comments in that regard?  
I thank my friend from Vancouver Island North. 
That is a positive aspect of this debate. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
We have to take necessary steps. 
We have to think about those little children.  
We will pass that expeditiously. 
I am sure all parties would move on that. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
I commend the hon. member who brought the multifacted issue before the House for debate. 
It touches on a number of very important subject areas.  
I am speaking of victims.  
There should have been an immediate response.  
In cases such as that one the public perception is very important. 
For justice to be done it must be seen to be done. 
This is an old legal maxim from the myths of antiquity. 
The law itself is not all bad. 
Those laws are there to protect people who choose to live that life.  
They have the right to feel safe in their homes. 
It is a very slippery slope when we begin to openly criticize our judiciary. 
It was from its own justice officials that this idea came forward. 
I believe there is a failing in that regard.  
It does not compensate for the amount of money that was taken out.  
The same can be said of our justice system. 
Mr. Clark, the leader of our party, has made this a priority. 
I am very pleased to have an opportunity to discuss these most important issues. 
This has been itemized as something of great priority in this country. 
We hope there will be further debate on these very important issues. 
We in the Progressive Conservative Party embrace the opportunity to participate in this debate.  
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed listening to my colleague from Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough. 
He made some comments about the RCMP training centre. 
That is a very high rate of attrition. 
We do not know where the government is going with all this.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the question. 
I know he has a personal interest in such matters.  
It is taking out more than there was in the system in the first place.  
I thank the hon. member for the question. 
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today. 
This person, according to the report, was unrepentant. 
He saw nothing wrong with what he did. 
It is unbelievable how our justice system serves up so much injustice. 
It is so out of whack.  
I mention that because it shocked me. 
Impaired driving is a very serious crime. 
The property and causality claims are billions of dollars. 
The victims of impaired driving deserve no less.  
There are a number of steps we can take. 
Something is wrong with that picture.  
I hope it does not let Canadians down once again.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to my colleague from Prince George.  
Mr. Richard M. Harris:
Nothing less than serious jail time is appropriate in that case.  
Because I don't want to see him back here again''. 
I congratulate that judge.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Richard M. Harris:
If my voice fails me at some point during the speech members will understand why. 
Over the weekend I lost my voice completely. 
That is the parliament immediately preceding the one that is under way at present. 
It has been four years since we first raised this very serious issue. 
We might even have some reason to be cynical about it.  
Conditional sentencing was meant to cut costs. 
The trauma one feels from an unjust sentence is immeasurable. 
I am sure one feels victimized all over again. 
The societal costs of conditional sentencing are mounting. 
It is my firm belief that without proper punishment there is no deterrent.  
The judge thought that this was part of their culture.  
That is absolutely appalling. 
Also in Ottawa, Robert Turcotte strangled his mother to death. 
Pay close attention to this one. 
it could have done so in clear language''.  
It is my contention that Canadian courts are already bogged down. 
We should not be using the courts to appeal these types of sentences. 
Motion No. 577 is currently on the Order Paper and reads: 
It would address a serious inadequacy in our present law.  
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, let me deal with the contradictions.  
Who is more mistrusted by the Reform Party than legislators?  
We cannot win with the Reform Party. 
The Reform Party does not trust the judges. 
It does not trust the prosecutors. 
It does not trust the defence lawyers. 
Whom will they turn to? 
In all their presentations they denigrate everyone in every part of the chain. 
Canadians understand this talk from the Reform Party. 
It really is grating on members of the governing party. 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member did not fail us again did he? 
Why does the hon. member not address the question?  
Yes, we do not trust certain legislators. 
We do not trust this Liberal government. 
Who do you trust?  
We are the official opposition. 
I would hope that our comments are grating on the Liberal government. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time.  
A number of people have forgotten that the federal government enacts laws. 
The focus thus far has been on the federal government. 
The federal government is not alone. 
I am not sure they are clear. 
If that is the case, what nonsense. 
It simplifies the shallow thinking that often goes into these kinds of debates. 
There is no thinking it through. 
It is a little more complex than laws.  
This change is about children and we have to be particularly sensitive to it. 
We are committed to protecting them. 
I hear heckling on that point. 
I take it there is disagreement from the Reform Party.  
Let me highlight a few. 
The Government of Canada is committed to combating organized crime.  
This character is reflected in their collective wealth.  
Let us seize the proceeds of crime and all organized crime is destabilized.  
Let me now speak about victims of crime. 
We all know that is not enough. 
We will give them just that. 
I will conclude with these comments.  
What have the results been thus far? 
I simply want to encourage all colleagues to address the issues in a comprehensive way. 
It is not sufficient to say the laws are inadequate. 
Some are, no doubt. 
To simply say the federal government is responsible for all this is an irresponsible statement.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I listened very closely to the remarks of the hon. member. 
He has quite correctly pointed out that this is not about simplistic approaches. 
Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:
We acknowledge that other governments have made contributions. 
We have no difficulty in saying that.  
I applaud that because we do not often hear that. 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:
Mr. Speaker, that is my point. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:
Is it because the laws do not favour them? 
Is it because police officers treat them differently? 
Is it because the judges or prosecutors treat them differently? 
I do not have an answer to that question. 
It is a question that needs to be studied in a responsible way. 
It is not a simple answer that is required.  
In fact it deals with them inappropriately.  
It is something we ought to debate in the House. 
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism) (Status of Women), Lib.):
That is what that sweeping motion would have us believe.  
In 1997 it was the lowest rate since 1980. 
The rates for all violent crimes were down this year. 
It is not only done by enforcement.  
We need to look at the root causes of all societal problems. 
We need preventive measures to deal with those root causes. 
This is a wonderful word that political party likes to use. 
There is an issue of prevention. 
Let us not do that.  
How do we rehabilitate young offenders? 
We are talking about isolationist policy here and just talking about legislation. 
So let us just talk about legislation.  
The issue of child pornography was raised by hon. members opposite. 
That is part of the process. 
Let us see what the supreme court says. 
It can look at the legislation. 
We must be aware of it and do something about it. 
This is what good policy is all about. 
This is what a good justice system does. 
It looks at prevention, public education, legislation and enforcement.  
Does it really matter who that group trusts?  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
We also understand that a message has to be sent. 
The government has had tons of opportunity to bring forward good legislation. 
You talk about special interest groups and you talk about giving- 
The hon. member will please address his remarks through the Chair.  
My question is quite simple. 
We agree with her that there has to be rehabilitation. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The party across the way voted against it.  
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
Canadians have a great understanding.  
If that is the case, I am certainly very happy.  
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for her comments. 
I think she raises a very important point. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the minister talks about being selective. 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
There has been precious little in the way of justice coming from the government. 
I will be speaking primarily in the area of young offenders.  
The provinces had ample opportunity for input. 
The message as to what changes were necessary was absolutely clear.  
The standing committee submitted an extensive report with a number of recommendations. 
The Bloc submitted a dissenting report. 
My hon. colleague from Crowfoot attempted to submit an extensive report in dissent. 
It said that it was too long.  
The hon. member for Crowfoot is a very determined individual. 
He did not give up. 
He listened to what the witnesses had to say in this regard. 
However, the government refused to listen to him. 
It refused to even allow him to submit his report. 
She spoke of having to consult with her provincial counterparts. 
They clearly indicated their interest.  
One example was in the area of funding. 
Remember, this was back in 1997.  
Were funds available in that budget? 
Of course they were. 
It just shows the misplaced priorities of the government. 
The wheels of justice were grinding slowly.  
She had to wait until the February budget. 
What did they get? 
What else did they get? 
She refuses to acknowledge that those programs are already failing.  
These young people are not properly dealt with. 
It is just more offloading on to the provinces.  
It has refused to listen to Canadians and to fellow members of parliament. 
It has let the provinces down. 
It does not have an enviable record.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his question. 
The minister saw fit to include my ideas, word for word, into the new legislation. 
I certainly have questions about the issue that the hon. member raised. 
That could be my only answer.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Is my friend one of the people supporting this initiative? 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
I wonder if I could ask my friend to clarify that for me.  
This clearly is not a point of order.  
We start with the police officer on the street. 
The RCMP budget is $1.9 billion. 
The RCMP fundamentally are handcuffed at a time of fiscal restraint. 
What kind of planning is this? 
We have had promises, promises and promises. 
The person who is currently the Deputy Prime Minister was the solicitor general. 
The member for Fredericton was the solicitor general. 
Now the member from Prince Edward Island is the solicitor general. 
That is the end of them. 
Now there is a fresh start.  
They are also reaching a voluntary retirement age.  
What was the government doing in permitting the Regina training centre to be shut down? 
It is operated through a national police service. 
It points out that CPIC is a 20 year old technology. 
CPIC is completely bulging at the seams with information. 
It needs approximately $200 million to upgrade the system. 
Where is the best place to spend resources? 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour, Lib.):
It is very difficult as a government. 
Opposition members can say anything. 
They do not have to prove anything. 
This government has put money into health care and education. 
Yes, it has tried to put money toward tax cuts. 
Yes, it has a zero deficit. 
Yes, it has started to pay down the debt. 
We have done a lot of good things.  
The Liberals were the ones who allowed that to happen.  
Could my hon. colleague talk about poverty within the nation?  
There are 14,000 inmates incarcerated in federal institutions. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
This is precisely what Canadians want us to do.  
We know that and we think that is appropriate. 
They should and they will. 
Their offences should result in meaningful consequences. 
This reflects the thinking of the residents of Waterloo-Wellington. 
An individualized plan of treatment and intensive supervision must be approved by the court. 
Accomplishing the objectives of the new legislation will not be easy. 
Youth crime cannot be legislated away. 
We can, however, deal with it more appropriately than we are doing at the moment. 
I think it is important that we move in that manner.  
The government has and will continue to deliver on criminal justice programs. 
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his speech. 
There are better ways of dealing with them.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the question.  
I think it is certainly a strong point and one that needs to be recognized.  
I am aware of the private member's bill to which the hon. member refers. 
It underscores the ability of the government to recognize a strong movement in this area. 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Many issues have been raised by members. 
There was no disagreement in this place.  
I am not a lawyer. 
I am not on the justice committee. 
It just did not make sense.  
I also want to touch very briefly on two other issues. 
The other issue concerns consecutive sentencing. 
I hope this place will have the opportunity to fully deal with the issue. 
It is an issue Canadians would like to see dealt with in this place.  
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
It seems that no one can be completely wrong on this issue. 
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
He leaves behind a legacy we will treasure forever.  
We extend our deepest condolences to Mr. Gelinas' family.  
NATIONAL ABORIGINAL ACHIEVEMENT AWARDS 
Mr. Raymond Bonin (Nickel Belt, Lib.):
They are leaders, innovators, educators, scholars, scientists and artisans. 
I encourage all the members of this House and all Canadians- 
The hon. member for Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia.  
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia, Lib.):
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):
CANADIAN POLICE INFORMATION CENTRE 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
A revitalized and restored CPIC system would ensure tracking of offenders. 
This government can easily find those dollars with one stroke of a pen.  
SOMMET DE LA FRANCOPHONIE 
Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):
Canada plays a key role in the Francophonie. 
Long live the Francophonie and long live Canada.  
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
With his passing, Quebec has lost a great pioneer of Quebec theater.  
Many Quebec artists owe their careers to him to this day. 
His critical view of society was an integral part of all of his work. 
We shall never forget him.  
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Congratulations and keep up the good work.  
STANDING COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORT 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Since then it has met five times and done absolutely nothing.  
The first change in direction was due to blatant ministerial interference. 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
Ginette Reno's career is a good illustration of Canadian cultural richness and diversity. 
OLYMPIC ADVOCATES TOGETHER HONOURABLY 
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
There are no easy solutions to this difficult problem. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
What was the government's response? 
It continues to discriminate against young people.  
The consensus is clear. 
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
The CBC is glue to this country.  
The hon. member for Burin-St. 
THE EAST COAST FISHERY 
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Canadian people are quite happy with the economic policies of this government. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
High taxes, low dollar. 
That is the Prime Minister's plan.  
Who else spoke at that conference today? 
Dr. Sherry Cooper of Nesbitt Burns. 
Is the Prime Minister proud that our standard of living is declining? 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
That is the Liberals' whole argument. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I understand why Joe Clark does not want to talk with the Reform Party.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
We will hear the hon. member.  
Sometimes the truth hurts, Mr. Speaker. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the facts as cited by the Reform Party are just simply wrong. 
Let us look at the facts. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, let us talk about the facts. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is caught in a time warp. 
He started in 1979. 
He ought to get with it.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
At best, Quebec will play a secondary role in any future delegation.  
Yesterday, the Premier of Quebec said a very shocking thing. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, let us not confuse two different issues.  
Let us not confuse these two issues.  
Mr. Louis Plamondon (Bas-Richelieu-Nicolet-Becancour, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the same minister.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Louis Plamondon (Bas-Richelieu-Nicolet-Becancour, BQ):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
I would like to quote findings of such a report.  
Does the minister stand by his comments about Canada's low productivity?  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
In December he said higher taxes were good for productivity. 
Then he said he was misquoted. 
Now he says Canada has the best. 
Does he think strong productivity can be brought with a report?  
The hon. Minister of Industry.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
It seems to have been above him.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We wanted to have an elected Senate and they opposed it.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, that was seven years ago this year. 
Number two, 60% of Canadians- 
He is calling names right now because they voted against it.  
I am going to permit the question. 
The right hon. Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
They count on the federal government to represent them.  
The hon. member for Roberval.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister will have the opportunity to rise again.  
We exist and we want to have the right to say so. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, what my hon. colleague should do is read Bill C-69. 
It is more inclusive. 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
This week there are witnesses here who are presenting evidence in support of our bill.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Cardigan, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what I am doing. 
It is the right thing. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
It was done at his request and we are following his rules.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
I raised the issue myself. 
We expressed our extreme disappointment that the Cuban government did not react. 
That is the Canadian policy.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, that is too little too late.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Last year a number of political prisoners were released. 
We have been able to improve the political space for civil groups. 
We are making some progress. 
There is a setback. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
My question is for the Secretary of State for the Status of Women. 
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
There is no doubt about that.  
We are looking at some of the issues. 
There is more that can be done to level that playing field. 
But we cannot make changes immediately, in one day. 
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Trade.  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Which side of the case is the Reform Party on?  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
The ports are completely shut down today.  
Another 24 hours have passed. 
Mr. Speaker, we have negotiated with the blue collar union. 
We have made it offers that we judge to be extremely generous. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Sixteen vessels are waiting for grain to be loaded, with seven more due this week. 
Canada's reputation as a reliable supplier is being destroyed.  
Unfortunately they are asking for unreasonable demands at present. 
We are considering all possible options.  
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
I was on the picket line this morning with Dean Haywood. 
Dean has worked at the parliamentary bureau for 25 years.  
Hon. Claudette Bradshaw (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have good news on the CBC front. 
The technicians have been meeting with a mediator since last Monday and are still talking. 
The media guild has now asked for a mediator and one has been provided.  
I would ask the hon. member to accept the procedure that is in place. 
Both parties are speaking and we hope they will go back to work soon. 
It is not only a funding issue. 
There are other issues on the table that are more than just funding.  
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
It has told CBC what logo to have. 
It censored Terry Milewski for his reporting. 
It has made CBC interference an art form.  
Hon. Claudette Bradshaw (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is not what I said. 
The mediators are speaking to both groups. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Yet the land forces have received $184 million in additional funding.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the defence department pays for its bills. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
We have had people come before the committee. 
The Reform Party has said that this will not happen. 
Now we have a case where we have the grain stopped at port.  
We are monitoring the effects of their strikes. 
At present we are taking all the possible measures. 
We will look at all the options in front of us to settle these strikes.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
The alliance of manufacturers managed the implementation of the program. 
It was a necessary but difficult decision.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We have debated this issue for years and years.  
I do not think it would be useful to open debate on the Constitution. 
They have had enough debate on the Constitution over the last 10 years.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Revenue. 
The government is rewarding their brave service with a cowardly tax grab.  
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
I will report back on what we will do. 
It is a very important issue and we are reviewing it right now. 
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the President of the Treasury Board.  
Mr. Speaker, there are two main reasons. 
Mr. Rejean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
What in the world will he do to solve this problem?  
We have negotiated with them. 
We have offered them whatever we could.  
Unfortunately, the union has the right to strike and it is using that right. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
It is with pleasure that I table this document for the House of Commons.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Does the hon. member have unanimous consent?  
ALLOTTED DAY-CRIMINAL JUSTICE 
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Why did the law students stay? 
Because they knew he was going to win. 
I beg to differ. 
It was not well presented, but it was well argued.  
I do not believe that Justice Shaw made an error in judgment. 
I thank the member for his question. 
I wrote the letter because it was the right thing to do.  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
I attended a conference last weekend in Montreal. 
The conference title was ``Injection Drug Use and Societal Changes''. 
A number of speakers recommended the continuation of the needle exchange program. 
Some recommended allowing for and establishing safe injection houses or sites. 
The conference focused primarily on harm reduction. 
Forty per cent of all motor vehicle accident victims were under the influence of drugs.  
What are we to do? 
There are a number of points I would like to touch on.  
Second, there should be more education and drug awareness in schools. 
We need stricter law enforcement of trafficking charges and penalties.  
We need to increase penalties for high level drug trafficking.  
They are only more expensive within prison''.  
The only difference is that it costs more in our prisons.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
I thought it was ridiculous.  
It is the best model in the world.  
There are two ways of dealing with the use of drugs in society. 
The first is management of the problem and the second is prevention.  
This motion passed in the House last year. 
I would like to know the member's opinion on those points.  
We do not have it in this country. 
We emphasize again that we do not have truth in sentencing.  
They should pay a very serious price. 
They are only worried about profits. 
That is what we should be looking at. 
That is what the RCMP was talking about when it said a full meal deal.  
We must also put in the effort required in order to rehabilitate them.  
There are drugs within the schools throughout the country. 
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
We have it with Iranian and Chinese refugee claimants as well.  
It is a major problem and certainly places the citizens of Canada at risk.  
Their budgets are being cut, particularly in this area.  
What we have to do is focus on this very broad question. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
I understand partisan differences and differences of opinions between members of this place. 
That is what serious democratic deliberation is all about. 
The member cackles across. 
We can have legitimate arguments about these matters. 
I know she does. 
I will not castigate this government as not caring about victims. 
I know it does. 
We have different approaches about how to defend the rights of victims. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I do believe using the word shrill is unparliamentary.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I guess she resembles that comment. 
I ask the hon. member for Calgary Southeast to withdraw those words.  
Mr. Speaker, I withdraw any unparliamentary remarks. 
It is something I would like to address.  
One of them had lost 10 litres of blood. 
His name was not released. 
Later this month I will be hosting a town hall meeting with his parents. 
Close to 2,000 people attended his funeral.  
This is the backdrop we see as members of parliament in representing our constituents. 
This is not just a simple break and enter for the purpose of robbery. 
This is an aggravated form of assault on the property and home of residents.  
In Kitchener-Waterloo a 71 year old woman was terrorized. 
She was petrified to open the door. 
I said I was running for parliament. 
The police were called but the boys ran off. 
I have seen the very real faces of people concerned by this. 
It is not just the Reform Party who are concerned about this. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
I appreciated the examples my hon. colleague used. 
It was the three young people who stabbed her to death. 
A young mother's life was taken. 
How can we justify having this lack of accountability for people and their actions?  
The member is absolutely right when he says that this is a serious problem.  
I would like to hear that from the member.  
I think that question probably is not relevant.  
I suggest that the member is correct. 
Would it be Europe? 
Would it be Texas? 
Compared to the United States, our crime rate is much lower. 
It is difficult to balance.  
Last year alone 110 million people crossed our borders to enter Canada. 
Security screening is used for all those who are entering Canada. 
At the international level a screening occurs. 
It is therefore necessary to work toward solutions at the international level.  
In 1998, 8,012 people were removed from Canada. 
Changes are now being considered. 
We have a generous acceptance of refugees which is both humane and generous. 
People look at Canada overall as being a nation of immigrants. 
Canada is a nation that was built on immigration. 
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
I invite the member to call in and get a transcript of the program. 
He will find out that it is just not so.  
It is absolute bunkum.  
I have returned there on many occasions.  
I can only suggest to him that he read the facts.  
People abusing our immigration system is a problem at times. 
The member continually refers to the Honduran claimants. 
It is important for the member to understand that. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
As a matter of fact it appears to have been somewhat on the increase. 
There is unquestionably a problem with current immigration policies. 
He reminded us how generous Canada is. 
I am concerned about two issues. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. John Maloney (Erie-Lincoln, Lib.):
However I would like to concentrate my remarks on the subject of correctional facilities. 
This was not always the case. 
Some of those structures are still with us today. 
This too is achieved very successfully today.  
They can be carefully supervised as they move from prison back into the community.  
Almost all offenders will return to the community. 
Our system of justice demands it. 
After serving prescribed sentences most offenders must be returned to the community. 
We have little choice about that. 
The record demonstrates the validity of this approach. 
This record of a successful completion of conditional release has improved steadily during recent years. 
This is strong support for the approach we have adopted.  
Is our penal system perfect? 
No. Can it be improved? 
The government is responding. 
It is seeking the opinion and the advice of these people. 
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
I was a member of the justice committee, as was the member for Crowfoot. 
We did a comprehensive study of the Young Offenders Act. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
We have to look at the drug situation which is terrible. 
It is the worst I have ever seen in Canada.  
We have cocaine houses all over the city. 
They were never there before. 
Because of the drug situation we have the break-up of families.  
We have to see how we can solidify that family unit. 
Have they looked at this? 
What steps will they take to correct this terrible ailment we have in society today?  
It is very appropriate as we lead into St. Patrick's Day. 
I think the question was what are we doing to prevent these matters.  
These programs are now starting to come to fruition.  
Something must be done about it. 
There must be stricter enforcement. 
We must cut off the flow from these countries. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
Even 1% would be too much. 
There is no question about that.  
While these inmates are in prison they receive treatment. 
There is a careful release planning. 
They are supervised and observed at all stages. 
That is an important factor to take into consideration. 
It may be a small offence or whatever but they are very strict on them.  
I have heard from some of these offenders today in our committee. 
For a very slight offence they are back in. 
They may have consumed a glass of alcohol and they are back in prison.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
I will use some quotes from some of these people.  
I will quote from one or two Liberal members later.  
Canadians pay the price. 
It is Canadians who are having their lives destroyed due to drug abuse. 
New immigrant communities pay a price in another way. 
I think that is sad. 
That they are in our country is a problem in itself. 
How did they get to our country? 
However, there is no doubt this is a problem.  
That is from a Liberal member who has recognized the problem.  
They should be screened by the process.  
This again is frustration speaking. 
Many of us have heard quotes like this. 
It is not really a quote that stands alone. 
This is a problem that we should not ignore.  
How does the immigration department respond? 
They do not have the tools they need to deal with the problem. 
The frustration is bound to show. 
I think it is sad that has not been done.  
Another issue that has become huge is people smuggling. 
This estimate is probably very low. 
There are some common solutions to the problem. 
Some of them have been set out by police. 
I appreciate the time I was given to make a few comments on this issue.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
On the other hand, my colleague from Lakeland focussed mainly on immigrants.  
Then there is Catherine Ballas, who employs more than 30 people. 
Disraeli owes a number of jobs to Denis Spiratos.  
He has even suggested a figure of 16,000. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
It is a few. 
I am not only talking about local crime, I am also talking about organized crime. 
It has become a huge problem. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
I noted a startling figure recently. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Inevitably, it is a combination of both within the context of our justice system. 
These women were actually integrated with families at risk. 
They developed a co-operative integrated relationship with those families.  
What was the outcome? 
There are also some programs that are not working well. 
It is our responsibility to the taxpayer to do that.  
The amount of money required for this would be minimum.  
At point zero we could use the medical community. 
In the middle we could use trained volunteers. 
At the age of four through eight we could use the education system. 
Children have their basic needs met in a loving, caring and secure environment. 
Their children are privileged to have such parents.  
I grew up in environment in which there was very little money. 
I was very lucky to have parents with strong parenting skills. 
For that we are grateful.  
Many colleagues on the other side have a great deal of expertise and experience. 
These individuals are suffering from irreversible brain damage. 
Their average IQ is 68. 
They cannot integrate and function properly. 
When they go to school they are at a loss. 
They are often marginalized, picked on and left in the periphery. 
As a result their problems are merely compounded as time passes. 
I know my time is up. 
I will close with a plug for the RCMP. 
The CPIC computer is ready to fall apart. 
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his eloquent speech. 
He puts many of these issues back into a realm where reality reigns. 
Those people have demonstrated their wilful neglect of innocent Canadians. 
We put protection first and rehabilitation second.  
How do we treat these problems? 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
I have two suggestions for my colleague. 
Work gets the brain going.  
Second, education is a virtue. 
Unfortunately, our government is hanging on to significant sums that should be going toward education. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my Bloc Quebecois colleague for his question.  
We also feel there should be innovative ways of dealing with drug problems. 
For example, instead of incarcerating individuals we should do what was done in Scandinavia.  
There is no other program like it in the world. 
It is something that we could all learn from.  
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
I will give a very simple example. 
These myths are detrimental to the entire justice debate. 
This is a simplistic solution. 
With all due respect, this is absolutely not the case, and I will explain why.  
This is the best guarantee for public safety.  
This was at Laval. 
A member of the victim's family was in attendance. 
The 42-year old inmate, a tough and hardened man, burst into tears. 
That is our position as government. 
It is not an easy one in political terms. 
These are not easy problems. 
I would really hope that we do not fall into simplistic solutions. 
There are no easy solutions. 
But if I have to choose, I believe in human nature.  
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
That is a very difficult job. 
I think this is a serious situation. 
It does not help our society. 
That is something that is not available to justices and judges across this land. 
Historically it has been the attorneys general who take on this role.  
In that case, thankfully in this country we have a system of appeal. 
Here in the Chamber we can change the Criminal Code. 
We can put in a new act concerning youth . 
We can do many things with respect to the detail of the law.  
I therefore think we can all agree with the goals. 
All of us are concerned about our constituents and their lives.  
I just heard my hon. colleague across talking about the needs of the aboriginal communities. 
I know these communities have great needs. 
I think specifically about fetal alcohol syndrome. 
It is not going to be fixed by enforcement. 
They are effectively working in London, Ontario today and they are being expanded.  
In our case we are using it for youth. 
There has to be an admission of a wrongdoing. 
There has to be some sort of restitution. 
They see the possibility of rehabilitation.  
There are many such examples. 
I know that with my colleagues we will start addressing root causes.  
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
As the member mentioned, she can be held accountable by the voters. 
The people in the court have almost booed at what has been done there. 
This is a problem that needs to be addressed. 
Taking care of the small things automatically takes care of the big things. 
That is the point Reform is making. 
There is plenty of money in Indian and northern affairs. 
It is just not getting to the right places.  
Mr. Speaker, on those comments I would not know where to start. 
There are so many issues that could be addressed.  
Suffice it to say that in every situation there are difficult decisions for our judiciary. 
Many I would call moves to shortcuts to make life easier. 
At the end of the system we would want proper sanctioning.  
Proper sanctioning has nothing to do with length of sentence. 
Public safety and security is of utmost importance. 
One of the ways this is accomplished is through rehabilitation. 
The reality is that most offenders will get out of the system. 
At the end of the day they are going to be members of our society.  
These are safeguards that are in the system. 
I certainly would never want to see elections for judges. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Canadians are talking about them and Canadians want to talk about them.  
The Reform Party has one view of the world by and large. 
He smiles in front of it intellectually.  
The Reform Party says one thing. 
The NDP would much rather talk about victims rights than increased levels of punishment. 
We have tabled documents in the province of Manitoba. 
I mentioned the aboriginal community when I rose for one of my interventions. 
The figure is still hugely disproportionate to the population. 
In the province I come from it is a very real issue. 
It would have been a far more pressing issue. 
People would have seized themselves of the issue.  
We have seen the U.S. model. 
Private prisons, what a concept. 
Locking people up for profit. 
It makes one wonder. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):

(Bill read the third time and passed) 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP) moved: 
This happened in my community. 
There were huge walks in protest against this sentence. 
I will go into more details on this defence. 
It is a partial defence for murder. 
There are specific areas of defence in our laws that look after that.  
Since their honour was at stake it was considered quite normal that they would fight. 
The idea was to provide an understanding of a human frailty. 
I will now jump back to Yukon. 
She got a maximum sentence. 
I am not saying that she should have got Mr. Klassen's sentence. 
In the Klassen case torment and taunt were alleged. 
We have to remember that Susan Klassen was dead at that point. 
The husband and wife were separated. 
That defence is patently not available to those people.  
It has been used over and over. 
Is that reason enough to kill someone? 
Is that considered an insult? 
Is that response a lethal response?  
It is established that it was not murder. 
Women I talked to who had watched that movie were absolutely horrified. 
We have honour killings. 
That is what the defence of provocation is all about. 
It is about justifying honour killing.  
It is legal for a person to want to leave a relationship. 
We call it divorce. 
Often her life is taken. 
Such was the case with Susan Klassen.  
That was the rule of law.  
This defence still hinges on those kinds of concepts. 
They are based on gender and class. 
They do not have any room in our society. 
It is a position of trust that has been violated. 
We should be safe in our home, not in more danger. 
Of those women who are killed, most are killed within the home. 
It happens at the basic level of law enforcement. 
What has been accepted as insults in our law? 
I argue against this because the premise is bad. 
We do not make excuses in other areas of law. 
Canada does not have a death penalty any more. 
Nobody is facing a death penalty when charged and found guilty of murder. 
We are making it more accessible in those terms.  
The Minister of Justice put out a discussion paper. 
I travelled around the Yukon Territory last year. 
We have to address the intent to kill. 
We cannot accept that they did not somehow intend the action to kill. 
We will not give a lesser sentence under those circumstances.  
She was a kind and generous woman, a storyteller of international renown. 
If her husband could not have her, nobody could have her. 
Nobody would hear from this woman again. 
She was in the prime of her life. 
It was particularly cruel and degrading and frightening to everybody in the community. 
We cannot allow this. 
We cannot exonerate people for murder. 
This is a votable motion. 
The Minister of Justice knows the case very well.  
The law respecting provocation is complex and admittedly controversial. 
I think the hon. member referred to that in her own remarks. 
It applies only to a charge of murder.  
If the defence is successful, it does not result in acquittal. 
The department is currently reviewing responses submitted by individuals and interested groups.  
We have finished the consultations and we are reviewing what options we will take.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Obviously women benefit more than men from this law.  
Why do the Liberals respond to issues from some petitioners and not others? 
Let us look at the hon. member's Motion No. 265. 
If it were, we might be able to support it. 
I cannot accept that.  
Eight of the options proved unworkable beyond any doubt. 
It would be reform or no change to section 232. 
We would have to be convinced that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. 
That is a very important point. 
So far this has not happened.  
Chief Justice Cory clarified when it [section 232] can be invoked. 
There is an objective and a subjective test. 
Mr. Justice Cory stated in his judgment: 
Affairs cannot justify murder. 
I will vigorously oppose this motion. 
I compliment the member for Yukon for raising this issue. 
We really should have legislation before the House that can be debated. 
As this motion is worded, I cannot support it.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I too am honoured and pleased to take part in this debate. 
I am also familiar with the very tragic case of Susan Klassen. 
Her motivation is beyond question. 
The Criminal Code is a document that is not immune to change. 
I am a firm believer in change for our system. 
It is true that the Criminal Code is not perfect. 
How could it be? 
It is made by man. 
This is an extremely useful exercise.  
I do not believe for a moment that the law condones violence. 
Again, I commend the member because this is a very timely intervention. 
The Department of Justice has expressed a desire to look at these proposed changes. 
I commend the hon. member again for taking the initiative to bring this matter forward. 
The wording is what troubles me. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
We heard some of the detail. 
I am glad that we were spared some of the gruesome detail.  
The member from the Reform Party disappointed me, frankly. 
Other members have spoken today of what a complex issue we are dealing with. 
There are other ways of conflict resolution other than striking out. 
This law deals with lashing out in the ultimate way, murder, killing someone.  
For this he got a sentence of four years in jail. 
The defence of provocation was allowed in this incident.  
No one is advocating that. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP):
Let us look at the facts and not at Liberal rhetoric. 
No stockbroker would sneeze at that.  
Our tax dollars will go in and nothing will come out. 
It is Liberal financial planning.  
For every job lost at Devco another three will disappear from the private sector. 
It conjures up images of lazy workers and inefficient operations. 
When they bailed out they left the taxpayers the bill.  
Do we hear about that from the government's spin doctors? 
No, of course not.  
All we hear are more derogatory stereotypes, more contempt. 
We want accountability and we want to control our own destiny.  
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Before the roof fall at Phalen colliery, production was very good. 
Workers will continue to be eligible for any earned pension benefits.  
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE 
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Its head office is in my riding. 
Last October training was suspended at the depot. 
We do not need to wait for an organizational audit to see that. 
We already have a shortage of 400 constables in western Canada. 
Why have we not been spending every single day training their replacements?  
The depot knows there is a problem. 
The deputy then cancelled.  
I have met with those workers. 
They provide a professional, loyal and dedicated service to the depot and the force.  
It has been over a month now. 
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Of course there are board members from various walks of life. 
It would be pretty hard to avoid that. 
This problem is not just restricted to Halifax. 
It is not too much to ask.  
There were some highly qualified candidates bypassed on the Halifax and Vancouver lists. 
There are some really outstanding people among those being sponsored for Prince Rupert.  
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
I might indicate that the process is also applicable in all other port authority compositions.  
This nomination process has been reflected in the letters patent. 
In addition, the province and municipality each appoint a board member.  
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
This issue requires urgent and special attention. 
Since the Golden report was released, the picture has not improved. 
Homeless people in many Canadian cities are a reality. 
The government has announced some measures. 
In 1996 a decision was made to transfer social housing to the provinces. 
Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
In response, CMHC has undertaken two initiatives. 
I am afraid I am out of time. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 7.43 p.m.)
