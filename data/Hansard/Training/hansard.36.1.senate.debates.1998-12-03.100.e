Committee Authorized to Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
Thursday, December 3, 1998 
The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I would like to introduce a distinguished guest in our gallery:
HIS WORSHIP, MR. PIERRE BOURQUE 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
He was a member of Parliament, a cabinet minister, a senator and a Senate Speaker. 
We must remember these words.  
He is someone who really understands the important role of the city. 
I was glad that he met with the Prime Minister of Canada today. 
He also met with the Honourable Martin Cauchon, the Honourable Sheila Copps and others.  
Mr. Bourque has an excellent rapport with the public. 
Yet, there are still those who say he does not have a clear mandate. 
Mr. Mayor, with your 44.5 per cent, you can go forward. 
National Day of Remembrance 
Ninth Anniversary of Tragedy at l'Ecole Polytechnique 
Once again, we quietly recall their names:
Women of all ages, from children to elders, are constant targets for violence. 
Honourable senators, this is not just a women's issue. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
When shall this report be taken into consideration?

LOWELL MURRAY, P.C. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The government has full confidence in the RCMP Public Complaints Commission. 
The commission is an independent body over which the government has no control. 
We have received varying opinions on this subject. 
But there is another opinion which I received recently.  
Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition already has a copy of the letter.  
It states, in part: 
If honourable senators agree, I will be happy to table the letter.  
The BCCLA does not share this view. 
A wealth of evidence has been assembled and 120 witnesses will be called - 
In the interests of brevity, I will skip the points they raise there. 
The letter then goes on to state: 
The letter is signed by Andrew Irvine, President. 
With the permission of the Senate, I would be happy to table this letter.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted to table the document?  
Where should I begin? 
Perhaps I should begin with other parts of the letter. 
Because they are fearful of a judicial inquiry. 
What do they say? 
Furthermore, on the next page, they state: 
Indeed, there is the El-Mashat affair. 
There are several matters before the Federal Court. 
Honourable senators, I have two supplementary questions. 
I think a lot of members on this side understand it, but I do not.  
Honourable senators, in my opinion, they have that right.  
No. It depends on the mandate.  
However, we would certainly be prepared to deal with the matter at that particular time.  
Honourable senators, I have a supplementary question. 
Honourable senators, I have one final supplementary question. 
That would be up to the Prime Minister.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Does the Leader of the Government truly believe that this is the case? 
Will he not admit that those planes are too old to be flying?  
I would ask the honourable leader to respond to that comment. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the number to which I was referring was the serial number. 
What does that mean?  
Can he not tell us whether the government is considering leasing equipment?  
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
This business of having things under consideration, honourable senators, is fine. 
It is an honourable intention. 
It is not a question of intention. 
Senator Forrestall is trying to obtain a definitive "yes." 
First, the possibility of leasing is under consideration. 
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson :
Are ministers of the Crown responsible for their departments, "yes" or "no"?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
In my opinion, that is not good enough. 
The ultimate responsibility lies with the Minister of National Defence. 
That is the chain of command.  
I understand the line of command. 
Heaven help us if we have another accident, or more lives are lost at sea.  
We are taking every precaution to avoid any kind of tragedy from recurring.  
Senator Lynch-Staunton is mumbling about who cancelled the helicopter contract.  
I am trying to restrain myself.  
He is trying to say that the present government cancelled the contract. 
Now it is four more years.  
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
Senator St. Germain, may I correct you? 
The Minister of National Defence and the government have that responsibility. 
I did not make that suggestion at all.  
That is correct, but the final responsibility rests with the Minister of National Defence.  
Will this government act in the same manner?  
Why did you cancel the order in the first place?  
Hon. Eric Arthur Berntson :
I have a supplementary.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I regret, honourable senators, that the time for Question Period has expired.  
Your Honour, I have a supplementary.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I am sorry, honourable senators. 
I ask for leave, honourable senator, to extend Question Period.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
Cancellation of Proficiency Flying of Labrador Helicopter Fleet-Government Position 
Hon. Eric Arthur Berntson :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, leave was granted for one question. 
That is what I heard.  
It was for supplementary questions.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
That is the basis that I heard for the giving of leave. 
That is the statement I heard.  
Business of the Senate 
Extension of Question Period-Point of Order 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I rise on a point of order. 
Leave was requested to extend Question Period. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, if leave is granted, under what conditions will it be granted? 
Is it leave for two more questioners?  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
To quote the Auditor General: 
My question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
What is this government's position on toll highways? 
Is it "toll highways if necessary, but not necessarily toll highways"?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, that is an interesting question. 
What is the current policy?  
The auditor also had a few more criticisms.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I am sure he always does. 
The Minister of Finance is very consistent in his approach.  
I did not hear your answer. 
What did you say?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I believe the answer was not understood by Senator Bolduc.  
That is too light an answer for me.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
This is a matter of principle.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Senator Bolduc, I must operate under the rules that the Senate gives me. 
Bill to Amend-Second Reading 
This bill includes some important amendments to three pieces of legislation. 
The amendments have the support of the legal, political and enforcement communities. 
In any case, the amendment makes sense, and I support it.  
Craps is a fast game. 
However, there are certain indisputable truths with respect to this issue. 
How far should governments go in allowing gambling in our country? 
The Hon. the Speaker :
If no other honourable senator wishes to speak, I will proceed with the motion.  
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Bill 
Corruption is a threat to the rule of law, democracy and human rights. 
The range of penalties must be comparable to that for domestic bribery. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
The point is that this bill is now before us. 
In principle, we believe it will be good legislation. 
I am delighted that representatives from Transparency International-Canada will be here. 
This organization has done extraordinary work in the field of international bribery. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
I must say that I share the opinion of Senator Lynch-Staunton. 
I listened carefully to the comments of Senator Hervieux-Payette and Senator Lynch-Staunton. 
Why adopt bills so quickly? 
The signatures of certain countries at the bottom of that new treaty made me suspicious. 
What I did see was, of course, very unpleasant.  
What Senator Lynch-Staunton said really caught my attention.  
Honourable senators, this is a very difficult bill to speak against. 
It represents virtue and honesty. 
However, we live on planet Earth. 
Having said that, I believe I have put my views as clearly as I can.  
We will see what he has to say to those senators who have some concern.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Bill read second time.  
Referred to Committee of the Whole 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate that the following communication had been received: 
The Speaker of the Senate 
Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Bill 
Considered in Committee of the Whole 
Shall the title be postponed?  
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
I am pleased to introduce the Honourable Mr. Lloyd Axworthy, Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
Mr. Minister, welcome to the Senate. 
Do you have a statement at this time?  
The Honourable Lloyd Axworthy, P.C., M.P., Minister of Foreign Affairs:
This is a very important piece of legislation. 
I appreciate the fact that the Senate is now in deliberation on this matter.  
In developing our partnerships, it is important that we tackle these problems. 
It has commanded the attention of OECD ministers. 
Agreements were made just in 1997 to proceed with this.  
The OECD draft was put together last spring. 
The legislation that is before you today is a result of that.  
I strongly believe that it will also respond to the needs of Canadian business. 
They have been a strong promoter of this measure.  
We are in a very key position at this time. 
Canada is the fifth country to provide the ratification. 
The bill describes facilitation payments that would be exempt from the ambit of the offence. 
Countries have their own laws which we must recognize and by which we must play.  
Mr. Chairman, I believe that explains the basic intent of the legislation. 
I would be happy to answer any questions that members of the committee may have.  
Honourable senators, shall clause 1, the short title, be postponed?  
Thank you, minister, for your presentation. 
We certainly support the bill. 
If that were not the case, I do not think we would be as cooperative. 
Three ministers were involved in the press release announcing the bill. 
What minister will be responsible for the application of this bill? 
Under whose jurisdiction does it fall?  
Mr. Chairman, I am cosponsoring this measure with the Minister of Justice. 
Under the legislation are certain income tax requirements that will also apply.  
Who would answer for it?  
If we were to write one today, would you accept it?  
My other questions are just for clarification. 
Why would non-profit businesses not also be included?  
As a result, we are following the code set out by the OECD. 
I can find the reference on that. 
I am not a lawyer. 
As a result, I pray a lot. 
That was spoken like a true minister of justice. 
I will draft an amendment and let my colleagues proceed with their questions.  
In today's world, who knows. 
That is my answer. 
I am sorry, senator. 
I do not think it would apply in this case.  
I have a question that is directly related to Senator Lynch-Staunton's question. 
No, it would be on reporting.  
Will those be covered?  
Perhaps I can go back to the bill itself. 
They are presently not addressed in this bill. 
That is the definition contained in the legislation.  
It does not matter what the vehicle is, then? 
If they are in the business of making a profit, they would be covered.  
I am a lawyer, but my advice is free.  
That is a first!  
That is the definition that we have. 
We would then be able to see it by whatever precedent applies.  
Mr. Kessel has provided more elaboration. 
It also includes any definition of "foreign public official." 
It says, "any person exercising a public function for a foreign country." 
That is contained in the clause of the convention of the OECD.  
Could we have a definition of "person"? 
We are talking about juridical persons as well as living persons.  
Minister, you mentioned in your presentation that there had been discussion with the provinces. 
Article 8 of the convention deals with the matter of accounting. 
Section 1, in part, says: 
Those seem to be items that fall under provincial jurisdiction. 
Therefore, it is already part of the federal legal regime.  
Notwithstanding that, have there been discussions with the provinces?  
Let me turn to a couple of specific items. 
In the convention, in Article 1, section 4, they define "foreign public official." 
We are all held under scrutiny.  
In other words, the bribe being made before the person becomes an official?  
You are questioning me on a point of law. 
Minister, the OECD had unwritten rules some time ago. 
However, surprise, surprise, someone very near and dear to him is profiting from it. 
In other words, you knew where to place the money. 
It would cover off the concern you raise.  
Senator, there would have to be some evidentiary process. 
That brings us back to investigation. 
We are going in the right direction.  
I am not sure that this proposed legislation will trap it.  
Do we have enabling legislation sufficient to address that situation today?  
Yes, it does include members of the international organizations.  
Finally, will you be considering different instructions to foreign service officers? 
However, they do hear a lot and know a lot. 
Will there be a separate set of guidelines?  
I am not sure it is necessary. 
Senator, no doubt there will be communication. 
This will be an important piece of legislation. 
I would certainly support such an initiative. 
We would like to respond to that report. 
I consider it to be a very instrumental report. 
We will be responding to that report.  
There are two levels of reporting. 
One is by the OECD itself, and that is part of the convention. 
It would be done under its own assessment and monitoring procedures. 
A corporation, as we say in French, is a - 
We are talking about a corporation. 
Do have you an opinion indicating anything to the contrary?  
I am always in favour of liberal interpretations.  
( a ) is permitted or required under the laws of the foreign state...  
Are we creating a loophole?  
The convention itself is a negotiated one. 
However, let us take this for what it is. 
It will take some while to see how it works. 
There are reporting or monitoring mechanisms to determine that.  
Therefore, we will learn from it. 
Clause 6 of the bill reads as follows: 
My first reaction to that was to recall the McDonald commission. 
Senator, this is designed primarily to protect police officers doing investigations. 
We all know that Canada is highly dependent on trade in goods and services. 
No one is perfect, as we all know. 
Nevertheless, states are ratifying on the basis of commitments.  
Will it be perfect? 
Can I guarantee absolute adherence? 
I thank you for that response. 
I have a very easy question now. 
You say there are 14 countries which are signatories.  
It is actually 29. 
We would be the fifth.  
This bill originated in the Senate, which is a rare occurrence. 
This is an excellent precedent. 
I am a little concerned about their haste to sign it.  
Why not refer it to the Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs?  
We are very happy.  
You run your own business. 
It depends in part on when it emerges from the Senate. 
Must they respect the treaty?  
I am sure the others will come along. 
We know who got the money. 
Will that be covered by this bill?  
I have many examples, but they will disturb the Christmas atmosphere.  
Senator, I believe that this bill will cover the OAS convention. 
Honourable senators, my suggested amendment is as follows:
Senator, I just asked the officials for a view on that interpretation. 
It would depend, in part, on what you are looking for. 
I now have what the law officers have suggested, and I will read it again. 
( b ) by renumbering the clauses...  
It is a question of who is responsible for tabling the report.  
In effect, it would be a short report.  
It is a shared responsibility in this case.  
If I hear the intent of senators, you would like to have that broader assessment.  
Could you do that before we adjourn today?  
That is done pursuant to article 14 of the convention. 
In other words, it is the future tense.  
We are obviously well along the way. 
We could ratify that convention without this bill having passed Parliament. 
Am I incorrect in my reading of the convention, or am I correct?  
I think you are correct in terms of form. 
I think my technical questions have been raised and answered by other senators. 
That is all I have.  
However, it is a great step forward.  
The product has the blessing of the ICC. 
That is not immaterial. 
The ICC has membership representing over 120 countries.  
The national organization of the ICC is the Canadian Council for International Business. 
As well, I should like to add my support for the bill.  
This convention is a product of that work.  
This legislation will conform to that. 
The Council of Europe is pursuing activities. 
Various protocols are being examined. 
Ultimately, the WTO will be looking at this as part of its procedures as well.  
This convention is a building block. 
I am thinking particularly, without any criticism at all, of China. 
We know China is actively engaged in seeking to join the WTO.  
Furthermore, we hope this convention will eventually become more universal.  
However, a country operating outside of those standards will become increasingly stigmatized. 
It is not just a matter of numbers. 
It is also a matter of weight that they bring to bear on the matter.  
For us to carry some leverage, we must pass it. 
I am not against the bill, on the contrary. 
I was the one who suggested it to the Parliamentary Centre.  
Basically, everyone at that seminar share the same views. 
It is a very prominent board. 
Honourable senators, that completes my list. 
I appreciate the proposed amendment. 
I think it will strengthen the legislation. 
This is a very important piece of legislation. 
Honourable senators, there is another group of witnesses from Transparency International.  
Is it the wish of honourable senators to hear from them this afternoon?  
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
With him is Mr. Michael Davies, who is the Vice-President, General Counsel and Secretary.  
Welcome to the committee, gentlemen. 
Mr. Wesley Cragg , President, Transparency International Canada:
Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased to be here. 
This is a very important occasion for Canada and for the international community.  
We will then be happy to respond to your questions.  
Transparency International supports very strongly this legislation. 
That is one of our central concerns.  
It is worth tracking a little bit why that is the case.  
No one was doing it in international fora or in national fora.  
Transparency International is concerned about corruption. 
It is worth pointing out why we are concerned about corruption. 
When Transparency International was formed many of the leaders came from the World Bank. 
They were concerned for three reasons. 
We now know that is the case. 
Research has established quite clearly that it has this distorting effect. 
This is one of the significant distorting impacts that exists for poorer countries.  
Finally, and extremely important, corruption undermines government. 
It undermines the development of competent political and democratic institutions. 
Where they are in the course of development, it blocks that development. 
The OECD convention is the second most powerful tool in this respect.  
We are a genuinely international organization. 
The national chapters are semi-autonomous. 
Frequently it requires substantial courage and almost always it requires ingenuity. 
I could go into some detail on that if you are interested. 
It was one of our objectives. 
Any time it was discussed in the industrialized world, it was a finger-pointing exercise. 
With the convention, corruption will be recognized as a shared responsibility. 
That is an important step.  
The convention is an excellent one. 
It is a marvellous first step. 
However, it is only a first step, as others have mentioned. 
Nevertheless, it is an important first step. 
It covers direct and indirect bribery. 
It calls for significant penalties for corporations and their agents. 
The convention also calls for careful international monitoring of the implementation process. 
This is a piece of legislation that people around the world will be looking at. 
That is extremely important. 
It is our view that this proposed legislation succeeds in that respect. 
That is extremely important.  
There is a solid response in every case. 
People are absolutely delighted that Canada is moving on this particular issue.  
I shall sum up by making the following comments. 
It is absolutely crucial that Canada ratify the convention by that date.  
Finally, we want the Canadian and OECD monitoring to be transparent. 
This will be extremely important. 
We do not want it to take place behind closed doors. 
We do not want this to be a purely government activity. 
This legislation will not just die. 
Mr. Michael N. Davies , Vice-President, General Counsel and Secretary, GE Canada:
I wear and have worn another hat in connection with the OECD convention. 
That is one of the reasons we so strongly support this convention. 
The next meeting of the ministers of the OECD takes place in May. 
At that point, every country will have to report on where it is.  
There is an OECD working group monitoring the process. 
Thank you both for your presentations.  
It is an NGO of which we have reason to be proud here in Canada. 
We must work on both fronts.  
We rank those countries in our index. 
It is an extremely influential analysis that is used around the world. 
We should be proud of that. 
That is one of the analyses that we do.  
We are in the process of forming another analysis. 
The results of that analysis will be surprising and quite uncomfortable.  
That is a complex question. 
All senators are welcome to read that paper, should they wish to do so. 
Corruption is just one element in the process. 
We frequently do not realize this.  
That is not the case.  
It is very difficult to stand up under that pressure.  
Facilitation payments are a problem. 
This chamber of Parliament has a good track record of carefully analyzing proposed legislation. 
Reference has been made to the work of Senator Stewart and his committee. 
We would certainly be delighted if the government were to do that. 
We will take your advice. 
I concur in the thoughts expressed by my friend.  
I should like to commend our two witnesses this afternoon. 
Could you tell us how you recruit your membership in Canada? 
Can you tell us from which walks of life members of Transparency International are recruited? 
In other words, what is the kind of membership you hope for?  
Transparency International is a voluntary-sector organization or NGO. 
It has a number of different categories of membership. 
We have a substantial individual membership.  
For example, the ethics counsellor's department is a member of Transparency International. 
We also have corporations which are members.  
We have two categories of membership at the top end. 
One is for just simply organizational membership but there is also provision for charter membership. 
We have quite a number of charter members.  
We have francophone and anglophone members, as well as colleagues from across the country.  
Could you give us a rough idea of your membership, in all classes?  
I should like to move on with a question on the bill itself. 
We want the bill to pass.  
We will be watching closely. 
We will do that as quickly as is necessary.  
This is an area of interest to me. 
That will be one of our objectives. 
We will also be working with chapters around the world. 
I can assure you that this is already going on.  
As I say, we are part of a worldwide effort. 
We will be monitoring the Canadian compliance to it and the effectiveness of Canadian legislation. 
The legislation is in conformity with the convention.  
You made the association between the two. 
This is a means of establishing better respect for individuals.  
Transparency International is active in those various associations or with respect to those governments. 
The next step is to urge the government to move on the OAS convention.  
We have a committee working at that level. 
We are working wherever there are associations of that sort. 
The OAS and APEC fora are extremely important. 
That is another extremely important area. 
Does Transparency International believe the penalties are tough enough in this legislation?  
That is an interesting question. 
Determining what counts as a "tough penalty" is difficult.  
Our view is that, yes, it is an indictable offence. 
I think that is significant as well. 
Corporations will face significant financial risk if they do not respect this legislation. 
We will be talking to the government about that over the coming months.  
First, this will be carefully monitored. 
I want to put a different spin on it. 
That is the way they do business internationally. 
Then the peer pressure will take effect. 
I am aware of Transparency International and its creation. 
This is my concern. 
However, it is worth noting that we have come an enormous distance. 
I think they can do a good deal.  
Canada can provide leadership there as well. 
CIDA is doing that. 
We can only progress on that street.  
I hope you carry that interest forward. 
That is one step forward. 
They are looking for other opportunities.  
Yes, that is right.  
Today is December 3, why the wait?  
A word that I am hearing from everyone is "fast-track." 
We have two great witnesses who are backing up the minister. 
Usually we have witnesses who differ with each other.  
My question is whether we could have done this earlier? 
Was there any impediment?  
I cannot answer that question. 
You know the political process better than I. 
Yes, but this convention was not drawn up today. 
We will draw our own conclusions. 
I do not want to embarrass you. 
When did Great Britain, Germany, Japan and the fourth one sign? 
That may encourage us to hurry up.  
This has all been very recent. 
They worried that they had set the bar too high in that respect. 
Countries have had difficulty meeting the time constraint; there is no question about that. 
Canada has also had difficulty meeting the time constraint. 
Perhaps it is the case that the bar was set too high.  
The others acted very recently.  
You talk about the OAS, the OECD and so many organizations.  
The United Nations has all the means at its disposal. 
Senator Joyal spoke of parliamentary associations. 
The associations also become responsible for human rights. 
The broad answer is "yes." 
The United Nations has been trying to address the issue of corruption since the 1970s. 
Quite recently, the United Nations took up the issue again.  
In this case, this is an appropriate initiative for the OECD. 
I am sceptical about that report. 
I take it that you will be strict with those who are guilty of abuse.  
Honourable senators, the Chair has a problem. 
It is agreed that I will not see the clock.  
We appreciate their contribution. 
We wish you well in your future endeavours.

Therefore, an interdisciplinary approach is necessary. 
It is important to break the cycle of violence. 
A combination of enforcement through the laws, education and community is needed. 
Violent behaviour must not be tolerated, hidden or excused.  
Too often brute strength is equated to power in our society.
