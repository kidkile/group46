Thursday, April 29, 1999 
The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Vaclav Havel, President of the Czech Republic 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
( For text of speeches see appendix, p. 3213.)  
We do know that Jason Lang, 17, is dead. 
Taber is just 30 miles down the highway from my hometown of Lethbridge. 
Taber is where the beets are processed. 
Taber is a safe community. 
That peaceful image was blown away by the events of yesterday.  
Debates are heating up about the issue of gun control. 
Honourable senators, think of your own communities. 
In Canada, it is "not supposed to happen" in any one of them. 
They have influences in their lives that may be difficult for us to understand. 
That is what is happening today in Taber.  
Honourable senators, Taber is different. 
It is really the essence of small-town Alberta and rural Canada. 
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
Honourable senators, I, too, wish to add a word or two about this tragedy.  
I was born just 30 miles from Taber. 
Taber has always had a God-fearing background. 
I called other legislatures today before making this statement. 
It would be greatly appreciated.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Time-Limits on Speeches and Senators' Statements-Adherence to Rules 
Senator Lois M. Wilson :
It concerns the matter of the time-limit on speeches. 
However, I have no such qualms.  
In practice, that is very often cast so that one can continue. 
However, if another senator says "no" it leaves some resentment. 
More important, it creates an uneven playing field.  
The other rule is 37(4), which says: 
...no Senator shall speak for more than fifteen minutes - 
- and I underline this next part - 
That really means 10 minutes plus comments and questions. 
Generally speaking, I have found the Senate to be a relaxed place. 
There are no limits set by the clock.  
Having said that, I hope a word to the wise is sufficient.  
Possible Closure of Centre in Ottawa 
Hon. Francis William Mahovlich :
Honourable senators, today I should like to speak on homelessness.  
Is homelessness a federal problem?  
It is everyone's problem, Frank.  
Honourable senators, the problems of the homeless are increasingly apparent. 
They have just been advised that they must leave the premises in a few months. 
The director of this centre is Mrs. Mary-Martha Hale. 
I know there are problems throughout Canada, and in particular in Toronto. 
This year we closed Maple Leaf Gardens. 
National Youth Achievement Awards 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
I am saddened by the tragedy, but we must also look to the future. 
We should look to the success of Canada's youth. 
Our pages are fine examples.  
These 30 Canadians make me look to the future with optimism and love.  
I would have hoped some of my colleagues might attend this event. 
Bill to Amend-First Reading 
Hon. Therese Lavoie-Roux :
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Canada-Europe Parliamentary Association 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Does the minister have any information which might confirm or reject this?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I am not aware of the use of chemical warfare weapons. 
Can the minister confirm these reports? 
I regret, honourable senators, that I do not have that information.  
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, my question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
How do we rationalize that?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Cape Breton Development Corporation 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau:
Honourable senators, my question is addressed to the Chairman of the Internal Economy Committee.  
Is this what we are to expect now? 
Honourable senators, high priority is still being given to the Fisheries Committee. 
Having said that, there is a budgetary process. 
We have re-established three subcommittees within the Internal Economy Committee. 
One of those subcommittees is on budgets. 
The reason for that is timing. 
Some of those committees have to report by June.  
Honourable senators, I suggest that reality reflects quite the contrary. 
The honourable senator referred to the chairman of the subcommittee having met with various chairmen. 
However, that was not the case.  
Hon. Raymond J. Perrault :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
There was then an intervention by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the situation in the refugee camps is at a critical stage. 
The honourable senator mentioned Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania. 
It is particularly critical, as I understand it, at the camps in Macedonia.  
The first of these families arrived in Canada on Monday. 
I understand that 45 more people are arriving today. 
Canada stands ready to accept 5,000 refugees. 
That was not accurate. 
Interest was expressed in the other place on this particular point as well.  
How was the number of 5,000 arrived at? 
If those same criteria were applied today, would 5,000 still a realistic number?  
Honourable senators, I do not think that 5,000 was a limit. 
I would not want to suggest that that is a maximum number. 
Very much to the contrary, honourable senators. 
She is very active on this file.  
By the way, the Americans have said that this is Canada's responsibility. 
They are not taking any responsibility for it.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I have a supplementary question. 
Honourable senators, a similar question was asked by Senator Wilson the other day. 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, no, I did not say "combat engineers." 
There will be many engineers. 
I do not know that they are being deployed as combat engineers. 
Hon. Jean-Claude Rivest :
Could the leader check with his colleague?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the answer is yes. 
They should have the same opportunity as students in any other part of the country.  
Delayed Answer to Oral Question 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government):
(Response to question raised by Hon. Lois M. Wilson on April 21, 1999) 
In fact, MOX fuel is used in nuclear power reactors in several countries in Europe. 
Certified General Accountants' Association of Canada-Message from Commons 
International Search or Seizure Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
We hope that is sooner rather than later.  
On motion of Senator Carstairs, for Senator Grafstein, debate adjourned.  
The Estimates, 1998-99 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, this item was adjourned in the name of Senator Cools. 
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
State of Financial System 
Consideration of Interim Report of Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee on Study-Debate Continued 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, the committee was not unanimous on this report. 
I was hoping that Senator Tkachuk would join us on that.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, this is a rather irregular procedure. 
Since the matter was stood, there should be no debate. 
Honourable senators, I will say a few words about it, then. 
On motion of Senator Kinsella, debate adjourned.  
Statement of Minister of Finance-Inquiry-Debate Continued 
I have heard many compelling presentations from my colleagues. 
Senator Spivak talked about tax bracket creep. 
This year's balance is down to zero.  
A budget should be a plan. 
It should express resolve, address current problems, and prepare for the future. 
This budget does not do that.  
Even some members of the Liberal caucus are clearly worried. 
Sadly, there is no vision emanating from the government at this time. 
Productivity is not only a problem for Canadian businesses and exporters. 
...there has been no tax relief. 
It is hitting home more and more now. 
This company has been Canadian for almost as long as Canada has existed.  
Even amongst the government's own employees there now exists a pervasive sense of drift. 
The government doesn't give me the feeling that it respects the public service. 
It just doesn't add up.  
There is a "quiet crisis" underway in the public service today. 
On motion of Senator Lynch-Staunton, debate adjourned.  
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
I should like to commend Senator Spivak for bringing this matter to our attention. 
The use of caffeine should not be taken lightly. 
I do not believe that is the real reason. 
We know that caffeine is a problem for pregnant women. 
Consequently, the additive of caffeine cannot be justified.  
I do not believe that either Pepsi or Health Canada have offered such proof. 
Alternates can be found and alternate products can be found. 
Therefore, I believe the debate must continue. 
On motion of Senator Carstairs, debate adjourned.  
Hon. Lois M. Wilson :
However, the restriction of this principle to an insufficient number of countries is problematic. 
Canada proposes that there should be debt cancellation for countries that: 
The UN Commission on Human Rights Resolution of 1997: 
The problems warrant a broader approach than the essentially biased creditor-debtor relationship. 
"Efficiency and productivity" are not exclusive economic aspects of development. 
They should be validated for social investments and expenditures.  
A tribunal would be available should it be impossible to reach such an agreement.  
The Latin American Jubilee 2000 campaign calls for arrangements where: 
...creditors and debtors will appoint an equal number of judges to the arbitration tribunal. 
Honourable senators will receive their copies of the petition in due course. 
Hon. John B. Stewart :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Even though she was, it may not leave time for our exchanges.  
My questions are not hostile; rather, they are questions designed to produce clarification.  
That is my first question. 
Will she undertake to do that?  
The second question relates to the so-called moral hazard. 
We are all familiar with the term. 
That is almost a classic case of so-called moral hazard. 
I wonder if Senator Wilson will obliterate that argument?  
I do not have all the answers.  
Structurally, the debt rests on the backs of the poor. 
They are at the mercy of the international financial instruments. 
Perhaps this measure might help to correct that.  
They are well aware that the money is being siphoned off.  
We are, first, commending the Prime Minister's initiative. 
We have already cancelled a number of debts. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, this matter stands in the name of the Honourable Senator Forrestall. 
On motion of Senator Kinsella, for Senator Andreychuk, debate adjourned.  
Hon. Catherine S. Callbeck :
As a nation, we are committed to these principles. 
These projects build on the individual capabilities of each society.  
This is not an abstract linkage. 
Equally revealing are the data on child labour. 
A generally dismal portrait of women in developing countries continues to be painted. 
It strengthens the full participation of women as equal partners in their societies. 
Half a million women die each year from complications due to childbirth. 
Malaria causes 2 million deaths each year, largely in developing countries.  
Separating economic aspirations from the reality of social conditions is folly.  
They themselves may be beaten, or worse. 
On motion of Senator Corbin, debate adjourned.  
The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate that the following communication had been received: 
Secretary to the Governor General 
State of Helicopter Fleets-Inquiry-Debate Continued 
Hon. Norman K. Atkins :
But not the Liberals. 
It seems that this government's new theme is "What is a billion?"  
No one will die from helicopters." 
No one will die because of helicopters?  
I turn now to our navy. 
On motion of Senator Di Nino, debate adjourned.  
Access to Census Information 
Hon. Thelma J. Chalifoux :
This is why I support Senator Milne's statements.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, this inquiry will stand in the name of the Honourable Senator Johnson.  
2. the then Deputy Minister of National Defence; 
3. the then Acting Chief of Staff of the Minister of National Defence; 
4. the then special advisor to the Minister of National Defence (M. Campbell); 
5. the then special advisor to the Minister of National Defence (J. 
6. the persons occupying the position of Judge Advocate General during the relevant period; 
7. the then Deputy Judge Advocate General (litigation); and 
8. the then Chief of Defence Staff and Deputy Chief of Defence Staff.  
"9. the present Minister of National Defence.".-( 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
The third point is critically important. 
I am not, however, the only one to describe them. 
Sir, I've forgotten a lot of things in the last two years.  
In effect, we have two choices, honourable senators. 
On motion of Senator Kinsella, for Senator Meighen, debate adjourned.

His Excellency Vaclav Havel 
President of the Czech Republic 
to both Houses of Parliament 
in the House of Commons Chamber, Ottawa.  
Thursday, April 29, 1999 
Hon. Gilbert Parent (Speaker of the House of Commons):
The Right Honourable Jean Chretien.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister):
I speak of course of the President of the Czech Republic, Vaclav Havel.  
A regime that chose to block your aspirations in life.  
And your words and deeds helped secure its doom.  
You may ask what kind of republic I dream of. 
Mr. Vaclav Havel (President of the Czech Republic):
Who will take over the various functions that are now performed by the state?  
Let us first speak about the emotional functions. 
Upwards applies to various regional, transnational or global communities or organizations. 
This transfer of functions has already begun. 
In some areas, it has progressed quite far; in others, less so. 
Allow me to give you one example. 
With this example I would to illustrate the following. 
Instead it must equitably mirror the multipolar world of today. 
More channels mean more balance and a wider mutual scrutiny.  
I am talking about something else. 
This value is humanity. 
Human rights rank above the rights of states. 
Human liberties constitute a higher value than state sovereignty. 
The category of ``interests'' tends to divide rather than to bring us together. 
It is true that each of us has some specific interests. 
Principles unite us rather than divide us. 
Nevertheless, the Alliance is fighting. 
This war gives human rights precedence over the rights of states. 
I see this as an important precedent for the future. 
Hon. Gildas Molgat (Speaker of the Senate):
You faced a totalitarian social structure. 
You were harassed and imprisoned for your beliefs and activities. 
You were denied the opportunity to complete the formal education of your choice. 
But never, never did you weaken.  
The free world admires you.  
We thank you for your address.  
It is one of stubborn adherence to the highest political principles.  
Our country, our dear Canada, is fortunate to have had a democracy since its beginning. 
Thank you for being with us on this day.
