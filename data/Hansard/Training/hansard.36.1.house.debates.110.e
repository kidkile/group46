We want the Minister of Finance to follow up on these concerns. 
Seniors can be assured that we will be vigilant during the review of that program.  
I wish you all a good week.  
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, last week, we learned that unemployment has gone up in Quebec. 
Politics is killing the economy in Quebec. 
UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS 
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
We must not close our doors to those seeking refuge.  
MINISTER OF NATIONAL DEFENCE 
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
The affront to public sensibility and personal vendetta continues. 
Why has this dragged on? 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Assembly 98 delegates will speak freely and candidly about the problems facing their country. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Has the government learned nothing from the tainted blood tragedy?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, as usual the member is not listening. 
The American authorities have examined the very product being imported. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
This product has been approved for importing into Canada. 
It has been approved by the Americans. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this really does not have to be. 
That is what payroll taxes do.  
Canadians want a date. 
When are we to get real cuts?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That is not nickels and dimes.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
In the meantime, the government is depriving thousands of unemployed workers of benefits. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Is the leader of the Bloc Quebecois against that?  
Is that not what he would like to see?  
Is all this not to his liking?  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
We are talking about over $6 billion a year. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the leader of the Bloc Quebecois says he wants to create jobs.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, is it immoral to fund the transitional job creation fund? 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
And while he was answering my question- 
The hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot has the floor.  
When will the minister stop siphoning off money from the unemployed?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
You look out for your boats, but not for the unemployed.  
Hon. Paul Martin: -have been created in Canada. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member does not understand the system. 
Products are approved or disapproved. 
Would the member confine herself to the facts. 
We had her calling over to the department last week. 
We sat her down with the officials. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
The minister refuses to inspect and test its unlicensed albumin. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We looked at the product and it has been approved, as the Americans approved it.  
The question is, is it safe? 
The authorities have examined it. 
They have applied standards and they have said it should be approved. 
Products are not licensed. 
They are either approved or not approved and this product has been approved.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That is why it is at $2.70 today.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
The hon. Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, every year since we have been in office we have cut those premiums. 
We have demonstrated our desire to do so. 
Would he not have put more money back into education? 
Would he not have eliminated the deficit?  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
The Newfoundland government is picking up the tab.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
This is a very vague and ambiguous question. 
I will look into the particular case.  
We are very proud of having created those jobs all over the country. 
That is what Canadians expect of us.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The funds are committed, but they have not yet all been spent. 
They will be spent over the coming months until March 31, 1999. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
This is how responsible management works, generally.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
The question is out of order.  
The hon. member for Roberval.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
That too is part of the employment insurance reform.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
The Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am not asking about an investigation. 
My understanding is that the investigation is passed. 
I ask that the minister confirm whether that is the case.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am not aware of that being the case. 
The information I have is that the matter is under investigation.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
It never listened to the collected representatives of the education community in Quebec.

YEAR 2000 COMPUTER BUG 
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
It is a serious problem and we are doing our best to alleviate it. 
Canada is in a better position than most countries. 
It was a subject that was debated in Birmingham at the G-8 meeting. 
We must make sure that everyone remains- 
The hon. member for Vancouver-Sunshine Coast.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
The hon. member for West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
These are not normal refugees.  
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the information given by the member is completely false. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Yet the environment minister seems to be unwilling to make substantial changes.  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
The environment commissioner warns that inaction will be disastrous. 
It takes guts to restore a gutted department. 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
High payroll taxes kill jobs. 
The minister is trying to build a war chest on the backs of unemployed Canadians. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
They should not seek refuge in history''. 
That was from Paul Martin Sr. in 1956 in the House.  
I have a news flash for the minister. 
Ten cent cuts are not good enough.  
Why is it good enough for young people but not good enough for all Canadians?  
The hon. Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
A $42 billion deficit is now down to zero. 
Business investment is surging. 
It was not the case six years ago.  
Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre-Rosedale, Lib.):
My question is to the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
Opposition leader, Dalton McGuinty, said: 
``We believe that it is better to grow together than to grow apart''.  
Finally, the leader of the NDP, Howard Hampton- 
The member for Yorkton-Melville.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will introduce the amendments when the government is ready.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
The surplus currently amounts to $17 billion.  
My question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That has been made quite clear.  
The hon. member for Fundy-Royal.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
We have policies and regulations in place. 
The people in my a department work as a team. 
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise today on a question of privilege. 
In 1998 it is coho.  
Departmental documents suggest otherwise.  
The documents have fisheries managers complaining of political pressure. 
Another note, dated July 25, reads: 
We would like this information by the end of this afternoon. 
I quote from a document entitled ``Speaking Points for the Deputy Minister'': 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Finally, the facts which we brought were gathered after considerable research. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
It is not a matter of debate of policy or a debate on the issues. 
That would be just a political argument.  
Speaker Fraser noted on May 15, 1991 in his ruling: 
The hon. member is not satisfied with the response given. 
The hon. member will know that I did listen to his arguments. 
COMMENTS DURING QUESTION PERIOD 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I even give it a pretty long preamble before I get there.  
In this case I ruled the question was out of order. 
I believe it was. 
I would refer the hon. member to citations 409 and 410 of Beauchesne's.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Does the House give its consent to allow the hon. member to table the motion?  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT AND STATUS OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES 
Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have the pleasure today of presenting four reports.  
JUSTICE AND HUMAN RIGHTS 
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the second petition has to do with families. 
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have three petitions to present. 
They are very concerned.  
GOODS AND SERVICES TAX 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the second petition is on another matter. 
The petitioners are again from Kamloops. 
They are concerned about the ongoing GST situation.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Raymond Bonin (Nickel Belt, Lib.):
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
They call upon government to give a $12,000 allowance to mothers at home. 
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, Question No. 83 will be answered today. 
Theses amendments, according to the Mexican government, fulfill its obligations under the San Andres accords. 
The amendments will be debated in the Mexican congress.  
Mr. Speaker, I would ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the member is quite correct. 
Shall the remaining questions stand?  
BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1998 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I will begin with the Canadian opportunities strategy. 
First, interest relief will be extended to more graduates. 
Second, the repayment period will be extended for those who need it. 
These measures together will help up to 100,000 additional borrowers.  
Working income supplement benefits are now provided per child instead of per family. 
The government remains committed to providing a secure retirement income for its senior citizens. 
It already has the authority to tax tobacco products.  
These are highlights of Bill C-36. 
Many Canadians are waiting to benefit from these measures. 
I urge my hon. colleagues to pass the legislation without delay.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that. 
Bill C-36 is about a number of things. 
It is the budget implementation act. 
Otherwise we simply would not have the chance to do that.  
This time we are talking about a major piece of legislation. 
Shame on those Tories across the way''.  
We should be allowed to debate these things.  
We are now talking about the budget. 
The government should be ashamed.  
The impact of that was devastating. 
We saw people in the provinces rebel. 
The were extraordinarily upset. 
We saw people picketing and marching on provincial legislatures.  
I think the people were misguided. 
Unfortunately again the democratic will of parliament was thwarted. 
They will never find their way into legislation.  
The moves to hold the fund more accountable will not be discussed. 
They will not be looked at by the government. 
We are extraordinarily disappointed in how the government has dealt with this whole issue. 
But it even goes beyond that. 
I know my colleague from Calgary Southeast has talked on this before. 
These students take this subsidized education and go across the border. 
How much sense does that make? 
What is the point of that? 
That is the problem this government has consistently failed to address. 
That young man is extraordinarily lucky. 
But not everybody has that. 
That is a human tragedy of tremendous scope.  
They will point to the cuts they made to the surtaxes.  
Right away taxpayers are still worse off this year. 
In other words, taxes are still going up this year compared to last year. 
Where does that leave workers? 
It leaves them looking for jobs on the unemployment line. 
That simply is not acceptable.  
In the next several months that fund will continue to grow.  
The government does not actually have that money sitting in an account. 
We should be very clear about that. 
This is another example of the government's so-called prudence.  
It is keeping it. 
What will it do with it? 
I think that is completely unacceptable. 
Unfortunately the government thinks it knows better.  
My friends across the way laugh when I say that but it is a fact. 
It has done nothing about the debt issue. 
I do not think Canadians are buying it. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
It is not some kind of technical legislation. 
They were principled when they were in opposition. 
They spoke out against the invocation of closure and time allocation.  
He called it a disgrace. 
It does demonstrate a disdain for the Canadian people.  
Only one member of each party had an opportunity to speak on dozens of amendments. 
That is not the democratic process properly conceived or executed.  
There is a very important principle here. 
That too is a disgrace.  
What does that mean? 
Madam Speaker, I believe you will find consent for the following motion: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there unanimous consent to present the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
There is not consent.  
The pile would be 214 times higher than the CN Tower.  
Unfortunately there will be a downturn sometime in this economy. 
The finance minister speaks as though he is a Pollyanna. 
Government revenues will drop at some point and social expenditures will increase at some point. 
That government decided to let it go easy on the spending side. 
We have not yet solved the problem. 
What have the Liberals done on the tax side? 
They talk about tax relief. 
They are government cheques that are being cut. 
That is the Liberal accounting.  
That is more than was being taken. 
That is an increase over the enormously high tax burden of this government's predecessor.  
That is $80 billion, or $5,700 per year for the average taxpayer. 
We respect the choices of people who decide to do that.  
They do not get one red cent of it. 
Closure is a disgrace. 
The lack of disclosure is a disgrace. 
The public accounting principles that are manipulated here are a disgrace. 
The unfairness for families is a disgrace. 
That is why I and my colleagues will be voting against it.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1998 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
I seek the unanimous consent of the House to do so. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Since 1964, Quebec has developed the best student financial aid program. 
In Quebec, no one ever tried to include the notion of merit in it.  
Why did it take this approach? 
Because the government wanted to be visible. 
The only valid reason was to ensure its visibility.  
The Quebec government decided to show magnanimity. 
It said ``we will give you that visibility''. 
But this was still not good enough. 
The Liberals did not propose any amendments.  
This is a perfect bill, one that requires no amendment at all. 
We will end up with a dual system. 
We do not know how merit will be defined. 
The situation is unacceptable. 
This is completely unacceptable.  
We are deeply disappointed with the attitude of the Prime Minister of Canada. 
Quebec students view democracy as coming from the people. 
And here is what students are asking the Prime Minister: 
Each educational institution has to have someone to help the students. 
How are they going to deal with all this?  
The situation is completely unacceptable. 
It took the same kind of pressure.  
Here is the motion passed by the National Assembly: 
(b) Quebec selects the students who shall receive a scholarship; 
I think the message is very clear. 
There is a consensus. 
There are no opponents in Quebec in this case. 
I think it would be important for the Liberals to think about that. 
This is the situation we find ourselves in.  
Quebeckers will never accept that.  
It took 35 years to build that consensus. 
That was 34 years ago.  
Today, this consensus is being cast aside. 
This action will have far-reaching consequences. 
This is turning out to be a money issue. 
The federal government has the power to spend and it spends whichever way it pleases. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Employment insurance is a very serious matter, and one that is well documented. 
The present Prime Minister was a presence throughout.  
Essentially, the witnesses had four messages. 
This is an understatement. 
The system has been in place for over 30 years. 
The government is dismissing all that.  
The second problem is the duplication. 
Now the system is being top loaded, as we say in good French. 
Do you know what it will cost to administer this millennium fund? 
There is another problem with this fund. 
In recent years, the Minister of Finance has got us used to figure juggling. 
It is the third time that he cooks up figures in such a shameful way.  
This is not standard procedure. 
Financial statements no longer mean anything. 
This is the third time.  
He did the same thing with the innovation fund.  
At some point, he will have to stop cooking the books. 
And I am not the only one to think so. 
Will he stop laughing at the taxpayers some day?  
Not every day do we- 
It would be better for everyone. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
They have also unanimously rejected the proposed millennium scholarship fund.  
They tried to smooth things over and made several concessions. 
It does not care about efficiency or helping students. 
Just the same, a negotiating committee was set up. 
There are even Canadian supporters, as I mentioned earlier. 
We do not believe this gets around the constitutional problem. 
The millennium scholarship project has also been opposed recently by students.  
These loans will be made by financial institutions- 
From that conference on, therefore- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I would point out to the hon. member that he has only one minute remaining.  
But Mr. Pearson understood. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I must interrupt the hon. member but his time has expired.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
We can hear them in the hallways. 
They will be muzzled. 
We say that is wrong. 
It is anti-democratic. 
It is simply wrong and it is unparliamentary.  
That is not where it ends. 
This is the final stage of an anti-democratic sweep by the government.  
There were 88 interventions. 
Amendments were brought forward. 
Not a comma was changed in the legislation. 
I say that is wrong and undemocratic.  
I have to be careful because I could get worked up. 
We are not allowed to. 
It is wrong and it is something the government has to change.  
I thought the Tories were bad under Mulroney. 
The Liberals are actually worse. 
I have a couple of comments about the legislation. 
To start with I want to talk about the millennium scholarship fund. 
As a matter of fact, it is a lot less than that. 
Ninety-some per cent will never see the benefit of this.  
By the end of the year it will be about $19 billion. 
By next year there will be a surplus of about $25 billion.  
No wonder we have the deficit under control. 
One per cent may benefit from this initiative. 
I could go on. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am afraid that at this point I have to interrupt the hon. member.  
The question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
(The House divided on the amendment, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the amendment defeated.  
The next question is on the main motion.  
Is there agreement to proceed in this fashion?  
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
(Bill read the third time and passed) 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
A number of travel agents have spoken to members of parliament about the problems there. 
The problem that exists here is really one of predatory pricing and price discrimination. 
For the purpose of this bill we want to deal specifically with what it does. 
The bill speaks for itself. 
This is occurring at an alarming rate. 
We only have to go to the major centres across the country to know that.  
It has nothing to do with taxes. 
It has nothing to do with competition. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
It is necessary for us to know to what the Competition Act says. 
Section 78 in part (a) refers specifically to what anti-competition really means. 
That is precisely the issue the hon. member is trying to address. 
I submit it does. 
It does not take a genius to figure out what that really means. 
I agree that we should not have that and that is why section 78 exists.  
I could not agree with him more.  
The member suggested this has nothing to do with taxation. 
It has a lot to do with taxation.  
Before I go into the taxation part I would like to suggest one other issue. 
It seems to me we ought to look at that as well.  
I want to come back to the taxation issue. 
The residual effect is that the profit margin for suppliers and retailers is reduced. 
That amounts to 6% of the average pump price. 
There is a very practical issue here that we need to look at as well. 
These are the issues we want to look at in a very serious way.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
However, there are still a number of unresolved issues. 
(i) the supplier's own cost of marketing at retail, and 
(ii) the supplier's reasonable return on the retail sale, 
What is the ``cost of marketing at retail''? 
I do not know how to address this problem, but it is nonetheless important.  
Times are very hard for many of them right now. 
I did hear arguments such as ``we have to think about consumers''. 
I wish him luck. 
But I do want to discuss the issues raised by his bill. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
We think particularly of near monopolistic practices such as the Irvings in the Atlantic region.  
About these amendments he says in part: 
-amendments provide some much-needed definition to the concept of predatory pricing. 
The result has been to discipline our company into retail price conformance. 
Mr. Collins goes on to say: 
The Americans also enjoy lower prices on average.  
He concludes by saying: 
I am thinking, for example, of telephone and cable television costs.  
Naturally the oil companies do not agree. 
Why do they go up across the country just before summer long weekends? 
Among the highest are the costs for fossil fuels.  
It is worthy of support. 
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Beyond the intent we must also look at the bill's effectiveness.  
Canada has not been oblivious to issues which are addressed by the bill. 
Let us deal with the issue of fair pricing first. 
Quite the opposite would be the case.  
Quite simply it could not be done. 
We believe this would be the result of Bill C-235.  
The reality is that healthy competition exists in the industry.  
This would result in less competition and higher prices.  
Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):
My colleague across the way also explained that earlier.  
Furthermore, did we not adopt a policy of deregulation in the 1980s? 
In a nutshell, there is little good to come out of these proposals.  
I doubt very much that this is what was intended by the proposal.  
The market does that. 
Let us work together toward that end and not adopt the proposals before us today.  
I am sure he will continue to do good work in that area.  
Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):
That in a nutshell is what this bill aims to resolve.  
We are losing independently owned establishments left, right and centre. 
When the independents are gone they will be gone forever.  
My point is very basic. 
The oil industry is unlike any other area of commerce. 
However, it is an important first step. 
Since that time I have taken an active role as a member of the committee. 
I have said it before and I will say it again. 
Why have we accepted it with gasoline? 
We need to establish accountability.  
I urge each of my colleagues to support Bill C-235. 
It is a good bill deserving of our support. 
High or low is not necessarily the issue. 
We are all aware of what profit loss means to a business.  
Right now parliament has the ability to prevent a looming disaster. 
I will be supporting this bill. 
I sincerely hope that each of my colleagues will be doing likewise.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):
In short, the Great Lakes offer Canadians much more than fish.  
I would describe the trip as productive. 
DFO's public image seems to be floating belly up. 
Those reports outline a bleak coastal situation. 
What a difference a few years can make.

I am afraid the time has expired.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):

Is the minister unaware of what these people do as a job? 
There are only 52 weeks in a year.  
That is totally unacceptable.

They lose touch with the existing networks. 
They are no longer used to compete for jobs. 
These are difficult situations.  
It is not a gift.

The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):

Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
My question to the parliamentary secretary is straightforward. 
What does the government plan to do to dispose of nuclear waste in Canada?  
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am afraid the time has expired.  
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 7.07 p.m.)
