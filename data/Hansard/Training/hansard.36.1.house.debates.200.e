EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 200 
Friday, March 19, 1999 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
I do not believe that this is something we should ignore. 
The regime set out in Bill C-67 is the outcome of these consultations. 
The regime would offer two options to foreign banks wishing to establish branches in Canada. 
That would mean they would be limited to deposits of $150,000 or more. 
There is very good reason for this. 
This option remains open to them. 
As well, the lending branches would be restricted to borrowing only from other financial institutions. 
What does this mean for Canadian consumers of financial services? 
We believe in addition that the domestic banks stand to gain from liberalization. 
How can he say that with a straight face?  
These are the guidelines which are in place. 
Safety and soundness in the financial sector is our top priority. 
Let me explain how these banks would be regulated. 
However, its business in Canada would be supervised by the superintendent. 
I will touch briefly on four technical changes contained in the bill. 
There are federal rules and there are provincial rules. 
This causes unnecessary red tape. 
We are attempting to enhance the competition in our financial services sector. 
Let me conclude by saying something about the entire banking structure in Canada. 
Our domestic banks are in favour of this legislation. 
That is a sign of the confidence which they have in their own future.  
They are the most highly taxed industry in Canada. 
Forty per cent of the their income comes from abroad. 
They have penetrated foreign markets throughout this world.  
Ninety per cent of their global jobs are in Canada.  
Maybe it is in fashion to criticize our institutions. 
Let us give them the credit that is their due.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
We are happy to support the efforts of the government.  
However the average retailing banking customer will benefit from the trickle down effect. 
Most other countries in the world allow direct foreign banking. 
The Liberal government has been promising the same for Canada since February 1997. 
They believe that Canadian businesses cannot compete without protection. 
That includes facing foreign competition at home.  
There has not been a steady growth in foreign banking activity in Canada. 
In 1987 there were 59 foreign banks operating in Canada. 
Last year there were only 45. 
How will foreign banks react to the legislation? 
Only time will tell.  
The Hongkong Bank of Canada is a good corporate citizen. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
That should have been changed in the legislation. 
In the last 20 years the number of banks in the country has diminished. 
We do not want those types of banks to be allowed into this country. 
The hon. parliamentary secretary has made some very cogent points about the banks in Canada. 
There are a lot of myths surrounding banks, both positive and negative. 
However all Canadians have seen service charges go up. 
They have seen the banks introduce things such a tied selling. 
This is bullying and is an unfair practice. 
They are not happy with that. 
Bill C-67 is rooted in globalization and free trade. 
Again there are a lot of myths around free trade. 
We have actually benefited from free trade.  
Unfortunately the government only did half the solution. 
Finally, I would like to talk about the international financial institutions. 
This will happen again. 
There are some innovative things being done now. 
These can be long lasting.  
What fuels those conflicts and the purchase of those arms? 
It is cold, hard cash. 
We cannot continue to fail as we have in the past. 
In closing, we will support Bill C-67. 
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
What is the government's response to the problem? 
British Columbians are concerned about the situation. 
The attorney general for B.C. is calling for action from Ottawa. 
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville, Lib.):
He is also the patron saint of fathers and the patron saint of workers.  
Several women in this Chamber are products of the education provided by these dedicated nuns.  
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):
Children are particularly vulnerable. 
ELIMINATION OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Sunday, March 21 is the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. 
Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):
Such recognition can only be a plus for the economic future of our lovely region.  
Once again, I say bravo to the people of Sherbrooke.  
ELIMINATION OF RACIAL DISCRIMINATION 
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Time for a reality check.  
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Francophonie is alive and well in Canada and throughout the world.  
Spanning five continents, it comprises 400 million people in 52 countries. 
Through the years, the Francophonie has grown. 
ROYAL CANADIAN AIR CADETS 
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):
JOURNEE INTERNATIONALE DE LA FRANCOPHONIE 
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, March 20, we will celebrate la Journee internationale de la Francophonie.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Instead, we had a call for 10 provincial moratoriums.  
Yesterday in Montreal we saw the inadequacy of that approach. 
Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
This final issue has existed for over 50 years. 
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
I wish to congratulate the Kitchener-Waterloo Sidewinders for hosting this event. 
I wish them the very best for the tournament.  
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
The growing incidence of poverty is a national disgrace. 
I wish the task force good luck.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
How we conduct elections is fundamental to our democratic system. 
The discrimination faced by smaller parties is shameful. 
These provisions have been struck down.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The study began in 1985. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
That is from the Alliance of Manufacturers and Exporters. 
The hon. Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, first of all, I have met with the alliance on numerous occasions. 
In fact the productivity numbers differ substantially from industry to industry. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, let me get this straight. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
There is also no doubt that we have a long way to go- 
The hon. member for Dewdney-Alouette.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
One of the ministers is wrong and I want to know which one it is.  
They have to admit there is a problem before they can deal with that problem.  
Which minister is right about the dropping standard of living?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Yes, we want to reduce taxes. 
Yes, we have to improve our productivity. 
There has been a long term declining trend. 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We have addressed it in every single budget. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
He is supposed to give the answers.  
No parliamentary secretary is in a position to tell me that.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne-Blainville, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne-Blainville, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
The provinces and the individual hospitals get involved in the reuse. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
As a result, patients are at risk. 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
He is prepared to do that and he will be having that discussion.  
CANADA MORTGAGE AND HOUSING CORPORATION 
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
Bill C-66 will retroactively legalize its mortgage insurance underwriting program. 
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Since 1996 the industry has been involved in this program. 
There was a period so that underwriters could be ready for it. 
The hon. member for St. John's West.  
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
Could the minister explain why this difference takes place? 
Why are property appraisals being swept aside? 
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
We believe that we have a good system. 
The results are there. 
We discussed how we could implement this program. 
The hon. member for South Surrey-White Rock-Langley.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Why does she not admit that if she wants something out in the open?  
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I personally think it is much better to have a surplus.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Glen Clark had a friend too, a contractor who built a deck for him. 
At the very least will the Prime Minister do what Glen Clark has done? 
Will he release all the documentation surrounding this affair?  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Shawinigan is one of those areas. 
One of the criteria is that all local MPs are consulted.  
By his question, the questioner is suggesting that MPs should not be consulted. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
There is another similarity between Glen Clark and the Prime Minister. 
They both look like a deer caught in the headlights. 
He is releasing all the documents. 
In fact, he is even doing interviews with the media. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
I guess they are against creating jobs for unemployed people. 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We think this report has some good news in it too. 
It tells us that our measures to help people are working. 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
I would ask members to be a bit more judicious in their choice of words.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
That attitude suggests that youth should receive more EI. 
That is how we are trying to help them.  
Most Canadians share these values with us. 
The hon. member for Wetaskiwin.  
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
We are asking the union to stop taking Canadians as hostages. 
We hope that this will be concluded very soon.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
Who will be thrown in the clink this time? 
Western farmers feel it should be all three.  
We learned the position of the Reform Party. 
We will take the decision that is favourable to all Canadians very soon.  
BLACK LAKE BC MINE 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, Lib.):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, Paul Gervais is a twice convicted pedophile. 
Obviously the opposition does not get it. 
They do not care about due process.  
The Supreme Court of Canada will be rendering a decision very soon. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
This college is overflowing in capacity and has been that way for years now. 
There is a desperate need for more room. 
The hon. Minister of Public Works and Government Services.  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
That has been the consequence of the change in administering the subsidy. 
Some magazines have been advised that they would lose their subsidy. 
That review is being carried out as we speak.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
We are reviewing and analysing the court decision in reference to the Figueroa case.  
PUBLIC WORKS AND GOVERNMENT SERVICES 
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Only three cabinet ministers have used this office in the past year. 
That means it cost taxpayers over $161,000 for each meeting. 
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there used to be 26 regional offices. 
When ministers travel they use common services which are a savings. 
We also give service to Canadians.  
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this member is a member of the Conservative Party. 
It had more than 26 regional offices. 
We are looking at every expenditure. 
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
Ms. Beth Phinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the comments the member just made are absolutely false. 
I reviewed the package in the lobby this morning an hour ago. 
They do not have to create any new numbers whatsoever.  
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
The minister said he was waiting for the report before making changes. 
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We want to do that.  
I think the member is wrong on his maternity description. 
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Trade.  
The panel has not sat. 
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Canada is negotiating the composition of the WTO special panel. 
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
The Cree of northern Quebec have particularly been affected by the situation.  
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):

The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):

And more than 25 members having risen:

Is there unanimous consent?  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I suggest that all remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):
He said ``This bill will allow us, we hope-''. 
Is he really aware of the impact of this review? 
Was the president of the Mouvement Desjardins, Claude Beland, consulted? 
Let us take a look at the main amendments found in Bill C-67.  
The same is true of the bill before us today.  
This situation is unfair to Quebec insurers.  
All players should be able to start at the same time.  
Enhancing competition is one of the concerns of the Bloc Quebecois.  
We are also concerned with making these changes equitably. 
The Bloc Quebecois also advocated greater democratization of the banks. 
We share the concerns of Yves Michaud in this regard.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Let us make that clear.  
I do not mean that in any kind of personal sense. 
What is the point? 
It is sort of the opposite of the Viagra issue. 
Why are we doing this? 
I will probably go with the rubber stamp classification. 
Why do I feel this way? 
It has no consequence at all. 
It is not because most parties will support it. 
What does all this mean? 
We did not learn about that in Canada. 
We had to read it in the Wall Street Journal .  
That was the formal announcement.  
Just a few days later guess what other announcement was made? 
They had read the newspapers as well. 
This apparently shocked the Minister of Finance.  
I will make a prediction today. 
Will the Minister of Finance be open to some aspect of merging?  
We have to protect our Canadian banks and allow them to grow. 
What does the legislation do? 
He is a man of great integrity. 
That was his word. 
He said that he was hopeful. 
I give him credit for being hopeful at least. 
I will set that aside for now. 
There will be a creaming off of the system. 
It can access capital in Europe. 
This is not necessarily a problem. 
That is fair enough. 
That is what will happen. 
That is what the banks say they are interested in. 
They are not interested in providing more competition at the retail level.  
That is where they will be. 
That is not the market foreign banks are looking for.  
That will not happen.  
As my friend from Winnipeg says, they will probably even go up.  
They will be losing money to the other guys.  
Service charges are a lucrative aspect and something they could easily introduce.  
Let us acknowledge very clearly the debate we are having today. 
That is essentially meaningless because it is a done deal. 
Let us consider what we are doing today. 
We are talking about a major change to Canada's banking. 
A huge report was recently tabled.  
Why are we taking this decision today on introducing foreign banking? 
This seems to be the cart before the horse. 
There is something wrong with this process.  
You know what the cart is full of.  
My friend says that we know what the cart is full of. 
Yes, we probably do know what it is full of. 
It is incredibly frustrating.  
There is another aspect to the legislation. 
I made some notes as well. 
I probably used my own wording. 
There are no breaks.  
I hear what my friend says. 
That is a pretty major change in how banking is conducted here.  
They probably feel they have been trickled on for a long time.  
They are probably trickled off.  
They are probably trickled off at this point. 
The legislation will do the opposite. 
It means a whole bunch of people will lose their jobs. 
A whole bunch of people will lose access to branches in their various communities. 
Branches will be closed. 
The banks have already acknowledged this. 
What is our job here? 
Is it not our job as elected representatives to protect the interests of ordinary people? 
We do not have to protect the interests of banks. 
The average Canadian expects us to represent their interests. 
What are we doing here? 
We all are like a bunch of rubber stamps. 
Stamp, stamp, stamp, that is all we end up doing now. 
The Minister of Finance has decided on this.  
Let us understand what this reveals. 
Who runs this country? 
Was it discussed among the Liberal caucus members? 
The report came after this was signed. 
My Liberal friend reveals the problem. 
He decides now on education policy. 
He decides on health care policy. 
He decides on environmental policy. 
Once again, should we have foreign banks? 
That is why this is really a frustrating place sometimes.  
I like the Minister of Finance. 
He is a smart guy. 
Maybe foreign banking is getting close. 
That is not the way we are supposed to work in this place. 
I lament the fact, I regret the fact that we are living in a dictatorship. 
Look at our defence budget. 
Who decides on the nature of Canada's armed forces? 
Is it the minister of defence? 
I know other members of parliament are frustrated. 
They say they feel alienated. 
They feel left out of the circle. 
Of course they should feel alienated because they are left out. 
They are not considered. 
Their views are not considered.  
We do not support the trickle down theory of economics. 
We lament the fact that this debate is irrelevant. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. member a question. 
That was no coincidence. 
Clearly this is not something we are prepared to co-operate in. 
My friend asked me to give a short history lesson.  
We were perplexed so we made some inquiries in the House. 
This made everybody's ears perk up.  
There was no debate here, not even a ministerial statement. 
Was it announced in the House of Commons? 
It was announced in the national press theatre. 
That is where the announcements are. 
As my friend said, then the banks came out with their notice. 
We see the sequence. 
I add one more element to what I said earlier. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to my hon. colleague. 
I thought it was a great speech.  
That is what it has come to.  
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
I ask the member a question with respect to his comments. 
I wonder if he could cite any of those breaks. 
That is what the whole act is about. 
That is what this is all about. 
That is what this is all about.  
I will ask this rhetorical question. 
No. He asked some of his backbenchers to keep him out of trouble. 
That is not the way it is supposed to work.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
He can usually live with his frustration. 
But the problem is more global than that. 
It is not the first time that we go through this kind of major change. 
Is Canada ready for this? 
Is Quebec ready for this? 
The government made political hay on the issue of bank mergers. 
It said no then, it will say yes later. 
It will argue that the international environment has changed. 
The move towards bank mergers in Canada is not over. 
Guess what is happening today? 
Bank mergers are not allowed to go ahead.  
A number of banks announced massive layoffs. 
Many banks, big and medium one, will announce branch closures. 
Massive layoffs are taking place throughout Canada's financial sector. 
And there have been no bank mergers yet.  
And yet, the number of branches is still dropping. 
We missed an opportunity. 
This is what is going on. 
And yet, there have been no bank mergers.  
There will be service agreements. 
Yes, we are open to competition. 
Unfortunately, we do not have the overall picture. 
The MacKay report was good, because it did provide the overall picture. 
But it did not end there. 
It was much more than that.  
We will miss the boat.  
I mentioned the MacKay report. 
One option is to reduce the minimum $150,000 loans.'' 
Watch out for what will happen during the next two years.  
At that point the foreign banks will do their lobbying. 
Then there will be a problem in the regions and with the SMBs. 
That is today's financial reality, and we have to live with it.  
And yet the interest rates are low.  
Look at consumer protection groups. 
Look at what is happening in Quebec with the difficulty in borrowing. 
The guarantees they want are incredible. 
That is what they want when you borrow these days. 
Financial institutions have financial ratings for borrowers like you and me. 
Mr. Speaker, I know yours is excellent. 
A Reformer would probably get a rating of nine. 
Because that party is almost at the end of its political life. 
We do not know what rating the Conservatives would get.  
That would be 5.5.  
It cleans up its financial portfolio.  
Think about the person who goes looking for alternative financing. 
Even that institution has tightened up its lending conditions, now. 
The situation regarding our country's financial institutions was not planned properly. 
Many changes occur and people are very concerned. 
I see my Bloc Quebecois colleague nodding. 
People in Quebec are very concerned about what is going on. 
What power does this body have? 
To receive complaints, the way the ombudsman does? 
It has no legislative authority, just political.  
I cannot examine the bill from a fiscal point of view today. 
It is a very complex issue.  
That is when it should have been done. 
This was a political issue. 
They will need one.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Having said that, I want to ask my colleague a question. 
I represent the riding of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve. 
Then why did you support bank mergers?  
Why did you support bank mergers?  
You would do better to get your act together.  
I ask the member for Richmond-Arthabaska if he agrees with my assessment. 
If there can be some kind of tax or refund to the taxpayer, why not?  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
He gave credit for that confusion to the presence of some Conservatives within the Bloc.  
I would certainly remind him that the Bloc was founded by Conservatives. 
Hopefully, he will have some influence on his colleagues.  
A number of things have happened over the last little while. 
This is just a joke.  
It is a good one!  
We must never forget that we cannot afford to lose that sovereignty. 
If that concern surfaces, then we will have to react.  
Such is the result of the many treaties that we signed.  
We made the right decisions. 
It impacts on those who live in our country. 
Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):
We are doing better now. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
As I mentioned, the amendment deals with the issue of accountability. 
It is not just criminal matters where this happens. 
There should be some responsibility laid upon them for having failed.  
That is the contract which they have signed.  
There is an obligation for parents or guardians to do that. 
It really is a question of differentiating. 
It is really earmarked or geared to that specific situation. 
In most cases that is perfectly all right. 
It works out fine. 
We acknowledge that some may well be dangerous and difficult to control. 
The hon. member for Crowfoot also criticized restrictions placed on the publication of names. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
We come to our jobs as lawmakers with the sum total of our past experiences. 
This is the first aspect we question.  
I think that is what all the parties in this House want.  
Of course there are different degrees of rebellion. 
I can understand that.  
But how can we make the rehabilitation process even more effective?  
With regard to young offenders, there is already a model in Quebec. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
I thank the member for bringing this issue forward. 
A lot of work is involved. 
The member's personal circumstances surrounding this issue are tragic. 
A bill such as this one may be something that becomes discriminatory.  
We have had debates from the Reform Party about the tax system. 
There has been a lot of useful exchanges in the House.  
People are working longer and longer hours for less money. 
These are very difficult times.  
Education is a lifelong process. 
Unfortunately, the converse is true. 
All of those things become pressures on young people.  
We appreciate this bill being brought forward. 
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
But it seems in our society the old days are gone.  
We buy fire insurance to protect our homes. 
Most of us will never see a fire. 
Violent young people whom we are speaking about today commit the most terrible crimes. 
I wonder why that has had to happen. 
We have done that a couple of other times. 
Another problem with the minister's bill is the ambiguity in the language it employs. 
Some of the legislation as drafted is hundreds of pages long. 
I understand the spirit of the legislation introduced by the member for Surrey North. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
The concept is fairly clear.  
Parents are not obliged to sign these undertakings. 
There is no rule or coercion which says they must sign these undertakings. 
It is not something that can be done frivolously.  
The speech of the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve left me somewhat bemused. 
One continues normal everyday maintenance.  
Bill C-260 could be enacted now. 
It needs a lot of revision and renovation. 
It has taken that long to reach the point where we are now.  
Anyone wanting to eat the smartie knows what has to be done. 
I do not appreciate that approach to legislation.  
That is what we are relying on right now. 
That is what we are doing. 
That seems to be what is happening with the new act.  
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to join the debate. 
In many ways this is a timely proposal.  
Clearly, Canadians want a youth justice system that protects society.  
The new legislation will soon be introduced. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House adjourned at 2.30 p.m.)
