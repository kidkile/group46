Thursday, March 30, 2000 
The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
The Honourable Ron Ghitter, Q.C. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
I will miss his loyalty and support. 
I thank her for sharing Ron with us. 
Thank you, Ron, for the last seven years. 
May you and Myrna have many happy and active years together. 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Senator Ghitter's principles are more important to him than politics. 
I remember his work with the Dignity Foundation, which he founded. 
Senator Ghitter combined his diverse skills into a powerful package in this place. 
He was always effective in his committee work. 
Hon. Norman K. Atkins :
This is no doubt due to timely interventions such as Senator Ghitter's.  
He was tremendously involved in campus life. 
I read that speech again this morning, and I agree with much of it. 
Now Ron heads back to re-energize a new phase of his life. 
Hon. W. David Angus :
I confess to a moistening of the eyes. 
It will be hard to get along without you, Ron.  
I happened to meet Ron in the Ottawa Convention Centre one afternoon. 
I was to be sworn in the next day. 
To both of you, Godspeed and good luck.  
He has been a valued and highly respected member of our caucus. 
I have admired Senator Ghitter's sincerity and honesty. 
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
Honourable senators, it is with mixed feelings that I rise today. 
Ron and I go back many, many years. 
We have always been political opponents, but friends.  
My dilemma was different. 
Whenever I had a problem, the last person I wanted to see was Ron. 
He is a tactician of many moves.  
He was a tennis professional for The Glencoe Club. 
One could not get him on a point of order.  
That is something I am looking forward to with a little bit of glee. 
I hope all honourable senators will buy tickets. 
Ron and I cemented our friendship in the last few years. 
He always looks perfect."  
To that extent, I appreciate him. 
There was no question that Ron was that effective.  
Honourable senators, Senator Ghitter brought that effectiveness into this chamber. 
Lately, he has been fighting for the Senate. 
With that, Ron, I take my hat off to you. 
We will miss you here because you have been an adornment. 
God bless and good luck.  
Honourable senators, this is not one of the better days for me in the Senate. 
I will speak from a more personal point of view. 
Why does a man retire early? 
Senator Ghitter is 10 years ahead of time. 
Could it be that he does not love us or like us any more? 
We were given offices side by side. 
They are small, but they have a wonderful view. 
The last coincidence is that we became friends. 
An old partner of mine told me not to use the word "friend" too loosely. 
Senator Ghitter's contributions to this chamber have been enormous.  
Ron has a wonderful wife in Myrna. 
How fortunate he is to have her.  
I shall miss sharing whiskey before dinner. 
I shall miss him tremendously.  
Honourable senators, I shall not be long, either.  
I am actually kind of happy that Ron is leaving. 
The reason for that is because I think he is happy he is going. 
I will see a lot of him in Calgary. 
I am a little upset at Ron. 
I know that the party will not miss him. 
Obviously, Myrna will not miss him because he will be home more often. 
We will miss you here and we will miss you in our caucus. 
We will miss your advice. 
Most of all, in this place, we will miss your dignity. 
You are just a class guy. 
I want to wish you good luck. 
The Senate will miss you.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, I want to thank Myrna for many things over the years. 
Marilyn also sends her appreciation.  
I hope he manages to do that, and I hope it is a 71. 
That should happen at about the time I leave the Senate. 
Thank you for being a colleague and a friend. 
Ron Ghitter has been an ideal senator. 
I looked up to him long before I entered this chamber. 
Those are the values of Ron Ghitter that I salute today.  
Hon. Lois M. Wilson :
I simply want to say I am impressed by his integrity and persistence. 
These qualities are very much needed by the human community.  
I congratulate you on those qualities, Ron, and I wish you well.  
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
Honourable senators, Senator Ron Ghitter has brought political balance to my life. 
Those of us from the far West will really miss you.  
I guess it is too late for that. 
I will have to carry on. 
Thank you, honourable senators, for your generous and warm remarks.  
That was, of course, until today. 
How often your perspective changes when you are the target of the tributes.  
When I came here, I thought that was a good idea. 
I no longer think that. 
That is what happens in this world.  
I am also very proud to have been a member of the Senate. 
I have to say that in all partisanship.  
I remember making my first speech. 
I was terribly nervous. 
Bless her for understanding.  
Yes, we need reform, just as the other place needs reform. 
To my colleagues on this side of the chamber, I will miss you all. 
It has been a marvellous experience coming to know you. 
I thank you all very much.  
Canadian Institutes of Health Research Bill 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Those tunnels were flooded, and properly so, to preserve them. 
The tunnels are there, the coal is there, and it is ready to go.  
Of course, a certain number of miners will be out of a job. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I thank the honourable senator for his question. 
They are not the only community group involved in this matter. 
I have had an opportunity to make contact with at least two groups. 
It is now reaching some critical stages. 
We are down to a very short list. 
However, it is not necessarily inconsistent that other possibilities might exist. 
Honourable senators, I want to thank the minister for that answer. 
I have no argument with what is happening now. 
They all use coal. 
This is what I want the minister to check. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
That will not happen again.  
Honourable senators, the minister has just touched upon the problem. 
The market is right there in Cape Breton at the present time. 
The claim is that approximately 200 miners could be employed in the new Donkin mine. 
It will not equitable or fair, if that happens. 
Disposal of Cape Breton Development Corporation 
I would appreciate it if the minister would answer that question.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
That company will emerge from this process. 
My recommendation at that time was that they proceed through the process that was available. 
Agriculture and Agri-Food 
Farm Crisis in Prairie Provinces-Flooding Problem in Manitoba and Saskatchewan 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I am prepared to make another copy of the response available.  
I understand that they do not qualify for AIDA, our disaster relief program.  
They are really in a predicament.  
Can we fit them into a government program that will help them? 
This offer was also open to the Government of Manitoba as well.  
The Government extended the seeding deadlines for crop insurance.  
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
One example is the training of judges. 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Honourable senators, I do not know how to put this gently. 
I understand most of these committees operate behind closed doors. 
We are not even talking about the Falun Gong, but the Catholic Church. 
How does the Leader of the Government explain that?  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
The honourable senator has raised one of those areas in this chamber.  
Honourable senators, I have a great deal of sympathy with the minister. 
We have seen unbelievable changes in the world in the past 10 years. 
Human rights improvements have been significant there.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Will the Government of Canada support that resolution? 
It is as simple as that.  
Can you not make up your own mind?  
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
I am seeking information regarding the coalfields in Sydney. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate that the following communication had been received: 
Secretary to the Governor General 
The Speaker of the Senate 
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Will it be at 4:45?  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
I am assuming the Royal Assent ceremony will take approximately half an hour. 
I propose that we see where we are at that time. 
I am not sure whether there is a response on the other side. 
If there is, I suspect that will take us close to five o'clock. 
I do not believe that she has a long speech. 
I know Senator Wilson wishes to speak to it. 
There is one speech, however, that we would like to hear. 
Honourable senators, that is my best guess as to how we will proceed. 
It will, of course, be necessary for us to obtain leave. 
I notice that the whip is in agreement with my comments. 
I hope that we will have a quorum.  
I would thank the honourable Deputy Leader of the Government for his comments. 
It is helpful for all honourable senators to know how the afternoon will proceed.  
Nisga'a Final Agreement Bill 
Third Reading-Debate Suspended 
I wish to focus on only three main issues in this presentation. 
Their contribution is much appreciated.  
The evidence of Gordon Gibson made these points clearly.  
The legislation became another hostage to the fortunes of the Clark government. 
We have had some of this comment from certain witnesses.  
Let me turn to those points.  
First is the question of the constitutional character of this bill. 
That is not a step which I believe need be taken.  
Paragraph 9 of the agreement's general provisions provides as follows: 
Conflicting claims of entitlement were made by the Nisga'a, the Gitxsan and the Gitanyow. 
Elmer Derrick and Earl Muldon, otherwise known as Delgamuukw, were present for the Gitxsan. 
Glen Williams made the major presentation for the Gitanyow. 
Minister Nault, in his evidence on March 23, said: 
These are two methods by which the overlap issues can be settled. 
Some object, saying that this may require long and costly litigation. 
They are our recourse to peaceful dispute settlement.  
I will not attempt to deal today with these questions, and others. 
I do not believe they are in any way an impediment to this particular legislation. 
We are the last legislative step in this process. 
As such, we have a particular responsibility for care. 
Honourable senators, those are the remarks I wish to make at the moment. 
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
Honourable senators, I should like to ask a question of the Honourable Senator Austin. 
I did that because it is only fair. 
The greatest concern of rank and file non-natives is the question of accountability. 
They want to make certain that all natives in these particular bands will benefit. 
Many good people are victimized under such circumstances.  
What other method of checks and balances is available?  
Where are the checks and balances? 
I feel compelled to separate the question into its constituent parts.  
"Political accountability", perhaps, would be what he meant. 
The Nisga'a government will be a popularly and democratically elected government. 
That is my answer to the honourable senator's question.  
Does the province and the federal government have the right to withhold funding? 
My question is not about political accountability, it is about financial accountability.  
I will do that before the conclusion of this debate.  
Having said that, I have no hesitation in speaking in favour of the accord.  
What should we do at this stage? 
Perhaps this question is already before the courts. 
I have no problem with the remainder of the bill. 
However, there is still some doubt in my mind about the question I raised. 
Do I understand correctly that the doubt will be ignored?  
I do not have a case directly on point, nor has Senator Beaudoin.  
But he wants to create one.  
We are arguing by implication. 
Legislation changes the meaning of laws, and decisionsmust be taken. 
They may say that in the future, but they have not done so yet. 
In my opinion, we are divided on this issue. 
However, it has not been said.  
We have a serious doubt. 
In the end, only the courts can settle this matter. 
I understand that this is what will happen.  
I agree with my honourable friend. 
We are responding to directions of the court. 
The duty of legislators is to legislate. 
Honourable senators, I wish to follow up on the previous question. 
Obviously, the government has said that it will go in that direction.  
I should like to answer the honourable senator in the following way.  
Section 35 is a part of the Constitution of Canada. 
There will be future negotiations with aboriginal communities. 
I was at those meetings in 1982 and 1983. 
I do not think the right of self-government is what was intended. 
I remember that those rights were placed in the Charlottetown Accord. 
That is my concern.  
The Canadian people and every Indian reserve in Canada rejected it. 
That is my concern. 
That accord failed, famously, for whatever reason. 
Historians will debate that for some time. 
I was told that it was "for greater certainty." 
I was in the cabinet of former prime minister Trudeau from 1980-81. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, Senator Austin's speaking time has expired.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Hon. Herbert O. Sparrow :
I then have another question. 
I will look for those polls.  
The people would have had an opportunity to look more closely at the final agreement. 
That would be helpful.  
I think that is what he said in his remarks.  
No, I did not say that. 
I do not understand the question.  
There were people who asked to appear before the committee. 
I should like to have a list of those witnesses. 
The honourable senator is entitled to his opinion. 
Senator Austin : - sought to appear. 
I had a discussion with her. 
That evidence is on the Senate record under Bill C-49. 
Honourable senators, I should like clarification from the Honourable Senator Austin. 
Can he do that?  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
However, I have a couple of questions for the Honourable Senator Austin.  
Could he clarify that for me?  
In fact, I read it three or four times. 
Did the honourable senator's committee examine that question? 
I thank the honourable senator for that question.  
I know that my honourable friend is fully aware of that provision. 
Aboriginal rights will be considered from time to time within the ambit of the times. 
Thus, there is no absolute aboriginal right; it is a relative right.  
With those protections, I believe that we are in good shape with this legislation.  
I thank the honourable senator for that. 
I endorse that provision very strongly. 
We took that decision in 1982. 
Some want to repeal section 35. 
They want to argue from propositions that start without acknowledging its existence.  
What about the Supreme Court?  
May I pursue this line of questioning after Royal Assent?  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
What do you mean "he will decide"? 
The Senate will decide.  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
This is a fascinating and extraordinary exchange. 
We have questions for Senator Austin.  
Is that agreeable, Senator Austin?  
Honourable senators, my first obligation is to sponsor this bill. 
I will be back in my chair on Tuesday. 
I do not claim all knowledge on this complicated legislation. 
I am doing my best as an amateur to explain it. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is it agreed?  
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.  
The said Commission was read by the Clerk of the Senate.  
An Act to amend the Criminal Code (flight) ( Bill C-202, Chapter 2, 2000 ) 
May it please Your Honour: 
To which bill I humbly request Your Honour's assent.  
The House of Commons withdrew.  
The Honourable the Deputy Governor General was pleased to retire.  
The sitting of the Senate was resumed.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Mr. McTeague has with him some guests who have a particular interest in the bill. 
Accompanying Mr. McTeague are other members of the House of Commons. 
They are Albina Guarnieri, Joe Jordan, and some others.  
Poulin, representing the region of Sudbury. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
It is this aspect that I want to discuss today.  
This was a turning point in our history.  
Honourable senators, think about what was going on in the world in 1968. 
We were choosing the peaceful way, the way of democracy, of politics. 
I believe with equal passion that it has to be done democratically, politically.  
Honourable senators, find me another great country that would do as much. 
It would not be the vast majority of countries on the face of the earth.  
This imposes some disciplines on politicians on both sides. 
These are not academic points, honourable senators. 
It adheres scrupulously to the democratic process. 
It does not prevent the secessionist side from asking whatever question it wants. 
The questions that have been asked in the past could be asked in the future.  
Surely this is better. 
This, however, is a completely legitimate approach. 
I believe that decision merits the greatest respect.  
That clarity is surely in the interest of all Canadians.  
This does not mean that the Senate has no role. 
C-20 does allow for the exercise of that right.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
The honourable senator's speaking time has expired. 
Is leave granted that she may continue?  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Please proceed, Senator Fraser.  
Many have legal expertise, which I will never have. 
Almost all of you have more experience in the Senate.  
I have given it much thought. 
I have learned lessons that were sometimes hard. 
My democratic principles have guided me during all this time. 
They are at least as relevant today as they were in the past.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Would the honourable senator take a question?  
Honourable senators, I have considered that. 
This bill does not provide for the legal breakup of Canada. 
That is what would provide for the breakup for Canada.  
We have found ourselves very nearly engaged in that process already. 
The then government of Quebec had a very detailed plan about what it should do. 
Could I ask Senator Kinsella to repeat his second question?  
If it is still a possibility, then of what benefit is this law?  
I cannot possibly tell him why they made the decisions they made. 
However, I do not know if that was their reasoning. 
If I get the opportunity, I will certainly do so. 
I have one other question. 
Will Parliament then be called upon to decide whether that question is clear? 
Should the federal government tell them to get lost? 
Should the government call a referendum of its own? 
What advice would the honourable senator give to the government under those circumstances?  
We would have to wait upon the day.  
It could have chosen the legislative route, and that is what it did.  
Why are MPs' opinions sought, but not senators'? 
We may be consulted, but no more.  
We are going against the principle of the equality of the two Houses.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, I am sorry to interrupt, but it is six o'clock. 
Do I have the permission of the Senate not to see the clock?  
The question is simple. 
The government has the obligation to heed the opinion of the House of Commons. 
It is a complete mystery to me. 
However, we do have a word to say about it. 
We have already had words. 
I listened to the leader's speeches. 
We are, in fact, involved at this point. 
Why do anything at all now since the Supreme Court has given its opinion? 
The Senate was involved.  
If you do not want the Senate to be involved, you must follow the Constitution. 
You must do it by a constitutional amendment. 
It was a constitutional amendment, not a statute. 
How can you change the parliamentary system by a simple statute? 
I see no precedent for that in our parliamentary history.  
Just the other day Senator Boudreau spoke about the question of timing. 
There are 304 members, and here we are only 105 senators. 
I think we can act within the same time frame as the House of Commons.  
Now we want to change it. 
I have no objection, providing we follow the principles of the Constitution.  
It is very difficult to take on Senator Beaudoin on matters of constitutional principles. 
Therefore, we are not losing any power. 
Not many parliamentary democracies have gone through this exercise. 
I have one word on the vote of confidence. 
This is quite a power. 
It differs from a vote of confidence. 
Why do they have that power? 
They have that power because the statute states that they have that power.  
It is not more; it is not less.  
That is my opinion. 
It may be wrong.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
I think of Term 17. 
I cannot understand the rationale behind that argument. 
The honourable senator speaks of our role preceding the presentation of a constitutional amendment. 
If we want to take our case to public tribunals, we can. 
If we want to have special committees, we can. 
If we want to do special studies, we can. 
Nothing will stop us. 
Indeed, I would be astounded if we did not do all those things.  
We can only delay an amendment for six months.  
Those hearings went on for a long time and were very valuable. 
I remember Mr. Dion coming here. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
I listened to Senator Fraser. 
I found her arguments disturbing.  
I wonder about the usefulness of the Senate. 
I prefer the term "English" to the term "anglophone". 
When I came here, I thought this was a house of sober second thought. 
This is what is written in the Speaker's Chambers.  
Order excludes haste and precipitation.  
Honourable senators, we are both Montrealers. 
I was a member of Parliament for 30 years. 
The Senate plays its role. 
Six months provides time for thought.  
It is a nice cool-off period.  
There is nothing worse than mob rule. 
This is written in the Speaker's chambers, as you know. 
That is what concerns me. 
I will never forgive myself for defending this principle. 
I was the first to take part in the debate. 
As I was alone, I listened. 
The official opposition pursued the debate. 
One of the roles of the Senate is to defend the minorities. 
There are minorities of all sorts and there are the regions. 
I wonder why we have a Senate. 
Suddenly people will say:
I listened carefully to Senator Fraser's description of those days. 
She mentioned 1968, but we could go back to 1960. 
So I voted in favour. 
I swore I would not go through it again.  
The more I listen, the more I am troubled. 
I wonder what the Senate is doing and what its role is. 
I would never interfere in the First Nations because they were there before me. 
I wish them justice. 
We must protect minorities. 
I was opposed in both cases. 
I am a traditionalist. 
We have opinions, people to represent, and that is what the Senate is there for. 
There is an impasse. 
There is talk of a majority of two thirds of the electoral list. 
This worries me even more. 
We are creating problems where none exist.  
That is the beauty of Canada. 
There are other ways. 
What does the Senate do? 
Everyone has an opinion on the Senate. 
Flattery, Senator Prud'homme, will get you nowhere.  
Well, it got me here, the same as you.  
Senator Prud'homme asks for my conception of the role of the Senate. 
I have always had the greatest respect for the Senate. 
Why am I convinced that it is so important? 
There is quite a strong argument. 
Who forms the government? 
It involves no legislation, it is a political choice. 
How should public funds be spent? 
It is a political choice.  
This is an essentially political decision. 
The honourable senator has just convinced me of the total opposite with her arguments. 
I am sure of the importance of the Senate. 
I do not hide that from you. 
I have confidence in these people.  
I do not know how I will vote. 
I am prepared to have this debate with members of Parliament any time. 
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
I will not hazard any reasons for their motivation. 
I think the course they have chosen is legitimate.  
I have no problem with that.  
If it is trying to set a precedent, what is that precedent?  
It is a statement by way of legislation. 
Therefore, it comes to us. 
It would not have had to consult us at all. 
It is consulting us now. 
On motion of Senator Kinsella, debate adjourned.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Therefore, we should move to the adjournment motion.  
Leave having been given to revert to Government Notices of Motion:
