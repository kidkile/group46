Tuesday, November 2, 1999 
The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Welcome to the Senate of Canada, Senator Watson.  
The Late Greg Moore 
Sadly, he had much more ahead of him.  
Greg offered more than his accomplishments on the track by giving back to his community. 
His enthusiasm for helping others was genuine. 
A fund established in his name will continue to lend support to charities he supported.  
Honourable senators, Canadians will not soon forget Greg Moore.  
The Late Mwalimu Julius K. Nyerere Former President of the United Republic of Tanzania 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Julius Nyerere was educated as a teacher. 
He became the colony's chief minister when TANU won the elections in 1960. 
Elections in 1962 brought him back as president of a republic.  
Women's History Month 
Honourable senators, October is Women's History Month. 
Yet we cannot forget that we are still so few in numbers. 
Income Tax Policy for Woodlot Owners 
Hon. Erminie J. Cohen :
There are approximately 425,000 family-owned woodlots in Canada. 
Caring for woodlots in this way is a mammoth undertaking. 
This is not the case with woodlot owners.  
Woodlot owner organizations have been working on this issue since 1988. 
Surely, it is time this problem was fixed. 
I urge the Minister of Finance to complete this job.  
The Late Claude Masson 
Recognition of Peacekeeping Efforts Abroad 
They have made a priceless contribution to the alleviation of human suffering.  
Canadians have fought and died in defence of human security and freedom. 
Our peacekeepers deserve nothing less.  
Change to Tabling Date of Commissioner's Annual Report 
Hon. Jean-Robert Gauthier :
The Crime of Human Trafficking 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Canada is not immune from such activities. 
June 2000 will mark the fifth anniversary of the Beijing Declaration. 
It is essential for Canada to consider the ratification and enforcement of this international convention. 
Honourable senators, November is Osteoporosis Month in Canada. 
Treating osteoporosis costs Canada $1.3 billion a year.  
Much of the damage is irreversible. 
There are now tests available for early detection for those at risk. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Clerk of the Senate 
The Hon. the Speaker :
First Report of Committee Tabled 
Hon. John B. Stewart :

Business of the Senate 
The Hon. the Speaker :
However, I do not believe that this is the wish of the Senate. 
I simply make the point that these anomalies in our rules must be corrected.  
Canada Customs and Revenue Agency 
Changes to National Child Tax Benefit- Effect on Recipients 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
For the benefit of the government leader I will restate the problem.  
Honourable senators, I will read you some figures. 
Then we have the income tested tax credits. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I know the honourable senator is pleased with the progress we have made.  
Honourable senators, I certainly will be interested in discussing the specific example. 
Honourable senators, I would agree with the honourable senator. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted for the tabling of the statement?  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I thank the honourable senator for that question. 
I thought his comments were very timely.  
I would be happy to convey it at that time to the honourable senator.  
Replacement of Sea King Helicopters 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, I have several questions for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Indeed, it is almost immoral to allow those planes to fly.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
My information is that the sailor is now making a successful recovery in hospital.  
However, that does not address the issue raised by the honourable senator. 
West Nova Scotia Regiment- Appointment of Honorary Colonel 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Agriculture and Agri-Food 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
That would be a premature conclusion.  
Honourable senators, the premier of my province came home bitterly disappointed. 
I know that a committee is looking at the figures. 
In fact, the answer is unequivocally no. 
Honourable senators, the government placed some $900 million into the AIDA program. 
The provinces provided $600 million. 
I think everyone agrees on the amount requested.  
I do not think that view has changed. 
However, it would be premature to conclude from that that there was no assistance available.  
Farm Crisis in Manitoba and Saskatchewan- Representations to Prime Minister 
Honourable senators, I am quite familiar with what the minister is saying. 
I have met personally, as have others, with several delegations. 
Thus, I am not giving you my interpretation of events. 
They have asked for that. 
Thus far, we have not had an indication that that will happen.  
I do not want to share that view. 
Will the minister also convey that feeling, which is beginning to settle in? 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
All of these representations are being taken very seriously. 
The government is giving them due consideration.  
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Is this the hidden agenda of the government?  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Some 36,000 farmers have responded to it in the form of applications. 
At least at some point they believed it was worthwhile.  
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Agriculture take this matter seriously. 
From where does the government's confidence in the AIDA program come? 
Once they are gone, they will not come back. 
Farmers are not a renewable resource. 
When they leave their family farms, they leave Saskatchewan. That destroys the base. 
We are dependent on agriculture, at least at this point in time.  
There is no time to wait. 
No more study needs to be done. 
The matter cannot wait. 
We do not need a review.  
The honourable senator talked about delays in dealing with applications. 
The government has taken that matter seriously. 
Hopefully, the product of that serious review will be made public very soon.  
Honourable senators, my question if for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
They produce commodities that are of the highest quality. 
Yet, through no fault of their own, they are going broke. 
That is something we do know. 
They are facing bankruptcy and some are committing suicide. 
The two premiers then came to pay the government a visit. 
What month is it now? 
They received figures from the Prime Minister and the Minister of Agriculture. 
I am a slow boy from the Prairies. 
Where did those numbers come from? 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I do not know that that has been resolved to date. 
It is a very large problem, as the honourable senator knows.  
It is not good enough to say that there was a difference of opinion. 
There was no difference of opinion. 
Provincial premiers laid out a case. 
That was a big move for him.  
Specifically, I believe that the Minister of Agriculture will bring the explanation forward. 
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
Honourable senators, my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
The disappointment of the farmers and the premiers of the two provinces is enormous. 
I am a farmer and I live among them. 
There is no way out for us. 
Something must be done.  
This will have very serious national implications for the whole of Canada. 
We are a very productive industry. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
It is a problem that involves more than just short-term government assistance. 
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
As you know, there is a call for farmers not to pay their taxes. 
Nine municipalities have voted not to pay their taxes. 
I talked to the reeve of the Municipality of Wellington. 
They cannot pay with something they do not have.

Business of the Senate 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
The sequence of Routine of Business is stated in rule 23(6). 
Only motions that can be moved without notice are non-debatable.  
I hope that it is of some assistance to understanding this aspect of our procedures. 
Speech from the Throne 
Motion for Address in Reply-Debate Continued 
1st day of resuming debate ) 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
We will both rely on her very much in the days ahead.  
What is that vision? 
The Prime Minister expressed it in his reply to the Speech from the Throne. 
Fortunately, they mean a great deal. 
It is being realized through actions to make our information infrastructure second to none. 
The vision is being realized by initiatives to improve our environment.  
Our nation has turned a corner. 
As the Governor General told us in the Speech from the Throne: 
The Government is committed to prudent fiscal management. 
It will keep the ratio of debt to GDP on a permanent downward track. 
Cape Breton, for example, is a region that must completely transform its economy. 
It must transform itself radically. 
It must leap decades of economic development. 
It must somehow propel itself into this new, post-industrial age almost overnight.  
Where he lives is not important to his employer. 
All that matters is his talent - and his Internet connections.  
The people of my province, Nova Scotia, know this very well. 
We saw the opportunity and we seized it early on. 
Let me give you an example.  
Then management took a big risk. 
They wired the towers for high-speed, cutting-edge access to the Internet. 
This foresight, imagination and investment has paid off. 
The development also established an intranet to allow networking among the tenants. 
Initiatives such as these, both public and private, are working. 
We must aim to be the most connected country in the world.  
Again, this government has set very concrete goals to achieve this: 
Our knowledge-based economy is more than high-tech companies. 
It is an economy in which all sectors strive to use leading technologies and processes. 
The government will encourage the development and adoption of new technologies in all sectors.  
Let us come back to my own province. 
How will Nova Scotia benefit? 
Again, very concretely, honourable senators. 
The energy sector holds tremendous promise for Atlantic Canada. 
This government recognizes that fact. 
Will it be easy? 
It is never easy. 
Building this country certainly was not easy. 
What were the odds? 
They did not allow themselves to be defeated by these difficulties. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Poverty and the plight of the homeless were given little attention. 
In September 1990, the Liberal leader stated: 
....the position of the party and the caucus is clear:
We are opposed to the GST and we do not want to see it implemented.  
There is nothing in the opinion that is binding on anyone whatsoever. 
Can disdain for parliamentary democracy be expressed more clearly?  
It was not one of its finer moments.  
The new President of the Treasury Board showed the same inflexibility. 
Thus, the unanimous will of the Senate was completely disregarded. 
On motion of Senator Hays, debate adjourned.  
Medical Decisions Facilitation Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
Honourable senators will note that Bill S-2 begins with a preamble. 
They have to do with the controlling of pain.  
I know that some legal draftspersons do not like preambles. 
Let me turn now to the specifics of Bill S-2. 
It is very important to stress that. 
An advance written directive made under the laws of a province will always take precedence. 
Most provinces have already enacted some type of legislation regarding advance directives. 
I think it is important to review some of these cases with you.  
I look forward to the debate on this bill. 
Perhaps this bill still does not have it right. 
We are not perfect as human beings, unfortunately. 
Would the honourable senator take a question?  
That is why we have to have guidelines and a control system put into place.  
The catechism says the following: 
I thank the honourable senator. 
My second question deals with the Criminal Code. 
Why is this bill bypassing an amendment to the Criminal Code itself?  
Honourable senators, again I thank the honourable senator for the question. 
Shelter Strategy for Aboriginal Peoples 
Hon. Thelma J. Chalifoux rose pursuant to notice of October 14, 1999: 
What has come forward is a disappointment. 
It is a growing trend and it will continue.  
Fifty years ago, less than 200,000 aboriginal people were counted. 
Now more than 1 million live in Canada. 
This figure, however, does not include the Metis population of this country.  
Their social and economic circumstances may show only modest improvement. 
Credit is often poor or non-existent. 
Obviously, a higher standard of living would be assured and all of Canada would benefit.  
The royal commission ventured its own analysis on this point. 
Together they have caused great hardship. 
It was then called Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation. 
The 1978 Urban Native Housing Program followed. 
A further reason for the disparities is the low priority accorded aboriginal shelter matters. 
That made it much easier to ignore their conditions.  
Most provinces, territories and aboriginal leadership put much of the responsibility on the federal government. 
It is a source of considerable controversy and has stymied the progress.  
There is no intention to blame.  
Tripartite committees were formed with aboriginal service providers in some instances.  
These are some of the positive impacts of past federal strategies. 
I will be tabling the attachment.  
Ten years ago, approximately 63,000 aboriginal families lived in core need. 
The number of households grows and grows.  
Approximately 4,000 aboriginal people were homeless in 1996 in Toronto alone. 
One out of five aboriginal people lives in seven metropolitan areas.  
One of these strengths is the evolution of aboriginal housing societies. 
The societies have proven themselves very successful and trustworthy.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Senator Chalifoux, I regret to interrupt you, but your 15-minute period has expired. 
Are you requesting leave to continue?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Thank you, honourable senators.  
The urban portfolio alone is now worth more than $500 million. 
We had a family, a single parent with six children. 
For the first time I can buy oranges for my children."  
They are waiting for this chance. 
Aboriginal housing societies also possess something rare. 
Even so, there are emerging priorities requiring attention. 
This is seven times the rate of the general population. 
Almost one-third of all aboriginal children live in a single-parent family. 
A woman heads most of the single-parent families. 
It also centres on the lack of consultation about these transfers. 
There has never been any independent evaluation to suggest this either. 
These assurances have been very unconvincing. 
They will be expressions of aboriginal self-determination.  
The recommendations and the action plan will assist the minister responsible for homelessness.  
This inquiry must not be shelved. 
Aboriginal housing societies have the expertise. 
Honourable senators, may I have permission to table the attachment I mentioned?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
On motion of Senator Rompkey, debate adjourned.  
The Senate adjourned until Wednesday, November 3, 1999, at 1:30 p.m.
