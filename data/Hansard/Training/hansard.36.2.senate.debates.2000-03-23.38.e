Eighth Annual Meeting-Notice of Inquiry 
Canada-Japan Inter-Parliamentary Group 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker:
A number of senators attended.  
For that length of time, they were senators.  
Sea King Helicopters-Level of FlightTraining for Pilots 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
The minister is aware of the very high level of unreliability of the Sea King. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Replacement of Sea King Helicopters 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
We are now three months past that deadline, as we are all aware.  
That incident can tell anyone who wants to think about it several things. 
First, that pilot was damn proficient. 
However, why did he shut off the fuels? 
He had never gone out in a plane and tried that out. 
We now know that Cougars, Cormorants and Sikorskys are in contention. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
That was not a minor error.  
We are extremely fortunate that we have a well-trained military. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Is that true, yes or no?  
Honourable senators, the answer must be no to the the honourable senator's assumption. 
Honourable senators know that. 
In fact, there may be activity. 
What I have said is that there will not be any major expenditures. 
Restructuring and Revitalizing System 
Hon. W. David Angus :
The honourable senator is being very partisan.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I will ignore some of the preamble to that question.  
Ignore all of it.  
I will not apologize for that. 
If we look at the last two federal budgets, two things happened. 
Over $1 billion in new money will be coming to the Government of Nova Scotia. 
Honourable senators, we must be more imaginative about this problem. 
Admittedly, the federal government must take a leadership role. 
The provinces are the deliverers of health care.  
I welcome the honourable senator's interest in this area. 
Honourable senators, I hope the Honourable Paul Martin will be there to help out.  
That is why I used nice words such as "restructuring" and "revitalizing". 
The honourable leader can count on my cooperation and on the cooperation of my colleagues.  
Government Support Programs-Accounting Controls 
Hon. W. David Angus :
He expressed great frustration as to how these grants are handled in general.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
The solution is not to eliminate the program. 
Hon. Jean-Claude Rivest :
Did I understand correctly? 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
It is a case of "to be or not to be".  
We do not wish to interfere with that. 
There would be no point. 
But why have a bill? 
Mr. Trudeau referred to this.  
The House of Commons?  
Employment Insurance-Effect ofIntensity Rules on Seasonal Workers 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
It reads as follows: 
The article was dealing particularly with the province of Nova Scotia. 
Ask for an audit first.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
He said that he would be reviewing it. 
I am confident that he means what he said.  
Just like the GST.  
Delayed Answer to Oral Question 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
(Response to question raised by Hon. Lois M. Wilson on March 2, 2000) 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I call to your attention another group of visitors in our gallery. 
They are graduates of the Universite de Sherbrooke and Bishop's University. 
Canadian District of theMoravian Church of America 
Private Bill to Amend-Message from Commons 
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
I ask honourable senators to remember the referendums held in 1980 and in 1995.  
Many people, including several in this chamber, have raised this question. 
The government takes no pleasure in this action. 
There are many other issues that need to be addressed. 
The court also stated, however: 
In particular, the court said: 
The first clause addresses the clarity of the question. 
The bill sets out a strict timetable for this process. 
A question is either clear or it is not. 
In particular, the bill states that the House must consider: 
Experience tells us that this type of provision is necessary.  
The question in 1995 was a great deal shorter but not much clearer. 
The separatist leaders in Quebec maintain to this day that both those questions were clear. 
Subclause 1(6) of Bill C-20 makes this explicit. 
This is not merely my view or the view of the Government of Canada. 
Mr. Castonguay, one of our former colleagues, was very clear. 
I have read the bill more than once. 
This assessment by its very nature must be made after the vote. 
I will quote from that opinion, which states: 
The final line is the one to which I draw the attention of honourable senators. 
In this context, we refer to a `clear' majority as a qualitative evaluation.  
Such a qualitative evaluation cannot be made in advance. 
We would not require the participation of "political actors." 
We could substitute a firm of chartered accountants.  
A constitutional amendment would be required. 
Secession would not be easy for anyone, honourable senators. 
The Supreme Court openly acknowledged this, and we know it to be true. 
As the Attorney General of Saskatchewan told the court: 
The threads of a thousand acts of accommodation are the fabric of a nation.  
Honourable senators, I am confident that these difficult negotiations will not be necessary. 
As the Supreme Court pointed out: 
Under the Constitution, secession requires that an amendment be negotiated.  
How would negotiations begin? 
What would trigger a call to amend the Constitution in such a way? 
It would impose an obligation on all parties to negotiate. 
Historically, all the constitutional negotiations have taken place between those levels of government. 
The court unequivocally rejects the suggestion that it should decide, saying: 
How would the process begin? 
...accountable to the House of Commons.... 
This is the Senate, not the House of Commons.  
The House of Commons, by contrast, has a constitutional veto, and it is absolute.  
He described the change as follows: 
How does such a proposition respect the spirit of the existing amending formula? 
If Bill C-20 fails to pass, that state of affairs will remain unchanged.  
on the clarity of the question and the majority. 
Honourable senators, Canadians have never taken the narrow path. 
Today, once again, we are charting our unique path. 
The enormity of the task does not absolve us of the need to address it.  
Quebecers will no longer risk losing their country to a confusing question. 
We will not roll the dice with the future of our country. 
That answer, for generations past, present and future is Canada.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable Senator Lynch-Staunton, is it your intention to speak?  
I wish to ask the minister a question. 
My question concerns neither negotiations nor amendments. 
That means, "Give us your views. 
If that is so, why are we here as part of this bill? 
We are a pressure group!  
First, in the view of the Senate it is not a choice, it is mandatory.  
It is not mandatory.  
The word "shall" is a mandatory instruction. 
They can be rejected.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I have a question for the honourable senator. 
The eighth paragraph of the preamble of the bill states, in part: 
Clause 1(3) refers to the House of Commons. 
The court specifically used the words "elected representatives." 
The Supreme Court opinion indicates clearly that this was the intention.  
That is referring to the negotiation process.  
Is that what the honourable senator just said?  
I will clarify my question. 
He says that this bill rests upon the opinion of the Supreme Court.  
I must return to the honourable senator's statement and ask him for clarification. 
Would the honourable senator please explain?  
In my view, that is entirely consistent with the views of the Supreme Court opinion.  
Under Bill C-20, that is not the case. 
I have not read any such opinion. 
In fact, their opinion will be received and reviewed.  
What is the government's position on that issue?  
Let me ask on another subject arising from the minister's speech. 
I am sure that all of the voters regarded the questions seriously. 
I am not sure all of them understood the consequences of their vote.  
I think my friend insults the intelligence of the Quebec voters.  
Should they be successful, it would require a constitutional amendment. 
Which constitutional amending formula would apply, according to the honourable senator?  
I was distracted when the honourable senator asked the question.  
The amending formula that would apply to the Constitution would be the one which - 
The one applicable, yes.  
Is that your final answer?  
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
We will all have plenty of time to address this.  
This is your answer, and it is not complete. 
Your bill is based on constitutional authority. 
It goes a lot further than that. 
Parliament has been asked to decide on the possible secession of this country. 
Presumably it will pass here. 
I do not contest the executive authority to govern. 
No one is contesting that. 
The legislative body of the federal power is being asked to decide something. 
You can negotiate whatever you want. 
Now it is different. 
You are asking us, Parliament, to decide on something. 
I am asking you if we have the authority. 
You are right; my answer would be yes. 
I would say that that is precisely what is happening in this case.  
It is not up to them to decide; it is up to the political actors. 
Political action does not always equal legislation. 
However, you took that decision. 
I want to know why the government took that decision and under what constitutional authority. 
I do not question your executive authority.  
The court does not want to decide. 
The honourable senator referred to the 1982 amendment. 
It is true that the Senate has lost some power. 
That is the first risk. 
It was possible for the government to negotiate at an executive level. 
Parliament is composed of two houses.  
In 1982 our powers were eroded, but that was the only time. 
It has done that historically. 
Without the legislation, the Senate would have no role prior to negotiations.  
With respect to clarity, I generally agree. 
I want clarity in everything. 
I want to save Canada and I am a strong federalist. 
That is not my problem. 
My problem is the means the government has taken to reach that goal. 
As a senator, this worries me.  
Perhaps the bill can be amended. 
Our role would not have changed without this legislation.  
The executive of the Government of Canada has said that our role will change. 
No one is changing that. 
It is simply the act of negotiating. 
The government has chosen to prescribe its normally unfettered right in a particular way.  
That should be a prior condition. 
That may be his preference.  
We are two Houses or two actors, to use the Supreme Court's phrase. 
I cannot imagine that a government would take such a resolution lightly.  
I say this with the greatest of respect. 
I beg to differ with Senator Beaudoin. 
That is what responsible government is all about. 
I think, however, that the Senate does have an important role to play here.  
What is that role?  
Hon. Jean-Claude Rivest :
This argument is rather strange. 
This concept may create some confusion; that I acknowledge. 
The problem is national unity. 
What is going on? 
What progress has been made on national unity? 
Are these 3 million Quebecers going to disappear?  
I would ask the minister to reflect on this. 
This is a non-policy. 
Has the government thought it over? 
What is going to happen the day after a referendum? 
Three million Quebecers disappear?  
That is probably not unusual. 
That was his conclusion. 
I do not think the honourable senator would disagree with that.  
I agree that legislation alone will not preserve the unity of a country. 
He is quite right. 
However, I strongly object to the government's policy on national unity. 
This is what the Prime Minister said. 
Mr. Chretien lied to us. 
Some federal Liberals think so. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I respect the honourable senator's point of view on that issue. 
However, the legislation is clear. 
I believe that the requirement as currently set forth is very significant. 
I did not say that the other bodies named are not important players. 
The Parliament of Canada is supreme and we are part of Parliament.  
Perhaps we will have an opportunity to discuss that at greater length. 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
It puts many people in a difficult position. 
That was just by way of introduction to my questions.  
I come now to my first question. 
Honourable senators, that may or may not be the case. 
It depends, I suppose, on many circumstances. 
One thinks particularly of minority situations. 
That is exactly the same situation that exists for any formal constitutional amendment.  
I was looking for some commentary on that particular, narrow issue. 
That is a question, honourable senators, that has not been addressed. 
This is a method of obtaining a single opinion. 
It is a shortcut to a single opinion.  
My second question has to do with political actors. 
The term "political actor" is a term that the court has created. 
It is a specious term. 
That is another point. 
I am not a political actor, ladies and gentlemen. 
When I stand on the floor of this chamber, I am a parliamentarian.  
The court, therefore, has not contributed to clarity.  
They did not choose to do that, and I think that was a wise choice. 
They are not lifting the provisions of the legislation out of the judgment. 
The court did not write the legislation. 
They chose not to do so. 
There is a rationale for that, which I expressed in my remarks earlier. 
That is what we call responsible government. 
They have that veto; we do not. 
At the end of the day, that is the justification that I would offer.  
It is a judgment. 
It is based on the executive's decision. 
The executive has made a decision to prescribe their rights in this particular way. 
It is within their authority to do that. 
We have had some discussions constitutionally as to whether that is appropriate. 
In my view, it is. 
They have decided to act in this way.  
The government asked for an opinion of the court. 
In which paragraph does the court state that?  
I said that the legislation is based on the opinion that the government received. 
It is consistent with the opinion, and I believe that to be the case. 
The government communicates to this house through the Leader of the Government. 
- the goal is to avoid confusion, is it not? 
Here is another scenario. 
I thank the honourable senator for that clarification. 
It is completely irrelevant. 
Our responsibility will be to ensure that the choice is clear.  
Honourable senators, I voted in those two referendums. 
I do not think I was confused as to what I was doing. 
I agree that perhaps the question could have been a little clearer. 
We knew what was at stake. 
There was no confusion.  
I do not accept that. 
They knew what they were doing and what their vote meant.  
The study I cited was quoted in the other place. 
It indicated that some people were confused about the consequences of their vote. 
I cited that study from that point of view. 
It is a simple scientific fact. 
Is the leader aware that there are many such studies?  
No, I am not. 
However, I thank the honourable senator for bringing them to my attention.  
Honourable senators, I am in complete agreement with our colleague. 
It is true that several studies have shown this. 
This bill does not settle the issue. 
It is bad policy. 
We have to convince these people to remain within Canada. 
The question is not the problem. 
We are not dealing with 50 cranks.  
That is my point.  
I thank the honourable senator for his comments. 
On motion of Senator Lynch-Staunton, debate adjourned.  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
Now, they are frequently the targets of both state and rebel forces. 
Basic human rights are ignored. 
Women and children are especially vulnerable.  
This is the terrible reality we face.  
The optional protocol will be presented to the United Nations General Assembly this year. 
Canada does not practice conscription or any other form of compulsory service. 
However, the Canadian Forces do enrol members voluntarily who are under 18. 
Approximately 1,000 16- and 17-year-olds are recruited annually. 
These young Canadians are given a valuable range of educational experiences. 
Their leadership courses expose them to accountability and ethics. 
Our recruitment practices already comply with the provisions of the optional protocol. 
On motion of Senator Kinsella, for Senator Meighen, debate adjourned.  
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Again, the National Citizens' Coalition challenged the legislation before an Alberta court. 
Moreover, Quebec courts were faced with a similar case. 
It stated as follows: 
This includes a maximum of $3,000 in any given electoral district. 
This whole issue has provoked quite a bit of comment in the media and elsewhere. 
Many of these beliefs are positive in nature. 
The election that was fought over free trade is proof of this. 
One might say the same of the Charlottetown referendum. 
And yet, we know what happened.  
There are no easy answers to these questions. 
If so, are they justified? 
Will they do the job they were designed to do?  
The more radical among them will go even farther. 
Secrecy in this area does nothing but undermine public confidence. 
As it stands now, third parties can spend more than political parties. 
All this legislation does is reverse the tables. 
I must say that I tend to agree with this. 
A $150,000 limit is unquestionably far too low. 
In fact, I think it is just plain unrealistic. 
Divide $150,000 by 301 ridings. 
That equals a little less than $500 per riding. 
You cannot buy much advertising space with that.  
They will not be shut out, but their activities will be seriously curtailed. 
However, there was a veritable dearth of quantitative evidence. 
What is fuelling all the rhetoric and the allegations? 
There appear to be three reasons for this. 
Honourable senators, I must say that I find this somewhat troubling. 
It is about electing citizens to govern other citizens. 
It is not a series of private debates between politicians.  
We extol the virtues of freedom of speech and democracy. 
We praise the charter and so on. 
Do we have the right to do that? 
Are elections the exclusive domain of politicians? 
Are young people asking us to think for them? 
It should be the exact opposite. 
We must stop wanting to control every aspect of the electoral process. 
With our habit of wanting to control everything, we have rendered elections meaningless. 
We could all benefit, I think, from a frank exchange of views on this subject. 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I wonder if I might have permission to ask Senator Oliver a question.  
First, I wish congratulate him on a thorough speech. 
I also wish to congratulate him for delivering portions of his speech in French. 
I have a question, however.  
Hon. Norman K. Atkins :
In other words, are the two comparable?  
In my opinion, it is punitive.  
I see third parties as groups other than the National Citizens' Coalition. 
I will be asking questions of witnesses in committee. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham :
I think we are all sensitive to that particular point.  
Senator Atkins has served in two campaigns. 
I have been the lawyer for six national campaigns for the national PC Party. 
My job was to deal with election expenses and election law. 
That was my job for 26 years. 
I have seen few cases where money alone can buy elections. 
Therefore, I do not think we need worry about the so-called multinationals.  
That is not my view. 
I was only stating another view.  
It is possible that they could. 
It is punitive, it is unfair, and it is not equal to the political process.  
On motion of Senator Finestone, debate adjourned.  
...the builders of Canada... 
Nor will we keep our most mobile and most ambitious citizens.  
What did he say in his Economic Update of last October? 
I will extract three of his assertions. 
On page 49 of the document, the Minister said, and I quote: 
A Minister of Finance should state the facts, not distort them.  
On same page of his document, the Minister said: 
He is playing with words. 
This could be called taxation on automatic pilot.  
The Business Council on National Issues said in April 99, and I quote: 
Our standard of living is in relative decline. 
The unemployment rate remains too high. 
Our currency continues to trend downward. 
Our global share of foreign direct investments is falling. 
The real after-tax incomes of Canadians have stagnated. 
How does it characterize Canada? 
He says that we are underemployed, overtaxed and underproductive. 
We are far from the minister's boasts.  
However, let us move on to the February 28 budget speech.  
I want to start by congratulating the minister on the full indexation of tax parameters. 
We have to follow the example of Ireland in the European Union. 
Remember the debate over the GST and free trade. 
Why should we believe him today?  
In certain circles, they call that being a good politician. 
It wants to be an activist just about everywhere except where it matters.  
Now, honourable senators, let us take a look at corporate income tax. 
Since the 1960s, taxes on profits have been going up steadily. 
The answer is that corporate taxes are too high. 
This is the same reason that explains our slide in direct foreign investment.  
Here again the Minister has been much too timid. 
The President of Nortel was very clear about that.  
I should now like to draw your attention, honourable senators, to public spending. 
Is this another new trend? 
I would add that the more omnipresent regulation becomes, the more entrepreneurial freedom is compromised.  
As R. Martin said in The Globe and Mail of February 9: 
Governments cannot pick winners but losers can pick governments.  
Scarcely 10 per cent of this budget will benefit the poor. 
When we have prosperity we can afford generous social policies. 
Otherwise, they are just another attempt to make us all equally poor.  
What more proof could anyone want? 
I urge the government leader to read a few of these major research papers. 
Public spending explained 42 per cent of variations in growth, in their opinion. 
I do not say that all their progress is attributable to this factor. 
Now, what did the authors I cited earlier observe? 
However, in Canada, we are well above 40 per cent. 
How can the government claim that its spending cannot be cut further?  
My chosen category is transfers to the provinces. 
That is the theory, the justification for this type of redistribution. 
Finally, government accountability is sacrificed in this process. 
One final spending sector that is always worrisome is that of health care. 
From 1965 to 1999, health care more than doubled its drain on GDP. 
At this rate, we are and will remain the most highly taxed G-7 country. 
In conclusion, I would sum up my thinking in four points. 
One, the government's economic philosophy is not convincing. 
On motion of Senator Kinsella, for Senator Stratton, debate adjourned.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Leave having been given to revert to Government Notices of Motion: 
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, March 28, 2000, at 2 p.m.
