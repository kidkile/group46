Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma-Manitoulin, Lib.):
In tabling this report I wish to thank all hon. members for their co-operation.  
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
At the present time, there are 16 to 20 people living in three bedroom dwellings.  
The Inuit find the housing conditions at Nunavik extremely distressing. 
At the end of October 1998, there was a shortage of 425 houses in Nunavik.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
Is there unanimous consent to revert to motions?  
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your patience and the patience of members of the House. 
Is there unanimous consent?  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
I am encouraged by the positive response I have received to these amendments. 
There is no need for me to speak about these amendments in detail. 
The standing committee recognized and emphasized two significant points. 
We are not starting from the very beginning.  
Significant changes have been made to the victim surcharge provisions. 
The new regime will place the obligation to pay the surcharge squarely on the accused. 
These amendments reflect this philosophy in a concrete and practical way. 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
There remains a great deal to be done''. 
He did not fulfill that promise. 
Those changes merely enhance the role of victims in our criminal law process. 
For one of the few times in this place, all participants seemed to be onside. 
Bill C-79 is merely the response to the committee report. 
It is long overdue. 
Perhaps this legislation is an indication of change. 
It only makes sense to consider that particular victim's concerns.  
Paragraph 2 of the legislation appears to fulfill this recommendation. 
The judge may appoint counsel for the purpose of conducting the cross-examination.  
This recommendation was of special significance to me. 
As some may know, my son was murdered six and a half years ago. 
I have been working for this change, among others, ever since.  
Paragraph 17 of the legislation appears to fulfill this recommendation. 
The court shall permit the victim to read victim impact statements.  
There will be ample opportunity at the sentencing for the defence to challenge the statement.  
Paragraph 18 appears to fulfill this recommendation. 
We, as proponents of victims' rights issues, are fair. 
Paragraph 18 of the legislation appears to fulfill that recommendation. 
It is one thing to provide victims with rights. 
Bill C-79 meets this test. 
The government has refused to initiate similar provisions with respect to young persons. 
They all make common sense. 
Victims have waited for years to finally obtain substantive recognition and respect for their interests. 
Unfortunately, this same sentiment is not as present with the government.  
We have a victims' rights report. 
It is difficult to understand why the government does not just do the job necessary. 
These changes were relatively simple. 
They were of the same nature as the changes to the Criminal Code. 
That is a travesty to victims of crime. 
All of these aspects do not really require legislation.  
We have seen little evidence of how it is to operate. 
It cannot be allowed to develop into just another bureaucratic department. 
I am concerned about the definition of victim. 
Section 722 is restricted to victim impact statements.  
As an offender he received help within days. 
What does that tell us?  
Bob and Pat are friends of mine. 
I do not intend on being entirely of gloom and doom. 
Today is a start. 
There is still a long way to go.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Criminal justice is defined in various ways. 
This sentence must meet various considerations, one of them being to protect society. 
The criminal justice system therefore has a very significant social dimension. 
We avoid legislating based on specific, individual, cases. 
We ensure that the justice system is properly integrated.  
Crimes have always had names associated with them. 
The suspect's first and last names appear on the court decision. 
As we have seen, crime has an adversary: the state. 
Criminal justice does not just involve us and the crime, us and evil. 
There are also, above all, those who have been the victims.  
We will see briefly how each of them is expressed in the bill.  
Parliament has responsibilities towards the victims of crime. 
These provincial program may be numerous, but they are also costly. 
In fact, it goes toward the funding of provincial victim assistance services.  
It may prove necessary to review the provisions on victim surcharge. 
So, Bill C-79 is welcome. 
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
It was done in the last parliament. 
Members of the Liberal Party brought a sense of listening to the victims.  
We put aside our differences. 
We debated some very fundamental issues about which I will speak in a moment. 
On the surface it seems fairly straightforward. 
When does one move from being an accused to being a criminal? 
They are all our rights. 
That is why the committee struggled so hard. 
These things cost money. 
This law will create a greater burden on the courts. 
There is no question about that. 
At that point there is a determination of guilt. 
This is a major step forward. 
It is something we recognize and applaud. 
This will provide victims an opportunity to fulfil that role themselves. 
It is important legislation in that regard.  
I think that much of this would not have happened but for their work. 
As has been indicated, there are some areas that have not been accepted yet. 
We will be looking at the legislation carefully. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
The biggest disappointment, as I said, pertains to resources.  
The victims office would be modelled after what is called the correctional investigator's office. 
The previous narrow definition of victims is also something that had to be changed. 
We certainly welcome the fact that we see that encompassed in the bill today.  
I certainly feel that the office which I mentioned has been an oversight. 
It has to some degree been overlooked by the minister. 
This is a purely good news initiative.  
There are other positive amendments that I will speak to briefly. 
I welcome and to a large degree commend the minister for recognizing the need. 
Huge press conferences were held and ministers toured the country. 
That is not something the federal government can be proud of. 
The federal government is getting on board.  
Under normal circumstances one would think that this would be a day for celebration. 
In 1997 Mrs. Solomon lost her son Kevin who was murdered by Michael Hector. 
Consequently he was free to kill. 
Three young individuals lost their lives as a result, including Carolyn Solomon's son Kevin.  
The bill itself I admit is a positive step. 
The abuser was arrested, charged, convicted and served time. 
Many years later he applied for a pardon and was pardoned.  
Has that situation arisen before? 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, it was Bill C-69. 
Bill C-79 is the bill before the House. 
I may have misspoken.  
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
The report is entitled ``Victims' Rights-A Voice, Not a Veto''. 
The victim of a crime has the right to be informed and to be heard. 
Paragraph 4 of the preamble states: 
Paragraph 5 of the preamble goes on to state: 
First, I will talk about the victim surcharge on offenders.  
This legislation is certainly an important step toward addressing their concerns.  
The second amendment I will address is the victim impact statements. 
I highlight this because it is very important. 
Victim impact statements have an incredible role to play. 
However, in practice some victims have actually been discouraged from making an oral statement.  
But our work is not over. 
I would like to confirm my support for Bill C-79. 
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
They want to be heard and to be taken seriously. 
We held the meeting in June 1998 and produced our own report. 
We had an excellent meeting. 
My constituents were fully engaged in the discussion. 
I think we need to be very clear about that.  
The second area is with respect to victim impact statements. 
It removes the judge's discretion in this matter.  
After reading that, I wondered why someone had not thought of it before. 
However, in practice some victims have been discouraged from making statements.  
This is a good piece of legislation and I compliment the government. 
This time I think it got it right. 
The bill deserves the support of all members. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
I am sure the member conducted town hall meetings. 
I know I conducted one in Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough. 
That is all people want to know. 
That is perfectly legitimate.  
In terms of wish, I would agree with the hon. member. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
It was never initiated by the Liberal government. 
I do not want to dwell too long on that. 
I attended many court trials. 
I spoke with victims across the country. 
There was no exploitation at all. 
We were merely carrying a message forward. 
The minister made another comment on March 11, 1997. 
There were about 2,200 people there. 
That was the largest rally of its time. 
There was still not an understanding by the government. 
We moved it on from there. 
The justice minister and I had a great debate on that day. 
To my surprise he actually admitted at that point that we needed to do something.  
From there it went to committee. 
We were basically all on side at that point.  
It was a difficult job convincing members on opposite side. 
That would be a much better approach.  
That is one of the greatest problems in the country. 
I understand that the committee is looking at talking about about that later. 
I am not interested in talking about it later. 
They must also be made aware of any available victim services. 
I hear again that is a provincial jurisdiction. 
Some say that is provincial jurisdiction. 
Some say that it is the CRA, the Conditional Release Act. 
How do we do that? 
All kinds of commitments can be made. 
Some would say, the technocrats I suppose, that it is provincial jurisdiction.  
The fact of the matter is, we can do more with the provinces. 
The justice minister meets with the attorneys general of every province every year. 
Commitments can be obtained. 
Could we please get help?'' 
We must have the police follow through on domestic violence charges. 
That seems reasonable to me. 
I have dealt with two individuals who have had that problem. 
One young lady was raped by an individual who finally was deported. 
Those are the kinds of rights we need in this country. 
I do not think that is practical. 
It is necessary to thank people like Ron and Corrine Schaefer. 
Corrine's sister Angela was murdered. 
Both of them have been and still are avid supporters of CAVEAT.  
These are courageous people.  
I should also mention Heather Fougere and Gail and Terry Smith. 
I very much encourage this House to do more. 
We should not stop here.  
I have gone through the national drug strategy of the Liberal government. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am talking about what is on the back of his speaking notes.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
If I had another ten minutes the member would wear that comment. 
The issue of drugs in this country is serious.  
Watch who you are talking to.  
Madam Speaker, I have just been told to watch who I am talking to. 
We will take on the issue of drugs in this country. 
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
I am sure the member is aware of it. 
It is a one hour course which lasts for 17 weeks. 
Madam Speaker, I welcome that comment. 
The DARE program, educationally, appears to be a very good program. 
There are many educational programs involving drugs today. 
I welcome the hon. member's question. 
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
I share with him the concern. 
I ask this in all seriousness because I am curious. 
The member refers to a bill of rights for victims. 
It is perhaps a philosophical question, but I ask it.  
Madam Speaker, actually it is a very good question. 
The charter of rights and freedoms has created some problems. 
They had the rights, but they did not have the privileges. 
I think we have mixed up the rights and the privileges.  
They were treated like third class citizens. 
That is why it has all come about. 
I do not agree with all that.  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
I worked a lot with him before I became a member of this place.  
Would he care to elaborate on some of the more common complaints? 
Where was the resistance coming from if indeed there was any?  
One of the things that touched me greatly was talking to victims. 
The member for Surrey North will probably not remember when I first met him. 
We were talking to some young kids in New Westminster. 
He was speaking to them and it touched me greatly. 
Those were the kinds of issues.  
I recall sitting at a sentencing hearing. 
We found out that the thing had been purged so badly. 
She was asking what rights she had as that guy was protected. 
I have another story. 
She was afraid of this fellow. 
They never told her a thing. 
That is what victims rights are all about: ``who cares about me?''  
That is more than one a day. 
The drug market is extremely profitable. 
I have talked to people who have sold drugs. 
I had previous connections with school districts. 
He was not even old enough to have a driver's licence. 
Profit is the problem.  
I am happy to announce that George Chuvalo will be attending as well. 
George has lost three of his kids to heroin.  
I invite all members to show their support. 
There will be local and provincial politicians there. 
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
One issue is the definition of a victim. 
It is there in this bill and it is defined. 
Can we not make a better definition of what a victim is?  
I am sure my colleague could speak a lot better than I on this subject. 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
The member for Langley-Abbotsford lives in a community neighbouring mine. 
It made a lot of sense, particularly in the area of victims rights. 
I want to thank him for taking a stand on that. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague. 
We do not have a unique market on compassion in this party. 
It is all through the House.  
We have seen a lot of crime in our day. 
We have seen a lot of victims. 
This is no small issue. 
I think the government has the message now. 
It is on the first step of the ladder. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
I know the reason the member worked so hard on that bill. 
It just was not answering the call.  
A number of organizations commended him. 
To me that presents a serious problem. 
In 1996 a valuable document was presented in the House. 
It is extremely serious. 
That is one issue. 
We cannot have a three year delay. 
Three years can be terribly disastrous to a number of individuals.  
His victims lived in Saskatchewan and were killed on an Alberta highway. 
At the scene the individual was very upset that it had happened. 
He admitted his guilt. 
It was proven that he was terribly intoxicated. 
Yet it took 18 court cases to deal with what seemed so obvious. 
He immediately pleaded guilty. 
He was immediately remorseful. 
All the things were in the right place to deal with it.  
He was obviously guilty and had pleaded guilty.  
I have become well aware of them over a period of time. 
It needs to be firm. 
It needs to be fair. 
The victims have been calling for it for ages. 
A five year old girl in Calgary went missing. 
By evening they found her in a dumpster. 
She had been murdered. 
It was very sad. 
They found the person responsible for her death. 
It was a next door neighbour who lived across the alley behind them. 
He had taken the little girl out of her yard.  
He was 47 years old. 
They spent time and energy on him. 
The 47 year old individual received psychological guidance. 
He even went to the hospital to be checked over. 
All kinds of assistance were overflowing from our system to him.  
The only counselling they got was from friends. 
There was no program offered to help them overcome the grief they were going through.  
For months and months it went on. 
We recognize the serious problems faced by victims in the land. 
1999 rolls along and we finally get to doing something about it. 
What kind of a procedure is that?  
The government announced that something had to be done with that act. 
Now it is 1999 and, lo and behold, we are to have a new act. 
Nothing has changed in the meantime. 
There are still all kinds of problems. 
We have to get at it. 
We have to consider it to be extremely serious and deal with it. 
I do not believe that for a moment. 
A lot of it has to do with poverty. 
It seems to me like it is going in the wrong direction.  
Why can we not make victims of crime our priority? 
Young people are a big part of the problem of being victims. 
They are victims of poverty. 
We could only speculate from that point on.  
Hon. members can object to the spending of money as I just mentioned I did. 
That is a very good thing to do. 
In Vancouver alone over 300 young people have died this year because of drugs. 
Victims are growing by the numbers.  
I encourage all members to get behind the bill and support it. 
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
Can he tell us the reason for this 18 time requirement?  
Mr. Speaker, it is difficult for me to do that. 
I only know of the one time that it was delayed. 
We had a drunk driver who killed four people. 
Pray tell, what difference would the person's nationality make? 
They thought it should have been a lot more severe than it was.  
That is the only incident that I can definitely say happened. 
I do not really know about the other times.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
I would like to pursue this a bit further. 
As he has pointed out, this does have a relationship to crime. 
It marginalizes people and involves them in taking on a criminal lifestyle.  
This will enable us to put chronic addicts into the medical system. 
I am talking about a genuine need. 
That is where we would expect the dollars to go.  
We would also expect the dollars to go into native affairs. 
We need a system that is going to help as best it can. 
That certainly has a bearing on what happens out in the rest of the world. 
It hardly makes sense to me.  
These are children who are victims. 
Why do we want to treat those people so kindly? 
We have to take these criminals a little more seriously. 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
I guess three years late is better than not at all.  
I have several concerns with the legislation. 
Nowhere is the definition of a victim clearly spelled out. 
This legislation has been introduced into the House of Commons. 
One would think that is pretty common and that it is already done. 
Surprisingly, it is not already done.  
It is far past the time that this recognition be granted. 
The government has given victims a choice. 
They can read the victim impact statement in court. 
As I said, this was never a choice which they had before.  
They can be protected from cross-examination by the offender. 
How can it possibly be that this was not a consideration before? 
In many cases a victim wants to make a statement during these hearings. 
That is what a first degree murder charge or conviction is. 
They have never had that opportunity. 
Finally these individuals will be given that opportunity.  
That is a given. 
Twenty minutes later, the vehicle stops. 
At the bottom the body rolls into the cold water of the river.  
How could there be anything more horrible, more appalling?  
``There is'', said the woman, ``the Canadian justice system''.  
The Canadian justice system.  
Here is a young woman whose life was destroyed. 
She was 18 at the time. 
She goes on to say about one of the rapists: 
I am angry because he is getting full parole. 
She does not understand why Lee has had the chance to get out of jail. 
``I felt that he would be there for the full 12 years. 
I became a terrible mother and I was a good mother before''.  
This is an individual whose total life has been destroyed. 
Both of them are out on parole.  
She is going through this time and time again. 
Her medication bills are $165 a month. 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
There is another case in her constituency that I find quite troubling. 
A number of years ago a man murdered his wife, or killed his wife. 
We cannot call him a murderer because he was accused of manslaughter. 
He served part of his time. 
He got five years. 
He was trying to have his kids visit him. 
These kids are victims. 
They are his kids and he killed their mother. 
He was trying to force them into having visits with him. 
I am sure she is aware of the case I am talking about. 
I wonder if she has any comments on that issue.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Surrey North for bringing up that issue. 
It is not one that is easy to forget.  
He tried to hide it. 
He was convicted of manslaughter. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
This initiative goes back a long way, in fact back to 1996. 
For too long, victims were the forgotten element in an impersonal justice system. 
The member for Langley-Abbotsford is to be commended for his tenacity and his vision.  
That took another three years. 
Another broken covenant by this lethargic government. 
It is regrettable that the government can never complete the job. 
After all, who is accused here?  
Until now the victim's safety was a passing thought.  
It is a good move. 
It is unfortunate that it has taken four years.  
We have one concern. 
Bill C-79 will make some changes to the application of this surcharge. 
The new charge will be 15% of any fine imposed on the offender. 
Another is the Young Offenders Act for 10 year olds and 11 year olds. 
All parties in the committee requested it. 
We did not get what the committee asked for. 
This is a government run by bureaucrats, not by elected officials.  
We will work hard to complete the task. 
He was arrested in September 1997. 
I talked earlier about some of the things that are not done in the bill. 
Some of them are under provincial jurisdiction, for instance plea bargaining. 
They could have been included in the bill. 
There is nothing in the legislation which allows that to happen.  
Most of all, victims should not have to wait for somewhere down the line. 
That is not in the bill, and that is not helping victims. 
The victim should have known about it. 
There is nothing in the law which says that has to happen. 
That is not right and that makes the bill not good enough.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it has been interesting to listen to the debate today. 
They do not feel they are part of what is going on. 
How do they get over that? 
It is not easy, but at least the victims could be part of the process.  
My colleague has also raised sentencing. 
These are issues the committee looked at. 
I talked earlier about plea bargaining. 
It is not here and it is unfortunate because it should be here. 
There is too much power in the PMO. 
There is too much control of what goes on in this place.  
All those things were discussed in committee. 
That has to change before parliament changes for the better.

Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
I ask hon. members to please address their remarks through the Chair.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is also for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
My question is simple. 
What specific diplomatic initiatives will Canada put on the table at the NATO summit?  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
The NATO summit in Washington gives Canada a clear opportunity to provide that leadership.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
I gave her a promotion.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is unbelievable. 
In most instances, that includes keeping your mouth shut''.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
I ask the hon. member to put his question.  
Mr. Speaker, it is very straightforward. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
We wanted to hear the question and we did. 
We will hear the answer.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:
Mr. Speaker, we have CF personnel in Aviano working as part of the air campaign. 
That is why we are over there. 
That is why we are over there.  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
The auditor general has one estimate. 
All Canadians want to pay their fair share of taxes. 
We are confident that they do that. 
We are looking at methods to ensure we give proper service to Canadians to- 
The hon. member for St. Albert.  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
They cannot make a living here and pay the taxes too. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let there be no doubt the government's revenues are up. 
They are up because corporate profitability is up. 
They are up because our exports are up. 
Our revenues are up because Canada's economy is up. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Seven years later, they are in the government. 
Why did they change their point of view?  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
That is the absolute truth. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we have seen no commitment from this government to reduce taxes at all. 
The finance minister has actually raised taxes over the past six years. 
Canadians are paying much more. 
Yesterday it was Nortel. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party sets up straw men. 
The fact is nobody thinks high taxes help the bottom line. 
That is why, as the Minister of National Revenue said- 
I would ask hon. members to keep their voices low. 
The hon. Minister of Finance will answer the question, if he so pleases.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Fact, technology partnerships that are going to help a number of our major industries. 
That is what this government has done.  
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member has matters confused. 
Therefore it falls within my responsibility.  
In fact they have been part of the negotiations. 
We will take up the matter directly with the secretary of state on Friday.  
Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The hon. member for Kitchener Centre.  
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, those fluffy questions just warm my heart.  
They fear for themselves, their families and their children. 
So far as we know the minister has done nothing. 
What has she done? 
When will she act?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this person was convicted; please remember that he was convicted. 
When he was released from jail he then entered back in as chief. 
Band members are frightened and they are worried sick. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
As I already mentioned we increased the number of enforcement officers. 
The hon. member opposite was one of the ones to complain about those measures. 
He is consulting with the fishing community and he is doing the right thing.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
I hope, sir, that you will understand- 
The hon. member will address his remarks to the Chair.  
The hon. Minister of National Defence.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I think the people from the fifth party are hallucinating. 
Neither one of them mentions the Canadian forces at all.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
It is a war of improvization. 
We have gone from 6 planes to 18, and perhaps more. 
One month of war, no information, no consultation, no vote.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
There was consultation after consultation.  
We were transparent, consulted and provided the necessary information.  
Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau, Lib.):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Unfortunately, despite all the requests, he has never made it public. 
We have asked him a number of times.  
The hon. government House leader.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
The conflict of interest code is a public document. 
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
Did the government not learn its lesson?  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
As well he has increased the enforcement measures.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
These are the rules that are in question. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
We in this House know that bill 602P does not exist. 
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO COMMITTEE REPORT 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Journalists had copies of this report as early as noon yesterday.  
We have other examples as well which I could list. 
A government, if it is to survive, must respect parliament and parliamentarians. 
It must respect its authority and grant its members dignity. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on the same point of privilege. 
It was basically about the same matter.  
I think there are really two questions here. 
We all could have commented in the dark. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
If that occurred, I will verify that as well.  
I hope it did not happen and that this is not the case. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
That is what we hear time and time again. 
I would suggest that two things occur here. 
That is unfortunately what we have degraded to in the House. 
It is very unfortunate indeed.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I do not mean to belabour this point. 
It does not seem to be enough.  
I am afraid that is what it is going to take. 
There are two points to be considered. 
I was listening and he did not do so. 
There are at least two points that I want to deal with. 
Perhaps these things happen. 
However, I would hope that matters of courtesy would be extended to all hon. members.  
Time and time again we come back and say this should be done. 
This will be done. 
This will be done, and we have gone far enough.  
That is my understanding.  
We cannot keep going around in circles.  
I understand that the committee on procedure is going to table its report. 
In the meantime, we have to deal with what we have on our plate here. 
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
Their 18 year old daughter was murdered. 
Today, if she had lived, she would be 33 years of age.  
Inge Clausen is an activist. 
She cares passionately about issues that affect this country. 
She did not sit in her grief and do nothing. 
However, by 1997 there was little government action. 
It is just that some of us are more victims than others.  
Canadians have felt that their judicial system has looked solely at the criminal. 
Victims of crime are often double victims. 
They become victims in the courtrooms and on witness stands all across the nation.  
This legislation is long in coming. 
What was the topic? 
The victims bill of rights. 
My hon. colleague spoke passionately, just as he did earlier today. 
Time after time the overflow crowd clapped and cheered with their agreement. 
My thanks go to him. 
He is a man of courage and he is a man of action.  
Until now the system has aimed all of its resources toward the accused. 
They feel they have been dirtied by a criminal act. 
Today's society in Canada is filled with victims. 
No matter how efficient the justice system is nothing will ever bring back their daughter. 
My sympathies go out to them. 
That was a senseless act of violence.  
Reena Virk's parents and her family are victims of a senseless crime. 
These people deserve justice also.  
The need is not a new one. 
The previous justice minister for instance stated in 1996: 
There remains a great deal to be done.  
Indeed there still remains a great deal to be done. 
It has taken two years for this response. 
I am not a lawyer. 
Some of those people had been victims of various different crimes. 
Listening and working with these people were never easy. 
Their faces and their lives were literally filled with pain. 
What these people are looking for is peace, peace within their souls. 
Sometimes we need to go well beyond party politics. 
It is too late for many victims of the past. 
However it is not too late for the victims of today and tomorrow.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
I see some shocked looks on the other side.  
It is an important first step. 
They have seen the need to make some of the changes we see today.  
What does the bill do that we are debating today? 
That is an important step.  
Victims will have the choice to read a victim impact statement in court. 
I hope that it will receive speedy passage.  
I asked three questions. 
Do you favour or oppose this practice?'' 
This is pretty straightforward. 
They can distinguish between right and wrong. 
They can distinguish between where the punishment should match the crime. 
He received a certain amount of local media attention.  
I had a tough couple of hours meeting with those young victims. 
He did not have to serve a day in jail. 
One is that your family must be responsible for you''. 
An 11 o'clock curfew for Mr. Gervais was put in place. 
He must be home by 11 o'clock at night. 
What possible good will an 11 o'clock curfew do? 
That particular case is being appealed.  
I raised a second case in the House as early as October 1996. 
It involved a young mother in my riding. 
She was sexually assaulted in her own home by a former spouse. 
He found the accused guilty. 
Imagine the sense the victim had. 
And we are here today to discuss victims rights. 
This was a very tough issue for me to deal with. 
I have had some conversations with her mother. 
He received four years for effectively murdering this young woman. 
I put forward Motion No. 577 which stated: 
This is a vitally important first step. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
According to Statistics Canada, tragically there were about 75 spousal homicides in 1997. 
That is what those hard statistics mean.  
Spousal killings are often preceded by a history of violence. 
Homicides involving family members totalled 4,193.  
But it does not have a legislative mandate and it does not have funding.  
I have two questions for the member.  
The second question I have for the hon. member has to do with family violence. 
It was rather interesting that the member talked about statistics. 
His party did not support the gun control legislation. 
The member should be supporting the government on initiatives such as gun control.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I rise very briefly on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House to move the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas-Charlottenburgh, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Does the House agree to the suggestion of the chief government whip?  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague across the way for her two comments.  
There are things her government can do to help prevent those types of deaths. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
It is a very solemn debate. 
We are talking about issues of life and death. 
I do not know whether many people have thought of it this way.  
Many of us know him as Paul. 
It was dastardly, unbelievable and totally unacceptable.  
I know there is a balance to be reached here. 
Some of these families struggled for years in their search for closure.  
They did not find her for a number of weeks. 
When they did, she was in an abandoned shed. 
She had been strangled and left there in the cold. 
The murderer has never been found. 
There are other things as well that people do which are illegal.  
This is a day of celebration in the House for an accomplishment. 
The Reform Party to which I belong is now 10 years old. 
In many cases they cannot afford it and have to go without. 
I am very happy this is happening here today. 
It is a step in the right direction. 
It is one which is long overdue, 10, 20, 30 years overdue. 
I have been the victim of minor crimes, but no major crimes. 
That is certainly true. 
Of course we do not want that.  
That is not what this talks about. 
I think it is a very great step forward.  
This is one area in which I think we should do a great deal. 
I am talking about things like breaking and entering, robberies, sometimes vandalism.  
We should place into law the principle of restitution. 
I suppose I should tell the House about the one thing I did. 
Maybe there were two, but I can only remember one. 
They were called displaced persons at that time. 
Some thought that was a derogatory term. 
There were about three or four of us young fellows. 
I think I was the youngest of the group. 
However, there was an empty farmhouse and there was gravel on the road. 
My father is a very wise man. 
He found out about it. 
He was the man who owned the property.  
Dad and I went. 
I am sorry and I want you to forgive me. 
I thank my father for doing that for me when I needed it. 
If one starts there, who knows what will come next. 
There is no way that young man's vision can be restored. 
He is blind for life. 
His eyes are gone. 
There is no restitution available. 
There has to be punishment for them.  
Perhaps I have a slightly novel approach to this. 
I believe that we should build morality into our young people. 
I do not buy that.  
When I was young we were very poor. 
I know that we need to do everything we can to alleviate poverty. 
There is no doubt about it. 
That just does not wash.  
We need to get down to some really solid principles. 
They make eminently great sense. 
I congratulate all members for what I expect will be unanimous support.  
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
They are almost all young men. 
We have a moral void with all of this moral relativism in our society.  
When I worked there I was young myself. 
I am now getting on, by a few more years.  
I believe that those are very important issues.  
I think that prevention is absolutely mandatory.  
We have to kick that into high gear. 
We have flagged on it. 
Our families are struggling. 
Many of them are in conflict because of high taxation. 
As a result our families are not as strong as they ought to be.  
This is one of the motivators of crime. 
Many of our young people get hooked on different kinds of drugs. 
Otherwise we have chaos in the country. 
We are all subject to authority. 
I would provide work experience. 
I know of a person who does this in his work with Manitoba justice. 
They provide work for these young men. 
It gives them a sense of accomplishment. 
They actually work for their food. 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
It turned out that she had been murdered in Winnipeg. 
The young girl's name was Candace and a book was written about her. 
I would like to acknowledge the mother who actually wrote that book, Wilma Derksen.  
Mr. Speaker, I think this works best at a younger age. 
I believe we have to captivate young people as early as possible. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
We want to change that around.  
To my knowledge that simply is not happening right now. 
They do not know where the person is or where that person is going. 
The concept of protection of victims too is important. 
What kind of message does that send to the criminal element? 
What can we do? 
My colleagues have mentioned many constructive suggestions.  
Their drug abuse and psychiatric and psychological problems were not being treated.  
There are things we can do. 
They are essential but they are optional. 
As I mentioned before, restitution is one of them. 
Treatment is another option that they have to engage in. 
We also need to look at the police. 
Many career criminals think it is a joke for obvious reasons. 
For others, there are different options.  
The RCMP do not have the resources to do the job. 
They had to close down their training facility. 
They do not have the helicopters they require. 
Nobody in the House, no law-abiding citizen in the country wants anarchy.  
Why put in numerous unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles?  
My colleague from Elk Island articulated the issue of prevention very clearly. 
She was the last one that I had seen recently.  
I was quite surprised that she was alive. 
The life she has been living is remarkable. 
I asked how she was getting the money when she was unemployed. 
This situation did not materialize for this little girl as a 13 year old. 
She came from a tragic environment. 
I had met her two other friends a few years ago. 
I saw treated them in jail. 
They were 14 and 15 years old at the time. 
They had already been on the streets prostituting for a while. 
They were IV drug abusers. 
A year after that I found her friend. 
I was walking through a pediatric ward and I saw her there. 
This is not uncommon.  
It is the leading cause of preventable brain damage in our country today. 
It is a silent epidemic.  
The average IQ of these people is 68. 
There is no going back. 
They engage in behaviour that puts them at the periphery of society. 
Then they end up in front of our justice system.  
What if we could prevent that? 
We can and need to do it. 
It involves whole communities.  
One-quarter of the people on the reserve had it. 
It is very difficult for them to do that. 
How do we prevent it?  
It was a leader in its field. 
How could they make them the best citizens possible? 
How could they put them on a level playing field with others?  
Essentially they worked with prevention. 
The parents and the children were brought together to strengthen the bond. 
Bad parents were taught how to be good parents. 
They were taught simple things such as disciplining a child. 
These studies looked at 1,600 random samplings of parents. 
There is a $6 to $7 saving for every dollar invested.  
There is a track record of prevention. 
This cuts across socioeconomic grounds. 
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I salute the member on his intervention. 
There was not a word that he said that I disagreed with. 
He deserves a great deal of credit. 
I have tried to use many of his ideas because they are just plain good. 
They are great ideas. 
I thank him for his long term involvement in this issue. 
He has been a true national leader on this issue.  
The secretary of state's intervention is good. 
Much of that has been used in other headstart programs.  
I am hoping that this will be a national program. 
I envision that three sections can be used.  
The first is to use the medical community at time zero. 
All women go to their doctors during the course of their pregnancy. 
They can teach people how to be good parents. 
We have seen the need for that in our country.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
There is one area in which I need some clarification.  
He spoke compellingly about the head start program. 
We know that in the head start program there is discretion. 
He said that there is no financial cut-off. 
The member talked about parole eligibility. 
I know that he wanted to be clear on this. 
Mr. Speaker, indeed, the parole board must have that discretion.  
I think they should be treated very differently.  
I think we would save money in the end.  
I would like to hear the hon. member's comments on that issue.  
Mr. Speaker, I will briefly answer three questions. 
The first question concerns prevention. 
We can use existing resources to engage in prevention. 
There is a smattering of organizations across the country which are engaging in prevention. 
We are in favour of having a delay period. 
It is called economic cost. 
The fact is that gun registries do not work. 
The government is now finding this out. 
I had this conversation with members opposite.  
That is the reason we oppose it. 
That is why we are opposed to it. 
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
I extend congratulations to my colleagues from Surrey North and Langley-Abbotsford. 
Does this bill address the concerns of these victims? 
It contains only very minor rejigging of procedure. 
Anyone at any time can be the victim of a home invasion. 
The elderly are described as the victims of choice.  
There were only 10 in all of last year. 
People are the target of home invasions. 
Victims are tortured into giving up property.  
Convicted offenders often do not go to jail. 
In short, no additional punishment is given for home invasion.  
Exceptional crimes require exceptional measures. 
He was covered by a chest of drawers and his walker.  
The daughter suffered from frostbite on her feet.  
The courts must take a hard line on home invasions. 
I will focus on Mr. Havelock's comments on home invasions. 
All of them are calling for action from the justice minister. 
So too am I. 
The criminal is concealed from others behind closed doors. 
Commonly sentences are served concurrently, not consecutively.  
A school invasion is taking place by armed youths. 
An armed assault is being made and students are being held hostage. 
Many deaths have occurred. 
This is the challenge of the future. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
I am writing this letter in regard to the parole hearing of Jack Edgar. 
I am aware that Jack will receive a copy of this letter. 
This man was my stepfather. 
In part she wrote: 
My children have missed so much. 
I have done this for my children, for my mom and for my aunt. 
The thought of him being released terrifies me. 
I should not have to live in fear of what he may do next. 
Releasing Jack is a violation of my right to safety. 
My fears are real and grounded and shared by many.  
If Jack is released, there will be no money, no power, no position. 
The ``important'' people will no longer be there for him. 
He is a convicted double murderer. 
I fear he is a man with little to lose.  
There is, however, another side to Jack Edgar which no one can predict.  
There is however another side to Jack Edgar which no one can predict. 
This side of Jack is still there. 
Then she named some other people. 
She wants to feel safe in knowing that this person will probably never be released. 
That is what she wants. 
She wants to be able to read that impact statement herself at a parole hearing.  
Unfortunately the legislation does not provide for that. 
It does nothing to provide for that. 
Let us carry forth and do a lot more to help victims of crime.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the suggestion of the deputy government whip. 
Is there unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The question is on the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The House resumed from April 13 consideration of the motion.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
And the bells having rung: 
Then we will do the same for those who are opposed.  
(The House divided on the motion, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the motion defeated.  
ALLOTTED DAY-THE BALKANS 
(The House divided on the amendment, which was negatived on the following division:)

The next question is on the main motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was negatived on the following division:)

(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
(Bill read the third time and passed) 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
CANADIAN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ACT 
I offer my sincere thanks to the Minister of the Environment. 
For that I say, thanks.  
Specifically I cite some names.  
My bill falls in line with this.  
This can no longer go unchecked.  
The potential impacts are as severe as they are broad. 
The fact is that lead sinkers are deemed to be a highly toxic substance. 
The fact is lead sinkers are killing our waterfowl. 
This fact is also irrefutable.  
There are also many other areas where lead sinkers may be having serious implications. 
Make no mistake, there are alternatives available.  
Their commitment has been unequalled. 
An example is lead based paints. 
For years there was no question as to the use of lead based paint. 
I think back to the days of fishing out in Georgian Bay. 
To this end this initiative has been very successful. 
There have been other positive suggestions that have come forward. 
As I said, make no mistake, there are viable alternatives out there. 
This is not a bad thing. 
Any fact based position must be able to stand the test of challenge.  
I am more than happy to listen to their addresses.  
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
The birds may also eat fish that have swallowed a sinker. 
In its 1995 report entitled ``It's About Our Health! 
To date the government has only used legislation that is explicitly federal in nature. 
I wish to congratulate my hon. colleague from Simcoe-Grey for his admirable initiative. 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
When it decomposes in the environment, lead can contaminate soil and water. 
Lead sinkers and jigs are used exclusively by anglers. 
These are the users that must be targeted if this hazard is to be eliminated. 
These materials are not toxic to birds. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
I do not need a lengthy study to convince me of the hazards. 
I do not think we have to go through that whole process again with fish. 
Gas sniffing was a serious problem in some northern Manitoba communities. 
When lead was a gas additive the consequences were very apparent. 
I am not willing to get caught up in the federal-provincial issue. 
I hope we pursue a ban at the federal level.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
The motion brought forward is indeed very constructive. 
We are now seeing trout species returning to our area. 
We are now seeing Atlantic salmon returning to these rivers. 
This debate is indeed very constructive. 
I know he will be returning to the House in a number of weeks. 
Perhaps he is looking over some things to read. 
It is a regulation that actually could be made.  
This is not unprecedented. 
This is an environmental initiative on which I believe we should move forward. 
We should take our time. 
We have to ensure that we do this in a very prudent way.  
I compliment the member for Simcoe-Grey for bringing this debate forward. 
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):
Parliamentarians and the Canadian public have reason to be concerned. 
Non-toxic types of fishing sinkers and jigs must become the norm.  
The meeting is scheduled for this fall. 
These areas were mostly in eastern Canada. 
In addition, a province-wide ban was introduced in British Columbia.  
A full national ban comes into effect this fall.  
I should emphasize an earlier point. 
As always, we are using scientific research as the basis for our actions.  
This represents about 12% of all lead releases to the environment.  
Individual Canadians have helped Environment Canada in developing the science in this field. 
Canadians play an important role.  
We always have the possibility of regulation when it is appropriate. 
His interest and continued action in the environment are most commendable. 
I am sure his constituents must be very proud of his accomplishments.  
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
It is just that the means appear to be somewhat different.  
There was some talk of constitutionality and whether it would be upheld. 
I believe the environment is a federal responsibility. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House adjourned at 7.39 p.m.)
