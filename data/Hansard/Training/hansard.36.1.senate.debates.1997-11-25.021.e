Tuesday, November 25, 1997 
The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Welcome to the Senate, Mr. Speaker. 
The Late Honourable John Sopinka, Q.C. 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
John and I were both members of the class of 1958. 
Bora Laskin taught labour law, real property and constitutional law. 
J. B. Milner taught contracts. 
John Sopinka had a quick body and a quicker mind. 
John came from a minority group. 
He was instinctively and spontaneously on the side of the underdog. 
He was such a great competitor. 
History will better judge the consequences.  
John also had a wicked sense of humour. 
Then he would dismember that student's response with his critical exegesis. 
John took his turn bravely and weathered the storm. 
Several weeks later, the same scene was repeated.When 
Nice to see you for the first time. 
The loss of John Sopinka is a tragedy. 
He was cut down in the prime of a brilliant judicial career. 
There are but two solaces that remain. 
Thence, in time, we shall go by the awful grace of God. 
The smaller solace is that John will not be forgotten. 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Honourable senators, I also wish to pay tribute to the Honourable John Sopinka. 
I particularly wish to remember John Sopinka as a person from a minority. 
Coming from an immigrant background is not unusual in Canada. 
He defended individual rights as bestowed in the Charter with great tenacity.  
He was always available and open to meeting with delegations. 
However, practically it lacked something. 
That, of course, was Ray Hnatyshyn's.  
Therefore, he was a role model and a great Canadian at the same time.  
Last week, on November 20, we recognized National Child Day. 
History of Sport in Canada 
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
I should tell honourable senators a little about its history.  
Canadians have truly made this sport their very own.  
Then, in 1820, a club was formed in Kingston, Ontario. 
The third oldest club in Canada was formed in Halifax in 1824. 
Then, as the game moved westward, curling just took off:
The first Canadian World Championship was held in 1961. 
I know that you will all be proud of their performance.  
Pages Exchange Program With House of Commons 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I would point out that Jules is brother to Senate Page Jeffrey.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
First Report of Special Joint Committee Tabled 
The Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
( For text of report, see today's Journals of the Senate.)  
The Estimates, 1997-98 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Anti-Personnel Mines Convention Implementation Bill 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Governement) :
With leave, tomorrow, honourable senators.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Notice of Motion to Authorize Committee to Engage Services 
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Wednesday next, November 26, 1997, I will move: 
Business of the Senate 
Notice of Refusal to Answer Order Paper Questions-Government Position 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
We will march onward and see what happens come Easter.  
My question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
I hope that is not the case. 
Is it simply a reflection of this winter of discontent?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I am not an unreasonable person. 
I do not want to compromise negotiations. 
Honourable senators, I assure the honourable senator that negotiations are taking place. 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, my question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
It is not merely my suggestion or my wish; it is the government's undertaking. 
Will the government keep that undertaking?  
Honourable senators, I will review the matter and report to my honourable friend.  
Hon. Eric Arthur Berntson :
I have a couple of questions arising from that. 
First, who is "me" in this response? 
Is that the Minister of Justice or some lesser light in the Department of Justice?  
Second, I have checked to see just what is before the courts. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I understand that efforts have been made to connect the parties responsible.  
To quote their paper: 
They may simply avoid retirement savings plans that generate heavily taxed income...  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, this is a significant issue. 
Seniors as a whole do not know about this. 
May I ask what that is?  
This is a matter I have referred to before. 
Surely you cannot believe that.

Answers to Order Paper Questions Tabled 
Human Resources Development-Employment Insurance Fund Surplus 
He said, and I quote: 
We began our hearings on October 22, 1997, and concluded on November 4, 1997. 
In 10 days of sittings, we heard from more than 60 individual witnesses and groups. 
We received written submissions from nearly 70 individuals and groups.  
They were united in their support of linguistic school boards. 
In brief, those goals are about equality, pluralism, and non-discrimination. 
In other words, democracy and parental choice have prevailed.  
We asked several constitutional law experts for their assistance in answering that question. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, we are dealing again with a constitutional resolution. 
These hearings were required because there were no parliamentary hearings in Quebec. 
There was already an important consensus that we acknowledged. 
That is what we have done.  
We heard different points of view. 
I would like to make several quick comments on some points. 
My first comment is on section 43.  
The Constitution Act of 1982 provides for five amending formulas. 
All experts agree on this point. 
The English wording of section 43 is clearer than the French. 
In Quebec, only the introductory wording will remain. 
The reverse is not, however, stated in section 93. 
My second comment is on the present section 93. 
Section 93 met the needs of 1867. 
Everyone, or nearly everyone, was Protestant or Catholic. 
My third comment concerns religious education. 
This debate is not going on only in Quebec, in Newfoundland or in Canada. 
It is also taking place in some of our major democracies. 
It is normal in our modern society for governments to legislate education. 
It is one of their major responsibilities. 
All that is needed is a proclamation by the National Assembly. 
It is up to Quebec to decide.  
On motion of Senator Wood, debate adjourned.  
Persons Case National Historic Park Bill 
Briefly, I have provided honourable senators with some background information. 
My purpose, first, is to give you a short summary of the bill. 
I will now address the importance of the park. 
The park would commemorate the "Persons Case." 
Sadly, few Canadians know about the "Persons Case" at all. 
It is worth commenting on the location of the park. 
The visibility of the site is important. 
The block that the park would be on is very interesting. 
It is green space. 
There is value added here. 
This is a very popular site for the citizens of Ottawa. 
The local paper, The Ottawa Citizen , did a survey. 
Surely, it must appeal to all of us. 
I hope that honourable senators reflect on that connection.  
The building physically started to fall apart in 1964. 
Eventually, the building was torn down.  
The National Capital Commission has been busy consulting with local developers. 
There is currently a short-list under consideration. 
Therefore, there is some urgency relating to this bill. 
This is not a money bill. 
We have examined the question very carefully. 
Honourable senators need not be concerned on that score.  
I am assured that the bill is in order constitutionally. 
Finally, I wish to thank the seconder of the bill, Senator Andreychuk. 
She has come forward with some terrific ideas. 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
This is the domain of all Canadian citizens.  
Many of these visitors are non-Canadians.  
Such reflection makes us better Canadians; it makes Canada a better place.  
I believe we can. 
I have indicated that the "Persons Case" is important. 
I have read the many statements made by senators over the years. 
Emily Murphy was appointed the first woman police magistrate in 1916. 
Other lawyers repeated this objection.  
Thus, women had been excluded in 1867, and they were to be excluded in 1928.  
The lords said that Canada was growing and changing, and so must its constitution. 
What was unique about these women? 
Why should there be a park at the Daly site? 
The internees paid great dividends. 
The story also has a sadly ironic dimension. 
For thousands of men, the parks meant confinement, isolation, and toil.  
Unfortunately, the spirit behind them seems to have been forgotten. 
These men deserve better.  
We can blend the parks concept with the persons concept. 
Hon. Philippe Deane Gigantes :
It is a great idea. 
I thank both honourable senators.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?

Social Affairs, Science and Technology 
Committee Authorized to Study Future of Canadian War Museum 
Hon. Philippe Deane Gigantes :
Honourable senators, I support what Senator Phillips is proposing in this motion. 
It is a good idea. 
I do not think the veterans are being anti-Semitic. 
They were truly the guys in the white hats.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Orville H. Phillips :

Legal and Constitutional Affairs 
Committee Authorizedto Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
Hon. Lorna Milne , pursuant to notice of November 20, 1997, moved: 
Hon. John B. Stewart :
May I ask the Honourable Senator Milne a question concerning the motion?  
This motion relates to tomorrow's sitting of the Senate. 
I assure my honourable friend that I do not know anything of the sort. 
I am merely hedging my bets.  
Hon. Philippe Deane Gigantes :
May I ask a question of Senator Milne?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Senate adjourned until Wednesday, November 26, 1997, at 1:30 p.m.
