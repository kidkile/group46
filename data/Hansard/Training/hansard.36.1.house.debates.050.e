EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 50 
Monday, February 2, 1998 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
I wish him all the very best on returning to the House.  
That is not what we are discussing here. 
What happens if our judgment happens to have been wrong? 
It is then too late to change it.  
I have a son Peter who is severely handicapped, intellectually handicapped. 
I remember meeting with a renal surgeon at the Montreal General Hospital. 
Who are we to decide? 
Today some will hold that Peter should not have been born at all. 
He brought a tremendous amount of comfort to our life. 
He brought an example. 
I rejoice in his life. 
I rejoice in the life of every person. 
Every person has the right to live. 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
That motion, if adopted as amended, would read as follows: 
It does not have the right to bury its head in the sand.  
Unfortunately, this care is not always the panacea it is made out to be. 
The decision to resort to euthanasia rests with the person. 
It is an extremely important decision. 
The decision rests with the person alone.  
Such concerns are understandable and legitimate. 
A large number of assisted suicides are conducted illegally. 
This situation has an adverse effect on the dignity of the person. 
A parallel can be made with the abortion issue. 
Abortion was long considered a criminal act. 
Charlatans and quackery have disappeared. 
I hope Motion M-123 will get the support of a majority of parliamentarians. 
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):
In the 1990s people are now able to live longer than ever before. 
Every attempt died on the order paper.  
There are several countries that have been utilizing some form of euthanasia. 
Many Canadians believe that allowing individuals to die with dignity is a reasonable proposition. 
There appears to be growing support among Canadian for the concept of euthanasia.  
Let us look at the down side. 
These guidelines were developed following a series of court decisions. 
The patient must repeatedly and explicitly express the desire to die time and time again. 
The euthanasia must be carried out by a qualified physician. 
The physician must inform the local coroner that euthanasia has been carried out.  
The courts should not be making the laws of the land. 
Members of Parliament must accept that responsibility. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
When are these actions legally acceptable? 
More important, when are they ethically and morally acceptable.  
His reply was that she was old and was now mentally handicapped. 
I argued and pushed for her to have the treatments. 
She remained very strong physically but her life was certainly limited. 
My life was devoted to her care.  
I never believed that I would be asked that question. 
I did not believe it was for me to answer that question. 
It was her life. 
More than anything, she loved being alive. 
Her way of life was different. 
It was limited but it was full of joy. 
She wanted to be with her grandchildren and she wanted to be with me. 
That was all that mattered and she loved it. 
They were intrigued and fascinated by this question. 
It was immediately something important to them. 
He wanted to know more and to talk more.  
Where should we be going? 
What historical perspective do we need on this issue? 
Then we will not be caught out. 
We will be able to discuss death and we will not be afraid of it. 
I support this motion.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
What is this motion really about? 
We need to recognize it is part of a political process. 
Instead of a motion that asks specifically to permit euthanasia, it is legislation by degrees. 
Any patient has the right to deny further treatment.  
They speak of dying with dignity. 
He had terminal cancer. 
He told me ``It is tough to say goodbye. 
That account with God was settled long ago''. 
He died with real dignity. 
That is the dignity of which I speak.  
In the past 30 years we have undergone a dramatic change in our thinking. 
That is a contradictory statement. 
I wish we would look again at our values and our true roots. 
Why do we think that death is an option? 
Is it because we despair of any other solution to our problems?  
His situation is very similar to that of my family. 
She was born with cerebral palsy. 
She cannot look after herself. 
She cannot dress herself. 
She needs help with eating. 
That is a false assumption.  
The cottages are brightly coloured. 
They are named after birds. 
On Wednesday the bus would go to the Swan cottage. 
There would be 20 to 30 people each day. 
There are 430 residents living there so it would take a whole month. 
I cannot say it strongly enough. 
There will be some who will argue why not have a committee study it. 
The Senate committee has engaged in a prolonged study on this. 
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
It is a sad day when legislators yield the legislative floor to jurists. 
The legislation appears to be merciful. 
Who can be against mercy? 
It is called mercy killing by some. 
First, consent is almost always problematic. 
Second, systemic flaws inevitably result in abuse. 
Fourth, the relief of pain and suffering is the only appropriate response for limited resources.  
The issue of consent is a troublesome one. 
The giving of consent must be voluntary and free of coercion. 
It can be revoked at any time. 
It is a matter of daily litigation in our courts. 
At best consent is temporal; at worst it is meaningless. 
These weaknesses have manifested themselves in a number of ways. 
Caveat, MADD and such organizations exemplify flaws in the justice system. 
Evidence disappears with disturbing regularity. 
Witnesses contradict themselves and each other. 
This is as good as the system gets in the world. 
A few years ago parliament saw fit to abolish capital punishment. 
We are under continuous pressure to free up resources. 
In summary, Mr. Justice Sopinka was right. 
No system, no matter how carefully devised, will be free of abuse and misuse. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
As such, our party will be voting on this motion accordingly.  
The questions may be simple; the answers certainly are not.  
Creating life, as ending it, inevitably prompts an atmosphere of controversy. 
Let us consider the arguments of euthanasia proponents. 
Medical ethics make the distinction between active and passive euthanasia. 
There are others who clearly reject the clear-cut distinction between active and passive euthanasia. 
Philosopher James Rachels wrote the following to support this view: 
That principle however is paramount.  
They believe that allowing for active euthanasia will lead to abuses. 
This is again a grave concern. 
I am pleased to speak on this issue. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
INCOME TAX AMENDMENTS ACT, 1997 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Last year 363,000 new jobs were created. 
It starts applying this higher cash floor one year earlier than originally slated.  
As a result they have been closely scrutinized by private sector experts. 
They have supported our action plan. 
Without their support our success would not have been possible.  
No objective observer can question what had to be done. 
That is one dollar in every five. 
We worked hard to make these cuts as fair as possible. 
This deficit cutting exercise was transparent. 
It was done in consultation with Canadians and their provincial governments. 
I had better repeat that just so we are very clear. 
These tax points have been provided to the provinces over the years. 
This was not devised by some bureaucrats in the back room. 
This was not a figure that was pulled out of the air. 
It is the precise amount recommended by the National Forum on Health.  
Some may be wondering where the extra money came from. 
The provinces get to keep the extra dividend. 
That is the source of the additional $1 billion.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Sadly I cannot support Bill C-28. 
My friend alluded to another problem just a minute ago. 
I am disappointed this is the first piece of legislation. 
The government could have made a better effort.  
Reformers are certainly supporters of a balanced budget. 
That is unfortunately not the case.  
This is from the Ottawa Citizen of Friday, January 30: 
Here are some of the findings: 
As the U.S. economy gets richer, it pays workers better. 
The same article goes on to say: 
And we cannot keep with the Americans when it comes to natural resources. 
My friends opposite want to paint a rosy picture. 
I do not buy it for a moment. 
I do not think that is any reason to break out the champagne. 
We still have a debt of $600 billion.  
People are concerned that perhaps the government has put on its rose coloured glasses.  
We do that by controlling the size and reach of governments. 
Let us resolve to give Canadians back some control.  
Right away Canadians have lost a substantial amount of control over their own lives. 
Half their income is gone which leaves them with fewer options. 
This makes it extraordinarily difficult. 
Sometimes people have to sacrifice these things and often they do. 
For 30 years the Conservative and Liberal governments did nothing. 
It is time for the government to begin giving up some control. 
Unfortunately that is what is happening. 
The government refuses to consider any of the options.  
However our power hungry government steadfastly refuses to do so. 
I do not know what else to attribute it to. 
The government refuses to allow Canadians to retain control over their own income. 
I do not understand why. 
That was the only option offered. 
It will drive a wedge between generations in years to come.  
The solution is obvious. 
We are about 25% higher than them in terms of the total economy. 
It would have benefits well beyond saving a few dollars. 
We might even have a criminal justice system in which Canadians have confidence.  
Imagine if we focused some of the savings on equipping our Canadian military? 
That is the sort of thing the federal government should focus on. 
My friend across the way is saying we need the money. 
Of course we need money. 
There are three steps in doing so. 
The second step is to secure our future by paying down debt. 
I could not believe it when I heard it.  
We have a debt of $600 billion. 
My friends across the way want to start spending again. 
I cannot believe how imprudent, how foolhardy that approach is. 
It is absolutely ridiculous.  
We need a plan to pay down the debt. 
A lot could be done with that $20 billion.  
I must point out to my friends across the way how imprudent they are. 
We have a debt of $600 billion. 
We have a global marketplace and a global environment. 
Unfortunately the government in its wisdom does not think it is a problem. 
It would rather take any surpluses and devote them to new spending.  
My final point is that we must create an environment for prosperity and opportunity. 
We should not be driving up taxes evermore. 
I will address that head on. 
We always hear about Canada's tolerance and compassion. 
Where is the tolerance and compassion in that? 
Let us elevate all those people. 
She had an income of about $18,000. 
She had to mortgage her home in order to pay income tax. 
She is paying thousands of dollars in taxes every year. 
There is a lot the government can do to help people. 
Bill C-28 is insubstantial stuff. 
It would go up dramatically. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I ask the hon. member to please listen to the debate.  
Thank you for your comment, Madam Speaker. 
What is this provision we find troublesome? 
It can be found in paragraphs 241(1) and (2). 
It is an apparent conflict of interest that could be very, very serious.  
This tax was to be paid annually to Revenue Canada. 
Right up to today these businesses have been paying tax annually. 
They are obliged to do so. 
Bill C-28 changes the rules for international marine transportation. 
Let us take Canada Steamship Lines Inc. as an example.  
Canada Steamship Lines Inc. deals in international shipping. 
It is a Canadian corporation owned by the CSL group. 
What would happen under Bill C-28? 
It is a change that applies specifically to Canadian shipping companies. 
One of them is Canada Steamship Lines.  
Need I tell you who owns Canada Steamship Lines? 
Who called for these amendments? 
They were not the ones calling for these amendments.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
He began with an interesting comment. 
I wonder where he has been in the last six or seven weeks. 
He obviously has not been in Canada but in some other country.  
They point out that 42% of young families today are living in poverty. 
Two out of five young families start their lives out in poverty. 
Today's papers talk about the student debt load. 
A $25,000 debt load is a huge albatross. 
They want to get their money out of here and buy American dollars. 
They look around and say that this does not look too good. 
Our dollar is at historic lows.  
Bankruptcies are now running at just under 10,000 a month. 
These are bankruptcies, when all else fails and you have to declare bankruptcy. 
There are 10,000 a month, year after year, month after month.  
Then there is this whole merger mania. 
Our two great big banks want to become one monster mega bank. 
This is going to be helpful to Canadian consumers and the small business entrepreneurs?  
He sure has not been in this country. 
He is obviously talking of some foreign country and I am not sure which one. 
He is on the finance committee as have been the other speakers.  
We heard stories of misery and of pain. 
We in this place should be embarrassed. 
We have some serious problems.  
They got preferential treatment and they did okay. 
They were not rescued.  
It is a Titanic economy. 
Some people are doing very well naturally. 
He has pulled off the con of a lifetime. 
Some provisions are very helpful to a lot of Canadian families.  
Increasing the encouragement for charitable giving is a good step. 
The minor support for the folks who are disabled is a good step.  
Then he asks where you are from and you say ``Alberta''. 
That is what these folks have done. 
Every cloud has a silver lining. 
Under the present system that would not take place.  
That means our patchwork quilt health care system will be emphasized. 
That is not what Canada is all about. 
That is not what a country is all about. 
We have to guard against that.  
What did he have to say? 
It went on and on and on. 
He went on at some length. 
I could quote at some length all the comments he made the other day.  
We have to take strong steps in that direction.  
My friends across the way say shame, and so they should.  
I said ``What is that?'' 
They were probably in their mid-forties. 
They were living on their own and were both on disability pensions of some kind. 
They were former drivers of Greyhound buses before it was changed. 
Perhaps my friends will answer that later today.  
What is happening is that we have a brain drain. 
Then Reformers talk about needing more tax cuts. 
I listened carefully to what my friends in the Reform Party suggested. 
It is an interesting view but I certainly do not share it.  
Canadians know that our tax system is corrupt. 
It is blatantly unfair. 
Will that restore confidence in our tax system? 
It will make it more convoluted, more complex and more biased.  
We have to reform our tax system. 
It is so complex it is beyond comprehension.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
The Liberal Party now wants free trade with everybody. 
It will sign a deal one day with Chile and the next with Israel. 
It denies the domestic economy the comparative advantage of free trade.  
That is a reasonable description of the bill.  
The Canadian economy needs too much tinkering. 
Perhaps we need a new vehicle. 
I propose that vehicle would be the policies being brought forward by the PC Party.  
High taxes kill jobs. 
I would use the same analogy potentially to describe the Liberal Party. 
It was not fat that they cut. 
As Tories we bear the heavy yoke of honest policy. 
It is a cobbled-up approach and it is not acceptable.  
The Minister of Finance has now begun talking about education. 
We expect more rhetoric. 
We do not really expect a lot of action.  
The fact is we cannot deal with this situation effectively. 
I went through Bill C-28. 
Highly educated and motivated Canadians are being forced to leave this country. 
We need bold action from the Minister of Finance to reverse this exodus. 
The U.S. tax code is actually far simpler than our tax code. 
In Canada the situation is more dire. 
Here we cannot basically deal with our own government without professional representation. 
This is clearly wrong.  
We are in an environment where disposable income has dropped by almost 6% since 1990. 
The minister speaks of lower interest rates and other positive economic indicators. 
That is not the right question. 
The question that should be asked is what is it not doing. 
The film industry is dealt with in this bill. 
In fact, it introduced it in Nova Scotia during the election. 
Nova Scotians are a fairly shrewd bunch of people. 
That exodus was certainly not a brain drain.  
This simply means that the cuts are going to stop. 
This formula continues to move toward a per capita calculation. 
Our choice is clear.  
Health care should be a priority for this government. 
We do not need to hear more rhetoric about this. 
We need to invest in medical sciences, research and development. 
What is government doing now that it should not be doing? 
What is it not doing that perhaps it should be? 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have some questions that perhaps the hon. member might address.  
I wonder if the member might have a response to those comments.  
He talks about cuts to health care. 
That is exactly what has been done. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a couple of points of clarification for the hon. member.  
They talk about the tinkering in this bill. 
They talked about eliminating the role of the federal government with respect to transfers. 
Those are Canadian priorities which is something that party is completely out of sync with.  
He talked about a by province floor. 
I am at odds to understand where this member is coming from.  
They quote selectively from what some publications say. 
They were opposed to free trade. 
It takes a visionary government to implement this type of policy. 
Unfortunately sometimes the next government can take advantage of that sound policy. 
They made the visionary changes and the Liberals have taken advantage of it.  
In four years we will have the opportunity implement it.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
We are down in the basement. 
We are subterranean because of the cuts. 
It should be reversed now and this bill does not reverse it.  
He will be recognized after question period.  
Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
My constituents take this opportunity to share their views with me. 
Why will the Liberals not focus on the issues that concern our constituents?  
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
Example is an eloquent orator. 
These acts of kindness speak volumes about our Canadian spirit.  
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
Ms. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
I am truly proud to represent NDG-Lachine. 
Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, Lib.):
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Each of these athletes embodies all that is good about Canada. 
Good luck to one and all. 
You have already made us proud.  
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FLEUR DE LYS 
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard-La Prairie, Lib.):
Their relentless efforts and dedication have been absolutely outstanding. 
This show of solidarity was greatly appreciated.  
On behalf of the people of our region, I thank them all.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
How did people respond? 
People rose to the challenge and performed magnificently.  
We are even stronger now. 
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
The hon. member for Burnaby-Douglas will remain seated while he gives his statement.  
MEMBER FOR BURNABY-DOUGLAS 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Many Canadians are wondering whether the prime minister saw his shadow. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
My question is for the prime minister. 
Does he have debt reduction targets? 
If he does, what are they?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We are all happy that will be the situation in Canada very soon. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
My question is for the prime minister. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is simply not the case. 
That is probably what the hon. member is having a look at.  
We could not afford the extra equipment on that helicopter. 
Today we have one that is 40% cheaper.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, that sounds like another chopper whopper from the Liberals. 
I think Canadians deserve better.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member should look at the contract. 
The contract has yet to be signed. 
It is in the final negotiation.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
The crisis experienced by all ice storm victims is without precedent. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I believe this is the best solution.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Where is the difference? 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We managed to do that and we are very proud of our initiative.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the big banks are trying to pull a fast one. 
Will the minister kill the monster merger today? 
Will he send it back to the banks stamped NSF?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The Minister of Finance rightly said that a committee is reviewing the situation. 
The committee will report in September. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That task force will report in September. 
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
I spoke with the Prime Minister on the phone yesterday. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The Russians and the French are actively involved in this at the moment. 
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
We are interested in what is the position of the Canadian government.  
Will the prime minister make a full statement to the House of Commons? 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
That is the position of the government.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Now in 1998 he says ``Okay, 15 helicopters. 
What a steal of a deal; a Liberal would think that is good bargaining.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
It is $600 billion and increasing every second. 
What kind of a deal is that? 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I think that, right now, the measures are meeting the needs of communities.  
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
My second question has to do specifically with the job creation program. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I think it important to relax some of the criteria. 
In certain cases, I believe it will be possible to buy certain kinds of equipment.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Who is really setting policy here? 
Is it the Royal Bank and the Bank of Montreal or is it the government? 
Who is setting policy on banking?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we are certainly glad to hear that. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The hon. member referred to the possibility of a shortage. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
They do not send a message to our allies.  
What resources will we use?  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, to begin with let me correct the record. 
I met with British foreign secretary Robin Cook 10 days ago. 
We are looking at the situation.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
What specific resources will we commit if in fact we are asked for them?  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Canadians expect us to be realistic.  
What we are doing is taking a realistic approach to the situation. 
We are supporting the United Nations in that respect.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.  
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.  
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
We must ensure consumer information is confidential. 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
This unacceptable sentence is the result of the Liberal legal loophole known as conditional sentencing.  
Will the Minister of Justice put an immediate end to this legal loophole?  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
The hon. member more generally speaks of conditional sentencing. 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
My colleague the attorney general of Quebec is appealing the case.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Many financial analysts say today that the fixation with size is absurd. 
Will the minister reject this monster merger and stamp it NSF, no such fixation?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member raises a number of interesting points. 
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabasca, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Sherbrooke directed his question to the Prime Minister. 
My question is also for the Prime Minister.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is not much of a historian. 
The same stands today. 
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Mr. Speaker, let us continue with this minister. 
In light of these recent events has the minister changed his position? 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Where does the money come from? 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The fact is that the provinces overwhelmingly support the Canada pension plan. 
Canadians overwhelmingly support the Canada pension plan. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
I have invited a group of- 
The hon. member for Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre has the floor.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
In fact the member from Spadina has made this a particular cause of his.  
I can assure the House that will continue. 
We suggested that the task force look at it. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
If such a request was received, it would have to be given serious consideration. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Constitutionally there is only one. 
While this seems to be a clear and well understood principle, the application- 
The only body in Canada that meets this test is the House of Commons. 
If the Senate is to amend those acts, it is amending financial acts. 
Bill S-3 is a financial bill.  
They are essentially the same bill. 
As you are aware, Mr. Speaker, royal recommendations are attached to money bills. 
In conclusion, the members are concerned over the slow erosion of their power. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
That is the essence of his statement today.  
On that point I would submit that the hon. member lost the battle previously.  
That is not the issue. 
The issue is whether a royal recommendation was required. 
This is exactly the process that has occurred with regard to this bill.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
The NDP members have always felt this way. 
This point needs to be made over and over again. 
There are two things. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
We are now up to five or six bills introduced into the Senate. 
But look at what is happening if you would. 
Yet a few months ago he did staple the royal recommendation.  
That does not make it so. 
I hope you will take those points into consideration, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
The Australian Parliament ceased to function. 
Is that where this Parliament is going? 
I do not think we do.  
I have had arguments from both sides. 
He does not rule for or against one side or the other. 
I have another point of order, the hon. member for Langley-Abbotsford.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
2. During the debate no dilatory motions or quorum calls may be received; 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
(Motion agreed to and bill read the first time) 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Mr. Speaker, it has been a busy month since the House last sat. 
I would like to read the petition submitted by a number of signatories.  
I wish to table this as a petition of my constituents of western Canada.  
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a petition signed by 150 constituents from Wetaskiwin. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
The petitioners point out that other countries use their taxes in a very creative way. 
In Taiwan teachers pay no income tax. 
Again this indicates the importance placed on teachers and young children.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, it is my honour to present two petitions today. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
I take pleasure in presenting this petition.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have the honour to present two petitions. 
The first petition is similar to the one presented by my colleague from Halifax West. 
The petitioners support a publicly administered universal pension plan. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have another petition I wish to present. 
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
The petitioners are concerned about the tax structure. 
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):

Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
The average processing time for all immigrant classes was 11 months.  
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Guy St-Julien: 
No work was done based on this estimate.  
<*Question No. 43- Mr. Jim Hart: 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
I ask, Mr. Speaker, that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
INCOME TAX AMENDMENTS ACT, 1997 
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
A measure of true leadership is the setting of government priorities. 
The priorities of this government are clear and definite.  
They are truly national concerns. 
Tax points, you say? 
I know that appears abstract, obscure and even bureaucratic. 
And what is a tax point? 
In 1977 these tax points represented some $3 billion dollars in receipts. 
Today, the figure is about $13 billion. 
It seems to me that the results are obvious. 
This may seem contradictory, but it is the plain truth.  
The provinces did too. 
The gains made by the provinces go beyond a decline in interest rates. 
I see things differently.  
It therefore deserves the support of all members of this House. 
I hope that that support will be unanimous.  
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
The transfer payments to Yukon will be cut by $20 million. 
Our only weather station in the whole north has been taken away. 
There will be no flood warnings this year.  
We have just had a huge event in Yukon. 
The only operating iron ore mine has closed, throwing over 700 people out of work. 
I hope the member realizes that. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, hindsight is 20:20. 
It represents roughly 20% of our budget. 
We made difficult decisions. 
We went to the provinces upon their request and gave them stable funding. 
I gave a concrete example in my home province. 
The member's home province is Alberta. 
Those were individual decisions the provinces had to make. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for my colleague. 
There is talk of cuts and transfers to the provinces. 
Personally, I wonder where these transfers are.  
So there were a number of transfers that did not really help.  
In the hospitals, we find our parents parked in corridors. 
I can even give you an example. 
That proves the transfers are not there. 
The question I would like to ask my colleague concerns the banks. 
It is up to the government to do the job and to assume its responsibilities.  
This benefits all workers.  
His province will also draw extra benefits as a result.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
They just want to spend, spend, spend. 
Now there is real pressure on the minister to spend.  
This bill is a band-aid approach when radical surgery is needed. 
It is interesting to listen to my colleague, the member for Kamloops, in the NDP. 
It is nice to hear him use the word reform. 
Of course that has been a policy of theirs for a very long time. 
He said that Canadians need tax cuts now. 
We all agree with that. 
In 1965 Canadians paid 27.7% of their income in taxes. 
In 1996, 43% of every Canadian's taxes are going toward the government.  
We have all had a break in this House since December. 
It is that our taxes are too high. 
He does not have to look that far. 
It is not even close. 
Should that shock anyone? 
We would have thought the Tories would have known better. 
I think they had every seat in Alberta at one time. 
It has taken the NDP just six years to ruin that economy. 
It is lowering taxes. 
He is a little late. 
Entrepreneurs are moving to Alberta because it is a better place to live. 
The premier has not reduced taxes quick enough.  
Every Canadian would agree with that. 
Everybody in this House knows what they make. 
My party has a plan to revamp the tax system. 
We talked a lot about it.  
He has been at it for a lot of years. 
He can give some good answers. 
They look very good on the 30 second clip during the news hour.  
In reality, where are we with our tax system in Canada? 
Where have we gone? 
In 1990 we were still number three. 
We had dropped two places on income per person.  
It has lower taxes. 
When there are lower taxes there are more jobs and that is the difference.  
The NDP member asked me if I switched parties. 
These old line parties just do not understand. 
I know this by the tans everybody has when I look around here. 
They can see the thriving economies in the cities across the border from us. 
We have to look at why this government is in trouble. 
That is what this government has done. 
Is that a high priority for a government that is not lowering taxes? 
Today we hear about the new helicopters this government has bought. 
Only a Liberal government could do that type of spending. 
That is what concerns the members on this side of the House.  
Yes, we have the deficit down, but where are we going from here? 
Are we going to really attack that debt? 
The bungled Pearson airport deal, $216 million. 
Why did the government not leave that airport alone? 
The British Columbia airport is operating separately and is making money. 
People on the other side might ask what would we do on this side. 
There are a lot of things the Reform Party would do. 
We would end funding of wasteful and patronage regional development programs. 
I come from a province with a lot of ongoing negotiations. 
The people who are making the money are the bureaucrats and the lawyers. 
It is time we ended this nonsense and solved the problem.  
Currently there is a surplus of $8 billion per annum. 
EI should be returned to its original function of insuring against temporary job loss. 
The way it is going right now there may be two provinces supporting eight.  
We would cut general government services by $600 million. 
Government efficiency still has a long way to go in every department.  
We have the highest income taxes in the world. 
We are number one in the G-7. 
Most members of the House have children. 
I now have six grandchildren. 
I worry about their future in Canada.  
Why were the Northwest Territories not mentioned? 
What about British Columbia and Alberta? 
We in the west feel alienated from Canada. 
We are creating some of the best pockets of jobs in the country. 
Some of the best taxation is in the province of Alberta. 
Yet eastern Canada is not paying attention. 
Central Canada is not paying attention.  
Western voters are frustrated. 
Their taxes are too high. 
It is not fair.  
You had better not get sick.  
An hon. member opposite says ``You had better not get sick''. 
I had good medical care while I was there. 
Do not tell me how good it is in Canada. 
We have to look into our medical programs in a major way. 
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
He indicated the difference between the United States and Canada. 
In the United States there is no universal medicare. 
You cut medicare by 35%.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:
Is that what he is trying to tell us?  
Why is the member neglecting or ignoring the cry of Canadians?  
If he would read it he might understand it.  
The Reform Party will lower taxes. 
The Reform Party has offered to increase the transfer payments on medicare. 
Members opposite have not read our brochure. 
The Liberal Party still taxes senior citizens. 
Someone living in the United States could buy a medical program. 
Anyone on welfare is covered under medicare. 
Maybe they get them more in provincial government offices. 
They may die of a heart attack before they get in there. 
That is one of the problems.  
He should read the Reform platform. 
We look after seniors in our program. 
Where is that Liberal compassion we all hear about? 
I was always taught that Liberals had compassion. 
That is why one was a Liberal. 
It seems to have changed.  
That is what we are talking about. 
That is not fair. 
They should be given a chance to get going. 
Taxes should be lowered for people who earn under $30,000.  
That would get the country going and that would create enthusiasm. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the member said that his family was Liberal. 
After that he was a Conservative. 
Now he is a Reformer. 
Maybe he will see the light one day and become an NDP.  
Those who were waiting for six months were not the rich. 
Those with all that money were not waiting six months. 
What does my colleague answer to that?  
That is what is wrong with our medicare program. 
We have to make some changes to it.  
I do not disagree with his party. 
Medicare needs more funding in Canada. 
We still say that, just as we say it for education. 
In this country we all wait six months no matter what our status.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
It has certainly been a long time coming. 
Perhaps if he had a heart transplant he could become a Conservative again.  
A lot of economic revisionism goes on in the House.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
It is nice to see the member for Kings-Hants here. 
Some may be delighted to see them here and others perhaps not so much.  
We hear calls from all sides. 
The NDP says we should spend more. 
The Reform Party says we should cut more. 
The Conservatives are simply saying we should reduce taxes. 
We came up with a number of very interesting facts and statements.  
We simply reported the facts. 
Let me share some of the results.  
Once we did this and compiled the data, we shared this with the participants. 
Canadians would understand that. 
A deficit is an overdraft and a debt is a mortgage. 
We simply had to make changes. 
Someone said that it was unfair. 
We talk about representation in this place. 
We talk about equality in this place. 
By and large the system works reasonably well. 
The people clearly want to see tax relief. 
I believe they will see tax relief in the Minister of Finance's budget. 
We have said we are committed to reducing taxes in this country. 
The Reform Party would support an across the board cut. 
We are talking about trillions. 
His wife was diagnosed with cancer. 
His wife is fine today. 
What we have here is the envy of the world. 
I have a bit of a concern about whether we need to expand those pillars. 
What is the result? 
We can see it. 
We should ask ourselves are those people healthy. 
Who would live on the street in February in Canada?  
We have to recognize that those people are sick. 
They need community resources. 
Let me share the message which I got from those people. 
This is exactly what I heard from that group. 
Do we do that by cutting taxes? 
You cannot have it both ways. 
We have to attack it and we will.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
It is a very creative approach.  
Let us get a couple of facts absolutely straight here. 
That government lied and now it is trying to pass the buck. 
It does not even have the integrity to admit that it made a mistake.  
The hon. member claims that the Ontario government has cut health care spending. 
He says that people are getting less quality care. 
Liberals do not understand that lower taxes mean more revenues. 
That is what has happened in the treasury of the Ontario government. 
The Ontario government has more revenues than it did- 
Let me say what has happened in the province of Ontario. 
Ask the people at the Queen Street mental health unit. 
Ask the people who live on the streets of the city of Toronto. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That would not have happened with me in the chair. 
I would ask everyone to be really careful how closely they dance around that one.  
We will go to another question by the hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
But time does not permit me at this point to pursue that.  
What is the policy of this Liberal government for today? 
Mr. Speaker, I will be brief. 
He said that our economy is not strong. 
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
My question is specific. 
That is right, Mr. Speaker. 
I think it is an excellent point that should be brought out. 
There will be increased funding as well in the bill.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
That is clear and that is our position.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I do not have to dance around it at all. 
There is no argument about that.  
It is a philosophy of the government. 
It is the leadership shown by the finance minister and the prime minister. 
It is turning things around but the job is not done. 
There is a long way to go.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
It is said that these surpluses could reach $8 billion. 
The purpose of these transfers is to fund hospitals, higher education and social assistance.  
Back to the surplus the Minister of Finance will be announcing shortly. 
Where is it coming from? 
It is very simple; it is mathematical. 
Let us talk about employment insurance. 
For us, employment insurance means ensured poverty, ensured suffering. 
When it comes down to it, that approach is the trademark of this government. 
These people are being punished for their gesture of solidarity. 
The Minister of Human Resources Development is increasingly dehumanizing his services. 
That is treating them like people.  
It is trying to readjust its services and maintain good contact with its clients. 
We will keep an eye on how it is doing.  
Let us now look at the federal tax. 
Now, that is something concrete. 
The Liberals should be aware of the unfairness of the current federal tax system. 
The Bloc Quebecois has spoken many times on tax issues. 
The federal corporate tax system is also ill-suited to the current economic context. 
We get the impression that nothing has been done since. 
Yet, the Minister of Finance seems content with this system.  
But this does not make these reforms any less necessary.  
Let me give you a few examples of outdated or inefficient tax measures. 
The Bloc Quebecois often raises tax issues. 
It is time it amended the Employment Insurance Act. 
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
I am extremely disappointed. 
He should be ashamed. 
He should apologize to all storm victims.  
Mr. Speaker, I do not need any medicine in order to be calm. 
The hon. member is getting carried away.  
This catastrophe has touched all of North America.  
That is really petty politicking.  
There was solidarity among us. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I go back to the comments made earlier today. 
We took office with a $42 billion deficit. 
I challenge the member from the Bloc Quebecois to rationalize and give us a reason. 
In fact those payments are going up and not down.  
Mr. Speaker, it is very easy to get into a war of figures. 
We were using the figure of $42 billion. 
That is something specific.  
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
I would like the member opposite to explain. 
We know that it was $42 billion.  
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Vaughan-King-Aurora, Lib.):
The measure of real leadership is where government places its priorities. 
They are truly national concerns. 
But as of 1977, we also agreed to provide the provinces with tax points.  
What is a tax point transfer? 
There was good reason for the provinces to accept these tax points. 
As the economy grows so does the value of those points. 
In 1977 those tax points amounted to some $3 billion worth of revenues. 
Today they are worth about $12 billion. 
To me the bottom line is clear. 
That may sound contradictory but it is again the truth. 
That saving has continued to grow.  
I see it differently. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Simply because it can do so better and more cheaply than the federal government. 
I will conclude by asking the hon. member opposite this question:
There are areas which need improvement. 
I mentioned, for example, the issue of youth unemployment. 
That is a concern for many Canadians from coast to coast. 
That was not long ago. 
We were carrying a high deficit. 
Interest rates went through the roof. 
People's incomes were dropping. 
People's hopes were dim.  
The government cannot take all the credit. 
Indeed Canadians rolled up their sleeves and said that we needed to tackle the deficit. 
Now they want to tackle the debt. 
The hon. member mentioned something which struck me as being odd. 
I submit to him that he is absolutely wrong. 
The burden of deficits needs to be eliminated. 
These are the fundamentals that generate economic growth.  
We will sacrifice ourselves for whom? 
To diminish the efforts of Canada, that is what the hon. member is saying. 
I say to you that you are wrong and we- 
The hon. member knows that he must address his remarks to the Chair. 
I have tried to caution him on this point.  
The time for questions and comments has now expired. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
It survives despite them. 
We know what that has done from coast to coast to coast in this country. 
You cannot do that to the Canadian people.  
What does that mean? 
They were planning a $500 million investment in terms of federal social transfers.  
Let us put it into today's context. 
By today's figures that is $8 billion.  
What did the Conservatives turn around and promise in 1997? 
That brings us to the current issue today. 
Second, try for goodness sake to rethink its position on patent protection. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
I would however like to correct the record on a couple of points.  
That as well is inaccurate. 
Therefore I think she ought to be somewhat tempered in her remarks.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
What does Bill C-28 have to do with the bank issue? 
This government will continue with that process. 
Let us not be ridiculous. 
This bill reflects a changing fiscal reality. 
We now have dollars to reinvest in the priorities of Canadians. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
The member asked a question about what the banks have to do with anything. 
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
This bill very much defines the heart of our country. 
Is the NDP supporting the bill? 
Why is this bill about the soul of our nation? 
I see two or three major components to this bill. 
The second one concerns the registered education savings plan which relates to post-secondary education. 
Third, but not limited to these three, is charitable donations.  
My constituents in Winnipeg North-St. 
This is truly a reflection of our social conscience.  
Therefore nothing will be lost and savings will be gained.  
Another principle relates to no extra billing on the part of physicians. 
We have one of the most beautiful health care systems in the world.  
In total it will represent six years. 
What we are hearing from the Reform Party is that we need to cut taxes. 
The NDP, on the other hand, will say that is not enough. 
I think that we need to inject a dose of realism. 
It is not enough, but we do not have enough money in the country. 
There are competing demands on the amount we have as a nation.  
That in all humility must merit the commendation of Canadians.  
We must invest in the infrastructure of high tech technology. 
I heard remarks during earlier debate that there had been cuts to transfer payments. 
That we said we did. 
Let us support the bill. 
Last November or December I consulted with the constituents of Winnipeg North-St. 
Or, would they like us to change the pledge? 
Everybody present in that community forum said that we must keep our pledge. 
That is what we are doing.  
It is about the generosity that we have for each other as Canadians. 
Then she said that this was about a bill of tricks. 
Is $1.5 billion not real money? 
Is $1.5 billion only an illusion?  
We must come down to reality. 
That is a realistic amount. 
I end with a key message. 
We have responded very well to the National Forum on Health. 
I will go directly to the member for Acadie-Bathurst.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
I will try to be brief in putting my question, Mr. Speaker. 
Let me give you an example. 
I call that a two-tier system too. 
The hon. member for Winnipeg North-St. 
Paul has approximately 45 seconds.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:
Mr. Speaker, certainly there are still problems. 
We do not deny that. 
We are realistic as well. 
However we have to put the problems in their context. 
We would all agree that delivery of the health care system is completely provincial jurisdiction.  
This will require federal and provincial negotiations.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
The Immigration and Refugee Board is a national embarrassment to Canada right now. 
I could not agree with them more. 
The people on this board make $86,400 each. 
That is the maximum. 
There are 198 members, $74 million a year. 
The average processing time for a claim is 13 months. 
Review of cases takes seven months. 
In reality the first processing of a claim takes two and half years.  
It is time that this minister got serious about this board. 
The recommendations from her committee say that it should be cancelled. 
The public wants this board cancelled. 
It wants a different process. 
Mr. Speaker, I welcome the hon. member's comments. 
I am sure members of the committee will also be looking at this report.  
The report deals with a holistic approach in all parts of the act. 
It deals with the Immigration Act, the Refugee Act as well as the Citizenship Act. 
These are all very important issues that will be discussed. 
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.35 p.m.)
