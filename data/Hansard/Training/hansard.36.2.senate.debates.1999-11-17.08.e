International and National Awards Won by Citizens of Lunenburg 
Hon. Wilfred P. Moore :
Members of ASTA are from across the Americas. 
It is the first time that the award has been presented to a Canadian port.  
Reform of the Senate 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
It is time for us to take on the role of leadership. 
Industrial Hemp- Obstacles in Exporting to the United States 
My congratulations to Kenex. 
This is good news for Canadian farmers.  
International Year of Older Persons 
Hon. Lois M. Wilson :
Report of Foreign Affairs Committee on Study Tabled 
Hon. John B. Stewart :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
First Report of Committee Tabled 
Cape Breton Development Corporation 
First Report of Special Committee Tabled 
Hon. John G. Bryden :
( For text of report, see today's Journals of the Senate.)  
Hon. Leonce Mercier , Chairman of the Committee of Selection, presented the following report: 
Wednesday, November 17, 1999 
The Committee of Selection has the honour to present its 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Religious Freedom in China in Relation to United Nations International Covenants 
Hon. Lois M. Wilson :
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government):
Our commitment to Cape Breton continues. 
That was a very large and necessary part of the plan.  
There government had two choices. 
I know that the honourable senator would not countenance such an alternative. 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
That individual will do just fine. 
I may have undertaken yesterday to give that opinion to Senator Murray. 
I will certainly give it to the Honourable Senator Oliver as well.  
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government):
Honourable senators, I am familiar with the matter which the honourable senator raises. 
In fact, those windows were removed from a chapel not presently in daily use. 
I have a supplementary question, honourable senators. 
I would ask the honourable leader to support that proposal.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, I, too, have a supplementary question. 
Perhaps I could throw the first pebble. 
Replacement of Sea King Helicopter Fleet- Possibility of Leasing 
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
Honourable senators, my question is also to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Could he please give me a more direct or definitive answer at this moment?  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
They have all been saying that.  
He has had some success. 
What is the cost of the refitting?  
That is the key.  
I speak from experience as an active pilot. 
I mentioned the submarines. 
For submarines, the commitment is $750 million. 
I do not want to avoid the honourable senator's question. 
That is not the solution.  
They would be shut down!  
I thank the honourable senator for his comments. 
As to the cost of servicing them, some questions can be asked. 
Proposal by Reform Party to Review Membership-Government Policy 
Honourable senators, this question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Have they learned nothing from history?  
Honourable senators, my question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Last July, a most unfortunate incident took place in Manitoba. 
Some cattle were poisoned with a highly potent weed killer. 
Luckily, however, there was no evidence of that. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I appreciate the question that the honourable senator has asked. 
I would sooner have your colleague from Cape Breton back there!  
The honourable senator raises an important question. 
However, I will get a response for the senator as quickly as possible.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I move the adoption of the report.  
Hon. Noel Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
We are very pleased to support the motion by Senator Mercier.  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I should like to add a comment to the debate on this report. 
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Bill to Amend-Second reading 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
I am grateful to him.  
This is an important principle of our criminal law system.  
The Solicitor General may decide the appropriateness of disclosing the contents of the record. 
This is a thorny issue.  
All the ministers agreed on that initiative. 
As you know, this point is of the highest concern to me.  
In this regard, I put a number of questions to him.  
That is too vague and too broad.  
Departmental officials said that the list already existed. 
That would have given us the opportunity to study it immediately.  
Criminal law is fundamental in nature. 
A crime is a crime. 
Yet this process is specifically included in several other federal acts.  
It seemed to me that quick passage was more important. 
I presume honourable senators will realize I am referring to Bill C-69. 
It can, however, be amended by Order-in-Council. 
It will be examined thoroughly in committee. 
Once again, we shall be most vigilant on your behalf, honourable senators.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
On behalf of all honourable senators, I bid you welcome to the Senate of Canada.  
Legal and Constitutional Affairs 
Leave having been given to revert to Notices of Motions: 
Honourable senators, I give notice that tomorrow, Thursday, November 18, 1999, I will move: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
On behalf of all senators, I wish you welcome to the Senate.  
Leave having been given to proceed to Motion No. 9: 
Hon. John B. Stewart , pursuant to notice of November 16, 1999, moved: 
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I rise on a point of order. 
We received a notice of motion from Senator Fraser a few moments ago. 
On our Order Paper for today is a similar motion made by Senator Oliver. 
There seems to be some confusion as to the rules. 
Could we have clarification on that point to obviate any misunderstanding?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I thank the Honourable Senator Kinsella for mentioning this matter.  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, I would be quite happy to add my remarks to the debate. 
First, perhaps I could receive some clarification. 
Is this a point of order? 
What is the question before us?  
That sounds odd to me.  
A similar motion was made by Senator Oliver last week. 
I believe we should have this matter clarified.  
I am attempting to ascertain under what authority I am answering Senator Kinsella's questions. 
I am prepared to speak to the matter.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, we are anticipating the question. 
All we have, insofar as Senator Fraser is concerned, is a notice of motion. 
The proper time to raise the matter is when the motion is placed before us. 
However, I am in the hands of honourable senators. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I believe that we are anticipating at this point. 
In other words, the matter is not before us. 
We have been told that eventually the senator will propose something. 
When she does, it would be the proper time to raise the matter.  
If it is the wish of honourable senators, of course, we can proceed now. 
I am in your hands in that regard.  
However, I am in your hands.  
Perhaps we can deal with it when Senator Oliver's motion is called. 
If that is in order, it would be my suggestion that we do so. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
They differ in that they deal with different items.  
I am in the hands of the Senate.

That a Message be sent to the House of Commons to acquaint that House accordingly.  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
Consequently, Bill C-251 died on our Order Paper. 
I hold her in high esteem. 
All Canadians are indebted to her. 
Christie Blatchford aptly described that hearing. 
This way, the lawyer indicated, Olson could take full advantage of concurrent sentencing.  
Olson mocked in the court, "They can't do nothing. 
They can only give me a concurrent sentence."  
This is sentencing for truly evil acts. 
The very few explanations of evil that have been developed are theological. 
Yet, theological explanations are dismissed today in the name of moral neutrality. 
The Hope for Healing Human Evil. 
Yet in our hearts I think we all have some understanding of its nature.  
Dr. Peck also wrote at page 46: 
Dr. Peck added at page 47: 
They are just bad. 
Such evil is not amenable to treatment or cure. 
The word "disease" means "dis" "ease" - without ease. 
They are not "dis" "eased" with their behaviour; they are quite at ease with it.  
Inmate Olson is quite at ease with his condition. 
He signs his letters "Clifford Robert Olson, SERIAL KILLER of 11 Children." 
I received a letter from him signed in that manner. 
Inmate Olson is not ill and he is not sick - he is bad.  
They basically told the committee to defeat the bill. 
My opponents were unwilling to have any debate or study whatsoever. 
...the folks from justice had gathered to provide `information' about the controversial section.  
Canadians never voted for concurrent sentencing. 
Concurrent sentencing is foreign to the basic concept of justice.  
That is the result of a national survey by POLLARA, conducted just last month. 
Albina Guarnieri continued to explain her bill as follows: 
The length of the inmate's warrant is that of his natural life. 
The inmate's warrant of sentence expires on the day the inmate dies. 
The terminology used by Corrections Canada is "warrant expiry date", abbreviated as WED. 
Their sentence is life imprisonment. 
There is much confusion about this. 
Many believe that the sentence of life imprisonment means 25 years and not life. 
In debate on December 12, 1996, I said: 
powers of clemency rightfully belong with the clemency granting agencies. 
It will, in turn, enhance the powers of the chief justices. 
These are powers exercised by the representatives of the body politic.  
They are executive powers.  
The cases of inmate Olson and inmate Homolka make that abundantly clear. 
The presiding judge presided over a political hearing. 
That hearing was a political one, not a legal one. 
The judge and jury and everyone present in that room knew this. 
That is why we are where we are today. 
I can tell you that no one will let him out. 
His most natural equivalent is Karla Homolka.  
Honourable senators, I served as a member on the National Parole Board. 
I interviewed many inmates and granted and revoked many paroles. 
These predators' ability to choose victims by attaching and exploiting their victims' vulnerability is diabolical. 
We are talking now about malevolent sexual deviants here. 
He wrote, at page 48: 
Honourable senators, I repeat, retribution. 
In our system, the language we use is the royal prerogative in justice. 
Retribution of the Queen's justice can always be tempered by the Queen's mercy.  
We are not talking about the traditional juvenile delinquent here. 
Senator Cools is a very enlightened person in this field. 
I thank the honourable senator for her question. 
That is the dilemma which has been posed by section 745 of the Criminal Code. 
The record on this is quite clear. 
Honourable Senator Finestone has hit the nail on the head. 
The issue needs our attention. 
I hope some of these issues will come out in debate.  
Why do the judges not currently avail themselves of consecutive sentencing? 
He was very unusual.  
All murder is unusual, I submit. 
Otherwise our race would be extinct. 
That is quite true.  
I have a host of information about these kinds of individuals. 
What is not that unusual among murderers are those committing murder again and again. 
That is absolutely true. 
We do not do that in this country. 
There used to be many, many different ways to kill the same person many times. 
I hope I have assisted the honourable senator somewhat.  
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Yes, I said something to that effect. 
This is not a question of the rule of law. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, the allotted time for speeches and questions is over. 
Honourable senators, we need to be clear now. 
Are they still in jail?  
In that particular instance, I revoked his mandatory supervision absolutely. 
I am speaking of years later.  
You are proving my case.  
I do not think such an individual can be rehabilitated.  
It is just a newspaper article upon which I am relying for information. 
There is no change in principle.  
That is what the honourable senator is asking. 
You need to make your case because as yet you have not done so. 
There is no change.  
Sure, we used to execute them.  
Why have we changed that? 
By the way, we do not call them "rapists" any more.  
What do you call those people now? 
I believe they are referred to as "sexual aggressors."  
Our sentencing involves not only punishment.  
It is a bad example, but that is all right.  
Let me finish my question, please. 
I allowed the honourable senator to finish her speech.  
We are no longer in the punishment business only. 
If she is able to convince me, I will gladly support her in second reading. 
There are some reasons for that. 
I am not questioning the honourable senator's motives. 
This is not a Private Member's Bill that has just been introduced. 
This bill has had four years of examination and scrutiny in the House of Commons.  
Those are the principles of sentencing. 
This bill is perfectly consonant with those principles. 
This bill bill builds on that section. 
He must just trust me on that. 
I have looked at the Charter.  
That is not what the bill is proposing at all. 
Perhaps the honourable senators does not understand the bill.  
What would be the minimum life sentence?  
The minimum would remain consistent with what is in the statute. 
Whatever the law currently prescribes as the penalty, is what this bill prescribes.  
The bill limits on any sentence a judge may hand down. 
I hope the honourable senator understands it now. 
The honourable senator must be clear for our colleagues. 
Would the honourable senator explain that to me, please?  
I would be happy to explain it to the honourable senator. 
That is the current regime.  
The reasoning is exactly the same.  
What would be the maximum?  
That is the limit.  
An addition of 25 years.  
There is no one additional 25 years. 
There is an addition to a total of 25 years.  
You just said that.  
The inmate's sentence is still life. 
The inmate must still serve his life sentence. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Consideration of Third Report-Order Withdrawn 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Legal and Constitutional Affairs 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
I have already commented on this. 
Senator Kinsella may wish to add a comment. 
I will defer to Senator Cools at this time.  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
On the second page of that report, the order of reference is reproduced. 
It is still in a state of committal. 
It was left in the committee. 
I happen to have with me, Senator Kinsella, a particular citation. 
We are talking about a bill that was committed, and the word is "committed".  
Beauchesne's sixth edition, paragraph 874, states clearly: 
The report is proof itself that evidence has been taken.  
The operative words here are "to consider that evidence." 
The question is, authority for what?  
I read rule 58(1)( f ), and it states: 
for an instruction to a committee.  
Therefore, the motion substantively is an instruction to the committee.  
However, that is now an academic point.  
We are sometimes a little careless, although that is a very strong word. 
The committee has as much power as it needs. 
This was an additional requirement.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
I shall try now to deal with this matter in a logical sequence.  
...with leave of the Senate, and notwithstanding rule 58(1)...  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Senator Oliver's motion was quite properly before the Senate because leave had been granted.  
We first go to our rules and then we go to our practices and precedents. 
Two of our practices and precedents have been detailed by the Honourable Senator Kinsella. 
I can find other precedents if honourable senators require them. 
However, my understanding is that this has been a common practice in the Senate. 
Reference was made by Senator Cools to Beauchesne. 
As I pointed out, our practices take precedence over Beauchesne. 
Our practice has been different. 
Do you wish the matter to remain standing in Honourable Senator Cools' name?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
It will remain standing in Honourable Senator Cools' name, then.  
Order stands in name of Senator Cools.  
Conference on Women's Equality and Participation in Public Life 
Hon. Lorna Milne rose pursuant to notice of November 2, 1999: 
The conference was divided into several panels, some of which I will highlight for you. 
I think it was just an excuse not to appoint Emily.  
The next speaker was Frances Wright of Calgary. 
She is president and CEO of the Famous Five Foundation. 
While in Calgary I visited this impressive new monument. 
It was Frances Wright, just keeping a friendly eye on her statues.  
She is an extremely intelligent and capable woman in her own right. 
You have all heard the story of Allerednic - 
The prince marries a princess and turns her into a scullery maid.  
This is, apparently, the true-life situation of many British women.  
The second panel was titled, "From the Periphery to the Centre:
Making Women's Voices Heard." 
It was chaired by Sandra Anstey, President of Anstey Associates, of Toronto. 
However, in the new Scottish Parliament, there are 48 women MSPs out of 139 members. 
The Equal Opportunities Commission is 25 years old in Great Britain. 
Dr. Barshevkin's subject was "The Challenge of Personhood:
Women's Citizenship in Contemporary Perspective." 
She cited some recent Canadian stories. 
Yvonne Roberts, a freelance journalist, quipped: 
During the session on "Women and the Law:
In 1991 this happened. 
The battered women's syndrome is not recognized there. 
The end result is the only valid measure of true equality.  
A national minimum wage has been introduced. 
It was written by Yvonne Roberts and it was called "Northern rights." 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Beaudoin rose pursuant to notice of Tuesday, November 2, 1999; 
The Forum of Federations will be an ongoing event. 
The next meeting is scheduled to take place in Switzerland two years hence. 
In my view, there was a need for the forum. 
Our Constitution has evolved considerably. 
History teaches us that we go through alternate phases of centralization and decentralization. 
Right now, we are in a phase of decentralization. 
There is a growing interest, worldwide, in federalism. 
With respect to treaties, Canada has adopted a dualist system. 
In many countries, the signing of a treaty changes the law of the land. 
The courts have established that treaties must be signed by the federal authority. 
A significant number of agreements between France and Quebec have been signed under this framework.  
These arrangements do not amend the Constitution, but facilitate its implementation. 
Such arrangements are necessary in a modern federation.  
Trade and commerce are almost no longer restricted by borders. 
This is also true in other parts of the world, for example in Europe.  
A case in point in Canada is the Francophonie summits. 
There could be others.  
As professor Richard Simeon said at the Forum of Federations in Mont-Tremblant: 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Present State and Future of Aboriginal Peoples 
Hon. Aurelien Gill rose pursuant to notice of Thursday, November 4, 1999: 
For a year now, I have been observing, listening and learning. 
The time has now come for me to speak up.  
My identity and my life bear witness to my principles and my convictions. 
Often words are all we have left.  
The First Nations issue is one of great significance for Canada. 
Its future depends on it. 
The heart of the matter is rarely addressed, however.  
The 19th century was a catastrophic one, filled with misery. 
So our first nations have been the whipping boys of history for 200 years now. 
We have been stripped of our identities. 
Our lands have been despoiled. 
Treaties have not been respected, we have been put under guardianship. 
For the past 20 years, it has been so:
Kanesatake, Ipperwash, Gustafsen Lake and Burnt Church. 
It is fortunate that none really went off the rails. 
We have of course made progress in the past 40 years. 
No one now disputes the fact that we are the first inhabitants of this country. 
We have lived on this land, now called Canada, for millennia. 
The Canadian Constitution bears witness to our rights. 
The first part of the history of our relations is one of partnership. 
It was only later that the mood of the guest changed. 
A history that is less insulting to us, the First Nations, must be written. 
How can anything at all be based on such an oversight, such a misunderstanding?  
We have been here from time immemorial. 
This is what we hear.  
The status of Canadian Indian is one of second-class citizenship. 
The act applies the concept of guardianship. 
But this remains a well-kept secret. 
As I have said, over my lifetime some progress has been made. 
Unfortunately, recognition of our rights seems to play against us. 
What those rights are still seems to be a mystery. 
Many balk at their recognition. 
As a people, we are perceived as a threat. 
Our future has become a legal issue. 
The day will come when we must move beyond this. 
The First Nations aspire to self-sufficiency, to responsibility, to dignity. 
Indian Affairs costs Canadian taxpayers dearly, with negative results.  
I am both a senator and an Aboriginal person. 
I do not want to feel ashamed of my country. 
There is a huge amount of catching up to do, but it must be done.  
My bet is on wisdom. 
We must all work for open-mindedness. 
In my future interventions, I intend to come back before you with more information. 
I intend to participate fully in the deliberations of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Peoples. 
If we cannot have this debate in the Senate, who will?  
We must have our responsibilities back. 
We most go beyond the affirmations of rights and we must act. 
Natives must take hold of their present, of their future. 
In conclusion, honourable senators, it goes much further than that. 
"Indianness" is not limited to moccasins, dancing and traditions. 
The Canada of tomorrow will also belong to the First Nations. 
For we have survived a very sad history. 
There is no need to reinvent the wheel. 
think that, during the past 50 years, everything has been said. 
First Nations must govern themselves. 
There is no turning back. 
This is an uphill battle. 
On motion of Senator Watt, debate adjourned.

Office of Children's Environmental Health 
Motion to Establish Adopted 
Hon. Mira Spivak , pursuant to notice of November 2, 1999, moved: 
Children are particularly vulnerable to environmental pollutants. 
Sometimes that impact is lifelong; sometimes it is irreversible. 
Nursing infants get considerably more dioxin each day than adults. 
That is because dioxin accumulates in breast milk. 
I do not know why.  
What precisely does dioxin do to children? 
The dioxin report has scores of recommendations to prevent future harm. 
We do have a choice.  
Why has asthma in children quadrupled in the last few decades? 
Some 30 months later, none has been created. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
