The Senate met at 1:30 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Medical Research Council-Effects of Reduction in Funding 
Hon. Wilbert J. Keon :
Research projects, while considered meritorious, are not being funded. 
Research is the heart of an evidence-based health care system.  
This brings me to my final point. 
As important as these investments are, however, they are not enough. 
These are not separate priorities but are inextricably linked. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
I was told this by what I considered to be very reliable sources. 
This leads me to question the legitimacy of the answer that was provided to me.  
The response I received from the government was as follows: 
However, someone is stretching things a bit. 
It is fundamental to democracy. 
No more stories, so there will be no more misunderstandings.  
First Report of Committee Tabled 
The Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
State of Financial System 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Appropriation Bill No. 1, 1997-98 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Bill to Amend-First Reading 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
I am referring here to clauses 32 and 33 of Bill C-2.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Changes to Canada Pension Plan-Request for Response to Questions 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
I will look into the matter.  
What kind of clarification does the government have in mind? 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
I thank the honourable senator for his question. 
I will take it as notice for the Leader of the Government.  
Situation in Canadian Armed Forces-Government Position 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, I wonder whether it is better to get the answer "quickly" or "soon"? 
Lots of luck to you, Senator Oliver!  
The same answer can be applied to both questions.  
Can they expect to be paid before Christmas?  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, as I remember my English grammar, it is "quick, quicker quickest." 
This concerns Employment Insurance and the reserve. 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Anti-Personnel Mines Convention Implementation Bill 
I pose the question and I hear your response.  
You never see the dead. 
You no longer see the thousands of people killed. 
We must return to reason. 
The spirit of humanity must govern the technology of murder. 
The killing and mutilation of innocent people must stop.  
There is hope; a new day is dawning. 
More than 100 states are expected to sign this treaty.  
We now know that we will meet that challenge. 
Some states will not sign the convention in Ottawa, next week. 
No convention enjoys universal support when it is first open to ratification. 
In the eyes of the international community, Canada is closely connected to this initiative. 
And this will not be the end of the process. 
In order to do so, the government is proposing this bill. 
Bill C-22 has several objectives. 
The convention authorizes the use of mines for these purposes.  
It is also impossible to know how many more anti-personnel mines are manufactured yearly. 
These figures are beyond human grasp. 
The situation in many countries is already critical. 
We must put an end to this abominable cycle.  
The job is not over yet. 
The number to keep in mind is 40. 
Forty countries need to ratify the convention for it to become international law. 
Honourable senators, I have said enough. 
Seldom have those agreements been so singularly devoted to making the world less brutal. 
Honourable senators, the convention is a historic victory for human rights. 
It is significant and fitting that the signing ceremony will take place in Ottawa. 
As we all know, it is not by accident. 
As The Economist noted: 
That approach, reaffirmed in Oslo, will soon be adopted by more than 100 nations. 
Any country that signs will be out of the landmine business completely, without exception. 
The convention is simple and clear. 
However, we would do well to remember that Canada is not without blame. 
Canadians have also lost their lives to landmines. 
The implementation process will also be arduous. 
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
The bill removes red tape and improves efficiency. 
Let me outline how Bill C-11 benefits Canadian businesses. 
Other rates will be harmonized, and rate inconsistencies will be corrected. 
Other things the bill does are very simple. 
On motion of Senator Kinsella, for Senator Meighen, debate adjourned.  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
Recently, a doctor in the maritimes was charged with murdering a patient. 
On motion of Senator Carstairs, debate adjourned.  
First Report of Standing Joint Committee Adopted 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Do I understand that no other honourable senator wishes to speak on this matter? 
If not, I will proceed to put the question.  
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Committee Authorized to Engage Services 
Hon. Terry Stratton , pursuant to notice of November 25, 1997, moved: 
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2:00 p.m.
