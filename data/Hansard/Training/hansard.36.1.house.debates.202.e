Tuesday, March 23, 1999 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
CANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS COMMISSION 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
GOVERNMENT SERVICES ACT, 1999 
MOTION THAT DEBATE BE NOT FURTHER ADJOURNED 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 57, I move: 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
The House resumed from March 22 consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Yesterday, I accused the Liberal government of being anti-worker and anti-union. 
I will deal with the essential.  
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I do not see this as a resolution. 
Those people are still without a contract. 
As of today they are without a contract. 
What have we gained? 
The government has some obligation to come to an agreement with its employees.  
These people have been to the bargaining table. 
The main reason I say this is that it is a recurring thing. 
We firmly believe that the best settlement is a negotiated settlement.  
We therefore suggest that in those situations final offer selection arbitration be used.  
I counter by saying I do not think it will at all. 
It would be absolutely false to say that.  
We have to overcome that. 
We will be presenting an amendment to the bill. 
We have a big problem with the negligence we are seeing. 
It is also limiting the amount of debate. 
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
My understanding is that the difficulties have been under negotiation for some two years. 
The government has refused to acknowledge and negotiate that. 
How long has this been going on? 
I believe regional rates of pay were imposed in 1922. 
There have been some changes since 1922.  
A member opposite says not in the NDP. 
The hon. member is right. 
That is why there is closure today.  
I welcome those suggestions.  
I had the pleasure and the honour of being in Winnipeg recently. 
Now people fly, those who can afford to. 
What does it mean to the workers in my part of the country? 
I have some statistics. 
Why are they so frustrated? 
Why have they taken to strike? 
It is not because they wanted to but because of those very issues.  
The government will answer that in many ways. 
The government has some concerns about the movement of grain. 
Farmers themselves understand the difficulties faced by these labour unions.  
That was the foundation of the beginning of progressive movements in this country.  
This dispute has been simmering for a long time. 
This should have come as no surprise. 
It was going to end up shutting down public service buildings. 
It was going to end up hurting people who receive unemployment insurance cheques. 
It was going to end up hurting people waiting for income tax returns. 
It was going to hurt most Canadians. 
That is a report that comes from the Liberals and the Conservatives in the Senate. 
There is nowhere for this blame to rest except at the feet of the government.  
We were given a piece of legislation in which the figures were not costed. 
We had to rely on doing that ourselves, in a short period of time. 
It is absolutely undemocratic. 
That is the approach that the government uses.  
They say ``Why is the debate ongoing and taking so long?'' 
It is ongoing because there has not been a proper process followed by the government. 
While we are doing that other important legislation has been moved aside. 
One has to wonder about the subtle implications of that.  
It is regrettable that we are here today in this situation. 
It is unnecessary that members of the House of Commons find themselves in this situation. 
It is poorly drafted legislation. 
The government forgot to include Nunavut.  
The government can not hide that from them. 
It does not have a rationale. 
There is no logic. 
The answer is deafening in its silence. 
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
I felt it was another opposition member who probably should speak. 
I did not know that I was in line. 
But thanks to their kindness, they gave me my spot back.  
I found exactly the opposite.  
We talked on the phone with these people for about half an hour. 
I asked them what they wanted me to do. 
I said that a large percentage of my constituents were farmers. 
I asked which side I was supposed to represent. 
That is simply negligence. 
We know what the cost of living has been. 
We know how taxes have increased in eight years. 
How are these people supposed to live?  
The ordinary blue collar workers also want an increase. 
They deserve it and they have to have it.  
How much does this government care about farmers? 
How much does it care about the ordinary individual? 
A prime example is what we experienced last year. 
What did this government do? 
It, along with the Ontario government, legislated against it. 
Give farmers the choice to market their grain. 
Morris Dorosh writes in the Financial Post : 
He goes on to say: 
Exports of Canadian oats are an all-time record for the first 31 weeks...  
The problem is with the management and with the selling of these products. 
Management does not have to be accountable or efficient. 
So what happened to those advantages of the export monopoly? 
If this is orderly marketing, give me chaos.  
That is exactly how the farmers feel.  
It is not the workers at the ports. 
We have seen that with all the non-board grains. 
It is the monopoly that controls the management of these sales.  
Today the unions are telling me they are tired of striking. 
They are tired of using the defenceless farmers as a lever. 
They do not want to do that. 
These people have been in a legal strike position for 90 days. 
This is not the way to run a country. 
That is the way I call it.  
This is what farmers are fighting for. 
They want a decent return. 
They do not care about becoming millionaires. 
They see suffering and they want to help.  
How much has this country lost because of these strikes? 
It could probably have provided for all our social costs. 
What will it take for the government to realize this? 
Government members do not know how to listen. 
We are not allowed to do that in the House. 
People are not working. 
They cannot get a paycheque. 
Farmers cannot ship their grain. 
There is a problem.  
We are trying to fix it.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:
They are fixing it, all right. 
That is what the government is liable to do.  
The first John Deere combines that came out were all fixed with Japanese bearings. 
It was not very many months before farmers found out these suckers would not run. 
They had to replace all the bearings.  
There is no way that the machine of government can run. 
This is the example PSAC workers are telling us. 
It is dilapidated and it is getting rusty. 
Very soon we will not even see the red colour on it. 
It will be just rust. 
What about the Reform?  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:
It is completely shot. 
It has to be replaced.  
I tried to warn the government about the Manitoba flood area. 
It will be NDP.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:
We are trying to rebuild a health system. 
We are trying to rebuild everything. 
It is to fix everything. 
In Saskatchewan the roads are out of shape. 
The elevators are closing down. 
Everything is going against the economy. 
How in heaven can it continue? 
I do not think it can.  
It should not be necessary. 
Farmers want those people to work and to have a decent livelihood. 
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau-Mirabel, BQ):
I would quickly like to relate a bit of history before speaking to this debate. 
It is pretty surprising that these people are now singing a different tune. 
The member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell backed the alliance in those days. 
I will give a brief historical background on public service negotiations.  
The Labour Relations Board characterized this approach as unethical. 
The ILO lambasted the government for its lack of support of union rights.  
Now we come to the government currently in office, the Liberal Party. 
Once again, the ILO criticized the process.  
Here is what is included in the bill. 
It seems the government's offers are negligible in this regard. 
The government's offer for table 4 is unknown. 
There is a majority conciliation report, but the government seems to be ignoring it. 
Here is the position of the Bloc Quebecois on Bill C-76. 
All of the fundamental principles of labour relations would be respected.  
At table 2, the union says it is fully prepared to go to arbitration. 
And what does the government have to say? 
That the union demands are unreasonable. 
If the union demands are so unreasonable, why refuse arbitration? 
What has this government got to lose?  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
We talk about a democracy in this country. 
It is actually a capitulated democracy.  
I preface my remarks around something that farmers would understand. 
It ignores other aspects. 
It changed the English language. 
Now it is changing it to imposing a collective agreement. 
It wants to impose a collective agreement. 
That is absolutely ridiculous.  
That would make it inequitable for many people in the process. 
It would mean excessive income for some in certain areas [of the country].  
That is a basic fact.  
The Parliamentary Secretary to the President of the Treasury Board said: 
These are the crocodile tears we get. 
That would disrupt the local labour market.  
Imagine anyone saying that. 
We spoke to the workers. 
It is now 1999 and guess what? 
They misled them on that one. 
It goes on and on. 
I am absolutely disgusted.  
I will now deal for a moment with members of the Reform Party. 
They are discussing the issues. 
Some of them have spoken very well on behalf of people in their ridings. 
That was an absolute disgrace.  
I reiterate that we cannot legislate a collective agreement. 
It will not do that. 
Regional rates of pay is strike two. 
This is exactly what will happen to the government come the next federal election.  
I challenge the government to do that. 
I can assure the House that the Liberals will be in for quite a shock. 
I reiterate that the government is refusing to listen. 
It has absolutely forgotten to listen to people. 
I do not think it really knows how.  
We should all try to help government members. 
I can assure him his re-election. 
It is called talking. 
It is called dealing fairly or dealing equitably or equity. 
There is that word again which the government does not understand. 
It has its new dictionary, its new thesaurus and its spin doctors. 
If it cannot be reformed, eventually I hope we will abolish that other place. 
That is for another time and another story.  
Nova Scotians will not stand for it any more. 
This is the straw that broke the camel's back, more or less. 
The Liberals just cannot keep this arrogant way of governing. 
They cannot do that any more.  
The last time I checked we lived in a democracy. 
In the long run it will cost the Canadian taxpayer a whole lot more money.  
It will not work. 
These people will not abide by the legislation. 
When will the next time be? 
We did it with the postal workers. 
Now we are doing it with the PSAC workers. 
I wish the government would tell us who is next.  
Another example occurred a few years ago. 
It stood by and let the market decide. 
It let the corporation decide what was best for business. 
However, what happens when ordinary working people exercise their basic rights? 
The government turns around and says that they cannot have them. 
There cannot not be too much democracy in the country.  
The government is one sided when it comes to negotiations of any kind. 
It does not know how to negotiate. 
It negotiated a terrible NAFTA deal. 
It negotiated bad environmental laws. 
That is an absolute disgrace.  
I have been in the House for about two years. 
It is all hyperbole. 
The arrogance of the President of the Treasury Board must stop. 
They are all speaking with the same voice. 
We cannot do this. 
We have to stop legislating collective agreements because it is impossible.  
It is a legislative term. 
It is certainly not agreeable. 
Daily we listen to the rhetoric of the Liberals. 
They go with the flow. 
They change every day. 
Their corporate friends, their very powerful friends, have no problems. 
It will divide and conquer. 
Farmers will be put against workers, coal miners against other people. 
That is completely unacceptable.  
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
It has failed in managing the House of Commons, the Parliament of Canada. 
This does not give us the right to have adequate debate. 
We should be here to discuss the problems facing Canada. 
One of those is the PSAC strike. 
It is here for the good of the people.  
This PSAC strike, as far as I understand it, is a legal strike. 
They pay their union dues. 
They use negotiating teams to negotiate a good agreement for themselves. 
To my way of thinking they have every legal right to do so. 
Some respect it and some do not. 
Obviously that has happened in western Canada.  
Not all governments follow this process exactly. 
Why did we take the right to strike away from policemen and firemen? 
They are deemed to be essential to good governance. 
That is government for government sake. 
It is not government for the people.  
I think that is absolutely shameful of the government. 
I know there is tremendous concern for our international trade reputation. 
Obviously it is not.  
Give them binding arbitration. 
It is absolutely unconstitutional. 
It is absolutely, totally unfair and PSAC is fighting this battle. 
It is a battle that needs to be won. 
It is a policy that needs to be changed by the Government of Canada.  
In Newfoundland we lost 30,000 people in the last three years. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
The only place where this is not occurring is with the Government of Canada. 
The issues PSAC raised are very important. 
National corporations have reflected this in policy in recent years. 
I know a lot of farmers. 
The farmers I know are very fair people. 
This is not necessary. 
It is not responsible government. 
It is not responsible human resource management. 
It puts members in opposition in a very difficult position. 
Maybe that would be the best millennium project this government could work on.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Dan and Louise are just past 40. 
They have one child in high school and two in elementary school. 
In the middle of my constituency is the city of Weyburn. 
It is the largest inland buying centre in Canada. 
When this country gets to know the full story, it will be anti-government. 
Make no mistake about that.  
Grain sales are down considerably. 
Farmers have not been paid for last year's crop. 
When they apply for the government aid package they will need to come well equipped. 
Their wife's purse will not be large enough. 
It is 40 pages. 
That is the insensitive part of this government. 
It is far worse than income tax. 
Why is this government always part of a problem? 
It is very good at scheming these things.  
That is what they need to know. 
The government exaggerates and personifies total disrespect for people who are marginal in this country. 
Certainly the farmers were angry about that. 
Certainly they were angry about the fact that they lost $9 million. 
I know one thing. 
That side of the House is the reason. 
The problem is on that side of the House. 
It is not PSAC.  
The people on the government benches do not believe that.  
The government should simply go back to binding arbitration. 
Everybody would be happy. 
We would not be forced to stand here today faced with a vote later on. 
We should not have to do this. 
What is the matter with the government? 
The government likes its Bill C-68. 
It keeps the people unhappy. 
The government has the power to stop this back to work legislation now, this afternoon. 
The government has not bargained in good faith. 
What we are about to do today is a disgrace. 
The hon. member for Perth-Middlesex on a point of order.  
Mr. Speaker, I am on my feet to speak for a short moment.  
The hon. member is rising on debate. 
The hon. member for Perth-Middlesex on debate.  
Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Middlesex, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, to get this straight, the strike is across Canada. 
Simple knee-jerk reactions are running against the grain on this issue. 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, today is a very sad day in the House of Commons.  
Why do I say that today is a sad day? 
This is the sort of situation we are facing. 
That will be it. 
I find it strange to speak about workers' rights. 
I have always represented the employer. 
What do the managers say to their employees? 
This is totally unacceptable.  
They are people whose service to the public has developed their awareness.  
I am not saying that everyone is perfect. 
What about the members here? 
Are all 301 MPs perfect? 
No, we are human beings with attributes and faults.  
They are people whose work is important to them, conscientious people.  
The letter is dated July 17, 1998. It reads as follows: 
I am a resident of Beauport and have worked for Revenue Canada since 1976. 
First, our salaries have been frozen since 1991. 
I did my part willingly, but we had no choice. 
(Another federal government injustice.)  
I continue with the third: 
We have lost 17% of the cost of living since 1991. 
This came out of my net salary. 
This 17% will affect my pension. 
In the fourth paragraph, he says this: 
The Beauport resident goes on to say, in his letter: 
So, I think that you, our members of parliament- 
That person is writing to us, members of parliament. 
Think about it for a moment. 
This writer from Beauport said the following in closing: 
There is much emphasis on the aspect of family.  
We hope you will bring the best possible one back to us. 
The position of the Bloc Quebecois is as follows. 
I would like to close with a short history of bargaining in the public service. 
Let us now look at the acts imposed by this government and the previous one. 
This is what we have with this government. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
We have had this before us now for quite some time. 
I asked why they said that. 
This is something the Canadian people must realize. 
Mr. Speaker, would you buy a pig in a poke? 
Would you agree to something you knew nothing about? 
That letter clearly indicates that this did not happen just in this last week. 
The government knew well in advance that this problem was developing.  
This was all in that letter.  
We are holding our noses and voting for this legislation. 
What else can we do? 
That is the point I am trying to make. 
They are looking for solutions.  
I will give a bit of an explanation on the proposal we put forward. 
I am hoping at some point the government will seriously look at this. 
He cannot take some middle ground between them. 
He has to select one or the other offer.  
The key thing is who the arbitrator is going to be. 
Both sides have to select an arbitrator from a pool of arbitrators. 
It is critical that it is an impartial person who reviews the final offers.  
Why are we supporting this legislation? 
We really have no choice. 
We have to get these people back to work. 
The government has dilly-dallied. 
Farmers do not own their own grain. 
They have to sell it through the wheat board. 
How does that compare? 
At one time we were up to 21.5%. 
How is that impacting on my riding? 
The various elevators in the northern part of my riding are plugged. 
Way back on January 24 of this year the first stoppage of services occurred. 
As I have already revealed, the government knew about this. 
A letter was sent asking the government to do something about it. 
That was quite some time ago.  
The workers are on strike. 
They are picketing all five terminals. 
Sixteen grain vessels are waiting for a total of 370,000 tonnes of grain. 
That is all part of the equation. 
The Canadian Pacific Railway will not deliver grain cars to any of the country elevators. 
It has cancelled all its car allocations for the next week. 
That is virtually grinding to a halt as well.  
CN has 13 trains waiting in Vancouver as we speak. 
It cannot move any of them forward. 
They cannot do anything with these cars because of the strike. 
Seventy workers are holding up a huge economy. 
That is totally unacceptable.  
Canada's reputation as a supplier of grain is severely affected. 
We are going to suffer immensely because of this work stoppage. 
This reputation affects the entire country. 
All of this is being severely impacted.  
We talked a lot last week about the decline in productivity. 
This legislation is not the answer to the problem on the west coast. 
The government should seriously consider implementing legislation that will solve this for the long term.  
Let me quickly summarize the essence of what Reformers are saying. 
There was some misinformation in the stories. 
I would like to clarify that.  
That is not true. 
I will tell the rest of the story.  
We want to get the PSAC workers back to work permanently. 
We called for an emergency debate on this matter twice last week. 
The first time it was refused. 
The debate was then held on the evening of Thursday, March 18. 
This procedure would ensure the continuous flow of grain to market.  
He responded by saying that he was looking at all the options. 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
I will resume after Oral Question Period.  
Since this morning, I have been listening to the debate on Bill C-76. 
I believe Bloc Quebecois members are very well prepared. 
Our approach to this bill is very well structured. 
What exactly is being proposed this morning? 
Unfortunately, we are looking at closure. 
Each word of this motion is very important.  
It reads as follows: 
During consideration of the said bill, no division shall be deferred.  
Is this because they have nothing to say? 
If they have nothing to say, why did they run in 1997? 
I find this extremely strange. 
We were not caught with our pants down, as they say. 
The government has decided to bring out its heavy artillery. 
In labour law, there are rules that must be followed. 
As far as I know, the employees and their union have followed those rules.  
Bargaining is a complicated and difficult process. 
The membership must be properly represented. 
I was a labour lawyer before I became an MP.  
We will now go to Statements by Members.  
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
I do not know whether it is her or me who created the instance. 
She always taught us to pay as we go and live within our means. 
I am very thankful for that.  
Some might ask how old she is. 
I would not dare ask that question. 
My mom's age is quite irrelevant; it is her knowledge.  
I can say that this place would not be the same without you.  
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I wish the hon. member's mother a happy birthday. 
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the year 2000 is being anticipated with hope and optimism. 
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Master Corporal Giguere is in serious but stable condition. 
We wish him a speedy recovery.  
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Hon. Andy Scott (Fredericton, Lib.):
It can be characterized by seizures, uncontrollable shaking or convulsion.  
Canadian research has made important contributions to the development of effective treatment. 
Furthermore, 20% of seizures are not successfully controlled by current medication.  
Continued research must be supported. 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Guelph-Wellington has done it again. 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
It was not the first time this man had been drinking and driving. 
His suggestions are being considered by the Standing Committee on Justice.  
I urge all political parties to support this initiative- 
The hon. member for Vercheres-Les-Patriotes.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
What is happening today? 
The Liberals are imposing back to work legislation. 
This is a punitive measure. 
It is unacceptable to treat loyal public servants in this fashion.  
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
CHAD BLUNDON AND LISA ROBICHAUD 
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
ELMIRA MAPLE SYRUP FESTIVAL 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
The festival is a wonderful event in the Waterloo-Wellington area.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
This goes beyond the bounds of being a good little MP.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I was elected to this parliament in 1963. 
It is a very important task.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will tell you the responsibility of any member of parliament. 
What does the Prime Minister do? 
He sends in his top personal aid to send a little message. 
The message was clear. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The member for Okanagan-Shuswap worked for Askews Grocery Store. 
The member for Nanaimo-Alberni worked for Port Alberni Marina. 
The member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley worked for the Fraser Fort George Museum. 
The member for Skeena worked for the Skeena Valley Golf and Country Club. 
The member for Kootenay-Columbia worked for the St. Eugene Mission.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
The words are close, but so far they are parliamentary. 
I would like the hon. member to please put her question.  
He has them to face today. 
Put the question right now. 
The words are now getting a little bit closer. 
The questioning of a member's character is not permissible. 
I am going to permit the Right Hon. Prime Minister to answer the question.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have served my riding for 36 years. 
I saw that again yesterday. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
But that is not all. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I do not have a share in that golf course. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, perhaps I will have to refresh the Prime Minister's memory. 
This is exactly the kind of question a conflict of interest raises. 
When will this be cleared up for Canadians?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I would like to quote a member of the National Assembly. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Would he increase contributions? 
Would he reduce benefits further? 
Or would he be obliged to present a deficit budget?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We are a long way from a recession. 
Should one by misfortune ever occur, the contributions are at an appropriate level. 
There would be no need to increase them.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Words are becoming a little too strong. 
The Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
What is the Bloc Quebecois asking us to do? 
Bring back the 10-42 system. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
I am sure we will be able to satisfactorily answer the member's questions. 
I would like to clarify some of the facts the member put forward.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Why should cities like Windsor and Sarnia be exposed to risk? 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I think I am being very clear to the hon. member. 
No commitments have been made. 
There have been no plans for any flights for any transportation. 
The point is we live in a dangerous nuclear world. 
We have some responsibilities to help in the denuclearizing of that world. 
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, again they use all sorts of words. 
These are the words of a member of parliament. 
Every member of parliament does this.  
The hon. member for Markham.  
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Mr. Speaker, two wrongs do not make a right. 
The Prime Minister is hiding. 
The ethics counsellor has no teeth to investigate the Prime Minister. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
The member is welcome to look at the facts for himself if he wants. 
That is fundamentally the answer to the member's question.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to give the Prime Minister an opportunity to correct the record.  
I ask him to correct that statement.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I was not paid. 
I do not ask them any questions. 
I do not have the shares. 
I make it my point not to ask any questions. 
It is the job of the trustee to decide what to do with my assets.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Apparently that is the way this has all happened. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
It is a big problem but I am still eating three times a day.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
There is no other commitment than that.  
We have to do our part to help reduce that threat.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
We would certainly be glad to engage at that point.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we are getting a smokescreen from the Prime Minister. 
This is not the case with the golf course.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what I have done. 
To be very prudent I said manage these assets too. 
It is her problem, not mine. 
She is a competent lawyer and she is doing her job. 
I put all my assets in the trust. 
It is a blind trust. 
I was not forced to give her the management. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
I ask hon. members to address each other by their proper titles.  
Will he answer the question?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Industry. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
We will protect the interests of all Canadians.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
That is what he said.  
The hon. member can put her question again.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we did work with the other provinces. 
After all, there was already a directive from the European Union that concerned us.  
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, in that particular case, we went through exactly the same process. 
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to go back to the Prime Minister.  
Mr. Duhaime bought a money losing hotel from the Prime Minister. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I had no business relations at all with Mr. Duhaime. 
CANADIAN EMBASSY IN BERLIN 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mention should perhaps also have been made of the Winnipeg connection.  
The hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
It is easy, Mr. Speaker, because he was not. 
It was based upon four separate criteria. 
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
It may take months and even years to recoup that.  
Unfortunately the losses that occur are picked up by the farmers. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we are trying to get to the bottom of this very murky affair. 
We would appreciate some direct answers to some direct questions.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
We know that the Prime Minister's office interfered in that process.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the shares were sold in 1993 to a different person. 
After that there was a debt owed to me. 
I guess I will have a collection for my breakfast tomorrow morning. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Mr. Duhaime is no ordinary constituent of the Prime Minister. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hotel was owned by the company that owned the golf course. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, he does not owe me a cent. 
I have no shares, no interests. 
He owes me not a cent, not a dollar, not a loonie.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
The hon. member for Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough.  
What safeguards are there?  
The question is in order. 
The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I was assured that everything was absolutely correctly done.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
We have seen the Liberal fundraiser convicted- 
I want the member to go directly to his question with no more preamble.  
The hon. member for Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford.  
Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the Environment.  
What is the government doing right now to respond to the concerns of the scientists?  
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am absolutely not at all embarrassed to get up in the House. 
Those who qualify, qualify. 
I could talk about many other projects of the Progressive Conservative Party.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
They might as well just get into it with everybody else.  
What is the point, Mr. Speaker? 
The hon. member is a veteran parliamentarian and he has raised this point before. 
I undertake to do that.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Our armed forces are waiting.  
Surely this type of question would be in order during question period. 
GOVERNMENT SERVICES ACT, 1999 
MOTION THAT DEBATE BE NOT FURTHER ADJOURNED 
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
We must understand what the issues and the facts are.  
It divided all its employees into seven such tables for bargaining purposes. 
They are not highly paid civil servants.  
This act came into force in 1967. 
Is that what is really going on? 
I think history has shown us that it is not the case. 
It has the power to do so. 
In August 1982, Bill C-124 froze the salaries of some 500,000 public servants. 
That was more or less what Bill C-29 was all about.  
But something rather special happened then. 
The International Labour Organization had doubts then.  
In 1992, there was something else. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Unfortunately this bill should never have been brought to the House.  
The government has not been negotiating in good faith with PSAC workers. 
It has not treated them fairly. 
We understand the reasons why the government will do that.  
We cannot have an economy that is held hostage to strikes. 
There is a way of resolving this issue. 
How do we ensure that people will not go on strike? 
How do we ensure the economy will not be hurt? 
How, on the other hand, do we enable workers to get a fair resolution?  
The way to do that is by binding arbitration or final offer arbitration. 
In other words, give workers in various disciplines the opportunity to negotiate a settlement. 
A third party, acceptable to both sides, would then make the decision.  
The other option is binding arbitration. 
That would enable workers to get a fair and quick resolution to their situation. 
PSAC workers, like other workers, just want to get back to work. 
They want to be treated fairly. 
Are they asking for things that are unreasonable? 
No, they are not. 
Their pay has been frozen since 1992. 
They are asking for a fair wage increase. 
For example, in Victoria the cost of living is higher than in Halifax. 
That is not fair. 
Right to work legislation exists in some parts of the United States. 
That is extremely important.  
In my riding we have quite a number of PSAC workers. 
They have been asked to downsize significantly. 
They have streamlined their jobs. 
They have streamlined their work. 
They have not asked for much at all. 
That should not happen. 
That is called parity.  
That is not what employment equity is all about. 
We do not believe that is fair. 
We do not support that. 
We very much support that. 
They are hardworking individuals who are the backbone of our country. 
Yet the government has not treated them fairly.  
That is all they are asking. 
Why it does not do this I do not understand.  
It should identify other workers it believes are essential. 
To do anything less is grossly unfair to all concerned.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Let us be clear about what is before the House today. 
It is yet another example of how arrogant this government has become.  
Lo and behold, that hope was short-lived for many of us.  
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire:
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
I request your co-operation, Madam Speaker. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Indeed, I note there is no quorum. 
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I see we now have quorum.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
Instead I saw two things in very short order. 
The second thing I noticed was a government of unprecedented arrogance. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
I call for a quorum check. 
I see the House is virtually empty.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I see we now have quorum.  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I was present while she stayed in the Chamber. 
She did not leave immediately after she called for a quorum count.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
This is not a point of order but a matter for debate.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
They have to be ashamed and embarrassed. 
This is not an isolated incident. 
It would have proceeded in secret and arbitrarily. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien:
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
I would like a quorum call please.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
We now have a quorum.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
The decisions are made outside this place. 
That is an undemocratic practice. 
In that case we were talking about bovine growth hormone. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
We are talking about closure.  
I am right on topic.  
This is discrimination with a capital D . 
Our prime minister does nothing to help us. 
I feel we have no rights as Canadian citizens.  
Alice does not feel she has any rights as a Canadian citizen. 
We do not feel we have any rights as members of parliament. 
Let me go on and read from Leona who wrote: 
Let me quote from Mike who wrote to me today: 
We are doing that today. 
It is absolutely unnecessary and unexplainable. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak to this debate. 
There should have been a settlement a long time ago. 
People are pushing hard for negotiations and to reach a settlement. 
We will not be able to legislate them back to work. 
They have no alternatives. 
What are you going to do for me? 
How much money are you going to bring me this year? 
How are you going to increase my wages?''  
They have absolutely no say. 
It comes from other places.  
They go on strike and stop the movement of grain. 
That is what they asked. 
Why do hon. members think that a relief package is going out?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I must apologize to the member.  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
We now have a quorum.  
Madam Speaker, we have to play a few more games. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
I do not appreciate the comment made by the member opposite. 
I am wearing this to show compassion for government employees.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
This is not a point of order but a matter for debate.  
Madam Speaker, that is what I am getting at. 
Farmers are the ones who lose. 
That is really important stuff.  
They have no avenue. 
They do not have a union. 
They cannot go on strike. 
We would like to blame everything under the sun. 
The government could have put an end to any danger in grain movement- 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I do not see a quorum at this time.  
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
We now have a quorum.  
The farmers' only alternative is the House of Commons. 
They cannot go on strike. 
They cannot set the price of their grain. 
The fate of the farmers is left in the hands of everybody under the sun. 
But there are these constant interruptions every year. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
The member opposite is using his cellular telephone. 
This is completely unacceptable.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Madam Speaker, we continue to play games. 
The farmers are quite concerned about their fate, about what is going to happen. 
I guess right now that is the most important thing. 
Madam Speaker, the interpretation is not coming through. 
I think something is not working.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
We are talking about the fate of a lot of people. 
They do not care that much. 
We are going to support this back to work legislation. 
There is no doubt about that. 
We want these things to come to an end. 
This does not have to happen year after year. 
It is costing the farmers millions of dollars. 
It has put a lot of young farmers right out business. 
I do not think any of them over there know what it is like. 
I will lead them to Vancouver. 
I was asked how many acres I have. 
That is life on a farm. 
I would like to talk about the prison guards. 
I visited the prison guards in my last portfolio. 
They begged and pleaded with the government and with corrections to do something. 
They were concerned about a raise. 
They had not had one for nine years. 
Now it is up to 11 years. 
Guards who put in harassment charges are never dealt with. 
Sometimes it takes two to three years. 
The government puts such little value on the people who work in these institutions. 
In 11 years the guards have not had a raise. 
The government is not even willing to talk about it. 
She has been out of work.  
This place sits back and plays its little games. 
How many times did it never happen? 
Why do we not do that?  
I am from a different party than those members are. 
You never have good ideas.  
Are those bad ideas?  
Farmers supply food to that member and to every household in the country. 
Is that not a good idea? 
I will pass the information on to the farmers. 
Stand up and say it. 
We will turn the mike on so we can hear. 
Those individuals do not have a union. 
How many times do we have to say that? 
They have to wait and see what it is going to be. 
We treat it every year in the same fashion.  
And fishing, which is farming. 
Let us get to the legislation. 
We want to support the legislation. 
We want the back to work legislation. 
We can do something.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
I find it rather interesting. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
I do not see a quorum in the House. 
Perhaps we should call for one, for the benefit of members.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In fact, we do not have a quorum. 
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
We now have a quorum.  
Madam Speaker, there are a couple of not so minor points of interest. 
Why were there not other members there?'' 
We all know what other members are doing. 
How many committees do we have? 
I currently sit on a couple. 
As is the health committee.  
The member says that the health committee is also meeting.  
There are members of parliament from all parties who are working in committee. 
They simply continue to call quorum. 
They are trying to perpetrate the fraud upon the Canadian people that members of parliament- 
And we will keep doing it until the cows come home.  
Go ahead, you just assist me when you chirp like that.  
Members are at committee. 
But the Bloc is not interested in that. 
That is all it is doing.  
We are quite prepared to do that.  
How do you like them apples?  
It is, of course, back to work legislation. 
Is that something any government wants to do? 
I would say not. 
There have been problems. 
Labour negotiation is a very complicated and difficult process to go through.  
I know a little of what I speak because my dad was a labour leader. 
Your uncle Ed will be happy.  
It is uncle Ted. 
He only farms rocks mostly. 
In any event, my dad would say that he did not agree with it. 
However, he would understand democracy. 
The games that people play are quite remarkable. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I will try to speak up. 
Perhaps that will help, although I doubt it.  
What are some of the problems? 
More than one million Canadians are awaiting their income tax returns. 
How many of those might be in la belle province I wonder. 
Why are the Bloc members doing that?  
That is simply not right.  
The right to strike means the right to demonstrate in a public place. 
It means the right to picket. 
It means the right to withhold services.  
That is plain and simple. 
We have arrived at that point with this legislation.  
No, I do not have to yell louder. 
The microphone is on. 
We have to get grain moving again. 
That brings me to an interesting point. 
I have to be honest. 
I heard members opposite when they were outraged. 
Is that not wonderful? 
Where have they been? 
They understand the agenda. 
They are certainly not fooling us.  
Why are they not supporting the government in getting the legislation through quickly? 
That is what farmers must wonder.  
How can they assume they are protecting their interests? 
They are voting against a bill that would get the economy going again. 
I am sure they find that bewildering.  
How did that happen? 
That is an interesting bed to find themselves in. 
It must be awful crowded. 
The reality is that they would wind up using the American dollar if that happened. 
We had problems even during the Bob Rae days. 
Tell us about Bill Mahoney.  
He has not heard anything because he is not listening. 
He does not like the fact that this is responsible legislation. 
He is just trying to be disruptive.  
The government has negotiated. 
We have sat at the table. 
The government is responsible enough to know that cannot happen. 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
It is important to have a clear picture of what we will be talking about. 
That, notwithstanding any standing order or usual practice of this House- 
All that goes out the window.  
During consideration of the said bill, no division shall be deferred.  
It must be more expensive when there is overtime involved. 
At time and a half, it is $33,000 an hour. 
At double time, it is $44,000 an hour. 
And they are the ones accusing the opposition of wanting to spend the taxpayers' money.  
I would be ashamed to say such things in the House. 
It is their fault that the House will be sitting so late.  
This is what the outstanding speaker from Mississauga West suggested.  
This harks back to the Duplessis area. 
My colleague from Trois-Rivieres will confirm this. 
I see my colleague, the member for Beauce, getting excited already. 
She was on the verge of tears. 
What can we do?'' 
Not only that, but this is done in an underhand manner. 
It is done through the back door. 
It is done hypocritically. 
That was called the ``night of the long knives''.  
Special legislation ought to be a last-ditch effort. 
This is a fundamental right, and one which is in a number of international conventions. 
What is the Canadian government doing? 
The government is reverting to a reactionary policy. 
Where are we headed? 
Where does the government want to take us? 
To the abolition of the right of Quebec and Canadian workers- 
Yes, Les miserables , among others. 
They are in front of us.  
This time, it is coming down on its own side, because it is the employer. 
There is a terrible imbalance. 
It lives in a bubble, on another planet.  
What does it mean, living on another planet? 
It means imposing regulations and laws that are completely ridiculous. 
This is a totally hateful attitude, worthy of Duplessis, and we must keep saying that.  
This is not the Parti Quebecois here, this is the Liberal Party.  
Now for the examples. 
He has refused to comply with the ruling on pay equity. 
The commission has asked the government to withdraw the appeal. 
How did the government react? 
I am happy to see that the member for Mississauga West is listening carefully. 
I am sure he will learn a lot of things from my speech.  
He does not even acknowledge the problem.  
What is the President of the Treasury Board doing? 
I think it deserves a try in the rest of Canada. 
But what did the President of the Treasury Board do? 
What did the President of the Treasury Board do in addition? 
I have two children, who have just turned one. 
They must be protected. 
What did the President of the Treasury Board do? 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Will the member please repeat what he said. 
I did not catch the member's request.  
Before everyone came back, there was unanimous consent.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
Freedom of association exists in Canada. 
When workers have good reason to do so, they go on strike. 
Back to work legislation should only be a last resort. 
I will end on that note. 
I could talk forever about this issue. 
It is always a pleasure to address this House, through you, Mr. Speaker. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Unfortunately, there is not unanimous consent. 
The hon. member for Drummond.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
These last two days have marked some extremely sad moments in our history. 
It has decided it will act as police and no longer negotiate. 
That is what it is saying.  
It is holding people hostage. 
It is the one acting in bad faith. 
The minority report was tabled by the employer. 
These are not people who earn huge salaries. 
They have not received a raise for a long time. 
This is democracy according to the government.  
Workers are not asking for the moon. 
They have not had a wage increase in six years. 
The employer's offers in this respect have apparently been negligible. 
The government's offer for table 4 is not known right now. 
There is a majority conciliation report that the government seems to be ignoring. 
It has already negotiated and everyone agreed. 
The government then said that was that. 
In fact, if that was what the government wanted, picketing could stop today. 
But what is the government saying? 
That the union demands are unreasonable. 
If they are so unreasonable, why refuse to go to arbitration? 
What has the government to lose?  
This is what the government wants to do to the employees of the public service.  
Those picket lines hurt prairies farmers. 
Have they been exhausted? 
We do not believe so. 
Going out on strike is a right of the workers. 
The member for Mississauga who has supported this special legislation should be ashamed.  
His father is a union man.  
He will be accountable to his constituents.  
This is completely anti-democratic. 
The government did not think about the people who would be affected by this legislation.  
The Liberal government is a very centralizing government. 
But to pass a bill like this one leans toward dictatorship. 
This is no longer democracy at work. 
As I said earlier, the right to strike is a fundamental right for workers. 
This special legislation would deny them their right. 
Arbitration is still an option. 
We know the mentality of this government and of the President of the Treasury Board. 
I said it before and I will say it again, this is dictatorial.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms: 
a) freedom of conscience and religion; 
c) freedom of peaceful assembly; and 
d) freedom of association.  
Today reference is being made to different bargaining tables. 
Salaries are the same, it is their expenses that are not.  
What has been said in the House is wrong. 
We cannot accept the way Canadians are being treated. 
Once again the government is going after the workers. 
Once again, it is committing another injustice in our country. 
That is where the problem lies.  
They do not want it discussed in parliament. 
They say ``You are the bad guys. 
You, the workers, are the bad ones. 
You are not moving the farmers' grain''. 
You should be ashamed. 
You should be ashamed of the way you are treating your workers. 
They are not in reality the best paid.  
The Liberals are not the only ones to do that. 
The Conservatives did it in 1989 and 1991. 
At that time, I was a union member, and the Liberals were in opposition. 
They boasted, saying ``We would never do that. 
We would never do that if you put us in government. 
We would not treat our employees like that''. 
This is utterly shameful.  
Let the government tell the truth.  
What are things coming to? 
It looks like we are following Mexico's lead. 
We are losing our democracy.  
They did not pass legislation for the RCMP. 
They deserve to be paid the same.  
Once again, what is going on is unacceptable. 
They should not be boasting. 
What is going on is a disgrace. 
We have a Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms giving us the right of association. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I must unfortunately interrupt the hon. member. 
When debate resumes, he will have approximately 10 minutes remaining.  
TAX ON FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The amended motion would then read: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
He still has five minutes remaining.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I want to briefly summarize what I said previously.  
That kind of a tax would also bring in a fair bit of return. 
It would have to be put in place globally. 
Those points are important. 
That is what we are saying we have to move toward. 
All those conditions have to be met. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
The debate we are having today is very important. 
To understand speculation, a bit of a historical background may be useful.  
This is a complex debate, but the impact of speculation remains to be determined. 
Today, at least, we are dealing with part of this problem.  
I think the issue must be considered in a more comprehensive way. 
There are other mechanisms. 
There is some instability.  
These investments do not create jobs, but wealth. 
It all depends how you define wealth.  
There are other causes for concern. 
I am not talking about hypothetical things.  
I am wondering who is attacking and who is mounting the attack. 
I believe this is worthy of debate.  
This leads me to an issue dear to me. 
I believe the economy is currently in mutation. 
Today, this proportion is as high as 90% to 95%. 
Make no mistake, I am not against globalization. 
Here in Canada, there is the CCIC and the Halifax initiative. 
My experience with markets has shown that they often had a tendency to be unstable. 
Obviously these are financial accidents.  
This quote is from the October 24, 1996 issue of L'Express .  
These are not leftist remarks. 
That is why I will vote in favour of this motion today.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
What is the Tobin tax? 
Why do we need a Tobin tax in today's market? 
The economic market was supposed to reward risk takers. 
That is the theory.  
The finance minister has recognized in the Tobin tax: 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
We do not need more taxation.  
What we have here is a motion by the member for Regina-Qu'Appelle. 
I will not question the hon. member's motivation. 
That is the whole agenda of the NDP.  
We talked about helping poor people. 
A nice fellow indeed. 
I said to him ``Therein lies the difference betwixt thee and me. 
Here is an interesting twist, though. 
It does not discourage it at all. 
As a means of discouraging speculation, it is a wrong headed idea. 
I would like to make a few comments on this tax. 
Generally what we tax we discourage. 
He just drove his old one. 
I think that was a good decision anyway. 
It was a perfectly good car. 
I will not do any free advertising for Oldsmobile here.  
Everybody will be happy. 
This is NDP style.  
The Brits came up with a wonderful measure of a tax for rich people. 
The windows were not needed if they were to be taxed on them. 
That is so obvious.  
There is another big problem with this tax. 
I have already mentioned the finance minister and his steamship companies. 
Investors can go to these countries and do financial transactions without being taxed. 
That is exactly what they will do. 
That is human nature. 
There is another very important aspect to this. 
She will take the tax from this and have a whole bureaucracy. 
The minister will take this tax and redistribute the money. 
That is an absolutely insane idea. 
We have taxes on taxes. 
This member certainly has his ideas. 
He is welcome to them. 
Let us all be sure that it is firmly defeated.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
He did raise it at the Halifax reunion referred to in 1995. 
It is a subject we are very concerned with. 
He has been working in the practical world of economics. 
Again there have been serious complaints made by third world countries.  
It is a subject that it could attend to.  
It is the green light. 
Sometimes we get interesting new policies. 
We welcome the motion by the member for Regina-Qu'Appelle. 
Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau, Lib.):
Every day, in excess of one thousand billion dollars are moved around the world. 
This is not exactly investments, but rather speculation. 
There has been reference made to the Tobin tax. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
It being 6.16 p.m., the time provided for debate has expired. 
Accordingly, the question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
(The House divided on the amendment, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the amendment lost.  
The next question is on the main motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The division will take place in the same way as the previous one.  
(The House divide on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
(The House divided on the motion, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the motion defeated.  
GOVERNMENT SERVICES ACT, 1999 
MOTION THAT DEBATE BE NOT FURTHER ADJOURNED 
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
Pursuant to order made earlier today, the House will now resume consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
I spoke for about 10 minutes in French. 
That is not equality of rights. 
Every time the government has negotiations it goes the easiest way. 
It is not only those people. 
The senators did not have to go on strike. 
The MPs did not have to go on strike. 
We did not have to go on strike, but we had our increase. 
What is the problem? 
Are we not allowed to have industry in the Atlantic provinces? 
Are we not allowed to have work? 
That is not enough. 
Now we have to treat the workers of the government differently. 
We will treat our workers the right way''. 
That was until they got elected and we see what is going on today.  
Whose fault is it? 
It is the fault of the Liberal government which is not taking its responsibilities. 
I am an MP from New Brunswick. 
I get paid the same as the members from Windsor. 
What did the minister say? 
``No, it is not true. 
We pay MPs differently. 
Some are getting paid more because they stay in the region''. 
He is not telling the truth. 
The wages of the MPs are the same across the country.  
I never heard about them again. 
Does PSAC have to go to see Doug Young? 
Is he the one who will save this country? 
Is that the way it works? 
Does somebody in the Liberal Party have to be paid by the back door? 
Is that the way it goes?  
Those people did not have to go on strike. 
The people of PSAC have proposed something. 
``Why does the government not give us binding arbitration? 
If it gave us binding arbitration we would agree with the arbitrator''. 
The arbitrator would come down with a decision. 
There are people working in prisons. 
What has the government done for them? 
Those people will have to take the 2%, the 2.5% and the 1%. 
That is not democracy. 
That is not the way to do things. 
They cannot be proud of the Liberals. 
The Atlantic region has learned its lesson now. 
In Nova Scotia they got rid of every one of them. 
In New Brunswick we are almost there. 
It needs to be done.  
We have to be proud of the workers in our country. 
We have to respect them. 
They are the base of our country; our working people, men and women. 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
This is an attack on democracy, at least on parliamentary democracy.  
The people want their members of parliament to express their fears. 
That is the case. 
I answered ``Naturally, it is a matter of equity''. 
We must not only reduce the gap, but eliminate the differences. 
We consider that an important right.  
All this has come up in the negotiations on labour relations.  
I would even say that some are ashamed of such a measure. 
As we know, the government imposes the party line when members vote on such issues. 
I understand why there are very few Liberal members here this evening. 
We cannot allude to members' absence, but we can talk about their presence. 
Today, I was at the industry committee. 
They died so that their fellow citizens could continue to exercise their democratic rights.  
There is another right and that is the right of association. 
In 1982, a bill was introduced to freeze the salary of some 500,000 workers. 
In December 1989, back to work legislation was passed. 
Salaries were frozen for six consecutive years. 
Again, this approach was criticized by various stakeholders.  
We could go on and on. 
I want to protect federal public servants. 
Some people may wonder why a sovereignist would do that. 
There are federal public servants everywhere, including in Quebec. 
Some of these people do a good job. 
On the contrary, many of them are competent and qualified workers.  
Anytime it runs into a problem, gag orders are used., 
not just at the end of a session.  
There are not very many bills. 
There would probably be enough time. 
It was the same thing in committee, as I have said.  
This is a provincial jurisdiction.  
What does it do? 
The environment was not mentioned in the Constitution of 1867. 
This is a concept that comes up more now. 
There is another point to consider as well. 
I often meet young people, as all members do in their ridings. 
We constantly have to uphold such rights.  
In the present system, questions must be asked. 
I am not saying this has to be sorted out this evening. 
In the United States, they hold presidential elections. 
They say ``Keep talking, you members, it will get you nowhere. 
We will do the deciding''. 
If we look at that, Canada is not the United States. 
Let us discuss that a little. 
I listened to my New Democratic colleague from Acadie-Bathurst. 
He is quite right. 
He comes from one of the poorest regions in Canada. 
There is no other way to put it. 
This is done at the expense of the regions.  
Because they work in poor regions, these public servants are paid less.  
This increases regional inequalities. 
They cannot make the same contribution to their region's economic development. 
This is not fair.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
This is a totally fallacious argument.  
In my riding of Jonquiere. we have a taxation data centre. 
I cannot say the same for the government. 
Today, I am not so sure. 
It is part of a fair balance of power.  
What is there to hide?  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:
Mr. Speaker, when my dear colleague opposite speaks, I will listen. 
So I ask you to tell him to allow me to speak.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
It is easy to make statements and gratuitous insinuations.  
I am afraid this is not a point of order.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:
Mr. Speaker, we recognize your great wisdom.  
You cannot say what we are hiding. 
It is easy to make accusations.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:
We have the whole night to talk. 
Your turn will come.  
Mr. Speaker, let me recapitulate.  
Unfortunately, the employer, which happens to be this government, tabled a minority report. 
Here is what is included in the bill. 
The cat is out of the bag. 
That is because their salaries have been frozen. 
A federal government mechanic is paid $14.05 an hour. 
How can this be? 
They are doing the same work but have three different salary scales.  
The government's offer to table 4 was known. 
There was a majority conciliation report. 
Why did the government choose to ignore it? 
In fact, if the government was really interested, picket lines could come down today. 
In general, we oppose back to work legislation. 
Have all the other options been exhausted? 
The government should accept going to arbitration. 
The blue collar workers would then put an end to their pressure tactics.  
I come from a unionist background. 
The riding of Jonquiere is a workers' riding. 
I do not think this government has any respect for that.  
Let us review briefly what happened in the past. 
I will give a list of some of these measures.  
The Canada Labour Relations Board said this measure was unfair.  
Once again, the International Labour Organization denounced this process.  
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
There is no mention of Nunavut, for example. 
We get discriminated against quite often in the Atlantic.  
That is what we are seeing here. 
This government seems to think it can.  
It is important to look at the situation. 
It all seems very complicated. 
When I was a CR, that is a clerk- 
This is not complicated.  
It is not hard to understand. 
It does not matter where one lives. 
I am hoping that Canadians are realizing what these employees are asking for. 
There is no argument, none that makes sense to anybody.  
We do not have to be accountants to figure this one out. 
I still had to pay the same amount for everything.  
We have a government that loves inequality. 
Look at the pay equity issue. 
This government likes to say one thing and do another. 
There are firefighters, hospital workers, workers in national parks. 
I guess that is the direction the government is taking.  
Some cuts don't heal.  
Some cuts don't heal. 
We have our workers in national parks. 
I was one of them. 
I was actually sitting at table 2. 
Their researcher is Doug Marshall.  
They have been fighting for all the blue collar workers. 
It does not need to negotiate any more. 
I may be back to where I was before. 
That is all the negotiators are asking for. 
They are asking for what we want for our children.  
These people are fighting for our children's future.  
Is it because we have a government that offered everything?  
Who negotiated leave to care for a sick child. 
Who negotiated health insurance? 
These benefits were not handed over on a platter. 
But governments keep on wanting to destroy it all. 
They are fighting for young people. 
We have young pages working here. 
They will want to have good jobs later on. 
They will want to buy a house, have a family. 
People cannot do this if they do not earn money. 
They cannot do this if they do not enjoy job security. 
It is important to remember how things work.  
The gap between the rich and the poor is widening. 
Canadians must remember this. 
The government wants to ignore all kinds of people. 
It is all the same. 
Promises are things of the past. 
They are saying: ``Sorry, we do not need to keep our promises. 
We only make promises to get elected''. 
The results of the next elections in Nova Scotia remain to be seen. 
I believe there is a risk in New Brunswick as well. 
I could name many more.  
Even today we see another example of unfairness. 
This is not complicated.  
Let us correct that immediately. 
Perhaps, though, the Liberals are paying themselves more. 
That may be what is going on.  
Speaking of raises in salary, I was in table 2 for the negotiations. 
It is a rotten system.  
There are some employees who want to sit down and negotiate. 
Let us look at employment insurance. 
No one is representing the Atlantic''. 
Things could not have been worse than when there were 31 out of 32. 
The 31 of the 32 said to the other members ``Go ahead, cut. 
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
Why are we doing this? 
Why are we pushing the bill through the House in this manner tonight? 
Why is the government's closure motion being debated right now? 
This need not be the case tonight. 
We have been pushed into what is an emergency for thousands and thousands of Canadians.  
They have been on rotating strikes this past month. 
Some of them are not on strike right now. 
It is not unusual for this government. 
By golly it did and it is still a mess. 
Think of the immigration situation. 
Tell me what kind of government that is. 
Why could we not use the dispute settlement mechanisms that are available? 
No, we have a quota agreement. 
The worst is what we got. 
It is those people who are hurt by these government policies. 
I hope they understand the seriousness of this kind of mediocre leadership.  
They are not surprised about the dispute between PSAC and the federal government. 
They are not surprised by the rotating strikes by PSAC members.  
We are very sympathetic with those people. 
Canadian taxpayers are seriously affected by it. 
This is undoubtedly the busiest time of the year for Revenue Canada. 
Are we to ignore them?  
They will be seriously hurt by the long term effects of the strike. 
We called on the government to act. 
Farmers and taxpayers are depending upon a resolution of this problem. 
It merely adds to the problems in the long term.  
It has not looked at a third party resolution to it. 
What is final offer selection arbitration? 
Both parties would be invited to present their final best offer. 
One final offer would be accepted. 
This would focus the mind on the very best offer possible.  
We will be pushing the government in this debate to adopt this policy.  
My NDP colleagues talk about this being the end of negotiations. 
There is no need for that kind of emergency. 
Their livelihood depends upon it. 
The approach that the government is using tonight is not a new approach. 
What has been the result? 
Sixteen months later it is not even negotiating with the postal workers. 
How is that for credibility?  
The government's various stalling tactics have not helped the situation in any way. 
Why is there no means of third party mediation or arbitration? 
Why is the government not using these? 
It is really not resolving it. 
The consequences are still there. 
This is a dark anniversary. 
This is the 50th time tonight. 
It is shameful and a total disregard for the democratic process. 
We oppose this restriction on our right as members to represent our constituents.  
We also acknowledge the overwhelming need for a resolution. 
This is the government's responsibility. 
I would like to make a couple of points about the legislation. 
What will this do to the morale of employees? 
Once again I voice my reluctant support of the bill. 
I am sorry to have to do so. 
We should have never been forced into this situation in the first place. 
We simply cannot cut them off. 
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
This must be translated into concrete actions.  
The government implemented a reform of the labour code in 1967. 
It granted powers to its employees. 
This is called the right to strike.  
We have an economic relations problem as well as a political relations problem with Canada. 
We should sit down to try and resolve these problems''. 
There is no problem. 
There are only seven bargaining tables. 
Only two of those are causing problems at this time. 
It is not worth dealing with them. 
The government says it is dealing with them. 
It will behave as if there never was a problem.  
It will say ``The problem has been resolved. 
We stomped on them and now we can start afresh''.  
How does the government intend to deprive them of that right? 
It is the same thing with labour relations. 
The government has done that four times since 1971. 
Was it a life and death situation each time? 
One only needs to look at the current situation to know. 
The other situations were no more serious.  
It is true there are problems with the current situation. 
The government is acting as it does in all other areas. 
I use that term advisedly, because they had no choice in the matter. 
There they were, and the government just helped itself.  
Of course, this was probably for their own good. 
It did not have anything to do with safety. 
At that time the government had no scruples.  
It is always the fault of the federal government. 
They are not listening to that. 
They are afraid of hearing people talking about real things. 
They are trying to talk to me. 
I am certainly not going to listen to them this evening.  
I know what it means. 
In certain cases, 20 years later, the wounds are still there. 
We cannot force workers to do that because these are feelings. 
This is what respect from one's employer is all about.  
Does the government expect to promote this kind of work atmosphere with a special bill? 
It is the easy solution used to render workers powerless. 
Tomorrow morning, they will praise them in the House. 
The downside of that party is what is happening tonight.  
To appear sincere, it is not enough to look the part. 
They believe in their demands. 
If the government is truly sincere, it should also let an arbitrator decide. 
The problem will be sorted out. 
Correctional services employees will be back on the job. 
They continue to provide services. 
This takes dedication, diligence and professionalism.  
That is not what a collective agreement is all about. 
That is not what bargaining is all about. 
To do that, one must also be able to listen.  
Is it in the taxpayers' interest? 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is a very important debate. 
The debate started today and it is now 9 o'clock in the evening. 
We will be going until about 11 o'clock. 
The NDP and the Bloc Quebecois have strong union ties. 
There comes a point at which we have to act. 
That is why the Reform Party will be voting for this.  
Canadians will know what rotational strikes are. 
Federal employees of the federal finance department were unable to go to work today. 
They were unable to discharge their responsibilities.  
It happens all the time. 
This does not only affect government. 
An awful lot of work has already been undertaken. 
That is what is important.  
The proposed legislation that the minister tabled yesterday is the last possible resort. 
The government's position is that this is the last possible resort. 
What are we talking about in terms of the urgency to deal with the strike? 
There are actually safety and security issues on the table. 
Real economic disadvantages to Canadian businesses are being affected by these rotating strikes.  
This is very, very important. 
Canada has contracts and agreements which it must meet. 
There comes a point at which we cannot wait. 
The cost keeps mounting every day the system is shut down by the striking workers. 
That is a lot of money and a lot of people are affected. 
Canadians have to know that.  
Why is it that Canadians so often are held hostage at the worst possible times? 
It is not fair to hold Canadians hostage.  
The operations of some departments have been severely impacted by the strike activity. 
The proposed legislation allows the government to implement- 
Mr. Speaker, I am trying to communicate my views as a member of parliament. 
Canadians must understand that every reasonable effort has been made. 
Canadians should know that this started back on October 17, 1996. 
That is how long ago this started. 
They could not reach a settlement. 
At that point government had to act.  
All Canadians are impacted. 
The member who is heckling will understand that very well. 
We have seen that before. 
We respected the process and the same occurs here. 
It is the same situation. 
This has to stop. 
They are who we have to protect.  
Canadians are being held hostage by 13% of the PSAC members. 
Canadians should be assured of that.  
The employer has also made concessions. 
We act in good faith. 
Here is the good faith.  
This is a very significant concession. 
It is going to pass. 
We are here doing our job. 
I thank the member from the NDP who has heckled me throughout my speech. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
It never should have gone this far. 
There is no reason that it should be this way.  
I have often noticed that members of his party get confused.  
Now we are going to see the results of that.  
This is not a joke. 
This is very serious. 
We have to do something about it. 
A grain train has not left the prairies for over a week. 
People are in a very bad state. 
People will not be able to move their grain to the trains. 
Something has to be done. 
We have been having these problems for 30 years. 
There is nothing new under the sun. 
The grain movement in this country has been constantly victimized by labour disputes. 
It never seems to end.  
There will always be somebody left on the outside who can tie it up.  
In this case it was the grain weighers in PSAC. 
Treasury Board has mismanaged negotiations with these people. 
It has brought in this legislation that will affect 14,000 people. 
In this case a very obvious solution would be to provide final offer selection arbitration. 
It is a solution that has been widely used. 
The government is certainly not unfamiliar with the mechanism. 
It has used it. 
It is my understanding that in this particular instance PSAC would agree to it. 
It would accept final offer binding arbitration. 
The government has boxed itself in and 14,000 workers are affected. 
Not all of them are even on strike. 
It is suspected they might go on strike. 
That is a rather important consideration.  
Many members want to address this question tonight. 
I will be addressing it again when we get to committee of the whole. 
With that I will let it go for now. 
I have made my position abundantly clear.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Therefore the Liberals used their majority in the House to limit debate. 
Make no mistake: this is an affront to democracy.  
This is incredible and truly unfair.  
This bill undermines the democratic rights of Canadian workers. 
We in the NDP oppose this unjust legislation.  
I did my best. 
I could not believe it. 
Suddenly that articulate, loud mouthed little member for Cypress Hills-Grasslands is defending workers. 
It was too good to be true. 
Guess what happened today. 
We found that the Reform Party was in bed with the Liberal Party once again.  
I say shame on the Reform Party. 
Who will they vote with tonight? 
They will vote against farmers. 
They are voting against some of the poorest paid public servants in the country.  
It is not just doing that. 
One of its basic rights is freedom of association. 
He is out of the labour movement himself. 
They are being sent back to work without any terms in writing. 
It is absolutely unbelievable and unprecedented.  
Let me be very clear. 
The value of their work is not recognized through decent pensions. 
In many cases they face very dangerous and intolerable working conditions.  
The government is treating these dedicated and hard working employees with absolute contempt. 
Let us look at the working conditions of those who have been on strike. 
In my own province of British Columbia how many are we talking about? 
The largest group of these employees is at Esquimalt in Victoria. 
In Vancouver the largest group is at the grain commission. 
These are not fat cats. 
The ones that did not were not picketed.  
That does not even catch them up to seven long years with no increase whatsoever.  
The government and the union were not that far apart. 
Let us take a look at that figure for a minute. 
Eight million dollars would have ensured that farmers were able to get their grain through. 
It makes no sense whatsoever.  
These are hard working employees. 
I have spoken with a number of them in my constituency office. 
Women in the federal public service are still waiting for pay equity. 
The government continues to fight against equal pay for work of equal value.  
Instead of treating its employees with respect, what does it do? 
Common law spouse includes those relationships. 
There was a conciliation board report released on March 19. 
These workers accepted the recommendation of the conciliation board. 
It was a very different Liberal Party back in 1991.  
I wonder if Clark pays for his jet.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson:
The loud mouth member from Coquitlam was not here then. 
They were prepared to defend the public service.  
They were there with the public service, but now what are they doing? 
This legislation, this motion is an affront to democracy.  
This is an assault on our international obligations. 
This is an assault on freedom of association. 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
The same goes for corrections officers.  
Like the unemployed, they helped eliminate the deficit. 
It changed its mind however. 
That is permitted under the rules of bargaining. 
According to the government, the union's demands are unreasonable. 
The reason is very simple, and the problem is a big one. 
Yet, surprisingly, federal blue collar workers are not on a general strike. 
They will be in a strike position on March 26. 
This is another edifying example of negotiation. 
The examples of unfair action on the part of this government are increasing. 
In December 1989, there was the back to work legislation, Bill C-49. 
For these employees and their union, this is a dead end. 
The only solution is for the government to bargain in good faith. 
These negotiations have been going on for two years, without an agreement. 
It is now up to the government to show its good faith. 
There is a lot of wisdom in this quote from Clemenceau. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to enter into the debate today. 
It is called closure. 
It is called ``Let's not debate the issue, let's just do it.'' 
Of course that brings us to a real solid dilemma.  
I was just trying to think of some sort of analogy. 
Why did we get into this? 
They went on strike.  
What do we do when there is a collision of interests?  
This has been such a tremendously difficult year for them. 
They are facing the next year with great trepidation. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Is the line of reasoning that he is following relevant?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
At this time of the night I need that kind of affirmation. 
This is a very important issue. 
We are talking about cash flow for farmers. 
We are talking about the delivery of grain. 
We are talking about the sale of grain which brings their income. 
I grew up on a farm. 
My father bought it. 
It is certainly true that it is very, very tough to be a farmer.  
They just had notice that the cost of fuel is going up substantially. 
It comes at such a bad time.  
About 20 years ago a friend and I had a little business. 
It happened to be a dairy business. 
They need to be milked every day.  
There was a strike at the dairy which picked up our milk. 
We ended up putting 5,000 gallons of milk down the drain every other day. 
We lost our income and we really had a tough time. 
It set us back fantastically. 
It was simply because they did not have an agreement. 
We need to work very hard and care for and look after each other. 
I think that is a breakdown. 
The government is refusing. 
That does not seem to be terribly unreasonable to me. 
This Liberal government has to think of what this action means. 
There is an attachment to the land. 
He has a great interest in this. 
I want to share an experience I had. 
That sits on our coffee table with great pride.  
I want to say something about that first agreement. 
We did not like some of the things that happened. 
We thought that the union was sometimes unresponsive to us. 
There are two levels of dispute resolution when it comes to labour agreements. 
They go on strike and force the hand of the other side.  
One of them was a guy by the name of Percy Bell. 
It was not forced by one side. 
It was right down to the day. 
Two weeks later they would give their positions on those contracts. 
There was a time line for arranging for meetings. 
It was all spelled out in the agreement.  
Now I will drop the bombshell. 
Unfortunately, the government threw a monkey wrench into this process. 
There was no arbitration. 
What happened was that before the negotiations began, the government would simply make an announcement. 
It is long overdue.  
If they have agreed to it, they will make it work. 
If it is imposed on them, they will not.  
There is a better way.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
The issue we have been discussing is one of extreme importance. 
That is what is happening today. 
The government is invoking back to work legislation. 
Make no bones about it. 
The government willingly created the situation we are dealing with today.  
They would have been working. 
That would have ended the whole situation of today. 
If we want to put blame, let us put the blame where it should be.  
Where is their right to the free and democratic collective bargaining process? 
It does not exist with the government.  
What has been done today sets that back. 
That is not the case here. 
It has now imposed the entire contract on them with no conciliation process.  
Next I will discuss regional rates of pay. 
Otherwise they should be opposing regional rates of pay. 
If they really believe that they should put their money where their mouths are.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
We are very concerned about this kind of legislation. 
Now the legislation forces them to abandon that particular avenue of redress.  
This is very significant for Atlantic Canadians.  
Why are these workers striking in the first place? 
It is of particular concern to Atlantic Canadians. 
Regional disparity is reinforced by regional rates of pay.  
MPs do not have different rates of pay. 
We all have the same basic pay. 
Why are we opposed to closure and time allocation? 
This is particularly true in Atlantic Canada. 
Quite often we see situations within our constituencies that call for solutions. 
The solutions are pretty simple if there is a will to get to the answer. 
I think for example of the issue of pay equity. 
It has gone through several levels of adjudication and rulings have been made. 
Pay equity is one of them.  
Let us look at the replacement of the Sea King helicopters. 
We see incident after incident where these helicopters are causing people concern. 
We can look at instances where industries are closing down in different areas. 
The results are pretty pitiful thus far, but I will not give up.  
Mr. Speaker, would you allow me to take part in this debate? 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve is quite correct. 
Right now we are hearing from the member for Vancouver-Quadra.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
His eloquence swept across the House. 
It was a moving and eloquent address. 
We are indebted to the member for Elk Island.  
I distinctly heard him utter words- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
What were the businesses affected with the public interest? 
Some would say it is too large. 
We think on this side of the House that we have the right balance. 
That would be a formidable confrontation and we would certainly want to avoid it.  
Why do so many of us cast stones against that other house? 
The grass is green. 
When we visit the offices of the Senate we see that beautiful red plush velvet. 
I asked ``What have they done?'' 
It has been observed. 
I was appalled when I heard this. 
I empathized with the senator concerned, one of our most attractive senators. 
We discussed alternative, more moderate controls, to take a further step beyond Mr. Justice Holmes.  
The principle was an inviolate one. 
The House cannot be used for service of ordinary legal processes. 
A member cannot be arrested in the House. 
That is why I come back to the 16th century.  
Mr. Chief Justice, I am above the law. 
That is a very eloquent principle.  
The alternative, more moderate control is that you can waltz around them. 
That is the way. 
The member for Elk Island would agree with me. 
He could exercise a skater's waltz around the obstruction.  
It had its dungeons and it cast the miscreants into the dungeons. 
There is a case to be made for cleaning the dungeons, cleaning the Augean Stables. 
Let us have access to those dungeons. 
We can learn from the past.  
Mr. Speaker, you and I watched the Academy Awards two nights ago. 
We saw the resurrection of Queen Elizabeth in two personalities. 
We saw the past as beautiful. 
The time is with us. 
The new millennium is arriving.  
What is the answer? 
People in these lost valleys have the virtues of yesterday. 
They have the old values. 
They have all the things that we depend on to build and maintain- 
Laurier said that the 20th century belongs to Canada. 
We will join him in preserving them. 
I take the opportunity to have a discussion on Senate reform. 
We respect our co-ordinate institution. 
We love the Senate and the senators. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The member for Vancouver Quadra has about 30 seconds left.  
One's understanding is there is an arrangement on both sides of the House. 
We have exercised it to the full. 
We are voting according to our conscience. 
We respect the opposition. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
Is there unanimous consent for the member to speak?  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
I think this agreement in principle is fair and generous. 
This agreement in principle does not guarantee that the strikes will end. 
Union members can ratify or reject this agreement. 
The rotating strikes have prevented many Canadians from having access to these services.  
In the port of Vancouver, dozens of ships are waiting to be loaded- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
If that is not the case, I would like the minister to- 
This is debate and the minister has the floor. 
I am afraid that is not a point of order.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Is this settlement agreed upon or is it not?  
That is not a point of order. 
The minister is making a speech on second reading of this bill. 
Ratification may take a number of weeks. 
It may be rejected by the workers. 
I am sure farmers in the west understand that situation.  
Increased tensions on the picket lines have resulted on occasion- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am afraid the hon. member is out of order. 
The minister is making a speech on a bill. 
The member is asking questions. 
He is not raising a point of order. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Canadians are kept in the dark along with the union negotiators.  
That was not totally clear to us in this House. 
We are left in the same situation of not knowing what is going on. 
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
This is a despicable move. 
Why is it done at this late hour?  
This puts an entirely different light on the situation. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
For our part we would be agreeable to that.  
I again ask the question. 
Mr. Speaker, I cannot believe this. 
This puts a totally different light on the situation. 
I cannot think of a more ridiculous situation to find ourselves in. 
God knows we did not put ourselves in this mess. 
It is a credibility problem.  
What do you know about credibility?  
You will learn something about credibility. 
Why are we here tonight?  
The hon. member for Wetaskiwin has the floor.  
Mr. Speaker, I do not mind a little help. 
I am getting tremendous encouragement from my colleagues and even some good words of advice.  
We are going to have to completely rethink our position on this. 
Things have completely changed from this morning when we started debating this. 
Things have changed completely.  
It does not deal with us in good faith.  
We will do that in a moment. 
There is a point of order from the hon. member for Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough.  
I ask that that be put to the House once again.  
The Chair is more than happy to keep putting this question to the House. 
I will put the question to the House again. 
Mr. Speaker, I cannot believe what I am hearing.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
Other members may say so. I will not.  
I heard a no and that was the end of it. 
I am very cognizant of the wishes of hon. members in this regard. 
We still have to have some sort of mechanism to deal with their contract. 
Therefore, we need to have final offer selection arbitration.  
Questions and comments to the minister.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
At what time did he know that?  
I would like to know why it was not. 
Mr. Speaker, I knew about the agreement taking place at about 10.10 tonight. 
This afternoon I heard about the various elements that were involved. 
I indicated that I was ready to agree to the various contents. 
I was told at 10.10 that they had initiated an agreement.  
Therefore, we still need to pass the law as it is. 
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, what is going on here tonight is very surprising. 
Now the minister is telling us that there is an agreement in principle. 
I find this totally unacceptable.  
The first are the blue collar workers. 
Continuing, there are two groups of workers. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question may seem quite similar. 
Mr. Speaker, the act is still necessary for the CX workers. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question for the minister is very simple. 
Everyone here wants to see farmers being able to ship their grain. 
The hon. member will address the Chair, please. 
The hon. member for South Shore will please address the Chair.  
He has not negotiated in good faith. 
The question is simple.  
We have been negotiating with the union. 
We have been at the same table. 
However, the agreement itself is an agreement in principle. 
If it is not ratified the strikes can continue over time. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I know that our negotiators have initialled that agreement. 
I do not know if it can be tabled tonight. 
We obviously have at least one copy that has been initialled. 
I am not sure it is available. 
If it is, we will produce it for the hon. member.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Speaker, I did not say that it could be produced. 
I indicated that I would check if it could be produced.  
I have my main negotiator here. 
I can probably get the answer in a few minutes. 
If it cannot be produced, it cannot be produced.  
That is not right and he knows it.  
Mr. Speaker, I can certainly understand the hon. member's frustration. 
A vote started at eleven o'clock. 
In fact what has been demonstrated is the exact opposite of what has been alleged.  
A point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
I am dealing with a question of privilege. 
That is not a question of privilege. 
I called for comments just on that.  
Mr. Speaker, I certainly believe that my privileges in the House have been affected.  
The government House leader knew of the agreement in principle. 
We on this side of the House did not. 
We only knew that the government had some announcement to make. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on the same point of privilege. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We could resolve this a lot quicker by extending it. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
There is a certain amount of confusion here. 
Therefore, the Chair is not in a position to do so. 
Then the minister said something about that. 
Would the minister like to add something.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of privilege. 
I am afraid that I have already ruled on that point of order. 
It was the same one raised by the whip of the official opposition. 
That is not a question of privilege.  
We would like to understand the meaning- 
Members will have to continue without the agreement. 
A deliberate omission is a form of contempt. 
The government deliberately misled the opposition.  
The fact is that there was an agreement reached- 
The Chair is running out of patience on points of order. 
I will hear a few more and then there will be no more. 
They are getting very repetitious and I cannot continue all night.  
The motion on which the vote took place was on a motion for closure. 
It had nothing to do with the act itself. 
The prisoner guards can also still strike. 
Therefore, the substance of the act does not change.  
The whip of the official opposition is absolutely correct. 
If that is the case, the minister is in contempt.  
Mr. Speaker, our point is still valid. 
The minister is incorrect in his assertion. 
The minister is incorrect. 
This government or this minister is in contempt. 
We were told by the minister after we voted that there was a tentative agreement. 
That is very germane to the issue at hand. 
I agree that it was deliberately withheld. 
That has just been brought to my attention.  
I use Beauchesne's to back up that argument.  
I ask the Speaker to rule on the issue. 
The minister knew before we voted. 
I was not allowed to vote with the full knowledge of what the minister knew. 
That is a breach of my privileges.  
Mr. Speaker, this is factually incorrect. 
It is because he is a credible member that he should not say these things.  
So are a number of other allegations that have been made.  
Everyone here has acted in good faith. 
Everyone is trying to do what is best for the people of Canada. 
That is still our determination. 
That is still what we want to do. 
Everyone in this House knows it. 
This is information that was purposely withheld. 
It is a prima facie case.  
I go by section 92: 
That is what Motion No. 21 does. 
It has nothing to do with it. 
No privilege was breached. 
There was no information that was relevant for the vote on Motion No. 21. 
Mr. Speaker, I will show the minister how much we are joking. 
The Chair is ready to deal with the question of privilege that has been raised. 
I want to stress the quality of this motion to the House. 
I believe it would be out of order.  
Such a request will require the unanimous consent of the House. 
If I had known what information the minister had I would have reversed it. 
I feel very strongly that the information was- 
I ask for the unanimous consent of the House to change my vote.  
Resuming debate with the member for Winnipeg Centre.  
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate being recognized. 
I am looking forward to entering into- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Just so I am clear on this, you have resumed debate. 
The minister was number one. 
This is slot number three. 
There will be no questions or comments. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Perhaps I can clarify this. 
We expect you to honour- 
I asked him if he was finished his remarks and he told me he was. 
We will get the blues, but it was very clear. 
I was quite emphatic with the hon. member for Wetaskiwin. 
He told me he had. 
The hon. member says I am wrong. 
I have no objection. 
If the hon. member wishes to continue I am prepared to go back. 
I assume the House will agree to that. 
I am not trying to cheat him out of his time.  
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that. 
I am sorry for the misunderstanding.  
It was the understanding of this House that we were dealing with- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Chair did not hear the word. 
If hon. members used the word I am sure they would want to withdraw. 
The hon. member for Wetaskiwin has the floor.  
We approached this issue on the basis that this was an emergency. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
This question has been asked several times. 
I do not believe it is a point of order. 
There was a grain stoppage at the port of Vancouver. 
Lo and behold exactly what we had predicted came true. 
One of the unions at the port went on strike. 
Now we find we have a completely different set of circumstances. 
What kind of position does this put the PSAC workers in?  
This is no way to cement labour relations. 
It is a very disrespectful way.  
It is absolutely insane to be doing this in this fashion.  
I am sure everybody arrived at it this way.  
What is the emergency now? 
I am sure a few government members will stand up on debate. 
I would like to have them explain to me where the emergency is. 
This is about the shabbiest handling of a bill. 
This is a sham and a ridiculous use of this institution.  
I thought hurrah, perhaps we are going to make some headway here.  
This is absolute silliness. 
We are going to be extremely suspicious of its motives.  
While we are talking about shifty operations, let us talk about last Friday. 
First that and now this.  
I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
I am trying to follow this debate here. 
It seems to me as though you have lost control of the House. 
That is my privilege and I would like it protected.  
The hon. member for Wetaskiwin.  
We always seem to be slipping back.  
We all would like to see these labour disruptions absolutely minimized. 
There are absolutely no winners in this situation. 
That is not the way it is decided. 
It is a very big decision for them.  
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
I have not made any comments in regard to what has been going on tonight. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
We have talked about this tentative agreement. 
Mr. Speaker, as I was saying- 
For the third time.  
Today is a very sad day too. 
We have a perfect and glaring illustration of that this evening.  
We will get back to the basic issue. 
Incidentally, workers in the general labour group earn an average of $31,000 per year. 
A salary increase is, therefore, definitely in order. 
There is nothing outrageous about such a measure, on the contrary. 
I think this is already expecting too much. 
We want the government to negotiate. 
Let me give a list.  
I did not pick year 1982 out of the blue. 
We should remember the context. 
That was in 1982.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot makes a good point. 
It is getting late. 
We could give each other the dignity of paying attention to each other. 
If we do not want to do so, there are the lobbies for social events.  
That was in 1989.  
The same thing happened in 1995. 
As members can see, almost every year, some special legislation was passed. 
There is one point to be made on this issue. 
It is a little easy in the government's situation. 
We have seen it here in Ottawa. 
Some people have been bitten. 
The International Labour Organization also blamed the Canadian federal government four times. 
-the principles concerning the fundamental rights which are the subject of those Conventions.  
Unless it can be proven otherwise, Canada is still a member of the ILO. 
This is totally unacceptable. 
He is not here.  
No. He is one of those who do not listen.  
He distinguished himself as a member of the so-called rat pack. 
This is typical of this government: a bunch of hypocrites.  
What about the managers' attitude? 
What kind of attitude can we expect from these people? 
Underneath all this lies a real human resources management issue. 
We do not have that. 
Let us hope that there will be a huge political price to pay. 
They will have to pay a huge political price for their lack of credibility.  
What we are dealing with here is a dictatorship in the making. 
No need to mince words. 
As for Quebeckers, we know how to leave all this behind in short order.  
We should all be feeling a great sadness. 
The government House leader was right in his opening remarks. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
I have mixed feelings about being able to speak now. 
Everybody seems to want to know what was in the tentative agreement. 
I know exactly what was in it. 
It went from 30 months to 24 months. 
I cannot understand it. 
Personally it is very frustrating. 
That is table two, the 14,500-odd trades people. 
The government found satisfaction there. 
Now it will merge the Atlantic provinces with Quebec into one zone. 
That is what the union was calling for all along. 
Now the government seems willing to let the union do that.  
That is why I say it is absolute nonsense.  
It leads me to believe that it was ideologically driven. 
The government had it within its ability to settle in that regard as well. 
Why is the government not honest about what it really wants to do? 
Then we could deal with it. 
We could have an honest debate about it. 
We have been hearing a lot of passionate speeches from very odd sources. 
I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member is quite correct. 
Mr. Speaker, it is interesting. 
It is a very detailed, complex book.  
The great champions of the working class. 
It is actually quite galling. 
It is valuable to spend some time and talk about that basic democratic right. 
The right for workers to withhold their services is basic and fundamental. 
It is recognized in our charter of rights and freedoms. 
What we have in labour relations is a way to try to solve that. 
It is through free collective bargaining- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am really sorry to interrupt the hon. member for Winnipeg Centre. 
I will be using the full 20 minutes.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member has 12 minutes left.  
It is getting to be more and more common. 
It is a slippery slope in this House. 
We come from a caucus that believes all labour has dignity. 
We believe that fair wages benefit the whole community. 
Their settlements have been imposed for that whole period of time.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The workers were stealing the gizzards and the wingtips to take home and make soup. 
That happened in 1991.  
It used to be that it was almost comparable. 
Workers have fallen way behind.  
Over the last couple of years there is no more job security. 
That is workers' money. 
It is deferred wages. 
It is paid to workers for their purposes. 
Everybody knows that Tory times are tough times. 
What do they get for it? 
I think they are fed up. 
It hurts all of us to be here, I suppose. 
It is such an unnecessary thing. 
We cost out what the spread is. 
It is does not add up from a cost point of view.  
That is just one example we found without digging too hard. 
We found that in the first five minutes. 
They have not lost a day's time. 
They are not on strike. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Without the labour movement the free market cannot operate effectively.  
It waits until the crisis develops. 
It is 911 government and it is unacceptable.  
It spent $500 million to cancel a helicopter contract.  
It is appalling for a government of Canada to behave in this manner.  
The government, in its approach to labour management, is doing the exact opposite. 
It is bludgeoning the unions whenever it has the opportunity to do so. 
It is absolutely shameful what the government has done tonight. 
First the government let this crisis develop without taking any responsibility. 
It is not surprising that the government is acting in this way. 
All members of this House receive the same level of pay. 
It creates a ghettoization of the public service. 
That is typical of this government. 
It is not consistent with good faith negotiations. 
The government has hit an all-time low in labour relations. 
It is absolutely inappropriate.  
The government has refused to table the tentative agreement. 
This government is not interested in consistency in policy. 
All it is interested in is power at all costs.  
We do not buy that over here. 
The government is negotiating in bad faith.  
There are members here who would have voted differently had they had the information.  
I am pleased that our party did not support the closure motion.  
What about the farmers?  
I hear a Liberal member opposite ask ``What about the farmers?'' 
Again the government is choosing to pit farmers against blue collar workers. 
It is absolutely unconscionable and unacceptable for parliamentarians to stand by and let this happen.  
I am shocked tonight at how the government is treating blue collar workers. 
It demeans parliament and it demeans the rights of workers in Canada.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
Shall clause 2 carry?  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Chairman, I would like to start the debate with some questions. 
It is only right that we get answers to those questions.  
Perhaps he could give some clarification to the Canadian people.  
He mentioned in the House that he has an agreement in principle. 
Mr. Chairman, just a follow-up question to that. 
Basically what we are doing is sticking a sharp stick in the union's eye.  
We have to protect Canadian people during that period of time. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
In French, the definition of common law spouse reads as follows: 
The English definition is the right one. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson:
Mr. Chairman, yes it is.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
The agreement covers only these two groups.  
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
Is there something in the process that is wrong or flawed? 
Is the problem the competence of the public servants? 
Is the problem the orders that are given by the government?  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Mr. Chairman, I have three brief questions for the minister responsible.  
What is their background in negotiation?  
Our instructions were the same.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
During that period there is no guarantee that there will be ratification. 
There is no guarantee by the employees that they will not have strikes.  
Those are conditions of the present contract.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
They have all been declared essential. 
A strike did not take place, this time. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Now there is a tentative agreement which substantially changes the whole nature of the discussion.  
I want to ask the President of the Treasury Board a simple question. 
No, Mr. Chairman, and I have given an answer in this regard. 
Another advantage has been given to them. 
There are five steps in each classification. 
One step has been added or reduced. 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Mr. Chairman, I have a couple of questions. 
Are the corrections people included in this tentative agreement? 
Obviously they have to know what they are voting on.  
Mr. Chairman, in the agreement only the blue collar workers are covered. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson:
Mr. Chairman, I have a couple of questions. 
Therefore the difference is about 1%, perhaps 0.9%.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson:
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Mr. Chairman, the figures have varied from day to day. 
A $9 million contract has been lost, according to the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool.  
In any event, the farmers themselves have seen their wheat exports drop significantly. 
Can he give us figures? 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
The example of the RCMP was used.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Chairman, the member is right to say that this is indeed the difficulty. 
We are correcting that quirk. 
We have already indicated to the union that we are ready to accept them.  
I would like the minister to confirm something for me. 
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
Mr. Chairman, I have two brief questions for the minister.  
Mr. Chairman, the normal period for the ratification process is four to six weeks. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Mr. Chairman, there is nothing in the agreement on that subject.  
Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay-Boundary-Okanagan, Ref.):
They are prepared to accept that. 
It was only through a slip-up on the part of the government. 
That is why it has the problem.  
The position now is that the only thing left for these people is conciliation. 
They went that route and accepted it. 
It has taken away strike and it is going to designate them. 
We used exactly the same right in this case. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson:
Mr. Svend J. Robinson:
Mr. Chairman, I rise on a point of order. 
I did not see the hon. member rise, unfortunately. 
The hon. member need not worry. 
I will come back to him in due course.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Will this permanently refuse their ability to strike?  
That is done through other means. 
It is the designation as workers in essential services.  
In the present case we have a specific problem. 
The second part of the bill deals with schedule 2. 
Is that not what it is saying? 
If the hon. member wants it.  
Now we have a situation where they are designated. 
We have an incredible imbalance.  
I am a member of the subcommittee studying the CCRA. 
I have been in the Pacific region and I have been in Atlantic Canada. 
Training is non-existent. 
That was one of the two items.  
We were very close to having an agreement with the correctional officers before. 
Clearly, over the past years we have been able to come to agreements with them.  
Out of the four elements we have agreed to three. 
We have no problem recruiting prison guards.  
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Mr. Chairman, we now have a tentative agreement. 
We have an imposed settlement, this 500-page plus document. 
Because, in fact, Mr. Chairman, the agreement may not be ratified. 
Mr. Chairman, my question really has not been addressed. 
The reason it has not is because I used the words ``eventual ratification''. 
That is a given.  
It does not have to all hinge on ratification of this agreement. 
We can talk about eventual ratification. 
Can the minister please tell me why that is not an option?  
They will be in a position to strike on Friday of this week. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Surely this is disturbing.  
If it is government policy, would he care to defend such a policy? 
It is this parliament that passes the law. 
We do our utmost to fit this test. 
Mr. Chairman, in a way, what can I say? 
That is why we want to introduce back to work legislation.  
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
Mr. Chairman, my negotiator does not have that.  
Mr. Chairman, I realize that we are not just asking questions here. 
Then again, maybe I will not.  
I have a couple of questions for the President of the Treasury Board. 
In other words, he is telling us to trust him. 
It is one of those things that one has an awful lot of difficulty believing.  
Why should we do that?  
I have mentioned some of the advantages, such as holidays, parental holidays and so on. 
The existing agreement is available for everybody to see. 
On that basis one can see what the general parameters are.  
Obviously the union would not go for that. 
Yet here in parliament, parliamentarians are being asked to just trust this government. 
This idea of an emergency gripping the nation is a little hard to believe. 
The grain is moving. 
That is not the emergency. 
There is nobody picketing in any major sustained way. 
I do not see an emergency there. 
I do approve of what is going on here tonight. 
I think it is great.  
He says they are ahead of last year's schedule at this same time. 
Mr. Chairman, I believe it is an emergency and it is important. 
I always speak kindly of him. 
Perhaps we are both wrong in our assessment of each other.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
Mr. Chairman, I see the hon. member's position.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Mr. Chairman, I am sorry, but that is not good enough. 
That is a huge inequity. 
This is the system we use.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
First, how are those local living conditions assessed, on what basis are they assessed? 
They would have to be changed by mutual agreement. 
That is the process we have.  
We have adaptations every time we renegotiate these rates. 
Mr. Chairman, I have a supplementary for the president. 
What are the living conditions based on? 
How are they measured? 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
This agreement does not have force of law. 
It is not a collective agreement and it cannot be applied. 
It is just a piece of paper.  
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
My understanding was an administrative error by this department. 
They are designated as essential and there was that possibility of a strike.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Chairman, it is impossible to have a legislative collective agreement. 
In this case, because there was no agreement, we have to legislate.  
The question is quite simple. 
That unfortunately was not done. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
My question for the minister is very simple. 
During that first statement, as the member may recall, I indicated what had happened. 
I have a second question for the minister. 
That is half the legislation.  
The other part of the legislation deals with table two blue collar workers. 
Negotiations take place all the time more or less seriously. 
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
Mr. Chairman, these are options that could be considered. 
Could he comment on that for me, please?  
That will cost farmers into the future.  
Mr. Chairman, we will look at these possibilities.  
This is the fourth time we are attempting to do it.  
However I will consider the possibilities my hon. colleague mentioned.  
It covered pay and it covered training. 
Yet they were prepared to accept it.  
Prisoners work for $5.65 a day. 
How will they negotiate in the future?  
I guess I am asking for some explanation.  
Mr. Chairman, the answer is easy. 
Before that agreement was made, there were 900 people in that situation. 
For these 500 and 600 we still have the need for back to work legislation.  
The fact is that the language in here is fairly clear:
Clearly something needs more explanation.  
That emergency was solved for these two situations. 
However, the rest of the problem remained. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Mr. Chairman, I would like the President of the Treasury Board to clarify one thing.  
The case of members of Parliament was used as an example. 
I know all MPs receive the same salary. 
What was said in the House is not correct. 
This can be proved. 
That is what I said.  
That is what we are doing.  
I just want it to be clear. 
We are not at the provincial level. 
We are at the federal level.  
I am talking about salary here, not expenses.  
I have understood what the member has said.

It therefore is not a very radical recommendation. 
We all want to go to bed. 
We could stop short of this heavy-handed intervention of back to work legislation. 
I would ask for the support of the House for the motion.  
Is it the pleasure of the committee to adopt the amendment?  
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.

In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
When shall the bill be read the third time? 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
I have just arrived and I too would have voted with my party.  
Mr. Speaker, I will not make a speech. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, tonight I believe we are about to- 
The hon. member for Selkirk-Interlake has the floor. 
I am sure all members want to hear his speech.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
Mr. Speaker, I no longer ask for that consent. 
I would like to speak my full time.  
The short title is cited as being the government services act, 1999. 
They knew at that time that the wage freeze would end. 
I believe the Prime Minister has something like a 34 year record. 
What did we see? 
We should hold him to that. 
Who will pay for the losses of these farmers? 
The agriculture minister bears full responsibility for that plan which went out to farmers. 
Mr. Speaker, I fail to see a quorum in the House. 
I wonder if you would take a count.  
And the count having been taken: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We have a quorum.  
It is only fair. 
It is only right. 
Why should farmers suffer due to the actions of other people?  
We will see the same old routine of the last 26 years. 
We will see how that works out in the future.  
We have covered the costs and the idea of final offer selection arbitration. 
It would seem to me they are a monopoly service. 
This closure that we are speaking on today is the 50th. 
If that is democracy, it is democracy being abused.  
We went through hours of amendments, some of which were very good. 
My friends in the Bloc, in fact, brought up the final offer selection arbitration. 
I thought that maybe that amendment would be one that would really improve this bill. 
What did we get? 
We saw the government members yell that great amendment down. 
I speak particularly of Ontario, because I am a little more familiar with it. 
The seaway is going to be opening up. 
Why could that not also have happened for the western farmers? 
These allegations border on a conflict of interest problem.  
Once again we see government interference. 
It is a strange method. 
I do not know why they have to be forced back to work. 
When they put up a picket line the other unions would not cross it.  
Now we see that the government understands that this is a problem. 
It was vital to get the grain moving. 
I have pointed out clearly where this government has fallen down. 
One last attempt to put in final offer selection arbitration will be made.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
They happen over and over again.  
It is certainly not the members of this House. 
There are no winners.  
My colleague from Selkirk talked about agriculture. 
This is about more than the farmers. 
The economy of Canada is quite dependent upon agriculture. 
Agriculture is still one of the largest employers in the Canadian economy. 
The spin-off effect from agriculture is huge.  
The government is certainly aware of that as well. 
It knows that we cannot hold up the grain shipments. 
I think we all agree with that.  
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The debate is on the amendment.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their understanding.  
But nothing has been done.  
Therefore, we have to go back to 1982.  
As for giving up responsibilities, I will give an example.  
There were complaints about erosion. 
Now there is are very serious problems. 
But now, the coast guard does not care. 
Apparently, there was devolution of this responsibility to municipalities. 
It all happens without discussion, vision or transparency. 
We have had it.  
It is just beginning. 
This is the only real concern of the government.  
Today, it prefers to legislate rather than negotiate. 
That is typical of this government. 
The farmers know it and the International Labour Organization knows it too. 
As a good manager, he should be worried. 
We mentioned him in our first speech. 
The member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell is a good example. 
Historically, he has always been very aggressive.  
What has become of his motivation today? 
What has become of his convictions? 
It will be nasty.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Madam Speaker, you seem to be full of energy this morning, just like me. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I will submit a copy to the clerk.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am referring of course to correctional officers, who work in prisons. 
Their right to a negotiated collective agreement was denied, rejected and trampled on. 
There will be a price to pay for this.  
This government has a rather ambiguous attitude. 
We will remember that. 
I cannot understand why the President of the Treasury Board acted the way he did.  
It will be, and it will have deserved what it gets.  
What is really at stake here? 
They do so under trying conditions. 
Contempt will be short lived.  
They cannot because they have not done it.  
Despite all the pressure, they have not moved on the issue; we will remember this. 
The obscure screams of the famous backbenchers will not change a thing. 
And the screams of the obscure backbenchers will not change a thing.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
On the issue of pay equity, this government's record is not good. 
All the members of the rat pack were mobilized on this issue.  
Can somebody tell us where we are today on this issue? 
Let us look at this government's record.  
And the President of the Treasury Board was the killer of those jobs.  
Was that done democratically? 
Was that done through negotiations? 
Was that done with respect for the workers? 
I also want to address another stigma. 
The Silence of the Lambs. 
Had it not been for the Bloc Quebecois, this would have gone unnoticed. 
That is the reality.  
I cannot say it strongly enough, it is a sad day. 
It is a very sad day, indeed. 
You have before you a concerned and sorrowful man. 
I know that certain government members went to law school. 
Let us talk about poverty. 
Who has solutions to propose for the fight against poverty? 
Certainly not members on the government side. 
I do not even want to look at them. 
Who has solutions to offer? 
The Bloc Quebecois has. 
My colleague from Shefford had also interesting things to say on this issue.  
In a few hours, I will be tabling an anti-poverty bill. 
What is in an anti-poverty bill? 
We will not tolerate that. 
We have a whole lot of solutions to propose on the subject of poverty. 
All we ask is a little attention. 
We do not think this is too much.  
We will continue to be this voice in Parliament.  
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP):
They remember the strikes of the twenties, thirties and forties. 
Not that that fight was not an important or necessary one. 
We are used to seeing the graveyards send ringing endorsements of Liberal candidates. 
Of course they are.  
What is so bad about that? 
It is a case of one rule for one and another for the other. 
While lower ranked staff are paid differential rates, their managers are not.  
Here is a challenge for the Liberal members. 
Equal pay, equal standards. 
What is so hard to deal with in those four words?  
Equality has gone out of favour in this country. 
No, this is not a surprise. 
We expect nothing different from this government. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member for St. John's West on debate.  
Give it to them, Charlie.  
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
One is its fundamental failure in how it runs this House. 
That is why we have been here for the last 24 hours.  
It is absolutely unfair and unacceptable. 
The government did not give the opposition the facts. 
It did not give us the truth as to what was really happening. 
What kind of logic is that?  
It was all done very wrongly. 
The whole collective bargaining process is now wrong for all public servants of Canada. 
That is a no-brainer. 
Who will go on strike? 
Who can go on strike? 
I will repeat today what I said yesterday. 
Certainly from our point of view not only salary issues are involved. 
I do not care about the business of disrupting labour markets. 
There are no jobs. 
In the last three years we have lost 30,000 Newfoundlanders. 
Is that labour market disruption? 
Those are the kinds of things that have to be negotiated through collective agreements.  
It is intimidation by the majority. 
It is a totally wrong process. 
It is a disgusting process.  
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
In my view, it was certainly unique. 
But the government went even further.  
One basic issue remains. 
What about the consequences? 
These 400 people are mechanics. 
These are people who make the lowest salaries in the federal public service.  
These people felt let down. 
I think this will certainly have an impact on their productivity.  
Did my employer show me any respect?'' 
These are all questions that people are asking.  
I think the aftermath is always difficult, in such cases. 
I think that is what happened. 
I raised several examples the other day. 
A few examples come to my mind. 
What kind of example is the government setting for employers today? 
Is it a positive one? 
This is a rather sad day for me. 
Has this government served voters well today? 
We get $5 and $10 bills from unions and individuals. 
These are nothing but pretexts. 
The government would have grabbed onto any pretext for accomplishing its ends. 
The Bloc Quebecois cannot, of course, subscribe to such a farce. 
Tonight we have been the spectators and performers in another performance, a dramatic comedy. 
The government turned up with offers at the last minute. 
We will continue with the legislation and we will take it to the very end''. 
I repeat, this was just adding insult to injury.  
People will go back to work. 
I find it unconscionable as I said yesterday. 
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
Somewhere along the line somebody is missing the boat. 
Somebody does not understand how the transportation system works. 
That is the key issue in my view. 
I think the government has completely ignored this issue.  
The matter of the grain handlers is only one small issue. 
This action taken by the government was unnecessary. 
The money was obviously there to satisfy those people.  
The work they do is dangerous. 
The support they have had from the government is almost non-existent. 
It is sad that it has come to that.  
If these people are essential workers, then treat them as essential workers. 
I urge the government to wake up. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Why is there a bargaining system in place? 
It begs the question.  
The government has completely turned its back on that system. 
It is a travesty of justice without question. 
The grain handlers are just an excuse for the government. 
There is something seriously wrong.  
The Liberals can blame it on the grain handlers or blame it on PSAC. 
It is very unfortunate.  
Madam Speaker, I agree with the concerns my friend has raised.  
The rail lines were not operating properly. 
The money was not there although taxes were high. 
We need action from the government on this very critical issue.  
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
This is what is happening. 
We are living in a democratic country. 
The prison guards are not on strike. 
I guess it got a pretty good deal, if we look at it that way.  
Madam Speaker, I think it is an outrage. 
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
Dan Sawatzky beat the case. 
Is that human rights abuse or what is it? 
I would like the member's impression on that.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
I want to address that issue further.  
After they had developed a market the government interfered. 
The government appealed that. 
Has the government dealt in good faith with anybody? 
People are being mistreated. 
People are in jail. 
What can we do? 
Why did people send us here? 
Why are we sitting back and allowing it to happen?  
There is a trial in Brandon, Manitoba, on the same issue. 
We have a prime example of what has happened over on that side. 
Why should people support it? 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members have risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
(The House divided on the amendment, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the amendment lost.  
Is the House ready for the question on the main motion?  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
Is it agreed the members are in?  
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
(Bill read the third time and passed) 
I express my thanks to all hon. members for their patience and their co-operation.  
(The House adjourned at 8.32 a.m.)
