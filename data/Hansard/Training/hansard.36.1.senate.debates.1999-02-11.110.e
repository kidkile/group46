Thursday, February 11, 1999 
The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Hon. Catherine S. Callbeck :
This fine institution has grown and prospered along with its world-class reputation. 
I would suggest that this institution is very worthy of government assistance.  
Culture, in all its forms, is very important. 
It is deserving of support. 
1999 Canada Winter Games 
The Canada Winter Games is the largest multi-sport event in the nation. 
From February 20 to March 6 there will be competition in 21 sports. 
The host region will stage a total of 135 competitive events.  
There will be entertainment and social activities to go with the excellent athletic competition. 
Citizenship and Heritage Week 
Canada is truly a wonderful country in which to live. 
Canada has an exceptionally rich and diverse heritage. 
Marie de la Tour, Marguerite Bourgeoys, Molly Brant:
These were brave and adventurous women, as were women like Susanna Moodie, Catherine Parr Traill.  
Those dreams are what have fashioned us as a nation. 
What are our responsibilities as Canadian citizens? 
What kind of society do we want to be at the dawn of the millennium?  
In short, they are the foundations for a bright and sustainable future.  
Let us celebrate the past and shape our future together and talk about it.  
Creation of New Fishing Zone for Snow Crab 
This is a win-win situation.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Accommodation of Senators in Commons Gallery 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I would presume it would be the Director of Operations.  
I will make inquiries and bring forward the proper information.  
Yes, I would presume that someone must give them notice.  
He stands on his own merits. 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I am not aware of any "sanitized version" of the report that was released. 
I am sure it is a very timely and interesting report.  
Honourable senators, I thank the minister for the praise.  
He did not want to be a party to that.  
The loss of 15,500 more jobs would be significant. 
Is this number accurate? 
I would have to make inquiries to determine whether it is.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Could the minister determine whether that is the case? 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
As I have said, we have already ordered the replacements for the Labradors. 
Now we know the truth. 
Where did the $1.2 billion come from?  
It came from the resources of the Department of National Defence.  
Why, then, was it not used properly?  
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
Honourable senators, my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
Very sad information was brought to the Parliament of Canada. 
We were told of famine and hunger in that country.  
For many years, the Russians bought large amounts of grain from Canada. 
Canada currently has a glut of wheat. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
The views expressed by Senator Gustafson were shared by many of the members. 
I will bring the matter to the attention of those I mentioned earlier. 
Senator Whelan was the then minister of agriculture. 
I attended a joint meeting of both Houses. 
Our friends in what is now Russia are having a difficult time. 
Answer to Order Paper Question Tabled 
Bill to Amend-Second Reading 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
We hope to have our report before the chamber before the summer recess. 
This commercial is directed particularly at my colleagues opposite. 
Two recent reports from the Transportation Safety Board are highlighted. 
These objectives do not specifically mention the unions involved in the rail industry. 
There is a period set out in the bill for consultation. 
For insomniacs, I suppose the sound of the whistle would be no problem. 
I hope that is the direction in which we are moving here in Canada.  
This bill generally is a positive step forward. 
It is the result of an overlook of the system required by statute.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
When shall this bill be read the third time?  
Third Report of Committee Tabled 
Hon. Celine Hervieux-Payette :
Fourth Report of Committee Tabled 
Hon. Celine Hervieux-Payette :
Honourable senators, I rise to support Bill S-22. 
This legislation is necessary because Canadian law has changed since 1974. 
Canadian law underlies the entire regime. 
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
That a Message be sent to the House of Commons to acquaint that House accordingly.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
The dictionary defines "scuttling" as "scrapping or abandoning." 
This is absolutely false. 
The minister then asked, and I quote, "Whose public interest are the Tory senators serving?" 
I ended the letter as follows: 
Whose public interest are the Tory senators serving?  
It is the same as his. 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is it your pleasure to adopt the motion?  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
That press release from the minister speaks to all of us. 
I would ask that it be tabled.  
I did send copies to all honourable senators. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it the wish of honourable senators that it be tabled?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
A Bill to Change the Name of the Electoral District of Stormont-Dundas 
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.  
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.  
Access to Information Act 
Bill to Amend-Second Reading 
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
The act helps Canadians participate more effectively in their governments. 
It also enables them to better hold their elected representatives to account. 
The bill before us is certainly loyal to this purpose. 
This amendment also faithfully reflects the recommendations made by the Information Commissioner. 
That concern does not relate to the bill. 
Therefore, I believe that this amendment speaks to the concept of ministerial responsibility.  
I commend the bill's sponsor for introducing such necessary legislation. 
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
When shall this bill be read a third time?  
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
Canada signed it in August of that year.  
It was not being monitored effectively. 
On December 4, the committee adopted its concluding observations on Canada's third report. 
It is these that I should like to talk about today.  
However, that rating does not tell the whole story. 
Simply put, honourable senators, we are not fooling anybody, least of all the United Nations. 
This is particularly apparent in the Atlantic region, where I come from.  
One reason for this is the new rules for part-time workers. 
Yet, benefits are now exhausted much earlier. 
On motion of Senator LeBreton, debate adjourned.  
Last year was no exception.  
Of the 11 million dead, one quarter were children.  
The reproductive tract is particularly fragile in young girls. 
These additional responsibilities do not leave enough time for farm work or gainful employment. 
Their income goes down and their diet suffers.  
We cannot, through our failure to act, take away their chance for a future.  
The rights to be recognized and protected urgently include: 
the right, for children and youth, to grow up in a supportive environment; 
the right to take advantage of scientific advances.  
On motion of Senator Wilson, debate adjourned.  
Child poverty in canada 
Hon. Therese Lavoie-Roux rose pursuant to notice of Tuesday, February 9, 1999: 
Poverty can take many forms. 
Just what is poverty? 
How do we measure it? 
Low-income families are the worst off in Canada. 
In Canada, poverty is widespread. 
Some 17.9 per cent of Canadians are poor. 
One in every five children lives in poverty in our country.  
I ask, honourable senators, how can we tolerate such a phenomenon? 
It is not acceptable.  
These figures show that some children are at a great disadvantage compared to others.  
We are losing ground, not gaining it. 
I have spoken about child poverty and low-income families. 
We also know that women are more at risk of being poor. 
Seniors are also at risk. 
We read about this during the Christmas holidays. 
It was alarming to read those statistics. 
People with disabilities also have incomes lower than those of the general population. 
Most Canadians who are disabled are also poor. 
How much do we want to help people living in poor conditions?  
Everywhere in the world Canada is considered a safe and prosperous country. 
The employment insurance fund has a surplus of $20 million. 
Would it not make sense to help those with the greatest needs?  
In closing, I suggest that the Senate strike a committee on a non-partisan basis. 
You are leaving us men out of this!  
And Senator Taylor and Senator Mahovlich. 
I am sure they share the same concerns. 
We could strike such a committee on a non-partisan basis.  
Hon. Norman K. Atkins :
I fully support her suggestion of forming a joint Senate committee on poverty. 
How could we advise public policy approaches to this subject? 
Frankly, I think we are well qualified to debate these issues. 
Unfortunately, child poverty rates have risen to record highs in the intervening years. 
Who are the poor in Canada? 
According to Statistics Canada, one person in six, lives in poverty. 
This is a growing segment of our population. 
One in five Canadian children now lives in poverty. 
Honourable senators, the issue is complex. 
Obviously children are poor because their parents are poor. 
We must revisit the way our social programs are both structured and administered. 
The poor in our society are not evil. 
They are not to be punished through the continuous reduction in benefits. 
For the large majority, it is not their fault they are poor. 
In fact, they would welcome the opportunity to have a meaningful job. 
Basic needs must be met first. 
We are now entering an era of budgetary surplus. 
Hon. John B. Stewart :
Honourable senators, would Senator Atkins deal with two questions?  
I will ask them together because I know his memory is good.  
That real, practical problem exists. 
Can Senator Atkins proposed a solution?  
The second question refers to the problem of taxation, to which Senator Atkins referred. 
Surely that is not desirable.  
I still think that an income of $8,000 is just too low.  
However, this is now a broader issue. 
Poverty must be one of the major issues on the agenda.  
I thank Senator Atkins for that answer. 
Where will it come from?  
It may be a question of resetting our spending priorities.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, poverty is a scourge upon the nation. 
Poverty is a scourge upon any society. 
Their solution is to lower the unemployment rate.  
Take our friends to the south. 
Have we not seen homelessness, the street people and so on?  
Honourable senators, we have zero tolerance for many things. 
Why do we not have zero tolerance for poverty? 
That is the objective; that is the goal. 
How do we measure the progress that we are making towards achieving zero tolerance?  
Prime Minister Mulroney chaired the World Conference on Children. 
The statistics show we have gone in the other direction.  
I do not know of any mechanism of the state that does this. 
However, we do not have a social audit mechanism. 
The obligation in the covenant applies to the provincial, territorial and federal governments. 
Canada ratified the international covenant in 1976. 
The social audit mechanism was agreed to by all the jurisdictions. 
That is our challenge.  
That was normative and helpful. 
The international treaty that I referred to is normative, as well. 
From an operational standpoint, we have this particular mechanism.  
Would Senator Kinsella take one question?  
However, I would leave it to the efforts of Revenue Canada to ascertain that.  
I need not describe those models for honourable senators. 
There was argument back and forth. 
Senator Grafstein stuck to his guns. 
I am speaking now about people who have jobs. 
This was built on something that we started to do in a previous government. 
A couple of years ago, the present government refined this and enriched it. 
Their welfare income remains the same. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II 
Congratulations on Forty-Seventh Anniversary of Accession to Throne 
Hon. Anne C. Cools rose pursuant to notice of Tuesday, February 9, 1999: 
He shall have dominion also from sea to sea.  
But first some history. 
He added as a postscript: 
This is not so. 
My son, when you come to serve the Lord, prepare yourself for trials. 
Be sincere of heart and steadfast, undisturbed in time of adversity. 
Cling to him, forsake him not; thus will your future be great. 
I took that oath most seriously. 
I recall most vividly her Coronation in 1953. 
They fought and died to defend their God, their King and their country. 
We owe much to them.  
Both were devout Christians, actually Anglican Evangelicals. 
The human psyche and human nature are artful dodgers. 
Honourable senators, I move now to the political condition of Canada. 
Often, I hear calls for the abolition of the Senate. 
Canada has one Parliament. 
The one Parliament for Canada is indivisible. 
I do not support either of these two propositions.  
I assert that there can be no Parliament without a monarch, or without a Senate. 
I assert that the Parliament of Canada is indivisible, as is Canada indivisible. 
The deconstruction of Parliament is synonymous with the deconstruction of Canada.  
The Queen is the chief parent of all the children of the land. 
We parliamentarians are their stewards. 
Psalm 127, verse 3, The Good News Bible, tells us: 
Human nature is imperfect. 
Consequently, the leaders of society are imperfect. 
We must understand the dark and the light sides of human beings. 
That is why, in the exercise of power and leadership, Lord Acton wrote: 
Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.  
It is an ill-fated leader or politician who ignores those words. 
For us, these have been Christian principles as born of Judaic, Christian, and Islamic tradition. 
For me, these principles are non-negotiable.  
She is a great woman, a great Queen and a great servant. 
God Bless the Queen!  
Romans, Chapter 12, verse 5, King James version tells us: 
Honourable senators, we are all connected.  
I would like to thank honourable senators. 
I attended that service last Sunday. 
I gave the homily.  
The choir was outstanding. 
Hon. Shirley Maheu (The Hon. The Acting Speaker) :
Cape Breton Development Corporation 
Motion for Production of Documents Relevant to Proposed Privatization-Debate Adjourned 
Hon. Lowell Murray , pursuant to notice of February 3, 1998, moved: 
( d ) minutes of departmental, inter-departmental and other meetings; and 
On motion of Senator Carstairs, for Senator Graham, debate adjourned.  
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, February 16, 1999, at 2 p.m.
