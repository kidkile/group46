Debates of the Senate (Hansard) 
Thursday, October 2, 1997 
The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
We welcome you to the Senate of Canada.  
Black Community of Nova Scotia 
Twentieth Anniversary Celebrations Address by Governor General 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Here are some examples of what he said: 
Every human searches for freedom and dignity. 
They hoped and they strived to build a better life in North America.  
Those slaves struggled to escape, to be free. 
Children sometimes found the school doors closed. 
Grown-ups found that jobs were scarce. 
That first hopeful journey of Black people to Canada ended with a disappointment. 
It was only the beginning of a struggle that would last two centuries.  
I might add that this is something that all Canadians should try to do.  
...winning their rightful place in society.  
It remains to be seen if the Governor General is correct.  
THE HONOURABLE MR. JUSTICE BASTARACHE 
Congratulations on Appointment to Supreme Court of Canada 
Hon. Jean-Maurice Simard :
I will take the liberty of reading a few lines: 
Hon. Louis J. Robichaud :
This was a wise appointment of a universally respected jurist. 
He did so very successfully and we are proud of him. 
Justice Bastarache is an excellent jurist. 
Recognition of Fifty Years of Canadian Forces Search and Rescue Operation 
Hon. Orville H. Phillips :
Hon. Rose-Marie Losier-Cool :
Teachers play a fundamental role. 
We are having great success and we have every right to be proud. 
We must keep religion in our schools.  
Bank of Canada Increase in Interest Rates 
We have been there before, honourable senators, have we not? 
Here we go again with a round of interest rate hikes. 
What is urgently needed in these regions in a policy to help revive the economy.  
The Hon. the Speaker :

Business of the Senate 
Delayed Answers to Oral Questions-Form of Presentation-Government Position 
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
I, too, wish him well as he assumes his new responsibilities. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Were you standing on "Senators' Corner?"  
I can see that it is going to be downhill from here.  
I am talking about delayed answers to questions.  
I have picked three at random from the last Parliament. 
It is a simple sheet of paper, same size, with no signature.  
They were well delayed.  
Where do they go? 
Does it go to someone else? 
You will get a delayed answer on that one, too. 
Honourable senators, that is a good question. 
With respect to written questions - 
Who set this up today? 
Are you reading from a prepared text?  
I am reading from the back of an envelope.  
Give the answer now. 
The question related to gun registration. 
That will cost more.  
What does that have to do with registration?  
This is a part of the question that he asked. 
I will get to registration in a moment.  
What does that have to do with registration? 
The figure mentioned was $85 million for registration.  
What does that have to do with registration?  
The law will be implemented in 1998. 
I do not think that would be appropriate in the chamber.  
The exact date will be announced in advance but it will be implemented in 1998. 
There will be a parliamentary review of these regulations.  
The police training has to be thorough. 
The computer systems have to be fully operational. 
When this work is completed, the new law will be implemented.  
I gave you the answer.  
No, you did not. 
I wanted to know how many questions go to the Privy Council Office. 
He is interested in everything.  
Do the PCO's fingerprints appear on all of the answers to the oral questions?  
You are no better off than you were.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, there is a temptation to ask a whole series of supplementary questions.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I am talking about the Sea Kings.  
I understand that you are talking about the Sea Kings. 
If not, what is the cause of the delay? 
They are replacing helicopters; approval, as you suggested, is in place. 
Everything but the will to do it seems to be working. 
What is the stumbling block now? 
Honourable senators, I honestly do not know of any specific stumbling block. 
Where will the money come from?  
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
My question concerns the proposed seniors benefits.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
Honourable senators, I have a supplementary question. 
Has the government done any calculations concerning how this new measure will affect women? 
If so, could that information be tabled in the Senate? 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The system is very complex and it is certainly a burden on seniors. 
The government is trying to preserve and strengthen the system. 
It is trying to make the pension system more affordable in the future. 
It is trying to target 
It is trying to treat couples equally. 
It is trying to make the system simpler. 
Growing Debt Load of Students-Government Position 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
My question is two-fold. 
First, does this $1-billion endowment fund represent new money? 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I have a supplementary question, honourable senators. 
We are already going a long way to doing what we can. 
Hon. Eric Arthur Berntson :
Honourable senators, my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
To date, I have yet to receive an answer.  
I now have one additional question. 
That process literally destroyed this man. 
Criminal charges were laid and Mr. Munro went to court to offer a defence. 
The court heard the Crown's arguments and threw the whole matter out of court. 
Not even one defence witness needed to be called.  
This man has been left tattered and torn, with virtually nothing.  
They include the former leader of the Bloc Quebecois. 
The government picked up his legal costs. 
They include Reform members of Parliament. 
The charges include everything from unjust dismissal to harassment to defamation. 
One member was investigated on a question of fraud. 
Why is that any different from the case of Mr. Munro? 
He has been left absolutely destitute. 
Yet, it seems that he will receive zero in terms of compensation from the government.  
What are the criteria used to make these judgments? 
Why is the application of the rules inconsistent? 
What did he do that put him in the bad books? 
I simply do not understand how that serves justice. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the concern of Senator Berntson is commendable.  
I assure the honourable senator that I will give it every attention immediately.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
That refers to both Houses of Parliament.  
Hon. Orville H. Phillips :
This resulted in lower benefit payments being paid to seasonal employees. 
That was done in the name of deficit reduction.  
Any benefit you can think of, they received it. 
These people received a bonus of $12,500, or approximately $1,000 per month. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I will attempt to determine the criteria for establishing these bonuses. 
I am just as curious as the honourable senator.  
Second reading-Bill to Amend-Debate Adjourned 
A large number of the changes proposed are relatively minor or are administrative in nature. 
Such protection would be similar to that provided to witnesses statements.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, perhaps Senator Rompkey would entertain a question or two?  
I cannot guarantee answers, but I will entertain a question.  
Honourable senators, at second reading we are debating the principle of the bill. 
Do you know anything about that commission?  
I cannot tell you who was on the commission. 
Obviously, it was a commission that was duly set up. 
I can say that the consultation was wider than the commission itself.  
You have answered that question.  
On motion of Senator Forrestall, debate adjourned.  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
We live in a time of substantial demographic change. 
The number of older Canadians is growing rapidly.  
It is clear that the Act must be amended. 
In some cases, the contributions required to finance these improvements were not forthcoming.  
Some of these principles are as follows: 
There should be rapid intervention to address the problems of pension plans experiencing difficulties; 
Regulation and supervision must be efficient. 
The mode of supervision must provide for adequate accountability and transparency; 
Employers, and in many cases employees, contribute to these plans. 
This does not necessarily mean that the pension plan must be terminated. 
This brings me to a related issue. 
This encourages supervisory agencies to intervene rapidly.  
The role of these agencies must be clearly defined. 
I would now like to consider another aspect of this bill. 
They would also be responsible for the administration of these plans. 
The sections on simplified retirement plans will be presented at a later date.  
The Office has been involved in this project for approximately two years. 
For example, the supervisory authority of the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions. 
He is therefore given six new powers. 
This power will make it easier to obtain such reports.  
Another power is that of arbitration in the event of surplus assets. 
We received many comments, but very few concrete suggestions. 
In conclusion, honourable senators, these measures are the result of a broad consultation. 
The government hopes to receive more comments on regulations and guidelines.  
On motion of Senator Kinsella, debate adjourned.  
Speech From the Throne 
Motion for Address in Reply-Debate Adjourned 
1st day of resuming debate ) 
I also wish to thank Senator Fairbairn. 
Your Honour, I also wish to congratulate you on your appointment to the Chair. 
This is an honour you fully deserve.  
One could not have found more appropriate words to open the debate.  
We are a very young country in the history of civilization. 
An infant compared to some other countries! 
Despite its young age, Canada is among the most industrialized countries in the world. 
In fact, it is the youngest of the G-7 countries. 
The single most important commitment of the Government is to keep Canada united. 
The Government of Canada can have no greater duty or responsibility.  
As parliamentarians, we will have to assume that duty or responsibility.  
How does the government intend to take up the challenge? 
Simply, to quote the Speech from the Throne: 
Mr. Chretien clearly expressed it last week in the other place: 
As Mr. Chretien told us, and I quote: 
That is what we are going to do.  
One of these commitments is to make our cities safer. 
Canada's crime rate has decreased steadily in the past four years. 
Those are but a few of the steps taken during the last Parliament. 
Crime prevention is, naturally, the best way to achieve this goal. 
It also wants to strengthen the capacity for good government in aboriginal communities.  
Independence, autonomy, self-respect. 
I agree with what my colleague said. 
In fact, the government has already taken some measures in that regard. 
We were all able to see for ourselves that it was possible:
That is how federalism can and must work. 
Our strength comes from our mutual respect and tolerance.  
As a Quebecker and a Canadian, I salute their initiative.  
This is the way a government should work. 
On motion of Senator Graham, debate adjourned.

That is found in the Executive Summary of the report at page ES-4.  
That description is found at pages 1408 and 1409.
