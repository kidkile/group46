EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 171 
Monday, February 1, 1999 
The House met at 11.00 a.m. 
FISHERS' BILL OF RIGHTS 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
We have travelled to both coasts of this country. 
I am making reference to the child pornography decision. 
I look forward to addressing that concern at committee. 
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Few facts have been advanced from the other side of the House.  
Presumably by making them pay for the so-called damage their policies have caused. 
But who pays here? 
What did the architect of the bill have in mind? 
Not from the minister and the so-called bureaucracy, but from the taxpayer. 
This is from a party that prides itself on fiscal responsibilities.  
Would it create more fish? 
No. Would it preserve the fish that are left? 
Again let us look at the facts. 
I urge the House to reject the bill.  
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
The Yukon River starts at Skagway, an American city, and comes up through Whitehorse. 
This year the salmon did not come. 
The fish ladder was almost empty by the time the river got to Carmacks. 
We are talking about their winter food. 
In Dawson City they could not fish. 
By the time they got to Old Crow there was no fish. 
The Gwich'in people depend on the fishery and the caribou. 
This bill brings accountability to the department of fisheries. 
It devolves some powers to those who need it.  
What it has meant is a total collapse in our fishing system.  
Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma-Manitoulin, Lib.):
The commercial fishery is something that is important to my area as well. 
The commercial fishers who extract fish from this resource are among the finest fishers anywhere.  
Let me come to Bill C-302. 
We have heard that while this bill is well intentioned there are many flaws. 
A bill of rights cannot prevent the disappearance of fish stocks. 
Only sound management, conservation based management can do that.  
So much has been done that I can only highlight some of those accomplishments.  
Last June was a particularly productive month. 
Progress is being made. 
It is not enough to say that mistakes were made in the past. 
We have to change our behaviour, as painful as that may be. 
That is what the minister has been telling Canada's fishermen. 
They trust that the government will make change in a responsible, caring way. 
Above all, as a government we have always tried to put people first. 
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
That is why I applaud the initiative of my colleague from New Brunswick-Southwest.  
What could be more praiseworthy?  
Therefore the capacity was not reduced. 
As well fishers question DFO's scientific estimates.  
Many witnesses have criticized the lack of resources allocated to new fisheries. 
DFO policies have raised serious concerns in many communities. 
That is what needs to change. 
They must be accountable to these people.  
It is nothing short of a crisis. 
I urge all my colleagues to vote in favour of this bill.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I believe you will find consent thereto. 
The motion is as follows: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
This will be a two stage process. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
FISHERS' BILL OF RIGHTS 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
What has it done on the west coast? 
It closed down coho salmon fishing last year.  
Members of the committee travelled all across Canada. 
That is why a bill like this one is a very good bill. 
That will not solve the problem.  
There are two examples of lack of consultation. 
The first is on the west coast in my own constituency. 
The minister wiped out coho fishing this year in British Columbia. 
This put a lot of people out of work. 
There was fishing in Porpoise Bay for coho. 
That was not good planning by the government. 
DFO said not to put any out there. 
Then what did DFO do? 
It banned the fishing because it said that there were not enough. 
This bill gives fishermen rights to consultation.  
Another story concerns herring roe on kelp. 
This was not a native fishery. 
Four companies were doing it and making good money at it.  
What has happened to the market in Japan? 
The other three licence holders wanted to be bought out too. 
The sad thing is this lack of planning, lack of consultation. 
That is the lack of planning in this industry.  
It is not right. 
It is not proper. 
As I said, I commend the member for New Brunswick Southwest. 
These are people who put good money into their industry. 
They are not being advised.  
What does the government do? 
This has not solved one problem.  
We need to get these 1,200 bureaucrats out of the business. 
There is no fishing in the Rideau Canal. 
The fishing is on the east and west coasts. 
There are too many bureaucrats making too much money who have made wrong decisions. 
It is time for a change. 
We ask all members of the House to vote for this bill tomorrow.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It being 11.55 a.m., the time provided for debate has expired. 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Vaughan-King-Aurora, Lib.):
A strong economy is the key to building a more secure society. 
Taxes seemed to know only one direction: up.  
The debt to GDP ratio is on a firm and permanent downward track. 
Our inflation rate is at its lowest level since the 1960s. 
Our interest rates are also at the lowest levels in three decades.  
Canada has enjoyed the strongest economic growth of the G-7. 
The government has listened. 
The government has shown its openness to modernizing the health care system. 
We believe that health care is a priority. 
The Canada education savings plan is another example. 
The measures that we are taking are important because we compete in a global marketplace. 
They want results from their elected officials. 
They want results from their corporate leaders. 
Let us put an end to the era of confrontation. 
What is our role to enhance productivity?  
There are a number of accomplishments we should take note of.  
The federal deficit has been eliminated. 
What did the finance committee have to say about that? 
These are three of the measures.  
We have made a number of recommendations in relation to taxes. 
I will discuss what the government has done to enhance productivity. 
It helps people get higher wage jobs and achieve greater productivity.  
Is this not essentially the type of society we want to build? 
That is where our competitive advantage is.  
Looking at education and skills development, what has this government done? 
This is what it takes to build a country. 
We need to invest in people. 
I think EI reform did that.  
Productivity is also impacted by our trade policy. 
What does trade policy do? 
There again the end result is a boost in productivity and competitiveness.  
What has this government done in the area of trade policy? 
We are a leading player in the WTO. 
Privatization can enhance and boost productivity.  
It is clear to me that the agenda of the government is working quite well. 
I heard this throughout the country. 
It is an agenda that looks to the future with a great deal of optimism. 
We have eliminated the deficit. 
We have lowered taxes. 
We have made key investments in education, research and development.  
I am proud to be a Canadian. 
I am proud to be a member of the House of Commons. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
My purpose will be twofold. 
That is being released today. 
The report has three emphases. 
First, it proposes a real, substantial tax relief package. 
Like many of us I think there is too much of that in the House.  
We do not want to fall into the same trap.  
We are encouraged by these signs of progress.  
Having said that, I would like to point out two major deficiencies in the report. 
This includes spin doctoring of the projected surplus.  
There is a second deficiency in the report which should be emphasized. 
However that is not my main point.  
The definition and elaboration of productivity in the report strikes me as curious. 
The cost of doing business is the denominator in that fraction. 
It includes taxes imposed by the government. 
I urge the committee to address that point. 
It is pretty simple.  
That is the thrust of our prebudget submission and our advice.  
Let me take these categories one by one. 
This year it is deja vu all over again. 
That is spending control. 
What the official opposition recommends is really three things. 
That is not an unreasonable figure. 
It is the figure that the finance minister himself said was adequate for last year.  
That is what we are here to debate. 
Let me turn to debt reduction. 
Again the federal government just is not doing it. 
We have a $580 billion federal debt. 
That is a burden on the capacity to finance social services. 
It is a drag on productivity. 
The government says it is concerned about productivity. 
Let us consider the taxation record under the government.  
There is a rumble through that audience that the government ought to take into account.  
The Americans spend much more than we do on defence. 
That is the government's record on taxation. 
Some hon. members actually believe that argument. 
That is a statement on productivity. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
The Liberal majority's report is a blatant piece of propaganda. 
I will quote the report of the Liberal majority, at page 55. 
So what do we find on page 55 of the Liberal majority report? 
We did our job.  
The people whom we consulted told us about the real issues. 
This is not normal.  
They discussed the Saskatoon agreement. 
We are making a point of putting it back on the table.  
These cuts have not been eliminated.  
The discussions were not about $1 billion but rather $6.3 billion. 
This can be done by fully indexing the tax tables. 
There was unanimity on this in Quebec. 
The second is to successfully reduce access to the program. 
The third is to reduce benefits.  
In recent weeks, they have gone so far as to exert pressure. 
This has happened in a number of regions in Quebec. 
I have seen it in Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot as well. 
Pressure is put on them to subtly take away their right to appeal. 
This action is deliberate. 
There is a limit to the harassment of these people.  
Do you know why they are being harassed? 
We thought it was a matter of intelligence. 
Do you know who this minister reminds me of? 
He reminds me of Lucius Domitius Tiberius Claudius Nero, commonly known as Emperor Nero. 
Nero set Rome ablaze and declaimed his sorrow as the city burned. 
I find it despicable.  
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
I have done so before.  
The member should be ashamed of his remarks.  
As far as I know, she can read English.  
In any event, she has been mistaken as long as we have known her. 
As a member of Parliament, she is often mistaken. 
I would like to put a question to the member. 
Exactly the same as they are today. 
This is a given.  
It is the same thing. 
As futile as debating how many angels can dance on the head of a pin.  
We are still looking, and maybe one day will find some. 
Where are these positive actions? 
We are still looking, and maybe one day we will manage to find some.  
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the Bloc Quebecois member for his comments.  
My riding of Beausejour-Petitcodiac is losing $35.8 million every year. 
Also, fewer and fewer women qualify for the program.  
We have a surplus that keeps increasing and that will exceed $20 million. 
Absolutely not, Mr. Speaker. 
He twists the figures. 
He twists them in a scandalous way. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his answer.  
This situation has occurred in the Atlantic provinces. 
Is the hon. member aware of this situation?  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Waiting lists are getting longer. 
It has driven many more into the ranks of poverty. 
Our so-called public universities are being transformed into institutions for the privileged elites.  
Canadians therefore want and deserve a fairer tax system. 
They want the debt problem addressed. 
This would be as imprudent and irresponsible as incurring another round of deficits.  
Overly aggressive debt repayment would put an additional drag on economic growth. 
That is something we must avoid. 
These questions have been on the agenda for more than two decades. 
This government calls it getting the economic fundamentals right. 
It has not worked. 
It is not going to work to improve the living standards of ordinary people. 
It has not worked to lift families out of poverty. 
It has not worked for the homeless. 
Ordinary Canadians are working harder and harder for less and less.  
The government's formula has not worked in its own terms. 
The first challenge is to reinvest in our social programs. 
This has to change. 
Canadians need their government to make this a priority. 
They need solid progress toward this important objective.  
In conclusion, to make progress in these areas will take imaginative visionary leadership. 
He might as well have said let them eat cake.  
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
I am reminded of listening to Tommy Douglas in the 1960s and 1970s. 
The speeches do not seem very different to me.  
They want more service for the money being spent. 
The answer is not simply to spend more money.  
The member went on to talk about labour productivity. 
There is no rule in the House that requires him to do so. 
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Meanwhile Mike Harris, since he has been in office, has created 500,000 jobs.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
It is absolutely clear that Canadians do not want either/or. 
They want both/and. 
That is why we are prepared to present a real alternative.  
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
Their tireless efforts have brought great comfort to the affected families.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
They are deserving of our support.  
THE INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF OLDER PERSONS 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the United Nations has designated 1999 as the international year of older persons. 
The UN has designated this year's theme as ``A Society for all ages''.  
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
I want to thank the Minister of Canadian Heritage for being part of the ceremonies. 
It was the first time Team Canada has played in the Metro Toronto area. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
This raises two questions:
Bombardier gets a lot of lucrative, untendered contracts. 
Maybe the PM has stock. 
We do not really know. 
Canadians deserve to know.  
THE 1999 FEDERAL BUDGET 
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):
I asked them about their priorities for our communities. 
Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):
Child pornography is violence against children. 
Child pornography should be no different. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it was terrifying. 
I was powerless to stop him. 
But they would not help.  
Why did the police not come to help? 
The answer is simple. 
The bandit was the tax collector.  
It is high time that we gave Canadians some tax relief. 
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
Let us pay tribute to the community spirit of the Inuit of Kangiqsualujjuaq.  
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the referendum game is on again, since this past weekend.  
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
The remarks of other religious groups received no such censure.  
As when any basic human right is transgressed, there are unfortunate and painful consequences. 
However, Canadians want to know that religious discrimination like this will not happen again. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, our Prime Minister is a funny guy. 
Whenever he talks about taxes he gets a twinkle in his eye. 
Last week in Switzerland he said a funny thing. 
I would like to ask old twinkle eyes over there, just between you and me- 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, twinkle toes.  
We know the Prime Minister has mixed feelings. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, surely the Prime Minister is kidding. 
Now we know he actually secretly admired him for raising taxes.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have reduced the taxes. 
We have balanced the books since we formed the government.  
The previous government could not manage it and it had to increase taxes constantly. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
They chose regional giveaways to cut health. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
I ask the hon. member not to use a prop.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
What is the health minister trying to do? 
He is trying to get a report card on the provinces for health. 
What does the federal Liberal report card look like? 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party would not do well in mathematics. 
The Reform Party really has an agenda that is quite hidden. 
We will never be in favour of that.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
By doing so, it has forced the provinces to bear political responsibility for federal cuts.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
These are not very dangerous requests, and I think that- 
The hon. leader of the Bloc Quebecois.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
What happened to the good intentions of 1995? 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We hope to have the same kind of co-operation in the case of health.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is also for the Prime Minister.  
Surely what is good for the goose is good for the gander. 
Canadians want the federal government to be accountable too. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
We believe that law to be constitutional.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
The ethics watchdog has now become the Prime Minister's own personal guard dog. 
Is this the new Liberal definition of ethics?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
He advises members from both sides of the House. 
He is always happy to give the information to anybody who wants it. 
That is why he met with reporters in the past. 
I always follow the instructions of the ethics counsellor.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Nobody seems to know what they are. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there was none of that. 
We established this institution to help all members of parliament. 
There were some cases where he met with members of parliament to explain the situation. 
He has been very open to the press. 
This Prime Minister always discharges his responsibilities.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the intentions of the federal Minister of Health are clear. 
He wants to control the provinces' exercise of their constitutional rights with respect to health.  
Mr. Speaker, as always, the Government of Canada intends to respect the Constitution fully.  
That minister had respect for the Constitution.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
What a lot of nonsense, Mr. Speaker. 
The member for Calgary Southeast.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am glad the hon. member woke up. 
This was announced two years ago. 
That is why this was done.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
How many jobs have moved to Shawinigan?  
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is very typical of the Reform Party. 
It wants to divide Canadians this way. 
It wants to divide Canadians by region.  
I have been informed that one job is moving to the Shawinigan riding. 
I know the Prime Minister may not be happy but that is the reality.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, these allegations about quotas are false. 
I have never heard anything about such quotas. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Will the minister today take action and solve this problem for Canadians?  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
He announced immediately that he will appeal the decision. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this decision has given pedophiles the right to abuse children.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
I think it is most unfortunate that the hon. member would so misrepresent the situation.  
We believe that subsection of the Criminal Code is constitutional. 
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there has been advancement.  
As a result of this legislation there will be.  
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
The hon. member for Dauphin-Swan River.  
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
I have made no threats. 
We have on this side of the debate respected due process throughout. 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this minister just does not get it. 
This is about jobs. 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
This is a recognition about Canada. 
This bill is fair for Canadians and Americans.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. 
Now the federal government is dumping Devco. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to outline the package.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
The government's package will not make a dent in that annual loss. 
I believe some of those discussions have already taken place.  
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
That is what Canadians expect, not only passive support.  
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. 
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
We believe the law is constitutional.  
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Why does her government not use the notwithstanding clause today?  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
To pre-empt that appellant process is silly and wrong headed.  
ATLANTIC CANADA OPPORTUNITIES AGENCY 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.  
Will the minister immediately launch an investigation into this sweetheart deal?  
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has his facts half right and half wrong.  
The hon. member for Mercier.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, there is concern among authors.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
The unions may have some suggestions to make for modifications.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Natural Resources.  
That works out to $68 million for economic development. 
This is just not enough.  
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Minister for International Co-operation.  
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
I take it the hon. member is asking for unanimous consent to put the motion. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Tomorrow we will force debate and a vote on this issue. 
Could we not further debate this today seeing that- 
We are getting into debate. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
MR. JUSTICE ROBERT FLAHIFF 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
(a) a lack of honour and dignity; 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the indulgence.  
I rise concerning last week's Devco announcement. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
It is a bigger issue than this.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
That is a separate point and I acknowledge it.  
I will reserve judgment until the minister involved is in the House.

MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT

Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
I am pleased to present these petitions.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
It concerns the issue of human rights.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien: 
b) During her period of office, she has presided over 466 cases.  
c) Of the 466 appeals considered, 139 were decided in the claimants favour.  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):

Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentry Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
What was the total number of skilled workers allowed into Canada in 1997?  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit: 
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
QUESTIONS PASSED AS ORDERS FOR RETURNS 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Madam Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions stand.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Shall the remaining questions stand?  
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Members of the opposition and all Canadians are waiting with some degree of suspense.  
The world is changing at an unprecedented rate. 
Globalization and the forces of technology create change on a daily basis. 
This is a government without a real agenda, without a firm vision. 
Canadians are responsible for the elimination of the deficit. 
Canadians have borne the brunt of deficit reduction. 
The government tells us to look at the fundamentals. 
The Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister tell us that the fundamentals are sound. 
We have the highest taxes of any of the G-7 countries.  
The Economist magazine has published articles on the Canadian situation. 
It gave credit not to the current government but to the previous government. 
These are some of those fundamentals. 
Our productivity is lagging our G-7 partners. 
In fact it is quite the opposite. 
The contrary is true. 
This will happen for two reasons. 
Those are the types of issues that need to be addressed. 
But the government has focused on one thing and one thing only. 
We are looking for leadership, not politics. 
Even then, it will only kick in in 2000. 
There is a global trend toward private post-secondary education. 
The Liberals know a great deal about spending. 
The Liberals deserve some credit for having developed a certain proficiency in spending. 
However, we hope they do not revert to their old ways.  
We are somewhat happy that they have done that. 
The Minister of Finance has said in the past that payroll taxes kill jobs. 
Employers can create jobs if we give them the tools. 
We are proposing that EI premiums be reduced to $2 per $100 of insurable earnings.  
We are calling for a full indexation of income tax brackets. 
That is about one coffee per week at Tim Horton's. 
If they go to Starbucks it is one per month. 
We are calling for an increase in the capital gains exemption. 
The provinces did not reduce their transfers from the federal government. 
We are calling for indexing the child tax benefit. 
We are calling for real and measurable debt reduction targets. 
That is simply not consistent with maximization of the returns.  
We are also calling for parliamentary control- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am afraid the hon. member's time has expired.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
That means an effective rate of 25%.  
It is really a frivolous argument.  
As the member knows, there is a lot of misinformation concerning that. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
They do not even believe in the law of supply and demand. 
The Liberals believe in Liberal focus group economics. 
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
The finance committee met with Canadians from all walks of life. 
Canadians want us to operate on prudent estimates. 
I did a survey in my constituency of Kitchener Centre. 
We must be attentive to this issue. 
We need to look at how we fund health care. 
It is not just a matter of dollars.  
This should be achieved within five years.  
The community that I represent was largely manufacturing in its historic base. 
I see that base evolving. 
My community is looking for highly skilled technical workers. 
We are trying to address this issue through some of the recommendations in the budget.  
Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):
The backdrop of how we got here from there is still important to Canadians. 
Approximately seven years ago we had the recession of 1992. 
It was not a one-year cyclical recession.  
There were reasons for that. 
I know they were not selected to exacerbate the recession. 
They were selected because they were seen as necessary. 
Some of it was necessary medicine. 
Some of it was just the right time to implement policy. 
However, it turns out to have been poor timing.  
High interest rate policies were pursued by the Bank of Canada. 
The timing was awful. 
The timing was all wrong. 
It succeeded ultimately, but at a very high cost to Canadians.  
There were adjustments to the free trade agreement. 
All of these factors exacerbated that very difficult recession year.  
I remember talking to constituents. 
I remember saying ``This is just a cyclical recession. 
However, that situation persisted for several years at a very high cost to Canadians.  
We adopted a plan, a process which was called a program review.  
There were tax adjustments. 
Who can take the credit for it? 
Our interest rates now are the lowest in 25 or 30 years. 
Our inflation is down to the lowest it has been in 25 or 30 years. 
That is very positive.  
That is all very healthy.  
The deficit is gone. 
Maybe there should just be a balance. 
Then we would not need to argue about a surplus.  
We have to deal with debt management. 
Like it or not it is there and we have some bills to pay.  
Second, we will have to restore the effectiveness of our social programs. 
There is more than one way to do that. 
Third is tax reduction. 
In the last budget the government began to deliver tax reductions in modest amounts. 
These reductions are showing up at the low end of the income scale. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, this is my opportunity to speak to the prebudget debate. 
I will be splitting my time with the member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley.  
I intend not to do too much of that today. 
I was around for the red book. 
I saw the promises in the red book. 
What have preserve and protect ended up meaning? 
Those are straightforward facts.  
She was reassured the surgery would likely be performed on the Wednesday. 
This was not the case. 
She was kept on morphine without seeing a doctor until Friday.  
On Friday she asked ``Where is my doctor?'' 
She went on to say that luckily she had the surgery that day.  
That is absolutely unacceptable in a country like Canada. 
Let us think of what she did for those four days. 
She lay there with the swelling in her ankle worse. 
She saw only the nurses, nurses doing wonderful work. 
I leave that to my colleagues across the way.  
This individual addressed the letter to the Minister of Health. 
He stated that the minister's comments had generated a few questions. 
I will not go through them all. 
I will go to the last and the main question. 
This is not a politician. 
These letters are coming like a blizzard to my office.  
What do the nurses say? 
They await an answer.  
The supplementary question was:
What do Canada's physicians say? 
I am just one lone voice. 
They have an association that involves all health care workers in Canada. 
I will not read what they say. 
It is very obvious what they say.  
It is easy to criticize, is it not? 
First, we need stable funding for medicare. 
I would like to give his head a shake. 
These guys only look for new spending. 
We do not need new spending. 
They are spending on areas they should never be spending on.  
We also need a thorough review of medicare. 
We need to put the patient first. 
The patient is not first, and that must change. 
We need to put more accent on prevention. 
Also, the government has been very harsh on natural health products.  
First is the Arkansas prison connection. 
The RCMP should be looking at that information. 
The Hepatitis C Society says it is unacceptable and inadequate. 
It has major problems with it. 
It is advising the public not to accept it.  
In France people are in jail. 
The prebudget debate on health care is not over. 
That is not acceptable.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Everyone out there wants tax relief. 
These are countries that we compete with. 
What happened to those wage increases because of the Liberal government's tax policies? 
It is clear that Canadians need tax relief. 
There is no doubt about it. 
He has used the pension funds of the federal civil service. 
He has taken that and has put that against the deficit. 
He does not have a balanced budget. 
He is still about $16 billion or $17 billion short.  
Let us talk about the EI fund. 
There is about $20 billion in EI surplus. 
I do not think so. 
This is a true story from my riding. 
He went to a specialist in Vancouver and had an angiogram. 
The next option is a bypass. 
In the old days a single bypass was a routine procedure. 
It is because the Liberal government has ripped the heart out of health care. 
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
I do not think many people really understand this issue. 
This is a cancer which exists within our taxation system. 
What does this all mean to the average taxpayer? 
The dollars they bring into their household buy less goods.  
They are in fact middle to low income earners. 
The impact on the truly high income earner is almost negligible. 
Indeed we can look at marginal rates of tax. 
I will give a quick explanation of what a marginal tax rate is. 
Imagine the impact this has on many low income families. 
I had a phone call from a constituent the other day. 
It is a tax illusion.  
This may be the expedient solution but it is certainly not the right solution.  
It had some alarming conclusions about the Canadian economy. 
We live in a remarkable time. 
People's income is not increasing. 
Indeed it is declining. 
Personal credit is reaching alarming levels made only possible by lower interest rates. 
One hundred and sixteen per cent of disposable income now goes toward personal debt. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise on this pre-budget debate. 
The second was to reduce EI premiums by 15 cents. 
It is reflective of the kinds of things the finance committee dealt with. 
I referred to it as the presentation from Oz. 
We need a budget that has heart. 
We have through Statistics Canada an instrument called LICO, low income cut off. 
Mr. Broadbent was in the House on his last day as a member of parliament. 
He was leaving the place. 
Most of the dialogue was giving tribute to Mr. Broadbent. 
Under the health regime we have concerns about social poverty. 
I believe there are some issues beyond basic fiscal issues. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Why does the member not understand the simple mathematics in this case? 
It has not paid to have a wage increase under the Liberals. 
I would be happy to sit down with the member and work out the issues.  
We have to balance the need to target those benefits.  
I believe that is what the member has in mind.  
We are talking about putting money back into the hands of low income people. 
Mr. Speaker, the member should listen once again. 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
The report is centralizing and makes a mockery of the provinces.  
They are editorial writers very well known in English Canada. 
These women reported exactly what would appear in the budget. 
So it will be no surprise.  
We call that blackmail.  
Page 64 of the Liberal report states, and I quote: 
That is not mentioned in the report. 
That is not important. 
So the federal government should give the money back to the provinces. 
That seems clear to me. 
This arrogant government is boasting how well it looks after us. 
All that matters to them right now is to make it into the history books. 
They could care less about the disadvantaged, the unemployed and the ill.  
Jean Chretien is going around- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I apologize for this breach of protocol, Mr. Speaker. 
Come on, what planet does he live on?  
I saw it on CPAC last week. 
And we do not have any program for these people. 
If the finance minister is going to show off, he should do it properly. 
His forecast was a surplus of some $2 or $3 billion. 
What is the source of these surpluses the Minister of Finance boasts about? 
Where do they come from these billions of dollars saved by the Minister of Finance? 
Where does the money come from? 
But they siphon the money off.  
No, this Minister of Finance and this government have not kept their promises. 
They told us ``We will put a stop to this shameless wastage''. 
But they have not yet done so. 
They are continuing duplication in areas of provincial jurisdiction.  
The report refers to a productivity covenant. 
They came up with three or four ideas.  
This could be done by indexing the tax tables.  
He should get out and see some real people.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
It really is a prebudget year 2000 debate. 
Governments need a lot of time to prepare the budget. 
One pertains to charities. 
I am confident that the government has taken this issue very seriously. 
There seems to be a problem. 
I sit on the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development. 
Let me give a few of the figures. 
The first figures I have are the average incomes. 
It deals with per capita incomes of aboriginals and non-aboriginal Canadians as of 1990.  
The provincial and territorial spending was $5 billion. 
This totals $11.628 billion.  
I hope the government is listening. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Why do some have so much and some so little? 
This is the funding the hon. member is talking about.  
If he does I would be pleased to support him.  
I thank the member for his very kind comment.  
However we know that it has not been working in the past. 
That is what seems to be lacking at this time. 
They are not really nation states; they are really like municipalities.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is delightful to be back. 
The member made an interesting point. 
We heard members opposite calling quite loudly for tax relief. 
It is my sense that there will be some additional tax relief in the budget. 
I am hopeful there will be. 
The Canadian people know because they can see it. 
They can see the actual benefits they get.  
In addition a caregiver credit was provided in the 1998 budget. 
The government recognized it in 1998 as important. 
We heard from students at various committees and in our offices. 
I believe, as my colleague mentioned, this budget has been put to bed. 
The policies have gone before parliamentary committees. 
They have been taken to caucus. 
There has been input from Canadians. 
This budget is probably done. 
The next budget will be for the year 2000.  
We were being referred to as a third world nation.  
That does incredible damage. 
I am sad to say that I think it was true. 
The proof was in the pudding. 
There is an upward trend in the economy. 
Canadians know that and they speak about it in resounding numbers every day. 
Things are strong and will get stronger.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Homelessness, for example, is at a record level. 
It is almost a national disaster and it is certainly a national embarrassment. 
The member should look at the resounding numbers of people living in poverty. 
We are hoping that in the coming budget these issues will be addressed. 
These are resounding bad numbers of the government.  
The problem of homelessness needs to be tied more to health. 
We have seen the cuts. 
The member talks about his home province. 
Let me talk about my province. 
We have seen the cuts that have happened in mental health. 
We can blame the federal government for downsizing the transfers to the provinces. 
We have to accept collective responsibility as a nation for some of that. 
I too would like to see a national housing policy. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
It will be a problem for some time.  
I wanted to make that point. 
I believe I heard the hon. member say that. 
If it is not so I will withdraw that statement.  
I probably did say it. 
Yes, there are problems with it.  
It is quite interesting to have a Reform member stand here. 
I guess the third 50% would go to health care. 
Maybe that is Reform math.  
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, if no one else will pick up the cudgel then certainly I will. 
I would allocate more moneys to debt reduction. 
I consider the debt to be a burden on us and our country. 
I am something of a minority in this view. 
I hope that will prevent the dead loonie bounce. 
This is quite an accomplishment and a significant sum of money. 
I was fortunate to have a conversation with Governor Thiessen on this very point. 
This government in my view has done it right. 
We have reduced debt in absolute terms. 
We have committed ourselves to reducing debt in a steady downward trend.  
That in and of itself is a tremendous accomplishment.  
I now to turn to tax cuts. 
The surtax can be removed at this stage. 
This was a tax imposed on Canadian taxpayers in order to fight the deficit. 
The fight for the deficit is now over. 
The rationale for that tax no longer exists. 
I urge the finance minister that this should be a priority tax cut.  
In addition, 10% of the taxpayers pay 50% of the taxes. 
This is a shocking figure.  
That in and of itself uses up room for doing other tax cuts.  
A dollar is a dollar is a dollar. 
The additional cuts that I would like to see are in the area of thresholds. 
However, an area that is easily understood is that of thresholds.  
Therefore I would have liked to have seen something done in the area of thresholds. 
There is also a certain level of hypocrisy in our approach to this. 
It is in the order of $25 billion to $26 billion.  
Surprise, surprise, but that is what has happened in Ontario. 
Right now it is around $20 billion. 
It is not the system that we would wish it to be. 
In government management there is always a choice in priorities. 
What priorities are we going to take? 
That has been achieved. 
This government then gave priority to reducing the debt in absolute and real terms. 
I applaud the government for doing that. 
Canada is a nation. 
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
I just want to review that for a moment.  
Do members know what it is now? 
It is not 50%. 
It is not 40%. 
It is not 25%. 
It is not even 15%. 
That is how the Liberals define priority for health care. 
They slash, hack and cut medicare so it is bleeding from a thousand cuts. 
This is a priority that I hope the member will address in the upcoming budget.  
That is a priority.  
In the process, the government's finances have been put back in order.  
Comparable health systems in other countries spend something like 7% of their GDP. 
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
I would like the hon. member to comment on that.  
The hon. member said that he was a debt hawk. 
Would the hon. member support that type of a lock?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member has a minute left.  
However, there is not a correlation with tax cuts. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Canadians are tired of the government's doublespeak. 
We do not need to abuse the EI fund to put an armoury in Shawinigan. 
In reality there should be no pats on the backs on the government benches. 
The social deficit in Canada has reached an all-time low. 
All that is missing is the iceberg.  
I want to read from a letter that I received over the break: 
It is very tough to survive on old age pensions in present times. 
My wife and I are trying to do just that. 
My lady is 70 years old and I am 76. 
We are both on medication. 
This is a low blow.  
The cost of living in the north is horrific. 
We pay top dollar to operate our cars. 
This is the Liberal legacy as we enter the new millennium. 
The government had best make a good showing with the next budget. 
We cannot afford for conditions to get any worse. 
Canadians will not tolerate this Prime Minister's lack of vision. 
This government must make a serious commitment to the people of Canada. 
Put the EI payments back into the program. 
In my riding $16.9 million less is being paid out in EI benefits.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
I agree with much of what she has said. 
What is the point of demanding accountability? 
Madam Speaker, I do not have a problem with accountability. 
It seems again I am talking of the doublespeak that the government uses. 
We did not have a problem within the health care system in Canada. 
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
What was the net effect of the moneys that were raised? 
How much did that contribute to the federal treasury? 
I personally have never begrudged my tax dollars. 
I have benefited greatly as a Canadian. 
That is the problem Canadians want to address in the tax system. 
They want something that is going to be fair for everyone. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
I commend my colleagues for their diligent work on this significant piece of legislation.  
One was in 1994 and more recently another in 1997. 
These reviews confirm the validity of the underlying principles of the act. 
Consultations were held as late as October of last year. 
This very simple device has historically been an effective safety warning. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
This is a preventive measure that will work to enhance the procedures of railway companies. 
It will allow communities to become involved in the issue of train whistles.  
It does not sound very important but it is. 
For one living in a community next to a railway track it becomes a disruption. 
It all fits into the safety implications of the bill. 
It is up against some pretty stiff competition. 
This is a big money maker, a big job maker. 
Otherwise it is like rolling over and playing dead to the elephant. 
I do not think that we can afford to do that any more.  
The transport minister's parliamentary secretary is here. 
He is a very capable individual. 
It is not as if it is a renewable resource. 
We have one and we have to take care of it. 
The last feature to which I will speak is the security of the railway system. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
These stakeholders have indicated their satisfaction and support for the bill.  
After all, it is the engine that creates our society. 
When business interests gain supremacy over others democracy is threatened. 
Labour was there to represent the workers. 
I particularly welcome the provisions for greater openness and transparency in rule making. 
It is possible that the railway companies will try to abuse this section. 
In summary, this bill attempts to improve the safety of Canada's railways. 
Only time will tell if this confidence in the railway companies is justified. 
Despite these reservations I reiterate my support for the bill.  
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
In the past rules and regulations were made and they were carved in stone. 
They remained that way for a great number of years. 
Safety will be number one throughout this entire process. 
We certainly cannot step into the picture and make declarations. 
In other words, we only deal with the facts.  
There is a concern that might not be the case. 
We will see how things proceed.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
We have to take what he said as true. 
Eventually it will come back. 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency- Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
Our party can only give its hearty approval.  
It read as follows: 
In a fourth paragraph, we said: 
That was the amendment we introduced at report stage.  
Mayor Gaudet wrote in his letter to his MP: 
Referring to order-in-council 1998/R402 of July 15, 1998. 
Since 1993, the municipality has been objecting to this responsibility. 
Now, without our consent, we have become responsible for this level crossing.  
We are calling upon your assistance in freeing us of this responsibility. 
For our small municipality- 
The same goes for Saint-Lambert. 
We cannot afford such an expense over the long term.  
First of all, CN. 
We are aware of the context in which the Liberal government privatized CN. 
When CN was privatized, it was given the lines as well. 
I hope the government will stand up.  
There is a sword of Damocles over their heads.  
I congratulate the government, but I hope it will stand up. 
We are talking about lines, about franchising Via Rail.  
I see the member for Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik is listening carefully to me. 
He is concerned about the sale of the Montreal-Senneterre line to a private company. 
My colleagues in the Gaspe are concerned about the Montreal-Gaspe and Montreal-Jonquiere lines.  
The government will have to give this serious thought. 
The large companies should pay for the cost of making railways safe.  
We are trying to fulfil our responsibilities as best we can. 
(a) the area meets the requirements prescribed for the purposes of this section; 
I am speaking here particularly to the elected municipal representatives listening to us this evening. 
It is set out in clause (b) I had started to read you that: 
I think this is entirely reasonable.  
A municipal council may therefore, by resolution, regulate use of whistles. 
This is a serious waste of the House's time. 
This is a charade from another era that should have disappeared a long time ago.  
Nobody believes it anyway. 
I hope everyone watching knows. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
That is not always true in some of the larger centres.  
In grade six we had a special class. 
All students were taught as they got older to hate the railways. 
However, that is coming to a close simply because the railways are disappearing.  
I want to pay tribute to the transport committee. 
I asked for a video. 
That is a must.  
I will never forget that engineer stepping down from the engine. 
It was impossible for him to stop. 
He had to live with that for the rest of his life.  
This bill is more than just a safety bill. 
That would not be a costly venture. 
One life saved would be worth the cost of the video.  
Each aisle in the House will represent a distance of exactly one mile. 
That is the way the west was surveyed. 
Most of the trains currently in operation are unit trains. 
Both incidents happened on the CPR Soo Line. 
I want members to picture this centre aisle as being the centre of the city. 
The fire halls are all on one side. 
The train approaches and the flashing lights block off that crossing. 
When he gets halfway there, this one is crossed. 
The centre crossing is the one which is used the most. 
By the time we have blocked this crossing at least 12 minutes have passed. 
I witnessed a period of 13 minutes.  
The trains travelling now are well over a mile long in most cases. 
These trains are presenting new problems. 
First, they need a greater distance to bring the train to a halt. 
I would suggest that we take a look at the problems that are being created.  
I would like to mention one other point that was brought up tonight. 
I think it is incumbent upon this government to take whatever steps are necessary. 
Should the $40 million be spent? 
Yes, we will be supporting this bill. 
Yes, it was a timely bill. 
That is a foregone conclusion. 
This is a plug for the railways and a plug for the highways. 
We have a national railway policy. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have a comment. 
That is not something which I think is in the best interests of the country.  
That is what I came to the House to talk about. 
He talked about 110-car unit trains. 
These trains have absolutely no possibility of clearing a crossing in the required time.  
What they are now doing is having longer and longer trains.  
I want to reinforce the point that the hon. member made. 
Now everything is according to the bottom line. 
Who cares what happens in Transcona? 
It is a shameful and disgusting tragedy for which these people will be held accountable. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to go back in time a little. 
I am reminded of the words of Will Rogers who visited western Canada. 
He made the comment that Canadians were building railways just for the fun of it.  
The hon. member is quite right. 
Most grain trains are 110 cars.  
I will admit that it is not perfect. 
Mr. Speaker, I would say to my hon. friend that I think he is wrong. 
A lot of this does have to do with deregulation.  
The fact of the matter is this does have a lot to do with it.  
They did serve a public purpose, an economic purpose, a social purpose. 
They did bring the country together. 
Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what we have been talking about in the transport committee. 
Even the Minister of Transport would agree. 
It makes good sense that we do this. 
Indeed I would like to see that happen. 
I want to make that clear.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
The government has particular responsibility for ensuring transportation safety. 
I will give the example of the creation of Nav Canada.  
It is a bill which modernizes the issue of railway safety. 
From that point of view, then, this is worthwhile. 
These rail lines give new life to the network. 
How will they organize in the event of accidents?  
That is why the Bloc Quebecois proposed an amendment.  
After all, it is only fair that a company maintain what it owns.  
In fact, this bill will modernize safety in our railway sector. 
There are some interesting legislative provisions in this regard. 
This is much simpler than before. 
So there has been a gain in terms of the bill.  
But for a rural municipality, it can be pretty significant.  
I approached the minister on this. 
I think he lent me an attentive ear. 
That would have been interesting. 
At the same time, an appropriate safety system would be in place.  
We did so with Nav Canada. 
Is the difference there because railway safety has been around a long time? 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
FIRST NATIONS LAND MANAGEMENT ACT 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
A vote on Motion No. 1 applies to Motions Nos. 6 and 7. 
(b) Motion No. 5 will be voted on separately.  
The House will now proceed to the consideration of the motions in Group No. 1.  
However, we see some flaws in the bill that can be fixed with amendments. 
I begin with Group No. 1 amendments. 
Sadly municipalities have been left out of the picture. 
We all know that this is a sensitive issue. 
Land is always a sensitive issue.  
It is only sensible that people would do that.  
Consultation is vital in these matters. 
That requirement for consultation should run both ways. 
It should not just be one way.  
This lack of consultation goes further than with just municipalities. 
I will discuss the expropriation provisions in the bill. 
That is really important. 
It is important for Canadians to understand that. 
The phrase ``other first nations purposes'' is a very broad statement. 
It is very wide open in terms of interpretation. 
It could mean virtually anything. 
You could establish almost any reason as a reason for another first nation's purpose. 
The Muskoday people have already designed a land code which I am familiar with. 
That is a much clearer, more focused definition. 
We certainly find it is much more agreeable.  
I will talk about this lack of consultation because I think it is so important. 
This has come about as a lack of consultation. 
The long term leases were between the department of Indian affairs and the lease holders. 
No notice was given to the leaseholders. 
They are not familiar with the clauses. 
They have not been told that this is coming. 
They have not been consulted. 
It is a flaw and it must be re-thought.  
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
Georgina Island will then truly be open for business.''  
These regimes will be harmonized with federal and provincial environmental regimes.  
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
They developed the framework agreement. 
We are talking about 13 bands and the 14th joined later. 
They voted on a framework and a land code. 
This is not a land claim we are talking about. 
We are talking about a land management act for 14 bands. 
This bill would devolve power. 
The land management will be the responsibility of the first nations. 
That is just not fair.  
It is a pretty broad coverage of our country.  
It has a lot of good points in it. 
It replaces the Indian Act for these 14 first nations. 
They will be able to develop or lease their land but they cannot sell it. 
They may expand through negotiation. 
They can acquire land for community purposes. 
The federal government retains the fiduciary responsibility for first nations. 
Another area of controversy is matrimonial breakdown. 
First nations people have different cultures. 
It has been explained to me that some are already doing it. 
The New Democratic Party supports Bill C-49. 
We hope to see it go forward very quickly.  
Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):
This bill was introduced in the House last June.  
The bill will ratify the changes brought on by a framework agreement. 
The 14th first nation was later added to the framework agreement.  
These provisions should allay their concerns. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The member for South Shore is once again proving just how wide awake he is. 
This would not allow first nations to develop rules according to their tradition of consensus.  
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
It is absolutely amazing that position would be taken.  
That is simply not the case. 
There is still great uncertainty in terms of consultation.  
They came to me to complain about it. 
I will read one of the petitions they sent today. 
Let us listen to what they say: 
We urge you to vote no to Bill C-49. 
We are status members of the Squamish Nation. 
I have an obligation to represent their interest in this place. 
People who have lived their entire lives on this land could have their homes expropriated.  
That is where it runs into the problem with the surrounding municipalities. 
A delegation of 18 members came to my office to meet with me. 
The lack of consultation being expressed is a serious concern that we need to address.  
I have encouraged the chief to be involved in more consultations in the community. 
They must get together, be proactive and take part in the process. 
I cannot change that for them. 
I urge members to listen to what I have said tonight. 
I have not talked about ideologies. 
We should listen to the words they are passing on.  
It cannot be done in isolation. 
It has to be done with co-operation and consultation.  
Let us put incentive in the bill to make it happen. 
I guess I have enough material here to speak for about 20 minutes. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
I have listened to the words of the Reform members regarding first nations issues. 
Their arguments have been misleading to say the least. 
They have been trying to exploit negative stereotypes about aboriginal people. 
They instantly assume the worst of the first nations. 
They assume that if first nations have power they will abuse it. 
This bill will give them the chance to do so. 
It makes perfect sense that they have different laws in certain areas. 
These kinds of relationships benefit everyone involved. 
The Opaskwayak Cree Nation is part of my riding and is signatory to this agreement. 
I could not have said it any better myself. 
The words gross disparity sum up the status of aboriginal people in Canada. 
Instead it has only made a few token gestures.  
It does not go nearly far enough.  
The few it has implemented are not enough. 
Aboriginal people are tired of this government's stonewalling. 
They are tired of half steps. 
The time for real action is now.  
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
This bill is a step forward. 
There are procedures in the bill regarding how this could occur. 
Provisions have also been included to address the concerns raised by native women. 
I know an earlier speaker brought up the situation of native women.  
The intent is really to change the bill in some way. 
There are ongoing processes. 
We need to respect the jurisdictional issues. 
We need respect the codes we have before us. 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not appreciate the name calling. 
I think it is very undeserved. 
I have nothing to apologize for in the work I have done.  
They were accountable for the dollars they were spending. 
They were accountable to the people who lived in and shared the community with them.  
It was a community that was leasing property. 
Some of these leases had been in their families for 40 to 50 years. 
I would like to share some of the comments with the members of the House. 
These are excerpts from letters received from a couple of families. 
How can you dismiss the fact that your department put us in this hell? 
They have not cashed cheques from persons remaining on the land to date. 
They refused to talk to us after 20 years of tenancy. 
They refused to quell the situation.  
People have lost their homes.  
With our neighbours we formed associations to negotiate a lease. 
We made an offer to lease. 
We did everything that we were capable of doing. 
If we did not agree we were out in nine days. 
We could not sign it. 
It would be like signing a blank cheque.  
That is the kind of situation these people were put in. 
I would suggest that there has to be clarity in legislation to protect individuals.  
We have recommended two amendments to Bill C-49. 
The second amendment would require that proactive consultations be held with adjacent municipalities.  
The Indian Act has proven to be a failure. 
They have lost their self-respect in many cases. 
It is a shame that we allowed that to happen.  
I do not want to be a part of continuing in that kind of environment. 
Somebody gave us the definition of insanity. 
It was doing the same thing over and over again, expecting a different result.  
That seems to me to be what we continue to do. 
We continue the same old policies over and over again. 
We may use different words, but we expect different results. 
It is insane to expect a different result.  
We have to release them. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise this evening to speak in this debate.  
However, the Liberal government refused those amendments.  
The concerns of the Lower Mainland Treaty Advisory Committee are: 
While this statement appears reasonable, it actually leaves two major concerns for municipalities: 
Regarding Parallel Process Concerns: 
Draft resolution from LMTAC meeting of January 27, 1999: 
It was moved and seconded 
Thank you for your careful consideration of our concerns.  
Mayor Don H. Bell 
This is a prime example. 
The government will not adopt those two amendments. 
The band is not doing poorly.  
We have negotiated shopping centres and buildings with them. 
We work very well together. 
The government should not go blindly into what its lawyers are telling it to do. 
That is the problem here. 
The people of British Columbia want these two amendments. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
I strongly encourage the government to listen.  
This paper makes a case for the amendments we have put forth in this group. 
It is time to listen. 
Bill C-49 contains two provisions which are particularly worrisome for native women. 
I encourage the government to listen to this part in particular. 
The paper goes on to state: 
It is well worth listening to because it is an important point. 
I will finish reading the paper: 
I see that my time is up. 
She has written a very thoughtful paper. 
I think she has presented the case in balance.  
Government members should listen to what they have heard tonight. 
The list is growing and growing.  
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, we have before us tonight a historic piece of legislation. 
It is with somewhat mixed emotions that I stand here tonight. 
They have grassroots support.  
We hear a lot about grassroots. 
This work has been going on for eight years. 
These people cannot wait any longer. 
It is appalling and it is shameful. 
They have a very positive, progressive, well founded relationship. 
The letter is dated December 2, 1998 and reads: 
All Canadians of good will and good intent see the necessity for the legislation. 
I urge the House to speedily pass the legislation. 
A few minutes ago I had a discussion with Chief Bill McCue. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
That is not the issue. 
How could that ever be the case?  
That includes my speech this evening. 
That is not the issue. 
I would ask him to withdraw those two words.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I would ask the member to kindly withdraw his remarks.  
In fact I do not think that is what our member said. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
We need to recognize what the legislation is attempting to do. 
It is to draw some very clear boundaries. 
Some people would call them fences. 
There is a proverb that says good fences make good neighbours. 
It is through those holes that we get some difficulties.  
They are hard working people. 
They do the kinds of things we want done in the country. 
The first nations of the country have a tremendous reason to be proud. 
In the face of tremendous opposition and difficulty they have maintained their culture. 
I recognize that and commend them for it. 
That is an issue we do not want to forget.  
There are some technical difficulties with the bill as well. 
I want to deal with them now. 
First I deal with the question of powers. 
Let me read subclause 21(3). 
It is a rather interesting clause: 
There is a separate set of observations. 
This is not to suggest that they would do this. 
That is what we are concerned about. 
That is a very significant issue.  
However, subclause 10(1) reads: 
In the first instance the council must have a land code. 
That land code must provide a consultation process. 
That is very interesting. 
It puts the power in the hands of the council utterly and completely.  
I do not want legislation to provide that kind of an opportunity. 
Motion No. 6 is a very clear motion. 
It does not say that there has to be agreement on everything. 
That is not provided for in the bill.  
We must provide for that kind of consultation and make it mandatory. 
We are trying to help them. 
Will they please listen.  
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we are all products of our history and our environment. 
We all view the world from our own vantage point. 
It is for sure that you learn more when you listen than when you talk.  
We are not here to advocate wishful thinking. 
This legislation is amendable. 
We could support it with amendments.  
That is what we are looking for. 
We are looking for clarity. 
This has nothing to do with race. 
We use the same tests. 
This has nothing to do with race, gender or any other circumstance. 
The purpose of this legislation is even getting lost in this debate. 
The implications are potentially quite far reaching.  
I spoke of my concerns and why the bill needed to be amended. 
That is the very thing we are talking about here today. 
They are subject to taxation without representation. 
Why is democracy being negotiated away?  
The way this government handles its aboriginal affairs is archaic. 
There is no vision. 
So why does the minister perpetuate reserves?  
We heard about the definition of insanity. 
That is your industrial base. 
This benefits nobody, native or non-native.  
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
That is the reason we object to this.  
Hopefully we can change that this time.  
The band councils have a responsibility to involve and include all aboriginals in the process. 
It is important to remember that I am referring only to a small number here.  
There are dangers and risks of that happening.  
We can understand their fears for granting chiefs additional power.  
Many believe this legislation will only concentrate that power further.  
Section 28 is not the only problem area. 
A communication network is essential outside the bands too. 
We could have homes placed in the path of pollution. 
I am sure we could think of many other examples. 
It is important to co-ordinate these efforts with the surrounding communities. 
We must remember that people who live together must work together too. 
How can lawmaking powers associated with criminal law be given to band councils? 
There are many, many questions that have to be asked about this bill.  
I support development on the reserves. 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
The Reform Party simply does not support self-government. 
I do not know how I could arrive at any other conclusion.  
I looked at one amendment and found it almost laughable. 
Motion No. 7 is one of the three we are debating today. 
That is the best the Reform Party can come up with.  
They do not support this kind of a deal for these first nations. 
I hear concerns about expropriation. 
I have looked at this. 
I have read through the document. 
I have read through the information in the bill. 
It is just not true. 
Members should not say things in this place that are not true. 
We all know that. 
We learn that the first day we come here.  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I wonder if it has changed for this debate or not.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
That is not true. 
That is what I said and that is what I say again.  
The hidden agenda might be Nisga'a. 
They are yelling so I am obviously making a point. 
I guess they are getting their knickers in a twist. 
The first nations put in place the land code. 
People understand the rules. 
Sounds reasonably democratic to me. 
I do not see that happening.  
My goodness that sounds radical. 
And they get elected presumably over a period of time on an ongoing basis. 
They represent their constituents.  
Not too long I hope.  
If the member wants to chirp she should sit in her seat. 
She is eating an apple. 
I am sorry, she is hungry.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
I will argue from the point of view of women on this bill. 
Yet this government still pushes ahead with this bill.  
Native women will bear the brunt of these legislative provisions which we are debating today. 
Can any member in the House argue that two wrongs make a right? 
I do not think so. 
I always enjoy listening to my constituents and representing them. 
Let me quote a letter that I received from one of my constituents. 
This is a frustrated constituent. 
What will this constituent do? 
He is living in Canada. 
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
Bills such as this one are not about self-government. 
They are about special rights for special people. 
He noted that non-native neighbours were ignored. 
Another aspect bothers me which I want to mention right off the top. 
It puts the whole issue into perspective. 
They said yes, that they were. 
He sat down to talk with these fellows and explain his unhappiness. 
He does not like that situation. 
We engaged them in negotiations. 
The native people were eager participants in this discussion.  
The negotiations went well. 
Somehow a sense of fairness was lost. 
They felt their rights were not being protected. 
When we get right down to it, that is what it is all about.  
Maybe I will come back to them. 
My friend across the way mentioned the Nisga'a treaty. 
How is that interpreted by the provincial government? 
I think this bill should be rejected on that basis alone.  
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
Our significant amendment reads as follows: 
That is very important. 
It has to do with consultation and accountability.  
Significantly, there is a problem with section 12 and I will refer to it. 
In section 12(1) on page 7 of the bill it states: 
Let us describe a typical situation in many bands. 
There are just general rules in the bill that appear completely open to manipulation.  
In British Columbia, municipalities are governed under the municipal act. 
It is a creature of the province. 
The provincial authority is the fallback power.  
Who mediates the powers of the band and other regular municipalities in a province? 
It is not very clear. 
The general intent of the bill is appropriate. 
That is a worry.  
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
I was there to debate what I got from the different points of view.  
There were many people in the audience who were most interested. 
Bill C-49 has some of those flaws. 
The issues are similar. 
Who is to be accountable? 
How are the band councils going to be elected? 
How are the band councils going to represent the individual people within their constituency?  
They cannot go to the band. 
They feel the band does not represent them. 
The issues are very much in the forefront in British Columbia at the moment.  
I have been on the school board. 
Many members have been aldermen or mayors dealing in municipal areas.  
Where do the bands report to? 
What is the hammer? 
Where is the next level people can go to? 
That is not explained in the bill.  
I touched on expropriation. 
The concern was non-natives. 
They have no recourse. 
That is not covered in this legislation.  
That is not spelled out in this legislation.  
There have to be checks and balances. 
This legislation does not have them. 
We need to know how the power is to be used. 
Again, that is not spelled out.  
The Reform Party has supported native legislation in this House on many occasions. 
However, this is not good legislation. 
We cannot and will not support bad legislation. 
We will not and cannot support Bill C-49 in its present form.  
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
I have intervened with the minister on several occasions. 
That was not the case at all. 
But it is not. 
I will give members another example. 
In the Westbank Indian band there are 514 natives. 
There are 7,000 non-natives living on that band's land. 
What happens to those people's rights? 
Why are those people's rights not considered in this piece of legislation? 
These people thought they were leasing land from the crown. 
That was never explained to those people. 
Now they have a situation where some of the retaining walls are crumbing. 
They are falling down because building codes were not followed. 
This piece of legislation is not going to help those people.  
There is no protection for those people whatsoever. 
Bill C-49 does not do anything to protect those folks. 
What do we tell them? 
Do they not deserve to have the protection of their federal government as well?  
The official opposition desires a better relationship with the Indian peoples of Canada. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
But nothing could be further from the truth.  
What is it that the Reform Party, the official opposition, is actually asking for here?  
A number of my colleagues have pointed that out. 
However the reality is that anything can be improved.  
What would our amendments to Bill C-49 do? 
They would require the Indian bands to consult with the municipalities. 
What is so terribly wrong with that? 
That is the question we must ask. 
The concerns being expressed this evening by the official opposition are very real. 
They are concerns about the expropriation powers contained in Bill C-49. 
The reality is that it could be done in an unfair manner.  
I do not see what is so terrible about that.  
On the east side of the divide the native bands are governed under treaty eight. 
In other words they are treaty Indians. 
On the west side there are no treaties. 
The band in my riding is McLeod Lake. 
It has tried for years and years to adhere to treaty eight. 
It wants to come under treaty eight. 
Yet we see this government continuing down that road of setting up more reserves. 
I have to question in all sincerity the wisdom in doing such a thing.  
As you can see, Mr. Speaker, it is now after 11 o'clock at night. 
I want to begin with a little story from my own riding. 
It has to do with our armoury. 
It is one of the oldest functioning armouries in Canada. 
There were serious problems with the roof. 
The foundation was in terrible shape. 
That has been the case for 90 years.  
They are managed by the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development.  
It is absolutely impossible and we know it. 
Yet, for generations that is the way these first nations have been managed. 
They are all very different. 
We can tell by their names that their languages are different.  
I am sure many members already knew that fact. 
That is one of these particular first nations.  
The proposal came to our minister from the first nations themselves. 
Chiefs came forward and suggested this approach.  
That is where we are. 
These 14 have decided to go this way.  
Some of this material has been used before. 
There has been some discussion of women on and off reserve. 
These are direct quotations from first nations leaders.  
I am glad to be here after 12 hours. 
I urge all members of the House to support this legislation. 
Let us end all these delay tactics and get on with it. 
Let us get on with it.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
This is not an inconsiderable step that is being put forward. 
There are federal-provincial consultations on a wide variety of areas. 
So this is not a novel concept. 
I have not heard it. 
Clearly speaker after speaker from the Reform Party has rejected that allegation. 
Let us look at the flip side of it. 
That is an equally ridiculous proposition.  
That is just the way civilized societies work. 
Should there be a consultation process in this bill or not? 
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I stand with great pleasure to close the debate this evening. 
They had an agreement. 
We did not say that.  
Mr. Speaker, that is not true. 
That was a breach of a promise. 
That is not true and the member knows it is not true.  
Why are they up in arms? 
It has set out the guidelines.  
In 1993 they asked to renegotiate the contract. 
They want to break the deal. 
That is not right. 
That is not proper. 
What do they want to do with their bill and their lands? 
We will stand here and represent these issues.  
They have set up a consultation process. 
They did not mention that today. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House adjourned at 11.30 p.m.)
