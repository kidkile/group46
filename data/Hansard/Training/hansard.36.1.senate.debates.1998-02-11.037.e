Business of the Senate 
Wednesday, February 11, 1998 
The Senate met at 1:30 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
As we know, there are 104 seats in the Senate of Canada. 
Currently, four are vacant. 
That is not the 60 per cent rate indicated by some journalists this morning. 
I thought I would set the record straight.  
Rogers Cablevision-Unjustified Raise in Service Charges 
Hon. Jean-Robert Gauthier :
As you can see, there have been improvements. 
Rogers loses absolutely nothing in the deal.  
Who is protecting the consumers?  
She will not interfere either. 
So whom can the consumer turn to for protection? 
Whom are we to contact?  
Privileges, Standing Rules and Orders 
Senator Andrew Thompson-Second Report of Committee Presented and Considered-Debate Adjourned 
Wednesday, February 11, 1998 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
Hon. Edward M. Lawson :
The constitutional experts say that this penalty is not achievable. 
That was the reporter's medical opinion.  
Honourable senators, no decision has been taken by the committee. 
We did not question the doctor's report. 
It was not a subject of discussion. 
I do not know of another senator who falls into the same category.  
Does that answer the questions?  
Is the answer contained in the doctor's letter?  
That has nothing to do with contempt.  
What is the basis of the contempt?  
That is what we are considering.  
That will take care of it.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
It is moved by the Honourable Senator Ghitter, seconded by the Honourable Senator Stratton: 
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion in amendment?  
Honourable senators, I should like to speak to the amendment, if I may. 
Section 18 of the Constitution Act, 1867, reads as follows.  
That is, a member of the House of Commons.  
...to run again and be re-elected.  
This is not a remedy to be used in a frivolous or a political manner. 
Until 1984 it seems his attendance was reasonable. 
It does not hurt to be in our communities. 
There is no perfect standard for attendance. 
That is not to say that this is a perfect institution with a perfect reputation. 
Indeed, it is not. 
Good for Prime Minister Chretien!  
Next, The Edmonton Journal in November: "Long Absences Bring Shame to the Senate."  
Being named to the Canadian Senate is a national honour. 
We seem destined to be burdened with this embarrassing institution for years to come.  
That gridlock, however, is no excuse for the senators themselves not to tighten their rules. 
They might even convince Canadians the institution is worth preserving.  
The Toronto Sun : "Adios," it says: 
He then speaks about the Senate, and he speaks of his disdain of the institution. 
He had few kind words about the Senate - 
"He" being Senator Thompson - 
- which he says is desperately in need of reform. 
"It could be so effective in helping people. 
It's like a morgue," 
So says Senator Thompson.  
On and on it goes. 
Honourable senators, I am sure, have all read it. 
It is what Main Street Canada is saying about the Senate. 
It is what we hear when we go home. 
Why are you not in Mexico?" 
What does Senator Thompson do? 
He is served with that document personally.  
Honourable senators, have we heard from Senator Thompson? 
Did he come yesterday? 
Have we seen a lawyer, a doctor, a letter, or anything? 
Will he say: "I did not know when the Senate would start. 
Of course it is not.  
What has our colleague Senator Thompson done to us? 
He could not care less about this place.  
We say, "Let us be fair; let us do all these things."  
I say enough is enough. 
I say it is time that we showed some guts in this place. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I must have clarification as to which one is correct.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I rise on a point of order. 
Perhaps the Clerk could clarify that.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Are there any other comments on the point of order raised by Senator Maheu?  
Honourable senators, I believe that the Honourable Senator Maheu's point is valid. 
To simplify the situation, is it agreed that we delete "or incidental expense allowance"?  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
There can be no questions to him, except with leave of the Senate. 
Is such leave granted?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I believe that his behaviour has been to the discredit to all of us. 
I do not think it was necessary. 
We keep referring to Senator Thompson's attendance. 
He is not absent. 
Honourable senators, I do not want to speak about the issue of contempt. 
I believe there may be a case for contempt. 
If you want to deal with Senator Thompson on the issue of contempt, do so. 
However, let us be governed by our own rules. 
That is the law. 
I am not making it up. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
There was then some side discussion. 
I thought that we had consent from the Senate to do so. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
If it is agreed, I will hear the question. 
Could he kindly repeat that? 
I do not want to start a debate on Louis Riel today. 
It is the legal precedent of the basis of the expulsion.  
There have been other cases. 
Beauchesne also quotes from the case of Fred Rose in 1946. 
Again, that one is somewhat different in fact. 
The House of Commons has the right to expel. 
I hope I have answered the question satisfactorily.  
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Honourable senators, this is an important question for all of us. 
Therefore, we should deal with it in transparent fairness.  
The question that I have for the Honourable Senator Ghitter is this:
Beauchesne's, Sixth Edition, page 17, states: 
As a precondition, there must be process and a specific allegation.  
The pertinent one is found at paragraph (4), which states: 
If he is attainted of Treason or convicted of Felony or of any infamous crime: 
I think we are caught here. 
I understand the feelings of all senators. 
We are caught between trying to do the appropriate thing and the right thing. 
That is my question.  
The Place of a Senator shall become vacant in any of the following Cases: 
If any of those cases occur, the seat becomes vacant. 
We have all those powers. 
However, our powers are broader than that.  
That is the argument. 
I cannot specifically say that I am right. 
I assume that the committee has done that. 
They have given him a short period of time to respond. 
We want to do the right thing for the right reason. 
Deal with the process question for me now. 
The process question can be established by this chamber in any manner it wishes. 
However, Senator Thompson has already thumbed his nose at us. 
He has already received the order of this place to appear. 
I was here yesterday. 
Hon. P. Derek Lewis :
What do you mean by "expelled"? 
Do you equate that with vacating his seat? 
It means that you are gone. 
What you are saying is that the seat be vacated?  
There might be some legal implications there.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, does that exhaust the questions? 
Are we ready to proceed with the debate?  
I am sorry to belabour this point, but it is important. 
That appears to be the remedy that the honourable senator is suggesting for this chamber. 
Essentially, he is saying that this chamber should decide what the definition of vacation is. 
Are we taking the Constitution into our hands? 
I think the Constitution is above us. 
This chamber has to do its work under the Constitution.  
I am not here to defend Senator Thompson. 
I am not sure that this is the right thing.  
Hon. Philippe Deane Gigantes :
I read section 18 of the act. 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
There is no reason for any of us in this chamber to feel diminished. 
We passed an order in this chamber on December 16. 
The Rules Committee met last evening for a considerable length of time. 
I understand that 18 of our members attended that meeting. 
I also understand that they formulated a unanimous report. 
I respect that decision. 
I was not present at that committee meeting. 
I did not participate in the debate. 
Honourable senators, I am not a lawyer, and I do not pretend to be. 
I do not think that what we are debating here is unimportant. 
It is critically important. 
I appreciate the position that the committee took with regard to this issue. 
He is thumbing his nose at them, in essence. 
He is saying, "You can't catch me." 
Canadians are fed up to the eyeballs with this kind of behaviour. 
We all know that he has a medical certificate. 
Let him come after us. 
That is what Canadians want, and that is what we should put on record. 
Let him come to us. 
That is absolute and total nonsense, as you know.  
We have discussed the appropriate thing and the right thing. 
If by next Wednesday he does not appear, what will you do then? 
Will we have another debate like this? 
Get it done now. 
I feel the way you do. 
I would prefer to throw him out today.  
You need only look down the way to Senator Gauthier. 
Look at what he is going through in order to come here.  
Jean-Robert Gauthier is an example to all of us. 
We cannot do that leaving some ambiguity. 
He has produced medical certificates from many doctors.  
It is our rule that he must send medical certificates. 
He has sent them. 
We have some doubts and we say, come and explain yourself. 
We have said that once, but we said it without specifying a date. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
The senator raises an interesting point. 
That will be for the Senate to decide.  
Whether today or a week from now, we must take that decision. 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
I have a question for Senator Gigantes. 
I am having the same problem of trying to come to the right conclusion here. 
You have pointed out the rights of Senator Thompson. 
You have said that we should do the right thing. 
He has a responsibility to be here.  
He has a responsibility to know what is going on here. 
He has a responsibility to do his duties correctly. 
He got a notice. 
He had a responsibility to come here. 
We have a responsibility to the people of Canada.  
Senator Andreychuk and I are on the same side. 
You talk about not bringing the system under disrepute. 
We have given the benefit of the doubt to Senator Thompson for too many years. 
He does not want him anywhere near. 
Honourable senators, I was at the Rules Committee meeting last night. 
That is not the issue. 
We are a court. 
We did not have an argument. 
We would give Senator Thompson an opportunity to answer soon. 
We know that we are dealing with some place in Mexico. 
This was done in the spirit of natural justice.  
It is not a question of our being sued. 
We will not be sued. 
You cannot sue Parliament. 
What are you talking about? 
The plain fact of the matter is that the man has certain rights. 
We must accept human nature.  
We could have just requested him to come. 
He has supplied a medical certificate. 
We have been into all of this background. 
There is a history to this situation. 
This is not something that has just arrived here today, or in the recent past.  
Senator Thompson is entitled to a full pension. 
If he cannot attend, he should take his pension, in my opinion. 
We can send the letter. 
I think that is reasonable. 
That seems to me to be a very reasonable resolution to the problem.  
None of us like the situation. 
Most of us are hard-working parliamentarians. 
We do not go in for this kind of thing. 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
I am sorry but the date was certain.  
It was a definite date: the day this House resumed sitting. 
That is not a valid argument.  
We do not give orders very often. 
Very seldom in fact. 
He chose to do none of this.  
He is therefore in contempt. 
Medical certificates no longer matter. 
All this stuff does not mean anything any more. 
It is very simple. 
The judge then has the power to impose a penalty. 
Today, we are dealing with a similar situation. 
We have various options, including a forced departure under section 18. 
Do not confuse it with other sections of the Constitution dealing with forced departures. 
Natural justice had until yesterday, at 2 p.m., to prevail.  
He was instructed to be here at 2 p.m, yesterday. 
He did not come. 
He is in contempt of this institution.  
Now, will we have the courage to go through with our decisions? 
It is almost impossible to do so. 
I think that was the point that the Honourable Senator Andreychuk was attempting to make. 
On the facts, the conclusion seems to be almost inexorable. 
Having said that, Senator Ghitter's proposition is very appealing. 
I would love to do that. 
Then we can get on with our business; we can clear our clogged veins.  
Unfortunately, honourable senators, it is not as easy as that. 
What happens to Ontario? 
Do we have one seat less? 
They would love to pick away at it. 
I disagree with that, but I hear it.  
My conscience says, yes, let us follow the committee's advice. 
I think the onus to explain is upon him beyond a reasonable doubt. 
Honourable senators, I believe in the Constitution, and I want to live under it. 
I do not want this chamber to be criticized for abusing the Constitution. 
We are clear on that now? 
Would the honourable senator explain it to us?  
Section 31 reads as follows: 
That is the factual question yet to be determined by the committee. 
We have heard that from other senators. 
That is proposition number 1.  
(2) If he takes an Oath...to a Foreign Power...  
That is not the case.  
(3) If he is adjudged Bankrupt or Insolvent...  
That is not the case.  
(5) If he ceases to be qualified in respect of Property or of Residence...  
Those appear to be the provisions under the act. 
As I say, I would like to follow this act.  
What if I told you to read section 18 of the same Constitution? 
As a chamber, we have the power to expel someone. 
It is not in question here. 
Section 18 is the basis of our right today.  
This is an important question. 
First, we must make a finding of contempt. 
I thought that was the course that the committee was moving towards. 
I think that is a material distinction.  
The honourable senator is a lawyer, and he knows the difference. 
The result is the same; the process is not. 
You have to agree on that.  
I should like Senator Beaudoin to give us his opinion.  
Hon. Edward M. Lawson :
I am asking for that advice now. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, the Speaker cannot become involved in legal decisions. 
I cannot get involved in that matter. 
That is for the Senate to decide, not the Speaker. 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, that is exactly what the committee was doing.  
Hon. Herbert O. Sparrow :
Honourable senators, I have a question for Senator Ghitter.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is there a seconder? 
This is a subamendment. 
We must be very precise.  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Your Honour, I have a point of order.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Today, we are faced with a resolution with amendments and subamendments. 
Why do you not get up and tell us what you think." 
The matter demands reflection.  
That would be more appropriate for senators.  
I am impressed with what Senator Grafstein and Senator Lewis have said. 
I understand the press. 
There is a major preoccupation with this issue, but we must deal with it. 
I am sure that all senators would like to reflect on this serious matter. 
That is what the Senate is all about. 
Hon. Peter A. Stollery :
The Hon. the Speaker :
A point of order was already raised by the Honourable Senator Prud'homme.  
However, he has made a suggestion. 
I do not quite understand what has happened. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Honourable Senator Lawson has his subamendment ready now. 
We will hear that first.  
Honourable senators, I move, seconded by Senator Lucier: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
That is not a valid subamendment in its present form.  
We will change the form, then!  
The Hon. the Speaker :
With the same seconder, then, I move: 
That the Law Clerk report his opinion to the Senate by tomorrow.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
It is moved by the Honourable Senator Lawson, seconded by the Honourable Senator Lucier: 
That the motion in amendment be amended by adding thereto: 
That the Law Clerk report his opinion to the Senate by tomorrow.  
Honourable senators, I have no objection to waiting for twenty-four hours. 
We are dealing here with a fundamental legal problem.  
I have no doubt that a legislative assembly may expel a member. 
This is what we call, in constitutional law, an inherent right. 
The situation has remained the same for many years. 
If a person is prepared to go to Mexico, why not to Ottawa?  
In that sense, perhaps we are discussing this matter for nothing. 
However, as a jurist, I would like to have an independent opinion. 
I may be wrong, but I am inclined to think that way. 
However, for the moment, that is my opinion.  
Honourable senators, I sat in the House of Commons for 30 years. 
We must be very precise. 
Before we vote, we will need to read the motion very carefully. 
We would be punishing him by saying that he is a nobody. 
I have a question for Senator Beaudoin.  
The action that we take should be that upon which we all agree. 
There are many other alternatives. 
We started to punish him. 
I believe that this debate needs to be conducted in an orderly manner. 
Haste, in this case, is not leading to good order. 
We are not answering to the mob. 
We may come up with a clearer solution.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
The 24 hours is not cast in stone. 
I have no problem with changing that aspect.  
Senator Beaudoin, I have listened to your speech and I have more questions. 
What would there be to prevent such a thing? 
I am no longer referring to expulsion for various lengths of time.  
If memory serves, he was re-elected. 
So that sorted out the problem.  
Once a senator is expelled, does the seat necessarily become vacant? 
I would like to hear an opinion on this as well. 
But obviously it can be challenged later.  
I will not take this any further. 
Obviously, this will set a precedent and cause an uproar. 
Does this prevent the exercise of an inherent right?  
I will not take it further for now. 
Hon. Philippe Deane Gigantes :
If there is no appeal, the Prime Minister could appoint someone else. 
That is the first question. 
The courts traditionally do not meddle in the internal affairs of Parliament. 
The court would decide. 
That is all I am saying.  
I am speaking of the inherent right you refer to. 
And with this inherent right, would the courts dare intervene?  
I think that, in a truly extraordinary case, the right to expel is inherent. 
Now, should we exercise that right? 
That is another matter. 
If they said so yesterday, that confirms what I am saying today.  
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
I have a question for Senator Beaudoin. 
I have looked briefly at an opinion which was available to the committee last night. 
I do not think we have the same inherent powers or remedies.  
The nice question that arose from that discussion dealt with the definition of infamous crime. 
I leave it for other finer minds to chew over in the foreseeable future.  
Otherwise, we have the same powers. 
We are a legislative house, as is the House of Commons.  
History shows that the House of Commons has expelled people. 
I am inclined to think that we also have such a right. 
I respect an opinion to the contrary, of course, because it is a difficult point. 
This subamendment presupposes to some degree the work that the committee was going to do. 
They wanted an order of this house to have him appear. 
The committee heard last night from the clerk. 
They also heard from other constitutional opinions. 
It was on that basis they prepared the report for today. 
They want to deal further with constitutional opinion on penalties.  
Now is not the appropriate time to do it.  
Hon. P. Michael Pitfield :
Let me simply put a few thoughts. 
This is a chamber of sober, second thought. 
I wish to speak for a moment simply of the procedure that we are following. 
I make no remarks with regard to the particular case. 
It seems to me that we are engaged in a rush to judgment. 
I have heard, "We must do it now." 
There have been some very serious doubts raised in this matter. 
We have heard doubts of facts that have been raised by Senator Lawson. 
We have heard doubts of equity that have been raised by Senator Grafstein. 
We are giving and we are asking for off-the-cuff legal opinions. 
I urge that we proceed calmly, deliberately, fairly. 
We wish to deal with this matter. 
It is coming to the close of a long afternoon. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Does any other honourable senator wish to speak?  
I see no takers. 
Perhaps we will know better next time. 
There is potentially another problem here. 
I put this to our friend Senator Ghitter. 
I simply say that by way of explanation. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I have a few brief remarks. 
We have had the situation with us now for many years. 
When asked, we were told that there was a medical certificate. 
Never would I challenge a medical certificate of one of our colleagues. 
That, however, seems to be highly unlikely. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Does he continue to be a senator? 
We are not clear on that.  
We had the motion of Senator Kenny. 
We had hoped Senator Thompson would show up yesterday. 
That committee met last night and brought in a unanimous report, which was presented today. 
Leave was given to consider the report today. 
The report proposed a process. 
I heard Senator Nolin ask if we have the courage. 
The process has been set in motion. 
That is why we have committees. 
The final judgment, however, is made in this place, where it should be made.  
Honourable senators, I am quite conscious of the remarks made by Senator Pitfield about fairness. 
Hon. C. William Doody :
Honourable senators, I have two questions of clarification. 
It has been a very troubling afternoon. 
I am more inclined, personally, to think favourably of Senator Pitfield's recommendation. 
That may not be possible.  
If this must be done, let it be done when we sit.  
I am a little uncomfortable with the idea of a Committee of the Whole. 
We have already referred this matter to a committee of the Senate. 
The committee has reported and given us a unanimous recommendation. 
How will we proceed tomorrow? 
Could someone help me with some of these problems?  
Perhaps I can make a point by asking Senator Doody a question. 
It is very important to remember that.  
I repeat that all of these things were done unanimously.  
Honourable senators, I am obviously completely adrift. 
Maybe I am remiss. 
Maybe the report from the committee was delivered to me earlier today. 
I have not seen it. 
With these uncertainties in mind, I am asking for guidance from the leadership. 
What we have before us now is the subamendment of Senator Lawson. 
However, we would have to have the approval of Senator Lawson's subamendment first.  
Honourable senators, what we want to know are two things that were raised by - 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, the Honourable Senator Lynch-Staunton has already spoken on this issue.  
Is leave granted for the honourable senator to speak again?  
It should be amended to reflect that.  
That is what we want to know. 
If we cannot expel him, can we suspend him? 
Second, can the Senate refuse his salary and his monthly tax-free allowance? 
That is what we want to know. 
We did not resume sitting today, we resumed yesterday. 
Therefore, he did not honour the order of the Senate. 
Why do we want to give him another week? 
Hon. Richard J. Stanbury :
Honourable senators, I am amazed at what the Leader of the Opposition is suggesting. 
The committee then reports to the Senate and the Senate deals with that report.  
That is what happened.  
We should get the order from the Senate. 
That would give us authority." 
I perfectly understand Senator Ghitter's motion. 
We are all frustrated and want to get it over with. 
We gave them two weeks in which to do it. 
For goodness sake, let us not mess this thing up any more. 
Let us pass the committee report. 
That means an order will go out immediately to Senator Thompson. 
It will be done properly and served properly. 
Honourable senators, I have a question for Senator Stanbury. 
Many of us are agonizing over this matter. 
My concern is simply that we are being seen once again to be dithering.  
Quit your dithering and get it done." 
I believe the public thinks the evidence is quite clear.  
We cannot afford to continue on forever like this.  
Then support the report and we can get going.  
That is great, except that you take the consequences.  
What was the job of the committee? 
We must do the thing properly, and that is what we decided on December 16. 
We wanted to do it properly. 
We set up the committee. 
Why are you jumping the gun and asking the committee not to do its job? 
Honourable senators, I do not think we should get bogged down here. 
The answer to each senator's question is in the draft report. 
Let me briefly go through them. 
Senator Pitfield says we should let the leaders have some time. 
I am confident that the chairman will come up with concrete recommendations.  
That is precisely what we have done in that recommendation. 
I am persuaded by what Senator Grafstein has said. 
My concern was for fairness and justice. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I am afraid that we are coming into a difficult situation. 
There are some serious technical problems in what we have before us. 
I know the Speaker should not interfere. 
That sounds like a good idea.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, this side would agree with that proposal.  
Honourable senators, how could I turn down such a pleasant invitation?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Do I have the agreement of both sides?  
Honourable senators, I will not be difficult. 
I am comfortable here, especially with my new seat partner. 
I know I will not be part of the consultation process. 
The Hon. the Speaker:
Honourable senators, I thank Senator Prud'homme. 
I try never to overlook any honourable senators. 
I ask that leaders on both sides meet in my chamber. 
The bells will ring at 4:30 to resume at 4:35. 
The sitting of the Senate was suspended.  
The sitting of the Senate was resumed.  
Leave having been given to revert to Government Notices of Motion: 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Will this be an in camera meeting or a public meeting?  
It will be an open meeting, as was last evening's.  
On the adjournment, is it to a specific time? 
I can give Senator Ghitter our commitment that there will be no extensions to that.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
It has nothing to do with the other motions that were before us. 
The honourable senator is referring to the other debate, which is adjourned.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
If we wish to debate it tomorrow, we can debate it tomorrow. 
If we do not wish to debate it tomorrow, we stand it. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Thank you for the clarification. 
I withdraw the amendment.  
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Honourable senators, where will this notice be sent? 
We have heard today about due process and fairness. 
We need an understanding of where this notice will be sent. 
Notice will be sent to his residence in Ontario. 
Motion to Further Direct Consideration of Rules Committee-Debate Suspended 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I further move: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I agree. 
...and to hear legal argument based on that debate.  
That is not enough. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, it will be difficult to get the wording exactly as you want it. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is that agreed, honourable senators?  
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
