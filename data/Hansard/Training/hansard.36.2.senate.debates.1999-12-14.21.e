Tuesday, December 14, 1999 
The Senate met at 2 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
The Late Honourable R. James Balfour, Q.C. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
He always regretted that fate intervened so brutally.  
To be wise is to have experience and knowledge and to judicially apply them. 
To his family, I offer my heartfelt sympathy.  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I mourn with other colleagues the loss of Senator Jim Balfour. 
Senator Balfour loved his family. 
We will miss Senator Balfour, his common sense and his vigour. 
I join with honourable senators in extending my deepest sympathy to his family.  
Honourable senators, Jim Balfour and I had been friends for 38 years. 
In 1994, Jane died after a prolonged and debilitating illness. 
In 1996, Jim received from his physicians his own deadly prognosis.  
He became a businessman and corporate director. 
He was a generous volunteer and then went into public life. 
He served seven years in the House of Commons and 20 years in the Senate.  
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Honourable senators, I wish to add my condolences to the family of Senator Balfour.  
In the profession, Jim Balfour had a quiet manner. 
With him, the two were synonymous.  
Senator Balfour was very influential in the city of Regina. 
His quiet hand, again, was on many of the community's services. 
Senator Balfour will be missed but his good works will live on. 
A few things always happen upon being appointed to the Senate. 
It is known to us in the political business as "Red Square." 
Every left winger in Saskatchewan is gathered in Regina. 
Jim Balfour did something that few Conservatives have been able to do. 
I did not know Jim that well, although I had heard of him. 
I admired his integrity and his honesty.  
I will miss that advice.  
He was always on the right side of the issues, and we will miss him. 
To his family, I extend our deepest condolences and sympathy.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators then stood in silent tribute.  
Cross Lake First Nation-High Rate of Suicide 
In addition, 100 other residents have attempted suicide in this five-month period. 
These statistics are horrendous and cannot be ignored.  
This story has additional alarming aspects. 
Honourable senators, this crisis must be addressed. 
However, that funding of $15,000 runs out soon. 
To all of these provinces, I say thank you.  
In tabling the legislation, Mr. MacKenzie said: 
As George Santayana wrote: 
Those who cannot remember history are doomed to repeat it.  
Ottawa-Winter Games 2000 
An estimated 600 parents and 1,200 volunteers will also come to support the athletes.  
This time, of course, it will be the winter events. 
He went on to found the Special Olympics. 
All of these are enhanced by the appreciation and support of an audience.  
You will be most impressed by the dedication and heroism of our athletes. 
The Special Olympics oath says it well. 
Let me win, but if I cannot win let me be brave in the attempt.  
Honourable senators, I hope to see you at the games.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Second Report of Standing Joint Committee Presented 
Tuesday, December 14, 1999 
The Standing Joint Committee on Official Languages has the honour to table its 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Civil International Space Station Agreement Implementation Bill 
Revised Report of Committee 
Hon. Peter A. Stollery :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Tuesday, December 14, 1999 
The Standing Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs has the honour to present its 
The Committee has two specific concerns that it wishes to see addressed. 
Second, Clause 11 (2.34) 
so as to alleviate the Committee's concerns.  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Nisga'a Final Agreement Bill 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
With leave, at the next sitting of the Senate.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Appropriation Bill No. 2, 1999-2000 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Recommendations of Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples Respecting Aboriginal Governance 
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Wednesday next, December 15, 1999, I will move: 
2. the mechanisms of implementing such new structural relationships; and 
Referendum Clarity Bill-Application of Terms 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Conversely, 50.4 per cent of Quebecers were opposed to that option.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
The bill makes reference to certain factors that are to be considered. 
Certain conditions will be reviewed in assessing the quality of the majority. 
However, the bill clearly provides for open consideration of all the factors. 
Honourable senators, am I a second-class citizen?  
Hopefully, that will never happen. 
However, that is not the point.  
Hon. Jean-Claude Rivest :
Using the later option, a sovereignist government would have declared Quebec's sovereignty. 
The current government bill addresses only the referendum approach. 
The bill is silent on this.  
They did not win, but that was their program.  
What the government is suggesting is simple and obvious. 
We have a responsibility take the Premier of Quebec at his word. 
Does he intend to act in other circumstances? 
What precisely is his objection?  
As I recall, the Premier of Quebec was high in his praise of the decision. 
I, for one, would hate to see the government abdicate that role.  
Honourable senators, Prime Minister Trudeau was very interested in the issue of Canadian unity. 
The decision was not available to us previously; it is available now. 
In its decision, the Supreme Court laid out some very clear criteria. 
Essentially, the government is insisting on two simple but fundamental points. 
Honourable senators, I have a supplementary question. 
We do not need Mr. Dion's bill.  
That is a different argument, honourable senators. 
What this legislation shows is that there are responsibilities on both sides. 
The Government of Canada has clearly embraced its responsibility here. 
Terminology Regarding Decision on Referendum Reference 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, I should like to know when we are going to get those helicopters. 
However, I thought the minister might be a bit more conversant with the following question.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
They determine the priorities then meet with the federal government to request financing. 
In fact, special provision might be made. 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Nothing has changed in the last two years. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I thank the leader for that.  
Could the Leader of the Government report back on two other things? 
Honourable senators, I would be more than happy to include those additional requests for information.  
Possible Regulations Regarding Addition of Caffeine to Beverages 
I should like to ask a couple of them.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I thank the honourable senator for that question. 
Request for Study of Effects of Caffeine 
They say they are left with two choices. 
I would suggest there is a third. 
They can have Statistics Canada generate the baseline data.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Yes, to generate that baseline data.  
I will pass along the honourable senator's request.  
Delay in Release of Scientific Report 
Now we are letting loose caffeine upon them. 
Caffeine is a psychoactive drug, and it should be labelled as a drug.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I cannot let that comment go by. 
We are not passing legislation. 
There are many other things like that. 
Do not confuse the two.  
I take the honourable senator's point. 
I just mention, though, that there is a balance to be struck.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Coast Guard-Provision of Cruises to Premiers 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Delayed Answers to Oral Questions 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Purchase of Major Companies by United States Firms- Government Policy 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Donald H. Oliver on Novembee 24, 1999) 
Elections Canada shares this commitment.  
He concurred with the results of the audit. 
(Response to question raised by Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk on December 6, 1999) 
Status of Holocaust Memorial Museum 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Colin Kenny on December 8, 1999) 
However, a time frame for theses consultations has not been established.  
Civil International Space Station Agreement Implementation Bill 
Third Reading-Debate Suspended 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Thus, all could not fail but support the underlying principle of the bill. 
I, too, support the principle of the bill. 
Sometimes, however, God or the devil lurks in the detail. 
Capital punishment was abolished by Canada almost three decades ago. 
After a full debate, those amendments were defeated in the Senate. 
A Canadian is charged with murder in the space station. 
A European is also charged with murder in the space station. 
Why the abstention rather than another amendment? 
Clarity from the Supreme Court should be available shortly. 
The proposed new subsection of the Criminal Code, subsection (2.31), 
reads in part as follows: 
Consequently, the other 14 contracting states will have similar provisions under their penal law. 
The statement made by Mr. Roy was: 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
I would beg the indulgence of honourable senators. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators that leave be granted to proceed to Inquiry No. 1?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I am sorry, Honourable Senator Andreychuk, leave has been granted.  
I would seek instruction.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is the honourable senator raising a point of order?  
Notwithstanding that, I intend to yield so that we may accommodate Senator Gauthier.  
I find myself dealing with this conundrum every Tuesday and Wednesday.  
Honourable senators, I do not think that the chamber can help Senator Andreychuk. 
It is her choice. 
Hon. Jean-Robert Gauthier :
I will adjourn the debate in my name and deal with it tomorrow.  
I would prefer that we deal with it today.  
Presently, the law is clear. 
I have not changed my opinion on that issue.  
We are making Canadian criminal law and extending it to the space station. 
We must be very clear. 
I was pleased that the committee took my concerns under advisement. 
I thank the committee for that. 
I will support this legislation.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
That inquiry was called. 
Does any other honourable senator wish to speak?  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted to proceed to Inquiries?  
Leave having been given to proceed to Inquiries: 
Hon. Jean-Robert Gauthier rose pursuant to notice of Wednesday, October 13, 1999: 
I am on side with such a position. 
On motion of Senator Kinsella, debate adjourned.  
Civil International Space Station Agreement Implementation Bill 
Leave having been given to revert to Government Business, Order No. 1: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Peter A. Stollery :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Let me quote some of the great, and now humorous, testaments of years ago.  
Alexander Graham Bell once said: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.  
Income Tax Conventions Implementation Bill, 1999 
Third Reading-Debate Adjourned 
Allow me to set the bill in context.  
Without a tax convention, both countries could tax this income.  
I will give some clarifications, if I may. 
Uzbekistan is one of the world's biggest gold producing countries. 
I will address two other points before I close. 
Canada currently has tax conventions with 67 countries. 
Honourable senators, I urge you to give quick passage to this legislation.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
I believe we are the only two senators who wish to speak.  
On motion of Senator Kinsella, for Senator Andreychuk, debate adjourned.  
Speech from the Throne 
Motion for Address in Reply Adopted 
8th day of resuming debate ). 
I have only one thing to say with respect to that:
The PMO's summary of the Throne Speech stated: 
We have put the debt-to-GDP ratio on a permanent downward track.  
They have played fast and loose with the truth. 
What are the facts? 
How did they do this? 
The Auditor General objected to this practice but the government did not care. 
They needed a certain figure for their own political propaganda purposes. 
Why would they not? 
They get high marks in spinning a story. 
I suppose, if you are a Liberal, this is terrific. 
It suits their purpose to perpetuate this myth. 
I intend to do just that: set the record straight.  
The situation the new Progressive Conservative government inherited in 1984 was bleak. 
We were determined to take this on. 
We believed that we owed it to Canadians who elected our new government. 
As a university study noted: 
The long term consequences - 
- of the Trudeau economic policies - 
Even the infamous Red Book conceded that. 
What are the facts? 
- government came to office.  
The Foreign Investment Review Agency, which drove away foreign capital, was abolished. 
The opposition, especially from the Liberals, was brutal. 
Mr. Mulroney was personally demonized and our patriotism was questioned. 
It is now clear that we chose the right course for Canada. 
Who but the Liberals could embrace these policies while keeping a straight face? 
As the Business Council on National Issues noted: 
Export performance has been the brightest star in the Canadian galaxy.  
It is fair to say, without equivocation, that free trade is an outstanding success.  
Who can ever forget the shenanigans here in this chamber? 
Canadians went to the polls in great numbers, believing this to be the case. 
Six years later, it is still there. 
The answer is obvious. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, may I have leave to continue?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
All these courageous policies have two common characteristics. 
Most important, honourable senators, attitudes have changed. 
What was their conclusion? 
I quote directly from their study.  
Jean Chretien and Paul Martin have already ordered their halos.  
Perhaps Mr. Chretien was having another of his famous chats with the homeless. 
Of course, he inherited no such thing. 
The groundwork had been laid for a strong export-driven recovery. 
They were unpopular but necessary.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Richard H. Kroft :
It has been a debate in the best traditions of this place.  
In my address, I observed the following: 
Speech from the Throne 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Does the mover wish to withdraw the amendment?  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Honourable Senator Kinsella has requested that his amendment be withdrawn. 
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Honourable Senator Hays has requested that his motion be withdrawn. 
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
Public Service Whistle-blowing Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
I commend this publication to honourable senators for reading. 
As indicated at page 54 of the Tait report, an ethics regime: 
Further, at page 55, we find the Tait report observing: 
The bill is built on a framework of four pillars. 
The second pillar speaks to the cross-service and public interest need. 
The fourth pillar of the bill is protection for the whistle-blower. 
Thus, there are in Bill S-13 anti-retaliation provisions.  
The second "P" is for process. 
Finally, the third "P" is for protection. 
Honourable senators will find the framework of the bill to be straightforward and clear. 
The public service itself has been working in this area of ethics and values. 
We should be proud of the Public Service of Canada.  
It is in the public interest that we have no improper activity. 
Sometimes cases are frivolous or vexatious. 
This is not a top-down kind of model. 
Finally, it was necessary to provide for protection of the statutory requirement for confidentiality. 
Honourable senators, those are the principles of the bill. 
That is the framework it encompasses. 
I invite my colleagues to participate in this debate.  
On motion of Senator Finestone, debate adjourned.  
Second Reading-Motion in Amendment- Speaker's Ruling 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, if it is agreeable, I am prepared to proceed with my ruling now. 
The Hon. the Speaker:
Shortly thereafter, Senator Lynch-Staunton rose on a point of order to challenge the amendment. 
One, of course, has to do with the matter of the Royal Prerogative. 
I will begin with the second element first.  
The amendment that Senator Cools proposes on December 1 reads as follows: 
This, however, does not settle the matter entirely. 
However, the report was never adopted by the Senate.  
This then seems to be an accepted departure from what occurs in Westminster.  
The question is what to do in the present circumstances. 
On motion of Senator Poulin, debate adjourned.  
Parliament of Canada Act 
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
I congratulate Senator Grafstein for bringing the matter before us. 
In recent years, the ceremonial duties of the position have largely been eliminated. 
I hope that we can do better than that, Senator Grafstein.  
Sir Paul McCartney - yes, of the Beatles - was one name mentioned in that context.  
She told The Guardian : 
No self-respecting poet should have to. 
There are so many more interesting things to do with the job.  
I think it would be a step in the right direction. 
The committee might wish to examine that proposition. 
This is the route that the Americans have successfully chosen.  
He said he particularly wanted to promote poetry in schools. 
...a poet of quiet understanding, gentle humanity and lyric force. 
The appointment is for a one-year term but is renewable.  
The Americans, for example, call their laureate the "Poet Consultant to the Library of Congress." 
The committee would also need to consider the nature of the proposed selection committee. 
It may be helpful to have a poet on the committee. 
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
Perhaps Senator Hays would like to adjourn the debate.  
On motion of Senator Hays, debate adjourned.  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
I am sure they already have done so. 
In 1986 and 1987, two separate boatloads of people came to Canada. 
The first contained Tamils, who landed in Nova Scotia in 1986. 
I say we must find a way to make it work. 
The government did nothing. 
It did not act to deter this behaviour, unfortunately.  
The sovereignty of our nation basically lies in our ability to control our borders.  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I move the adjournment of the debate.  
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
The motion stands in the name of Senator Ghitter. 
I do not know if Senator St. Germain was speaking on behalf of Senator Ghitter. 
I suppose they talked with each other. 
Was the honourable senator reading Senator Ghitter's speech? 
Is that what happened?  
Honourable senators, not at all. 
I was speaking on my own behalf. 
I discussed with Senator Ghitter that I would be speaking to this matter. 
I took this opportunity to do so. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Therefore, the situation is quite in order. 
Senator St. Germain had the authority of Senator Ghitter to proceed in this manner.  
On motion of Senator Hays, debate adjourned.  
I believe we can be proud of the work we have accomplished.  
Our report is balanced and reflects what the witnesses told us. 
The committee hopes the Canadian airline industry will flourish. 
Special attention should be given to seniority lists.  
Honourable senators, I believe this is a good report. 
Members of the committee had heated debates about a number of issues. 
They made this report possible.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
It is hardly an accurate title. 
That is exactly what happened as the committee continued with its work. 
She did an excellent job, and I congratulate her for it.  
I refer here, of course, to the Competition Bureau of Canada. 
We must ask ourselves why it acted in this way. 
The response must be:
We just simply do not know. 
What was the extraordinary disruption of the national transportation system that was imminent? 
What evidence did the minister have? 
We do not know. 
Honourable senators, we could have stopped there. 
The public interest must be protected, but not through the return to a regulatory environment. 
In the time available to the committee, it did a credible job. 
Here, I am talking about competition.  
Canada is a vast country. 
Some parts are only reachable by air at certain times of the year. 
It is sufficient to say that it was void of policy. 
I thank you for your attention. 
On motion of Senator Forrestall, for Senator Johnson, debate adjourned.  
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration 
Second Report of Committee Adopted 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Honourable senators, I move the adoption of the report.  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
The Estimates, 1999-2000 
National Finance Committee Authorized to Study Estimates 
That the Committee present its report no later than March 31, 2000, 
"with the exception of Fisheries and Oceans Votes 1, 5 and 10; 
That the Committee report no later than March 31, 2000.".-( 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, Senator Murray is not in the chamber. 
This order deals with his motion and the amendments moved by Senator Robichaud. 
We are, however, in a position to deal with this matter now. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
We can proceed now .  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
I am not quite sure what that means. 
Is there a request to withdraw the motion in amendment?  
Motion in Amendment Withdrawn 
I am aware of the issue.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Senator Murray is not present.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Motion in amendment withdrawn.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, we are now back to the motion by Senator Murray. 
I am prepared to hear from Senator Bolduc.  
But the mandate should not read "with the exception of". 
The Standing Committee on National Finance does not necessarily examine all programs. 
This is what Senator Murray would have argued. 
There has been a long-standing tradition. 
There is much wisdom in it.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I move that the debate be adjourned.  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I think it is in order to put the question. 
In saying that, I listened to Senator Bolduc. 
As to the future, it may be a little more difficult.  
We should proceed with the question.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Canada-Europe Parliamentary Association 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein rose pursuant to notice of November 30, 1999: 
What is the work of foreign policy? 
Yet, war predominated foreign policy.  
This century started with such high hopes. 
The race for military supremacy was on. 
In 1917, the Russian Revolution erupted. 
The League of Nations, with Canada's help, faltered and floundered. 
We remember the Holocaust. 
It remains beyond our imagination. 
We recall the horror of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  
The 1940s became the first host of endless Middle East wars. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Senator Grafstein, I regret to interrupt you, but it is now six o'clock. 
What is the wish of honourable senators?  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
I move that Your Honour not see the clock.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
The 1970s continued with at least 37 war-like clashes around the globe.  
Honourable senators, this awesome catalogue of perpetual wars is not exhaustive. 
However, there was hope - the USSR empire disintegrated.  
Where were we before the war? 
What did we do between the wars? 
What did we do during the Vietnam War, and so on?  
Our literature became obsessed with actions and reactions to wars. 
What then, honourable senators, are we to do? 
What can we do? 
Has the human condition advanced in this century? 
Tolstoy gave some early guidance. 
Imitation is the best compliment. 
What a shameful history. 
That is the one miserable and paradoxical lesson of the 20th century.  
These were auspicious setbacks to world peace in the 1990s. 
We are told God knew where Adam was. 
Where is your place in history? 
What have you done with your life? 
These questions each of us can only answer in our own way.  
May the next generation improve on our work. 
The threshold from this century is certainly not very high.  
Is there not a surreal paradox in what I have advocated? 
Last Sunday, Joseph Heller, the American author of Catch-22 , died. 
Honourable senators, let me quote ever so briefly from the book Catch-22 : 
"You mean there's a catch?"  
"Sure there's a catch," Doc replied. 
Anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn't really crazy."  
Orr was crazy and could be grounded. 
"That's some catch, that Catch-22," he observed. 
"It's the best there is," Doc agreed.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Poulin , having given notice on Thursday, December 9, 1999: 
On Thursday, December 9, I tabled a notice of inquiry. 
What message are we sending to the Canadians everywhere in the country? 
What respect are we showing for the Canadian Constitution? 
Honourable senators, lend Senator Gauthier your ears. 
Hon. Jean-Robert Gauthier :
This is a rather touchy and, to be frank, frustrating subject. 
One of these proposed that the new amalgamated City of Ottawa should be institutionally bilingual. 
He justifies his recommendation by stating: 
Over 15 per cent of the new City of Ottawa will be francophone. 
We know that our nation has two official languages. 
Quoting Mr. Shortliffe again: 
The courts may use them to clarify the issue. 
I am not a lawyer, but I am convinced that there will be problems. 
Provincial legislatures have the power to pass legislation concerning municipalities. 
The court ruled, and I quote: 
The National Post explored this view. 
The government indicated its unconditional support for such an appeal.  
It would certainly have the effect of making the issue better known. 
It is making recommendations to us just about every day to lower taxes. 
It might choose not to, or it might go back on its decision later on. 
Mr. Shortliffe's report is carefully drafted and structured. 
The Government of Ontario should implement this important recommendation.  
In conclusion, honourable senators, I insist that the City of Ottawa is unique. 
It is the national capital of an officially bilingual country. 
It has a rich francophone history and culture and it has a significant francophone minority.  
The future belongs to those who fight. 
Such is the motto of Le Droit, our French daily newspaper in Ontario. 
That is exactly what we will do.  
Ottawa is like no other city. 
It is the capital of Canada. 
We recently had an example with the Montfort Hospital. 
The court added and I quote: 
That is at page 6 of the judgment.  
That is at page 7 of the judgment.  
Institutions are also important symbols for the Franco-Ontarian community. 
That is at page 7 of the judgment.  
The French language is the key cultural component of the Franco-Ontarian community.  
That is at page 8 of the judgment.  
In the past, mayors of Ottawa did understand this issue.  
The decision of the Ontario government is inconsistent with the spirit of our Constitution. 
...are not simply "descriptive" of rights. 
They infuse our Constitution and breathe life into it. 
The Supreme Court said that Canada is a constitutional democracy. 
That is found at page 8 of the judgment.  
That is at page 20 of the judgment.  
Honourable senators, we must draw the conclusions which are obvious.  
That is at page 23 of the judgment.  
These two legal actions were well received by the courts of Canada.  
The Ontario government has decided to appeal the decision concerning the Montfort Hospital. 
It saw fit to challenge the legitimacy of that decision. 
Therefore, I invite Senator Marie-P. 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Honourable senators, I should like to ask some questions of the Honourable Senator Joyal.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, it is getting late and there are those who have obligations. 
This is an important issue. 
We have heard from three francophone senators on the matter. 
I have a comment and a question for the honourable senator.  
I make that comment as a senator from Metro Toronto.  
Thus, there would be no question that the geographical territory would be totally bilingual. 
If it were used, it would be under exceptional circumstances. 
I see Senator Lynch-Staunton sitting on the other side of the chamber. 
They want to merge services. 
On motion of Senator Fraser, debate adjourned.  
Motion to Uphold Royal Assent Proceedings- Motion Stands 
On Motion No. 43: 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I rise on a point of order. 
I suggest that the rule of anticipation should be invoked here. 
One conflicts with the other. 
The rule of anticipation, as stated in Beauchesne's 6th edition, paragraph 512(1), states: 
I would also draw your attention to paragraph 512(2).  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, Senator Cools is not in the chamber. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, there is no motion before the chamber at this point. 
We have a notice of motion which was given by the Honourable Senator Cools. 
Therefore, there is nothing on which I can rule.  
At that point, I will be pleased to entertain a question concerning the rules.  
The Senate adjourned until Wednesday, December 15, 1999, at 1:30 p.m.
