ANTI-PERSONNEL MINES CONVENTION IMPLEMENTATION ACT 
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan 
EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 36 
Monday, November 24, 1997 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
That is why I have introduced the bill. 
That would be democracy.  
All appeals are to be conducted in a timely fashion. 
The sentence, if upheld, is to be carried out within a reasonable period of time. 
The death penalty is to be carried out by lethal injection. 
This is a more humane method of execution than hanging or electrocution. 
The death penalty should be reinstated for many reasons. 
First and foremost is that the state must protect society. 
In this debate we cannot forget the inevitable release of murderers. 
It is clear that our so-called rehabilitation programs are not working.  
He escaped, only to murder four more law-abiding innocent Canadians.  
This is not something any Canadian is proud of. 
We now have much improved DNA technology. 
If their trials had been held today they would have never been convicted. 
In 1996 the homicide rate was 2.11 per 100,000. 
Whether we measure it from 1966 or 1975 it is still far too many.  
Another statistic is much more relevant to the debate today. 
No act of vengeance can undo the harm done. 
The death penalty is not about vengeance. 
It is the role of the state to mete out justice.  
Capital punishment is about public safety. 
His request was denied by the court.  
Some of these people object to the death penalty strictly on moral grounds. 
According to our laws, taking a human life is wrong. 
Some Canadians agree with this while others do not.  
Let me bring another murder case to the attention of the House today. 
That is not right.  
There is no way to bring the victim back. 
Do you want to take the chance with your children and grandchildren? 
Deterrence is not the issue. 
Sixty-three per cent of Canadians want the death penalty reinstated. 
Democracy denied as usual.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House to move the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
I would like first to address the issue of reinstatement of the death penalty.  
The question as I said earlier was debated at length. 
There was a free vote in this House. 
Some people push the agenda all the time.  
Why are we asked to debate the reinstatement of capital punishment at this time? 
In fact the rate for 1996 is the third lowest rate since 1975. 
For 1996 the rate is 2.1.  
I want to be clear. 
This decrease hardly supports the deterrent element of capital punishment. 
Capital punishment is final. 
On practical grounds, these are reasons I personally oppose the death penalty. 
If convicted of murder in adult court, the minimum sentence is life imprisonment.  
Since our government changed this law after December 1, 1995, the following provisions apply.  
Maybe one of my colleagues will finish this.  
It has only been two years since we have changed these rules. 
We have a justice committee looking at it. 
We take this seriously. 
In my submission, capital punishment plays no part in our just society.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
The mover says it is about safety. 
The purpose of prison is safety. 
Don't count on it.  
The hon. mover says that it has never happened. 
We now know there is no rationale for the piece of legislation. 
It would be Reform justice, I suppose. 
In many states in America, our neighbours to the south, there is capital punishment.  
The bill makes provision for a mandatory appeal. 
It is a very American piece of legislation. 
It is a fight for someone's life. 
I think we have to look at the reality of this. 
Since I have one minute left, I will try to wrap up. 
And my friend says that this is not couched in vengeance. 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, on a point of order. 
This bill is not a Reform bill. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Indeed, this is a private member's bill. 
Some of us are capable of making that distinction.  
It will be recalled that there was a debate in this House. 
I would remind the hon. member that the bill in question was C-261. 
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, on a point of order. 
It was not a Reform bill. 
So he needs to get his facts right. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Things are not going well. 
There are another four or five who may do the same.  
They wanted to amend it. 
A compromise was reached, because they abolished capital punishment. 
You have to understand that people, that a society, that a country can change. 
Maybe not the Reform Party, but everyone else. 
However, we improved it over the years. 
I would like to read to you some of the objectives we have here. 
Why did we go from capital punishment to the system we have today? 
He should think about the objectives to be achieved by imposing a sentence. 
But the sentence should also consider the actual or potential rehabilitation of the offender. 
No one in this House is infallible either. 
For these additional reasons, I am opposed to the hon. member's bill.  
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I have listened with interest to the debate this morning. 
That is one thing which has not changed with time.  
We have to do something to bring those two positions more closely together.  
There would be extensive public debate. 
Everybody would have the opportunity to put forward their point of view. 
That is a lot of rubbish. 
Certainly they revisit issues but the timeframe tends to be a lot longer. 
The fact is that a referendum is a very good tool for getting public opinion. 
There is a decent length of time to discuss the issue.  
It would not be automatic. 
It would be a recommendation of the jury. 
This suggestion was given to me by one of my constituents. 
If we are ever faced with this situation we may get into that dialogue. 
It is important to remember that.  
There was a program on television about this recently. 
There is a desire in society to get control of these criminal elements. 
I have been in Canada since 1979. 
In Vancouver graffiti was almost unknown then. 
They want to see us return capital punishment to the law books. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
What happened to him?  
What happened to him? 
Obviously some of them are released because they are repeat offenders.  
It is not supposed to be along party lines. 
I notice that I have but one minute left. 
It is such a short period of time to debate such an important issue. 
Speakers from all parties said likewise. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
ANTI-PERSONNEL MINES CONVENTION IMPLEMENTATION ACT 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Does the hon. member have unanimous consent of the House to move the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
This, to me, says much about the Parliament of Canada. 
It will not just be the signature but the actual ratification. 
This movement has an interesting history. 
It is no longer just governments that make decisions. 
The normal corridors of disarmament discussion were becoming cul-de-sacs. 
They were closed off to any meaningful approval. 
It was just not the way things were done.  
Members have also played their own part in mobilizing that effort. 
In some cases the onus has clearly moved on to parliamentary systems around the world. 
It is now clearly within parliaments that ratification must take place.  
It is not simply the fact of the treaty. 
Only about a week before I arrived, a young Austrian soldier lost his leg. 
That will not happen overnight.  
I am not expecting miracles. 
They will be part of the discussions.  
I will give one example that struck me as absolutely astounding. 
Think of what it must mean if that is the problem that France has. 
Bill C-22 does several important things.  
It requires the destruction of all anti-personnel mines, except for training purposes. 
The legislation proposed was prepared in a short timeframe. 
The bill and the convention differ slightly in some respects. 
We can set a real example by being the first to ratify. 
The process can begin here in this Chamber. 
These are the words they used: 
children have the right to know where land mines are located 
children have the right to be in a land mine free area 
children have the right to be supervised 
children have the right to play and not get hurt 
c. Children have the right to go to school, even if they are hurt 
It demonstrates that this generation believes that Canada can make a difference.  
I recommend Bill C-22 to members of the House. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Reform has supported this process from the word ``go''. 
These are not just words. 
At that time Mozambique was one of the worst countries in the world. 
It was a nation racked by civil war and it was heavily mined.  
The hospital was 20 kilometres from the border. 
Tragically, some of them had their legs blown off.  
I remember this very vividly.  
He had shrapnel injuries in his groin and lower abdomen. 
He was very conscious of what was going on.  
We took three hours to amputate his leg above the knee. 
Many people have their legs blown off at the hip.  
Some are designed like butterflies. 
They are a constant economic drain to society. 
They are not soldiers. 
Land mines are primarily designed to address and terrorize innocent civilians. 
They are a weapon of terror. 
They are not, generally speaking, a weapon used by military.  
Mines also were used by guerrillas. 
They are supposed to be used for military purposes. 
The Americans tried to water this treaty down. 
That is something that we as Canadians can be very proud of.  
There are over 30,000 seeded all over the world. 
They inflict damages in various countries that are absolutely horrendous. 
It goes beyond that. 
Land mines sit in the ground for over 50 years. 
The most land mined country in the world is Egypt. 
Those costs are enormous. 
This cost will not be borne by the countries that are mined. 
We as nations do not have the money to do this. 
There a few interesting things we can learn from this. 
Instead we did not settle for second best. 
Therefore we have a treaty which has teeth for a change. 
We also set a deadline. 
It is something that we as Reformers can heartily support.  
Our defence budgets also incur great costs.  
As a result we also put our soldiers in harm's way. 
Their son was tragically blown up in the former Yugoslavia by a land mine. 
They have worked very hard to bring this issue to the forefront. 
This is a cost that we all bear.  
We must not let this process die. 
From 1945 to 1985 the international community has lurched from one conflict to another. 
We have watched the precursors to conflict exist right in front of our eyes. 
That world has changed. 
Between 1985 and now we have had over 26 peacekeeping operations.  
We have not met those challenges. 
In fact, we have failed abysmally.  
This is a penalty we will all pay. 
This is where the Ottawa process can come into play. 
All these things are witnessed by NGOs. 
Those who live far away have paid a far greater price. 
We have to change this thinking.  
They exist on demonizing the small differences that exist between different ethnic groups. 
It can be broken. 
Once the precursors are identified, positive propaganda can be put in there. 
Furthermore a tool that is not being used often is the tool of economics. 
Many of these countries rely on international financial institutions in order to survive. 
You cannot run a war without money. 
Therefore, if this is occurring, choke off the money supply.  
The IFIs can be used not only as a stick but also as a carrot. 
The IFIs could also be used as a carrot. 
The world has changed. 
The world is looking for a new group of individuals to bring nation states together. 
Many of these nations are working in isolation on peace building initiatives. 
Canada can be that country. 
We have the diplomatic skills. 
We are in an enviable position to do that.  
I spoke to members of other countries, such as the Norwegians. 
I was interested to learn about their work. 
It is unfortunate that we are working in isolation. 
There will be a lot of co-operation and like-mindedness if we pursue that.  
We could then address the security issues that affect us all. 
All will require international co-operation.  
The Ottawa process did not start with 100 countries all wanting to ban land mines. 
We can no longer afford to see the proliferation of this destruction. 
It is imperative that we deal with it now. 
I hope we can apply that principle to foreign policy.  
Well these are more than nice words. 
There are pragmatic solutions.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
[ English ] <``My factories may make an end of war sooner than your congresses. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
It was interesting listening to the hon. member from Vancouver Island. 
Of course what I am speaking about are nuclear weapons.  
They need to become a majority in government circles and in international circles. 
It was held at the National Conference Centre. 
At that time we were still dreaming of what is now unfolding.  
I will repeat the point I made that day. 
The NDP has been supportive of the initiative from the beginning. 
A very important thing is happening out there which the minister has acknowledged.  
I say almost exclusive because obviously it was not exclusive. 
There were other things going on like this.  
We urge the minister to find the resources necessary. 
This is a good day for parliament and a good day for Canada. 
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I have listened to the debate today in the House. 
I had the distinct privilege to go with the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
I listened to what my hon. colleague had to say. 
How would the hon. member look at that issue?  
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her question.  
It is sort of not cool to be like that. 
We put certain things on the record. 
They are there and we can always say that we said them.  
People should be put on the spot and made to think about it. 
These are the kinds of things Canadians can do in various international gatherings.  
Madam Speaker, I have a supplementary question for the hon. member. 
I am pleased he mentioned emotion.  
I hope the member will invite people he knows to come here. 
He should even welcome to Canada those parliamentarians he does not know. 
He should be a host in the name of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  
The exhibits will make us heartsick. 
I am happy he raised it.  
We have a truly international cause. 
I thank the member for that observation. 
However, we look to the words of Isaiah. 
We want to finally beat swords into ploughshares and spears into pruning hooks. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Would the hon. member care to rephrase his comments?  
It was the government that refused- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am afraid you are going into debate right now. 
We will resume debate with the hon. member for Kings-Hants.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Madam Speaker, Canadians should feel a great deal of pride in this significant accomplishment today. 
The people that are most vulnerable to these land mines are civilians. 
Children have nicknames for land mines. 
Some mines similarly are called camera mines because they resemble a camera. 
Some are called pineapple mines because of the fact that they resemble pineapples.  
Mines are being redeployed around farmers' fields to prevent theft. 
SFOR's mandate does not include clearing farmers' fields. 
You cannot go off the pavement. 
It is a difficult problem to control and to contain. 
This is critical as well. 
Canadians have a very important role to play in this effort. 
Our peacekeepers are among the best in the world. 
That is something I would like to mention. 
We have contributed over $11 million to the humanitarian efforts to clear land mines. 
Mine removal requires significant and sustained resources that are very costly. 
I have a further note on my trip to Bosnia. 
This can be done with a band saw in some cases. 
Within the other country that mine could be turned into three anti-personnel mines. 
It is a great accomplishment to have 100 countries sign the treaty. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
We appreciate it when we do get this type of support from the west.  
We are proud of all Canadians who have been participating in this effort. 
It is a gain. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Others use mines to protect their crops.  
So again, I offer my warmest congratulations to the government.  
There are a lot of pieces required, however.  
My concern is the following:
Are there any measures to prevent this from happening?  
My concerns that deal with international affairs are perhaps not as traightforward. 
What I am about to say is very important and cannot be orverlooked. 
I cannot emphasize this enough, so I will say it again:
The situation is much different. 
This is not a case of war gone by. 
This is a clear case of a conflict that still exists. 
It is monitored by the South Koreans as well as by the Americans.  
The United States is Canada's close friend and ally. 
It has not signed this treaty. 
I encourage the government to continue to put pressure on these countries.  
These mines are left over from the Communist regime.  
Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):
She always remembers those who have helped her along the road.  
Lorie, we congratulate you and wish you continued success.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
SENATOR MARCEL PRUD'HOMME 
Mr. Guy Saint-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
He was appointed to the Senate as an independent in 1993. 
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
They include self-government, and negotiations on this point are still dragging on. 
In Quebec, on the other hand, the statistics are much more positive.  
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, November is Diabetes Awareness Month.  
The chances of having diabetes increase with age. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Canada, along with NGOs, has led the charge to ban these devices. 
This is an example of what Canada can do on the international stage.  
We must move from a reactive foreign policy to a proactive one. 
The 21st century belongs to Canada.

Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
Their first radio broadcast was from Richmond Hill's Curtain Club.  
I salute both the Curtain Club Theatre and the Royal Canadian Air Farce.  
Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau, Lib.):
We are honoured to have this visit by former President and Mrs. Gemayel.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Thousands of workers are being laid off already.  
It seemed to be musings and idle chatter.  
When is this government going to get these postal workers back to work?  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are monitoring the situation very closely. 
The government is very concerned about the situation.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will tell you who is monitoring the situation. 
But then along came the postal strike. 
The Lorenzes could now lose their business, their dream and even their family home. 
So this kind of answer is not good enough.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
This is a process that has worked. 
Let the process work and let the parties come up with an agreement.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Quite simply, we are not at that stage yet. 
Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay-Okanagan, Ref.):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay-Okanagan, Ref.):

Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Rejean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have made no promises. 
I am going to see that it is followed. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
However, the minister responsible for Canada Post is now threatening to impose special legislation.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
What I am trying to do is assist the process. 
We should let them do their work. 
We should let the mediator do his work.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
That is good news.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Mr. Speaker, it would be sustainable at $2.00.  
I would prefer, colleagues, that we stay away from using such words. 
I will permit the hon. Minister of Finance to answer if he wants to.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let us be very clear. 
There is an opportunity for him to be chosen as the auditor. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Monte Solberg: -and they are clapping for it. 
That is what it works out to. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):

The Minister of Canadian Heritage.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I have a supplementary question.  
What political activities has the Minister of Canadian Heritage managed to finance?  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
This statement was made by the finance minister of the PQ government of Quebec. 
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, first, that option is open to the investment board.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
I will deal with the investment fund. 
The auditor general will not be involved in that audit.  
I will ask the Minister of Finance again. 
What is he trying to hide?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, first, there will be complete public scrutiny. 
All of the information will be made available. 
The member should read the legislation.  
Why does the hon. member refuse to talk about the $600 billion liability? 
Do Canadians have a reason to be afraid of what the Reform- 
The hon. member for Roberval.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
I would sincerely like to know the answer to the following question:
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
The hon. member for Roberval.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, that is precisely what I am asking her for. 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this is not news. 
We have heard these kinds of things before.  
They fly around the country with the elite. 
They visit the elite. 
They are supposed to be doing all this consulting. 
When is this minister going to get her priorities straight? 
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
We are consulting with those. 
I would ask you please to keep it down a bit.  
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the Environment.

Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.  
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
It is the provinces that have to deal with the emissions. 
It is the provinces that will take the economic hit after the Kyoto agreement.  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):

I am sure with the negotiated settlement that mandate can be achieved.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
It is like fattening up a calf before bringing it to market.  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
We do not want to privatize Canada Post Corporation. 
We want Canada Post to continue to deliver the mail. 
It is a good corporation in the global economy.

Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
They are trying to make ends meet. 
These Canadians do not want government handouts. 
All they want is the government to take its hands out their pockets.  
My question is for the Minister of Finance. 
His so-called latest tax relief is simply nickels and dimes. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
To Canadians that happens to be real money.  
The tax relief that is being provided to students happens to be real money. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
Hon. Gilbert Normand (Secretary of State (Agriculture and Agri-Food) (Fisheries and Oceans), Lib.):
An agreement has been signed on import products, including butter. 
At the moment this product meets the requirements of the agreement.

That cost was supposed to be $1 million. 
The hon. member for Markham.  
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
The minister said that someone from the outside may have more expertise. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
He will be auditing the Canada pension plan.  
That is a decision for the board to make.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
However unemployment continues to be a serious problem for Canada's young people.  
What initiatives has the minister taken to address this important issue?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
My question is for the Minister of Transport. 
When will the minister return 20%- 
The Minister of Transport.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
There is no question that we have a program. 
We have just announced the extension of the agreement with New Brunswick. 
I hope we can continue that over the years.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Negotiating consists basically of two parties reaching a compromise.  
My colleagues, that would bring to a close our question period.  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
My point of order concerns irregularities with certain of these estimates. 
It is the parliamentary process to which I am objecting today.  
These funds can only be made available to the crown by the House of Commons.  
Three votes are attempting to legislate through the application of the Appropriation Acts.  
However, no such legislation has been passed to permit this action.  
A similar situation is occurring at Environment Canada. 
Neither of these two pieces of legislation has received royal assent.  
My fifth point concerns Transport Canada. 
Once again we must use the part II book that contains the estimates. 
Colleagues, this point of order could have far reaching effects. 
I would like to hear what the hon. member has to say. 
I return to the hon. member for St. Albert.  
Again we must use the part II book containing the estimates. 
A second irregularity comes from the Department of Public Works and Government Services. 
In March 1997 the department officially privatized the Canada Communications Group. 
The department is in effect legislating through the use of an appropriation act.  
I must at this time indicate my dismay with the practices of this government. 
I respectfully ask that you so rule.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will not be quite as long as my colleague.  
This is far from a routine point of order. 
Citation 935 puts it simply like this: 
Citation 941 of Beauchesne's sixth edition makes the case: 
This is a mandate, not a request.  
Citation 942 points out: 
That in fact is not true. 
Before the election was called- 
I appeal to you, my colleagues. 
This is something that has seldom been done before, if ever.  
The part IIIs of course do not form the principal element of this issue. 
I would like to suggest two things. 
Second is that of course this could not be done without having proper supply.  
That is the submission I wish to make to the Chair. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
We can negotiate in good faith and arrange days for debate. 
You said words to the effect that you took this very seriously. 
You admonished the finance department and those responsible for putting these types of things together. 
They were right at the edge and you said that you took it very seriously. 
A situation like that would be totally irresponsible and unworkable.  
It cannot be both ways.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Had that happened perhaps some of this could have been avoided.  
I am informed a large number of ministers have not appeared. 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
To say the least an interesting point of order has been raised. 
I will surely take into consideration the information and the opinions of both sides.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of information. 
I will take all of this into consideration in trying to make my decision.

Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Is the House ready for the question?  
If the hon. member wishes to move his amendment, would he please read it?  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Chairman, we support the hon. member's amendment.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Is the House ready for the question?  
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
I declare the amendment carried. 
(Clause 10, as amended, agreed to) 
Shall clause 11 carry?  
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Application for Court Order 
The question is on the amendment.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
I understand someone is checking on this.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
I would like to have him define what reasonable grounds are.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
It would be very wise in this case to do the same.  
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
(Clauses 12 to 14 inclusive agreed to) 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Mr. Chairman, I have a question about clause 15(4). 
Basically it talks about not getting a warrant. 
I guess that is all right. 
The only thing is it seems there is room for abuse. 
Is there any way to fix that or tighten it up?  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
They take into account these extenuating circumstances. 
(Clauses 15 and 16 agreed to) 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
``reputation ou la dignite humaine de tout individu;'' 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Chairman, we are in agreement.  
Shall the amendment carry?  
Shall clause 17, as amended, carry?  
(Clause 17, as amended, agreed to) 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Chairman, it is a good question. 
We would bring in any pertaining regulation once it is actually signed and in place. 
Mr. Chairman, that is basically the intent. 
It will then be deposited by the prime minister with the secretary general. 
We will repromulgate that regulation at that point in time.  
We cannot make that application until we have actually signed the treaty.  
(Clause 19 agreed to) 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
We therefore propose that this clause be amended. 
``Amendment to the Convention 
The question is on the amendment.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
We would undertake that the general principle would be discussed by the task force. 
That would be our position.  
Therefore we would suggest to the hon. member that he might withdraw the amendment. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
We would not support the amendment today. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
We look forward to going ahead in the future and examining it in further detail.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
I would appreciate a comment from the minister on this question.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
I will look forward to the work of the committee with considerable interest.  
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the answer. 
Is the House ready for the question on the amendment?  
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
There is not unanimous consent for the proposal.  
Is the House ready for the question on the amendment?  
Members have heard the terms of the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the committee to adopt the amendment?  
(Clause 20 agreed to) 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Mr. Chairman, I have a question for the minister.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
I would like to know from the minister and his officials what separation exists. 
The normal test would apply, which is the seriousness or the gravity of the action. 
That would be a judgment call by whatever prosecutor was used. 
I notice one is not forthcoming.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Chairman, I thank the hon. member for his comments. 
Perhaps it shows the value of the ever vigilant activity of members of Parliament. 
In our opening remarks we did beg the indulgence of the House. 
We wanted to take into account all particular references to the charter. 
The hon. member's examination last week was tough in that regard. 
It was to make sure the courts would be the interpreter, not the minister.  
Even at that, it was just that we did not want to leave any question. 
(Clause 21 agreed to) 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
I would like a point of clarification here. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Chairman, I should clarify just in case people did not quite understand it.  
Different ministers could apply. 
(Clause 22 agreed to) 
(Clauses 23 to 25, inclusive, agreed to) 
Shall the amendment carry?  
Shall clause 11, as amended, carry?  
(Clause 11, as amended, agreed to) 
(Clause 1 agreed to) 
Shall the schedule carry?  
Mr. Chairman, I have a question.  
I believe a copy of the treaty was included.  
We can give hon. members the website number. 
I should mention we have also established a separate website to cover the conference itself. 
We will have our officials available to share information.  
I think that portion is scheduled for next Thursday, probably after question period. 
We would like to involve the the members of Parliament as much as possible. 
I hear no points of order on the issue.  
(Bill reported as amended and concurred in) 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the minister has a commitment which will take him away from the House. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the government whip for his intervention.  
No one has ownership of this. 
This is one of our finest hours. 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
This treaty is a significant achievement in its own right. 
We have made history in a certain sense and it will continue. 
This is a succinct treaty and a treaty that has teeth. 
It is something that goes to the gamesmanship of making treaties. 
We have pushed ahead on that basis. 
It was to become law when ratified by 60 countries. 
That was to become law when ratified by 12 countries. 
It took eight years to get 12 countries.  
Then it takes effect six months after the 40th instrument of ratification. 
We would like to complete the whole process beginning to end in a year. 
That is to say, what is the effect? 
Is that not a treaty with gaps in it?  
It is no longer avant-garde and is acquiring an increasing acceptance. 
We will find that jurists in Canada will be making that argument.  
Let us put it this way. 
That is one of the reasons we took this risk. 
We are going to encourage that.  
This is law in the making. 
I commend the adoption of this legislation to this House.  
Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre-Rosedale, Lib.):
We have heard a great deal about land mines from the minister and others. 
They are so ingenious in their destructiveness. 
They are supporting the United Nations de-mining centre. 
We are contributing to the rehabilitation of victims. 
We talked to CIDA experts who are doing the same. 
When we choose to do that we can achieve incredible results.  
We are taking an important step today. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
It will hopefully provide motivation for other countries to come on side.  
We saw pink all over the map. 
It is often easy for us to pass legislation. 
I think back to when we talked about youth prostitution in foreign countries. 
I cannot imagine how we would ever enforce that kind of legislation. 
There is a slight problem. 
Mr. Speaker, I am sorry for not mentioning that at the outset.  
We have figures like 200 million or 300 million mines being out there. 
The numbers are huge. 
We need to help people to help themselves in that area. 
We could talk about plutonium being sent to Canada from Russia. 
We could talk about that whole area.  
We in Canada are lucky. 
The minister made reference to this. 
Changes within the UN are desperately needed. 
I should mention the foreign affairs committee. 
Many people do not know what we do in that committee. 
They cost a lot of money. 
Ultimately they end up being put on the shelf.  
This is an example of a case where there is an issue that is real. 
We can put a face on it. 
It is something which people care about. 
It is something that the committee can get involved in.  
A lot of members have urged the government to make committees relevant. 
We have urged the government to let the committees deal directly with the minister. 
That is something to work toward. 
Some of it will be a dream. 
We have seen this sort of presentation before. 
We all know about the failures which have happened. 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
This is a proud achievement for Canada. 
It also includes assistance for de-mining and for victims of land mines. 
They will have the powers to search and seize them with or without warrant. 
Dwelling houses can be inspected with a warrant. 
Warrants are not required to search military bases and/or warehouse facilities.  
Land mines are a very serious issue in the international arena. 
The use of anti-personnel mines already violates numerous tenants under international law. 
That works out to one person every 20 minutes. 
This is a tragic loss. 
To make it even more tragic is that these losses are often unnecessary.  
There are approximately 100 million mines that are waiting for their next victim. 
These losses could have been and, more importantly, should have been prevented. 
Land mines do not discriminate. 
They will target any individual who comes into their path. 
I take a personal interest in this bill. 
In these countries the infrastructure development is concentrated in the urban centres. 
We can, therefore, visualize what terrible deeds these land mines can do. 
It is only fitting. 
Therefore, we can move forward and stop manufacturing land mines.  
It is believed that for every mine removed another 20 are planted.  
Getting rid of these mines is not going to be easy.  
For the most part these countries are citing security reasons for using the mines. 
We now live in a global village. 
We are members of one gigantic family. 
Our efforts should be devoted to promoting harmony and peaceful coexistence. 
All religions of the world espouse neighbourly love. 
However, we have a long way to go before we can peacefully coexist. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Is there unanimous consent?  
Therefore, this work is unfinished and it might remain unfinished. 
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
One fact remains, and it represents an important step. 
It will, however, help to limit the terrible effects. 
I will now give some background on anti-personnel mines. 
These mines are cheap weapons. 
That is what mine fields were used for originally.  
However, the use of such mines was expanded. 
And what about the economic tragedies caused by anti-personnel mines? 
The images of innocent children horribly burned by napalm caused universal consternation. 
The effects of anti-personnel mines are every bit as devastating.  
Their impact will be greatly diminished, it is true. 
The issue of mine clearing will, however, remain intact.  
We know, however, that mine clearing is an expensive operation. 
History is repeating itself.  
Here again, action must be taken and solutions do exist. 
In conclusion, the Bloc Quebecois reaffirms its support to Bill C-22. 
The Ottawa process has become essential. 
However, as I said previously, we still have a long way to go. 
It is also the price we have to pay for peace and security.  
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Perhaps I could hear the proposal of the chief government whip.  
In that same spirit I move: 
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Accordingly, we will continue with the debate before the House.  
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or, NDP):
In Canada we are blessed with thousands of kilometres of open space. 
That is the worst sort of hypocrisy.  
How about the wide area anti-personnel mine. 
This treaty is a huge step forward, a step on to safer ground. 
We are not free from danger yet. 
That war ended over 50 years ago. 
Since then more mines have been laid than ever. 
During those decades more families were broken. 
This issue has to be put in a larger context. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
I also wanted to correct the member on another point. 
It banned mines before the issue ever came to the forefront.  
I would like to set the record straight on that point. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for his comments. 
As we all know, our time for speaking is very limited. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my comments will be brief today but extraordinarily meaningful. 
I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Compton-Stanstead.  
These are challenging times for a middle power. 
The majority of those interstate conflicts have been between governments and their own people.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I will also be very brief. 
Jody Williams was mentioned several times. 
She said that she would be continuing with that project.  
The Asia-Pacific economic co-operation meeting is taking place in Vancouver. 
That is not the right thing to do. 
It will soon not be able to ignore the issue. 
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Burlington.  
Together a very important humanitarian goal has been achieved.  
We have all heard about the statistics on land mines. 
Every 20 minutes a person is maimed or killed by an anti-personnel mine. 
For every mine taken out of the ground, 20 new mines are planted. 
Others are not so lucky.  
Like all the children in the camp, this young fellow was clothed in rags. 
The effect of land mines goes beyond the physical damage that is done. 
Also of concern is the profound psychological damage that accompanies living with land mines. 
Warm nights full of temptation to go out for a walk. 
We have had enough of smoke filled cafes, but where to go. 
Mines are all around us. 
Our fields, meadows, forests are probably covered with mines. 
I want to run through flowery fields with my girlfriend. 
I want to pick the first violet for her, to climb the trees and forests. 
I want to lie in the grass and watch the sky for hours. 
It takes only one wrong step. 
So lower your head, my friend. 
Your enemy is in the earth. 
It has surrounded you with a thick wire. 
There are a number of challenges we face in connection with this treaty. 
This would be a major step forward.  
This next phase will make the Ottawa process seem easy by comparison. 
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):
The Canadian delegation performed admirably. 
What are the next steps?  
This is a bill about peace and international security. 
Most important, this bill is about people. 
It is about saving lives. 
It is about preventing senseless deaths and it is about restoring hope to communities.  
Others will take weeks to die. 
The effect for young women on their marriageability is rather drastic. 
There are many obstacles along that road. 
The social reintegration of the individuals is absolutely important. 
These are innocent victims. 
The signing of this treaty is only the first step. 
We must sustain political and public attention on the issue. 
We have the momentum. 
There is a lot we can do with this energy. 
My colleague has identified opportunities for Canadians to participate in that process. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
A draft treaty was produced in Oslo, Norway, in September 1997. 
Next month there will be a formal signing ceremony in Ottawa.  
The treaty is supported by the Canadian Armed Forces. 
The Oslo treaty is intended to be a collective international disarmament treaty. 
The bill has 14 sections. 
I would briefly like to describe a few of the sections which are important.  
There are prohibitions as we know. 
It is also illegal to import or export anti-personnel mines.  
There is a destruction of mines section. 
There are inspection rules. 
This power is only extended to commercial dwellings. 
The United States and China have refused to be signatories to this treaty. 
Also they have not exported mines for some years. 
It has made sure that the anti-tank weapons are not anti-personnel any more. 
It has destroyed a record number of mines already. 
Another issue is the request for assistance. 
Let us imagine the civilian human aspect for a moment. 
History shows that mines do not stop armies but stop people's lives completely. 
The schools are covered with posters asking kids to think mines. 
There is something worse than a war. 
Even the children have to work to support the families in those countries. 
The forgotten mines take away their young dreams in a split second. 
The war is still in their hearts, souls and memory. 
There are people out there with one leg of their trousers hanging empty. 
I know he is splitting time with the hon. member for Souris-Moose Mountain. 
I think he would want to ensure the other hon. member has his 10 minutes.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his brilliant and erudite intervention.  
What do his constituents think about the issue?  
It was an honour to have the opportunity to speak in support of it.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
We live in relative peace and quiet. 
We know from fact that many illegal guns are being smuggled into Canada every day.  
He talked about it being the smuggling capital of Canada. 
They are bringing guns in. 
I am pleased to support the motion. 
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
Indeed, the Bloc Quebecois fully supports Bill C-22. 
It will be recalled that the agreement did not fully prohibit the use of mines. 
On the contrary, it stated that future mines had to be detectible or self-destructible. 
But it is never too late to do the right thing. 
Everybody must be delighted with this convention banning anti-personnel mines. 
And the figures speak for themselves.  
Five million more are sold each year. 
And what about children? 
What is more normal for a child than to go to school? 
This slaughter has to stop and fortunately we are on the right track.  
The campaign against land mines was launched at the end of 1991. 
These organizations shared a common purpose: to ban anti-personnel mines.  
That is where we are now.  
There is a shadow over the event, however. 
This is very regrettable. 
But I think that international popular pressure will eventually bring these countries around.  
Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard-La Prairie, Lib.):
No conflict has ever been won through the use of mines.  
We believe the United States should take the lead to achieve this goal''.  
I would like to tell you briefly about my experience in Oslo. 
I was there when the treaty was negotiated. 
The Canadian negotiators enjoyed a high level of credibility over there. 
He introduced me to someone from the Red Cross as a Canadian parliamentarian. 
She looked at me and said: ``Well done, Canada''. 
That is an experience I am not about to forget. 
It is an experience that makes one extraordinarily proud of this country.  
What I would like to say to all Canadians is this:
Be truly proud of your political leaders. 
When I took up politics, I was criticized for being idealistic. 
Today is proof of that. 
That is the embodiment of what we are doing this evening.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
The member for Winnipeg North-St. 
Paul is assured this House will rise to the challenge. 
The minister of course has the full support of the government caucus. 
This government's commitment is resolute. 
Its determination to succeed is unwavering and the government sees full success on the horizon.  
These are very laudable developments.  
We in Parliament and through us, our constituents can be part of that difference. 
And we will keep working until the last moment and then beyond''.  
I am not a pessimistic person by nature. 
Despite Bruce Coburn's presence, attendance was sparse. 
Various groups in Peterborough have taken a continuing interest in this matter. 
I have mentioned Mines Action Canada and our own Red Cross. 
They are now part of the way decisions have to be made. 
It does not stop here. 
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
It is one of those days today.  
On this issue, we have been united. 
I think all Canadians should be proud for the role that we are playing.  
There are many people who are Canadians who have experience with this. 
My parents were in their mid-thirties. 
The terror of that night is something that has never left me. 
On one side we have Muslims and on the other side we have Croatians. 
This is a very beautiful river. 
After seeing it, one wants to walk down to it. 
If you had your fishing rod you would want to try fishing. 
It is a very beautiful and scenic site. 
I am incredibly proud to be in this Chamber. 
As we push this ahead, we know that we have Canadians with us. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
All of us as members greatly appreciate your efforts.  
This is the perhaps the last speech tonight. 
It is a shame that it took such an issue to bring us all together. 
Bill C-22 will save lives. 
These devices do not affect rich countries like ours. 
This bill will go a long way to preventing that carnage from occurring.  
Let us look beyond land mines. 
There is life after land mines. 
This cannot be left to wither away. 
The biggest challenge is conflict. 
We can reflect on the Bosnian conflict. 
The signs were continually there. 
We the nations of the world sat on our hands and wept. 
It was potentially an avoidable tragedy. 
Certainly many of those lives could have been saved.  
What did we do? 
Here are some constructive solutions. 
We have to rethink the way we deal with each other as nation states.  
First, we must set up an early warning monitoring system to address conflict. 
It could then be dealt with by the United Nations as a whole.  
It is exceedingly important to pursue this issue. 
These are not just words. 
If we fail to address it we will see an explosion of ethnic conflict.  
It has driven the United Nations into bankruptcy. 
This then is not a situation that can be sustained.  
Why should Canadians be interested in this issue at all? 
This is a lot of money. 
It contributes to the already weakened system we have in our social programs.  
It is artificially maintained right now through force. 
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
Each corner echoes the screams of human beings fighting in a deadly war. 
Thousands upon thousands of lives were literally torn apart by weapons of destruction.  
Have we learned our lesson about the futility of war and weapons? 
Where the children shriek 
Between bursts of machine gun fire 
Mothers protect their bosoms 
That give the sweet milk of life 
Soldiers trample under foot 
In the silence of occupation 
Where the deaf can hear 
Speak to me of love.  
Have no revolver, no tank 
I do not understand 
I can no longer play war 
Play it so nicely.  
I am a child 
And I will grow up tough 
Let me laugh now while I can 
For I will not have the time for it 
When I am a grownup.  
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
It is estimated that there are over 18,000 minefields in Bosnia. 
This convention is long overdue. 
The Ottawa process provides an opportunity to build a greater awareness. 
I am disappointed, as I am sure we all are. 
Is the House ready for the question?  
(The House adjourned at 8.10 p.m.)
