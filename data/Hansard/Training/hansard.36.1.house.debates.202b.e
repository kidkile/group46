GOVERNMENT SERVICES ACT, 1999 
I think this agreement in principle is fair and generous. 
This agreement in principle does not guarantee that the strikes will end. 
Union members can ratify or reject this agreement. 
The rotating strikes have prevented many Canadians from having access to these services.  
In the port of Vancouver, dozens of ships are waiting to be loaded- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
If that is not the case, I would like the minister to- 
This is debate and the minister has the floor. 
I am afraid that is not a point of order.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Is this settlement agreed upon or is it not?  
That is not a point of order. 
The minister is making a speech on second reading of this bill. 
Ratification may take a number of weeks. 
It may be rejected by the workers. 
I am sure farmers in the west understand that situation.  
Increased tensions on the picket lines have resulted on occasion- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am afraid the hon. member is out of order. 
The minister is making a speech on a bill. 
The member is asking questions. 
He is not raising a point of order. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Canadians are kept in the dark along with the union negotiators.  
That was not totally clear to us in this House. 
We are left in the same situation of not knowing what is going on. 
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
The hon. member for Wetaskiwin.  
This is a despicable move. 
Why is it done at this late hour?  
This puts an entirely different light on the situation. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
For our part we would be agreeable to that.  
I again ask the question. 
There is no consent.  
Mr. Speaker, I cannot believe this. 
This puts a totally different light on the situation. 
I cannot think of a more ridiculous situation to find ourselves in. 
God knows we did not put ourselves in this mess. 
It is a credibility problem.  
What do you know about credibility?  
You will learn something about credibility. 
Why are we here tonight?  
The hon. member for Wetaskiwin has the floor.  
Mr. Speaker, I do not mind a little help. 
I am getting tremendous encouragement from my colleagues and even some good words of advice.  
We are going to have to completely rethink our position on this. 
Things have completely changed from this morning when we started debating this. 
Things have changed completely.  
It does not deal with us in good faith.  
We will do that in a moment. 
There is a point of order from the hon. member for Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough.  
I ask that that be put to the House once again.  
The Chair is more than happy to keep putting this question to the House. 
I will put the question to the House again. 
There is no consent.  
Mr. Speaker, I cannot believe what I am hearing.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
Other members may say so. I will not.  
I heard a no and that was the end of it. 
I am very cognizant of the wishes of hon. members in this regard. 
The hon. member for Wetaskiwin.  
We still have to have some sort of mechanism to deal with their contract. 
Therefore, we need to have final offer selection arbitration.  
Questions and comments to the minister.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
At what time did he know that?  
I would like to know why it was not. 
Mr. Speaker, I knew about the agreement taking place at about 10.10 tonight. 
This afternoon I heard about the various elements that were involved. 
I indicated that I was ready to agree to the various contents. 
I was told at 10.10 that they had initiated an agreement.  
Therefore, we still need to pass the law as it is. 
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, what is going on here tonight is very surprising. 
Now the minister is telling us that there is an agreement in principle. 
I find this totally unacceptable.  
The first are the blue collar workers. 
Continuing, there are two groups of workers. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question may seem quite similar. 
Mr. Speaker, the act is still necessary for the CX workers. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question for the minister is very simple. 
Everyone here wants to see farmers being able to ship their grain. 
The hon. member will address the Chair, please. 
The hon. member for South Shore will please address the Chair.  
He has not negotiated in good faith. 
The question is simple.  
We have been negotiating with the union. 
We have been at the same table. 
However, the agreement itself is an agreement in principle. 
If it is not ratified the strikes can continue over time. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I know that our negotiators have initialled that agreement. 
I do not know if it can be tabled tonight. 
We obviously have at least one copy that has been initialled. 
I am not sure it is available. 
If it is, we will produce it for the hon. member.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Speaker, I did not say that it could be produced. 
I indicated that I would check if it could be produced.  
I have my main negotiator here. 
I can probably get the answer in a few minutes. 
If it cannot be produced, it cannot be produced.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
That is not right and he knows it.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I can certainly understand the hon. member's frustration. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
A vote started at eleven o'clock. 
In fact what has been demonstrated is the exact opposite of what has been alleged.  
A point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
I am dealing with a question of privilege. 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
That is not a question of privilege. 
I called for comments just on that.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I certainly believe that my privileges in the House have been affected.  
The government House leader knew of the agreement in principle. 
We on this side of the House did not. 
We only knew that the government had some announcement to make. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on the same point of privilege. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We could resolve this a lot quicker by extending it. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, on a point of order.  
There is a certain amount of confusion here. 
Therefore, the Chair is not in a position to do so. 
Then the minister said something about that. 
Would the minister like to add something.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of privilege. 
I am afraid that I have already ruled on that point of order. 
It was the same one raised by the whip of the official opposition. 
That is not a question of privilege.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
We would like to understand the meaning- 
Members will have to continue without the agreement. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
A deliberate omission is a form of contempt. 
The government deliberately misled the opposition.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
It does not change the substance of the issue. 
The fact is that there was an agreement reached- 
The Chair is running out of patience on points of order. 
I will hear a few more and then there will be no more. 
They are getting very repetitious and I cannot continue all night.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
The motion on which the vote took place was on a motion for closure. 
It had nothing to do with the act itself. 
The prisoner guards can also still strike. 
Therefore, the substance of the act does not change.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
The whip of the official opposition is absolutely correct. 
If that is the case, the minister is in contempt.  
Mr. Speaker, our point is still valid. 
The minister is incorrect in his assertion. 
The minister is incorrect. 
This government or this minister is in contempt. 
Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
We were told by the minister after we voted that there was a tentative agreement. 
That is very germane to the issue at hand. 
I agree that it was deliberately withheld. 
That has just been brought to my attention.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
I use Beauchesne's to back up that argument.  
I ask the Speaker to rule on the issue. 
The minister knew before we voted. 
I was not allowed to vote with the full knowledge of what the minister knew. 
That is a breach of my privileges.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is factually incorrect. 
It is because he is a credible member that he should not say these things.  
So are a number of other allegations that have been made.  
Everyone here has acted in good faith. 
Everyone is trying to do what is best for the people of Canada. 
That is still our determination. 
That is still what we want to do. 
Everyone in this House knows it. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
This is information that was purposely withheld. 
It is a prima facie case.  
I go by section 92: 
That is what Motion No. 21 does. 
It has nothing to do with it. 
No privilege was breached. 
There was no information that was relevant for the vote on Motion No. 21. 
Mr. Speaker, I will show the minister how much we are joking. 
The Chair is ready to deal with the question of privilege that has been raised. 
I want to stress the quality of this motion to the House. 
I believe it would be out of order.  
Such a request will require the unanimous consent of the House. 
If I had known what information the minister had I would have reversed it. 
I feel very strongly that the information was- 
I ask for the unanimous consent of the House to change my vote.  
I am afraid there is no consent. 
Resuming debate, the hon. member for Winnipeg Centre.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate being recognized. 
I am looking forward to entering into- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Just so I am clear on this, you have resumed debate. 
The minister was number one. 
This is slot number three. 
There will be no questions or comments. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Perhaps I can clarify this. 
We expect you to honour- 
I asked him if he was finished his remarks and he told me he was. 
We will get the blues, but it was very clear. 
I was quite emphatic with the hon. member for Wetaskiwin. 
He told me he had. 
The hon. member says I am wrong. 
I have no objection. 
If the hon. member wishes to continue I am prepared to go back. 
I assume the House will agree to that. 
I am not trying to cheat him out of his time.  
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that. 
I am sorry for the misunderstanding.  
It was the understanding of this House that we were dealing with- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Chair did not hear the word. 
If hon. members used the word I am sure they would want to withdraw. 
The hon. member for Wetaskiwin has the floor.  
We approached this issue on the basis that this was an emergency. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
This question has been asked several times. 
I do not believe it is a point of order. 
There was a grain stoppage at the port of Vancouver. 
Lo and behold exactly what we had predicted came true. 
One of the unions at the port went on strike. 
Now we find we have a completely different set of circumstances. 
What kind of position does this put the PSAC workers in?  
This is no way to cement labour relations. 
It is a very disrespectful way.  
It is absolutely insane to be doing this in this fashion.  
I am sure everybody arrived at it this way.  
What is the emergency now? 
I am sure a few government members will stand up on debate. 
I would like to have them explain to me where the emergency is. 
This is about the shabbiest handling of a bill. 
This is a sham and a ridiculous use of this institution.  
I thought hurrah, perhaps we are going to make some headway here.  
This is absolute silliness. 
We are going to be extremely suspicious of its motives.  
While we are talking about shifty operations, let us talk about last Friday. 
First that and now this.  
I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
I am trying to follow this debate here. 
It seems to me as though you have lost control of the House. 
That is my privilege and I would like it protected.  
The hon. member for Wetaskiwin.  
We always seem to be slipping back.  
We all would like to see these labour disruptions absolutely minimized. 
There are absolutely no winners in this situation. 
That is not the way it is decided. 
It is a very big decision for them.  
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
I have not made any comments in regard to what has been going on tonight. 
There is no consent.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
We have talked about this tentative agreement. 
Mr. Speaker, as I was saying- 
For the third time.  
Today is a very sad day too. 
We have a perfect and glaring illustration of that this evening.  
We will get back to the basic issue. 
Incidentally, workers in the general labour group earn an average of $31,000 per year. 
A salary increase is, therefore, definitely in order. 
There is nothing outrageous about such a measure, on the contrary. 
I think this is already expecting too much. 
We want the government to negotiate. 
Mr. Speaker, could the president of the Treasury Board listen to the debate?  
Let me give a list.  
I did not pick year 1982 out of the blue. 
We should remember the context. 
That was in 1982.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot makes a good point. 
It is getting late. 
We could give each other the dignity of paying attention to each other. 
If we do not want to do so, there are the lobbies for social events.  
That was in 1989.  
The same thing happened in 1995. 
As members can see, almost every year, some special legislation was passed. 
There is one point to be made on this issue. 
It is a little easy in the government's situation. 
We have seen it here in Ottawa. 
Some people have been bitten. 
The International Labour Organization also blamed the Canadian federal government four times. 
-the principles concerning the fundamental rights which are the subject of those Conventions.  
Unless it can be proven otherwise, Canada is still a member of the ILO. 
This is totally unacceptable. 
He is not here.  
No. He is one of those who do not listen.  
He distinguished himself as a member of the so-called rat pack. 
This is typical of this government: a bunch of hypocrites.  
What about the managers' attitude? 
What kind of attitude can we expect from these people? 
Underneath all this lies a real human resources management issue. 
We do not have that. 
Let us hope that there will be a huge political price to pay. 
They will have to pay a huge political price for their lack of credibility.  
What we are dealing with here is a dictatorship in the making. 
No need to mince words. 
As for Quebeckers, we know how to leave all this behind in short order.  
We should all be feeling a great sadness. 
The government House leader was right in his opening remarks. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
I have mixed feelings about being able to speak now. 
Everybody seems to want to know what was in the tentative agreement. 
I know exactly what was in it. 
It went from 30 months to 24 months. 
I cannot understand it. 
Personally it is very frustrating. 
That is table two, the 14,500-odd trades people. 
The government found satisfaction there. 
Now it will merge the Atlantic provinces with Quebec into one zone. 
That is what the union was calling for all along. 
Now the government seems willing to let the union do that.  
That is why I say it is absolute nonsense.  
It leads me to believe that it was ideologically driven. 
The government had it within its ability to settle in that regard as well. 
Why is the government not honest about what it really wants to do? 
Then we could deal with it. 
We could have an honest debate about it. 
We have been hearing a lot of passionate speeches from very odd sources. 
I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member is quite correct. 
Mr. Speaker, it is interesting. 
It is a very detailed, complex book.  
The great champions of the working class. 
It is actually quite galling. 
It is valuable to spend some time and talk about that basic democratic right. 
The right for workers to withhold their services is basic and fundamental. 
It is recognized in our charter of rights and freedoms. 
What we have in labour relations is a way to try to solve that. 
It is through free collective bargaining- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am really sorry to interrupt the hon. member for Winnipeg Centre. 
I will be using the full 20 minutes.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member has 12 minutes left.  
It is getting to be more and more common. 
It is a slippery slope in this House. 
We come from a caucus that believes all labour has dignity. 
We believe that fair wages benefit the whole community. 
Their settlements have been imposed for that whole period of time.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The workers were stealing the gizzards and the wingtips to take home and make soup. 
That happened in 1991.  
It used to be that it was almost comparable. 
Workers have fallen way behind.  
Over the last couple of years there is no more job security. 
That is workers' money. 
It is deferred wages. 
It is paid to workers for their purposes. 
Everybody knows that Tory times are tough times. 
What do they get for it? 
I think they are fed up. 
It hurts all of us to be here, I suppose. 
It is such an unnecessary thing. 
We cost out what the spread is. 
It is does not add up from a cost point of view.  
That is just one example we found without digging too hard. 
We found that in the first five minutes. 
They have not lost a day's time. 
They are not on strike. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Without the labour movement the free market cannot operate effectively.  
It waits until the crisis develops. 
It is 911 government and it is unacceptable.  
It spent $500 million to cancel a helicopter contract.  
It is appalling for a government of Canada to behave in this manner.  
The government, in its approach to labour management, is doing the exact opposite. 
It is bludgeoning the unions whenever it has the opportunity to do so. 
It is absolutely shameful what the government has done tonight. 
First the government let this crisis develop without taking any responsibility. 
It is not surprising that the government is acting in this way. 
All members of this House receive the same level of pay. 
It creates a ghettoization of the public service. 
That is typical of this government. 
It is not consistent with good faith negotiations. 
The government has hit an all-time low in labour relations. 
It is absolutely inappropriate.  
The government has refused to table the tentative agreement. 
This government is not interested in consistency in policy. 
All it is interested in is power at all costs.  
We do not buy that over here. 
The government is negotiating in bad faith.  
There are members here who would have voted differently had they had the information.  
I am pleased that our party did not support the closure motion.  
What about the farmers?  
I hear a Liberal member opposite ask ``What about the farmers?'' 
Again the government is choosing to pit farmers against blue collar workers. 
It is absolutely unconscionable and unacceptable for parliamentarians to stand by and let this happen.  
I am shocked tonight at how the government is treating blue collar workers. 
It demeans parliament and it demeans the rights of workers in Canada.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
Shall clause 2 carry?  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Chairman, I would like to start the debate with some questions. 
It is only right that we get answers to those questions.  
Perhaps he could give some clarification to the Canadian people.  
He mentioned in the House that he has an agreement in principle. 
Mr. Chairman, just a follow-up question to that. 
Basically what we are doing is sticking a sharp stick in the union's eye.  
We have to protect Canadian people during that period of time. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
In French, the definition of common law spouse reads as follows: 
The English definition is the right one. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson:
Mr. Chairman, yes it is.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
The agreement covers only these two groups.  
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
Is there something in the process that is wrong or flawed? 
Is the problem the competence of the public servants? 
Is the problem the orders that are given by the government?  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Mr. Chairman, I have three brief questions for the minister responsible.  
What is their background in negotiation?  
Our instructions were the same.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
During that period there is no guarantee that there will be ratification. 
There is no guarantee by the employees that they will not have strikes.  
Those are conditions of the present contract.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
They have all been declared essential. 
A strike did not take place, this time. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Now there is a tentative agreement which substantially changes the whole nature of the discussion.  
I want to ask the President of the Treasury Board a simple question. 
No, Mr. Chairman, and I have given an answer in this regard. 
Another advantage has been given to them. 
There are five steps in each classification. 
One step has been added or reduced. 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Mr. Chairman, I have a couple of questions. 
Are the corrections people included in this tentative agreement? 
Obviously they have to know what they are voting on.  
Mr. Chairman, in the agreement only the blue collar workers are covered. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Chairman, I have a couple of questions. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson:
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Mr. Chairman, the figures have varied from day to day. 
A $9 million contract has been lost, according to the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool.  
In any event, the farmers themselves have seen their wheat exports drop significantly. 
Can he give us figures? 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
The example of the RCMP was used.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Chairman, the member is right to say that this is indeed the difficulty. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
We are correcting that quirk. 
We have already indicated to the union that we are ready to accept them.  
I would like the minister to confirm something for me. 
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
Mr. Chairman, I have two brief questions for the minister.  
Mr. Chairman, the normal period for the ratification process is four to six weeks. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Mr. Chairman, there is nothing in the agreement on that subject.  
Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay-Boundary-Okanagan, Ref.):
They are prepared to accept that. 
It was only through a slip-up on the part of the government. 
That is why it has the problem.  
The position now is that the only thing left for these people is conciliation. 
They went that route and accepted it. 
It has taken away strike and it is going to designate them. 
We used exactly the same right in this case. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson:
Mr. Svend J. Robinson:
I did not see the hon. member rise, unfortunately. 
The hon. member need not worry. 
I will come back to him in due course.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Will this permanently refuse their ability to strike?  
That is done through other means. 
It is the designation as workers in essential services.  
In the present case we have a specific problem. 
The second part of the bill deals with schedule 2. 
Is that not what it is saying? 
If the hon. member wants it.  
Now we have a situation where they are designated. 
We have an incredible imbalance.  
I am a member of the subcommittee studying the CCRA. 
I have been in the Pacific region and I have been in Atlantic Canada. 
Training is non-existent. 
That was one of the two items.  
We were very close to having an agreement with the correctional officers before. 
Clearly, over the past years we have been able to come to agreements with them.  
Out of the four elements we have agreed to three. 
Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay-Boundary-Okanagan, Ref.):
We have no problem recruiting prison guards.  
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Mr. Chairman, we now have a tentative agreement. 
We have an imposed settlement, this 500-page plus document. 
Because, in fact, Mr. Chairman, the agreement may not be ratified. 
Mr. Chairman, my question really has not been addressed. 
The reason it has not is because I used the words ``eventual ratification''. 
That is a given.  
It does not have to all hinge on ratification of this agreement. 
We can talk about eventual ratification. 
Can the minister please tell me why that is not an option?  
They will be in a position to strike on Friday of this week. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Surely this is disturbing.  
If it is government policy, would he care to defend such a policy? 
It is this parliament that passes the law. 
We do our utmost to fit this test. 
Mr. Chairman, in a way, what can I say? 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
That is why we want to introduce back to work legislation.  
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
Mr. Chairman, my negotiator does not have that.  
Mr. Chairman, I realize that we are not just asking questions here. 
Then again, maybe I will not.  
I have a couple of questions for the President of the Treasury Board. 
In other words, he is telling us to trust him. 
It is one of those things that one has an awful lot of difficulty believing.  
Why should we do that?  
I have mentioned some of the advantages, such as holidays, parental holidays and so on. 
The existing agreement is available for everybody to see. 
On that basis one can see what the general parameters are.  
Obviously the union would not go for that. 
Yet here in parliament, parliamentarians are being asked to just trust this government. 
This idea of an emergency gripping the nation is a little hard to believe. 
The grain is moving. 
That is not the emergency. 
There is nobody picketing in any major sustained way. 
I do not see an emergency there. 
I do approve of what is going on here tonight. 
I think it is great.  
He says they are ahead of last year's schedule at this same time. 
Mr. Chairman, I believe it is an emergency and it is important. 
I always speak kindly of him. 
Perhaps we are both wrong in our assessment of each other.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
Mr. Chairman, I see the hon. member's position.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Mr. Chairman, I am sorry, but that is not good enough. 
That is a huge inequity. 
This is the system we use.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
First, how are those local living conditions assessed, on what basis are they assessed? 
They would have to be changed by mutual agreement. 
That is the process we have.  
We have adaptations every time we renegotiate these rates. 
Mr. Chairman, I have a supplementary for the president. 
What are the living conditions based on? 
How are they measured? 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
This agreement does not have force of law. 
It is not a collective agreement and it cannot be applied. 
It is just a piece of paper.  
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
My understanding was an administrative error by this department. 
They are designated as essential and there was that possibility of a strike.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Chairman, it is impossible to have a legislative collective agreement. 
In this case, because there was no agreement, we have to legislate.  
The question is quite simple. 
That unfortunately was not done. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
My question for the minister is very simple. 
During that first statement, as the member may recall, I indicated what had happened. 
I have a second question for the minister. 
That is half the legislation.  
The other part of the legislation deals with table two blue collar workers. 
Negotiations take place all the time more or less seriously. 
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
Mr. Chairman, these are options that could be considered. 
Could he comment on that for me, please?  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
That will cost farmers into the future.  
Mr. Chairman, we will look at these possibilities.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
This is the fourth time we are attempting to do it.  
However I will consider the possibilities my hon. colleague mentioned.  
Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay-Boundary-Okanagan, Ref.):
It covered pay and it covered training. 
Yet they were prepared to accept it.  
Prisoners work for $5.65 a day. 
How will they negotiate in the future?  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
I guess I am asking for some explanation.  
Mr. Chairman, the answer is easy. 
Before that agreement was made, there were 900 people in that situation. 
For these 500 and 600 we still have the need for back to work legislation.  
The fact is that the language in here is fairly clear:
Clearly something needs more explanation.  
That emergency was solved for these two situations. 
However, the rest of the problem remained. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Mr. Chairman, I would like the President of the Treasury Board to clarify one thing.  
The case of members of Parliament was used as an example. 
I know all MPs receive the same salary. 
What was said in the House is not correct. 
This can be proved. 
That is what I said.  
That is what we are doing.  
I just want it to be clear. 
We are not at the provincial level. 
We are at the federal level.  
I am talking about salary here, not expenses.  
I have understood what the member has said.

We could stop short of this heavy-handed intervention of back to work legislation. 
I would ask for the support of the House for the motion.

All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
When shall the bill be read the third time? 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
I have just arrived and I too would have voted with my party.  
Mr. Speaker, I will not make a speech. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, tonight I believe we are about to- 
The hon. member for Selkirk-Interlake has the floor. 
I am sure all members want to hear his speech.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
Mr. Speaker, I no longer ask for that consent. 
I would like to speak my full time.  
The short title is cited as being the government services act, 1999. 
They knew at that time that the wage freeze would end. 
I believe the Prime Minister has something like a 34 year record. 
What did we see? 
We should hold him to that. 
Who will pay for the losses of these farmers? 
The agriculture minister bears full responsibility for that plan which went out to farmers. 
Mr. Speaker, I fail to see a quorum in the House. 
I wonder if you would take a count.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We have a quorum.  
It is only fair. 
It is only right. 
Why should farmers suffer due to the actions of other people?  
We will see the same old routine of the last 26 years. 
We will see how that works out in the future.  
We have covered the costs and the idea of final offer selection arbitration. 
It would seem to me they are a monopoly service. 
This closure that we are speaking on today is the 50th. 
If that is democracy, it is democracy being abused.  
We went through hours of amendments, some of which were very good. 
My friends in the Bloc, in fact, brought up the final offer selection arbitration. 
I thought that maybe that amendment would be one that would really improve this bill. 
What did we get? 
We saw the government members yell that great amendment down. 
I speak particularly of Ontario, because I am a little more familiar with it. 
The seaway is going to be opening up. 
Why could that not also have happened for the western farmers? 
These allegations border on a conflict of interest problem.  
Once again we see government interference. 
It is a strange method. 
I do not know why they have to be forced back to work. 
When they put up a picket line the other unions would not cross it.  
Now we see that the government understands that this is a problem. 
It was vital to get the grain moving. 
I have pointed out clearly where this government has fallen down. 
One last attempt to put in final offer selection arbitration will be made.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
They happen over and over again.  
It is certainly not the members of this House. 
There are no winners.  
My colleague from Selkirk talked about agriculture. 
This is about more than the farmers. 
The economy of Canada is quite dependent upon agriculture. 
Agriculture is still one of the largest employers in the Canadian economy. 
The spin-off effect from agriculture is huge.  
The government is certainly aware of that as well. 
It knows that we cannot hold up the grain shipments. 
I think we all agree with that.  
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The debate is on the amendment.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their understanding.  
But nothing has been done.  
Therefore, we have to go back to 1982.  
As for giving up responsibilities, I will give an example.  
There were complaints about erosion. 
Now there is are very serious problems. 
But now, the coast guard does not care. 
Apparently, there was devolution of this responsibility to municipalities. 
It all happens without discussion, vision or transparency. 
We have had it.  
It is just beginning. 
This is the only real concern of the government.  
Today, it prefers to legislate rather than negotiate. 
That is typical of this government. 
The farmers know it and the International Labour Organization knows it too. 
As a good manager, he should be worried. 
We mentioned him in our first speech. 
The member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell is a good example. 
Historically, he has always been very aggressive.  
What has become of his motivation today? 
What has become of his convictions? 
It will be nasty.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Madam Speaker, you seem to be full of energy this morning, just like me. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I will submit a copy to the clerk.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am referring of course to correctional officers, who work in prisons. 
Their right to a negotiated collective agreement was denied, rejected and trampled on. 
There will be a price to pay for this.  
This government has a rather ambiguous attitude. 
We will remember that. 
I cannot understand why the President of the Treasury Board acted the way he did.  
It will be, and it will have deserved what it gets.  
What is really at stake here? 
They do so under trying conditions. 
Contempt will be short lived.  
They cannot because they have not done it.  
Despite all the pressure, they have not moved on the issue; we will remember this. 
The obscure screams of the famous backbenchers will not change a thing. 
And the screams of the obscure backbenchers will not change a thing.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
On the issue of pay equity, this government's record is not good. 
All the members of the rat pack were mobilized on this issue.  
Can somebody tell us where we are today on this issue? 
Let us look at this government's record.  
And the President of the Treasury Board was the killer of those jobs.  
Was that done democratically? 
Was that done through negotiations? 
Was that done with respect for the workers? 
I also want to address another stigma. 
The Silence of the Lambs. 
Had it not been for the Bloc Quebecois, this would have gone unnoticed. 
That is the reality.  
I cannot say it strongly enough, it is a sad day. 
It is a very sad day, indeed. 
You have before you a concerned and sorrowful man. 
I know that certain government members went to law school. 
Let us talk about poverty. 
Who has solutions to propose for the fight against poverty? 
Certainly not members on the government side. 
I do not even want to look at them. 
Who has solutions to offer? 
The Bloc Quebecois has. 
My colleague from Shefford had also interesting things to say on this issue.  
In a few hours, I will be tabling an anti-poverty bill. 
What is in an anti-poverty bill? 
We will not tolerate that. 
We have a whole lot of solutions to propose on the subject of poverty. 
All we ask is a little attention. 
We do not think this is too much.  
We will continue to be this voice in Parliament.  
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP):
They remember the strikes of the twenties, thirties and forties. 
Not that that fight was not an important or necessary one. 
We are used to seeing the graveyards send ringing endorsements of Liberal candidates. 
Of course they are.  
What is so bad about that? 
It is a case of one rule for one and another for the other. 
While lower ranked staff are paid differential rates, their managers are not.  
Here is a challenge for the Liberal members. 
Equal pay, equal standards. 
What is so hard to deal with in those four words?  
Equality has gone out of favour in this country. 
No, this is not a surprise. 
We expect nothing different from this government. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member for St. John's West on debate.  
Give it to them, Charlie.  
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
One is its fundamental failure in how it runs this House. 
That is why we have been here for the last 24 hours.  
It is absolutely unfair and unacceptable. 
The government did not give the opposition the facts. 
It did not give us the truth as to what was really happening. 
What kind of logic is that?  
It was all done very wrongly. 
The whole collective bargaining process is now wrong for all public servants of Canada. 
That is a no-brainer. 
Who will go on strike? 
Who can go on strike? 
I will repeat today what I said yesterday. 
Certainly from our point of view not only salary issues are involved. 
I do not care about the business of disrupting labour markets. 
There are no jobs. 
In the last three years we have lost 30,000 Newfoundlanders. 
Is that labour market disruption? 
Those are the kinds of things that have to be negotiated through collective agreements.  
It is intimidation by the majority. 
It is a totally wrong process. 
It is a disgusting process.  
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
In my view, it was certainly unique. 
But the government went even further.  
One basic issue remains. 
What about the consequences? 
These 400 people are mechanics. 
These are people who make the lowest salaries in the federal public service.  
These people felt let down. 
I think this will certainly have an impact on their productivity.  
Did my employer show me any respect?'' 
These are all questions that people are asking.  
I think the aftermath is always difficult, in such cases. 
I think that is what happened. 
I raised several examples the other day. 
A few examples come to my mind. 
What kind of example is the government setting for employers today? 
Is it a positive one? 
This is a rather sad day for me. 
Has this government served voters well today? 
We get $5 and $10 bills from unions and individuals. 
These are nothing but pretexts. 
The government would have grabbed onto any pretext for accomplishing its ends. 
The Bloc Quebecois cannot, of course, subscribe to such a farce. 
Tonight we have been the spectators and performers in another performance, a dramatic comedy. 
The government turned up with offers at the last minute. 
We will continue with the legislation and we will take it to the very end''. 
I repeat, this was just adding insult to injury.  
People will go back to work. 
I find it unconscionable as I said yesterday. 
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
Somewhere along the line somebody is missing the boat. 
Somebody does not understand how the transportation system works. 
That is the key issue in my view. 
I think the government has completely ignored this issue.  
The matter of the grain handlers is only one small issue. 
This action taken by the government was unnecessary. 
The money was obviously there to satisfy those people.  
The work they do is dangerous. 
The support they have had from the government is almost non-existent. 
It is sad that it has come to that.  
If these people are essential workers, then treat them as essential workers. 
I urge the government to wake up. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Why is there a bargaining system in place? 
It begs the question.  
The government has completely turned its back on that system. 
It is a travesty of justice without question. 
The grain handlers are just an excuse for the government. 
There is something seriously wrong.  
The Liberals can blame it on the grain handlers or blame it on PSAC. 
It is very unfortunate.  
Madam Speaker, I agree with the concerns my friend has raised.  
The rail lines were not operating properly. 
The money was not there although taxes were high. 
We need action from the government on this very critical issue.  
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
This is what is happening. 
We are living in a democratic country. 
The prison guards are not on strike. 
I guess it got a pretty good deal, if we look at it that way.  
Madam Speaker, I think it is an outrage. 
It is as simple as that.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
Dan Sawatzky beat the case. 
Is that human rights abuse or what is it? 
I would like the member's impression on that.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
I want to address that issue further.  
After they had developed a market the government interfered. 
The government appealed that. 
Has the government dealt in good faith with anybody? 
People are being mistreated. 
People are in jail. 
What can we do? 
Why did people send us here? 
Why are we sitting back and allowing it to happen?  
There is a trial in Brandon, Manitoba, on the same issue. 
We have a prime example of what has happened over on that side. 
Why should people support it? 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members have risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
(The House divided on the amendment, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the amendment lost.  
Is the House ready for the question on the main motion?  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
Is it agreed the members are in?  
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
(Bill read the third time and passed) 
I express my thanks to all hon. members for their patience and their co-operation.  
(The House adjourned at 8.32 a.m.)
