EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 151 
Friday, November 6, 1998 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
According to this government the Senate did an excellent job.  
The government is prepared to support these amendments for the following reasons.  
The government also supports these amendments.  
These are goals which I am sure all Canadians support.  
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
The official opposition is grateful for the amendment put forward by our colleague from Crowfoot. 
However, this amendment has not swayed our opposition to the bill. 
It has simply made it more palatable. 
The Reform Party still stands firmly opposed to Bill C-37.  
These findings, released by Statistics Canada, were derived from the 1996 census.  
As pointed out by the Liberal senator this will: 
Section 100 of the 1867 Constitution Act states in part: 
The real intent (of Bill C-37) is to remove parliament from the process.... 
I will turn specifically to the amendments put forward by the Senate. 
It would, Estey said: 
Clause 6 establishes the judicial compensation and benefits commission. 
Specifically we take issue with section (1.1)(a) which reads: 
What exactly does this mean? 
How expansive are the powers of the commission? 
In fact Mr. Scott went so far as to say: 
Bill C-37, as originally introduced, meets that legal obligation. 
Senate Amendment No. 3 is therefore unnecessary.  
In closing, I reiterate the Reform Party's position. 
We stand opposed to Senate Amendment No. 3. 
We stand opposed to the concurrence motion.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
It is often said that what is clearly understood can be clearly expressed. 
With this in mind, let me outline the Bloc Quebecois' position. 
We oppose Bill C-37. 
On October 22, the Senate made eight amendments to the bill. 
In our view, these explicit criteria are positive and fair.  
The bill also establishes the Judicial Benefits and Compensation Commission.  
The Bloc Quebecois puts other priorities ahead of raising judges' salaries. 
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
I said that this bill was very similar to that sauce.  
I sit on the custody and access committee. 
Again this means longer waiting times for court hearings. 
I do not blame the RCMP officers for this. 
This country has some very good judges. 
I do not want to diminish that for a moment. 
There are hundreds of good judges in this country.  
That appointment met with considerable criticism in the province. 
It was not the only one.  
We need to have a discussion about this. 
This was a missed opportunity.  
It is too bad that the government could not have supported them. 
It did support one of those amendments. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Clause 6 of the proposed amendments will for the most part strengthen the judiciary. 
An example of this is in Quebec where common law marriages are not recognized. 
Narrowing the scope eliminates the possibility for difficulty and confusion down the road. 
We have previously debated the important question of the separation of power in society. 
We as parliamentarians are elected as opposed to appointed judges. 
Is the House ready for the question?  
The question is on the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
FIRST NATIONS LAND MANAGEMENT ACT 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will continue my delivery from yesterday. 
I was discussing some of the many injustices that have taken place in the past. 
Let us go back 10 years.  
That is an injustice. 
It is a national debt.  
It has gone into reserve. 
The RMs are not quarrelling about the acquisition of land. 
The quarrel is with this government. 
What happens to the remaining farmers in that area? 
They have to have their taxes raised considerably in order to provide the same services.  
That is key to the survival of rural Saskatchewan. 
I was 20 years on local government. 
What did we have to do? 
We had to prepare a financial budget. 
There are certain checks and balances.  
We would not want to turn back the hands of time. 
That is the big question facing Canadians.  
This is a problem facing all Canadians at this time. 
How will we handle this? 
What are we doing with the series of legislation bills which will be forthcoming?  
I am very much at home there. 
We were both teachers there. 
Our roots go a long way back. 
I got back to some of the people I still know there. 
It is time for us not to proceed any further in land negotiations. 
I hate to interrupt you in midstream. 
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
This year they chose Canada. 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
One wonders how they became Canadians in the first place.  
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
CANADIAN FILM CENTRE LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD 
Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
I am pleased to rise today to congratulate Mr. Jewison on his award.  
THE PARLIAMENT OF CANADA 
Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
This is a sad and shameful chapter in our military history.  
Time is running out. 
I call upon this government to immediately deal with this national injustice.  
THE NISGA'A AGREEMENT 
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, today is a very important day. 
The hon. member for Jonquiere. 
SEMAINE MONDIALE DE LA MARIONNETTE 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
The hon. member for Gatineau.  
Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau, Lib.):
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, aboriginal people are speaking up. 
The comments are even more illuminating. 
But lo and behold, look behind you. 
Our own backyard seems to be gathering quite a bit of political garbage''.  
The people most in need are still waiting.  
Grassroots native people are fed up with mismanagement by their leaders. 
JOB CREATION IN QUEBEC 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
We have had enough demagoguery from the Liberals. 
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
FRANCOPHONE AND ACADIAN COMMUNITIES 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
The francophone and Acadian communities symbolize these roots. 
For too long, these communities relied only on their vitality to grow.  
The Official Languages Act made them grow faster. 
These communities have given themselves strong institutions. 
But the Liberals have cut funding for francophone organizations by 40%.  
The Liberals can no longer ignore their obligations. 
They must reinvest to ensure the development of Canada's francophone and Acadian communities.  
ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN QUEBEC 
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the leader of the Parti Quebecois has had yet another change of heart.  
Such expediency on the part of a leader who slurps at everyone's trough. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
These poor yields have resulted in economic hardship for our farming community. 
Many farmers will have to re-seed in 1999 to produce new growth. 
In extreme cases producers have been forced to sell out.  
We can ill-afford to lose another farmer in my constituency. 
Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne-Blainville, BQ):
These men returning from hell were convinced this war was the last. 
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
When the new plant is operational it will create 32 jobs. 
Surely this is not a good investment. 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Would it be Pluto?  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Since 1994 each and every year we have reduced EI premiums. 
We will continue this debate. 
No decisions have been made. 
We will continue to focus on Canadian priorities.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I was aware that I was not paying EI premiums. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will continue to say that we will reflect Canadian priorities. 
The EI question is part of that mix.  
They ask us to invest in Canadian priorities. 
They ask us to deal with the tax system we have in the country. 
They ask us to reinvest in health care.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
That is the point we are trying to get across to the government.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
Businesses need some time to adjust to the new tax levels.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, once again the Reform Party has it all wrong. 
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
I would ask for a more complete answer. 
Why is there a delay in the announcement of the rates? 
Why does he hurt business planning to serve a political agenda? 
I ask him to justify the choice of one over the other.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I guess we should also look at the bigger picture. 
We have numbers that are improving. 
Canadians are back to work and they are full time jobs.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
The minister's answer is far from reassuring. 
It wants the provinces to do what it says, and no questions asked. 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Health. 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
I find that far from reassuring.  
Yet the federal government has done everything it can to help the Government of Quebec. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
The hon. the leader of the government in the House.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is quite wrong when she makes such allegations. 
Hopefully we as Canadians will all be behind them as they march through this journey.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the Nisga'a agreement was signed on August 4. 
The Prime Minister chose to be absent. 
We have scarcely heard a word since from the Prime Minister.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
They have been a disappointment to the farmers and the industry.  
The minister said then that GRIP and NISA were not enough. 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
The message was very clear. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Once again they gave agriculture short shrift.  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
I suggest that the member check Hansard . 
I was proven to be correct.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member and his party keep talking about lowering taxes. 
They do not seem to realize that we have lowered taxes. 
How would they wish to address that?  
Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):
Canadian farmers are trapped in a net farm income crunch. 
Unfair trade practices and foreign subsidies are bringing farmers to their knees.  
What does the minister mean you cannot plan? 
The minister is a farmer- 
The hon. minister of agriculture.  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
The hon. member for Charlesbourg.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have spoken to this many times in the House. 
They deserve to have their day. 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
He is in a tighter spot than ever.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
I stand by that statement.  
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
The Department of Natural Resources has $10 million designated for- 
If the parliamentary secretary wants to address the comment, he may.  
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am not sure of the full context of the question. 
A statement was made so I will answer it with a simple statement.  
Canadian forest practices are among the best in the world. 
That ensures we have export markets. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
This is driving B.C. into a recession. 
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
ICE BREAKING IN PORTS 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. 
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Canadian taxpayers are paying 82% of the costs of ice breaking. 
We do have a cost recovery program in place. 
The industry is benefiting extensively by that.  
He is not talking about that. 
As well when a ship comes to the St. Lawrence- 
The hon. member for Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans.  
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, obviously the parliamentary secretary does not know what he is talking about. 
I will try putting it a different way.  
Does he realize this?  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, far from it. 
As I said earlier, 82% of the cost is covered by the Canadian taxpayer. 
The member opposite should be thanking us for that support.  
There is strong support from the port community in terms of what we are doing.  
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
When is he going to fix the problem for this ill and elderly woman?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let me fill the member in on the facts.  
Health Canada investigated the original complaint. 
The hon. member should be assured that Health Canada is looking after the problem.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
This government will ensure that that role is strengthened in the future.  
Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Health. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
This is the position of the Government of Canada, and it is a- 
The member for Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke.  
KUALA LUMPUR APEC MEETING 
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the very astute member for his question.  
The hon. member for Lakeland.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Well, we can plan.  
That is exactly what is happening now. 
What will the minister do now to deal- 
The hon. minister of agriculture.  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
The question of funding for the RCMP in British Columbia was discussed.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
It will take the resolute action of this government. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Reports from Buenos Aires state the opposite. 
Why is the government forcing our environmental responsibility on to other countries?  
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, first of all, the member is not correct.  
I hope the member will join us in that work.  
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Does the minister condone this practice by Canada Post?  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the budget of Canada Post has been viable since 1988.  
It provides quality service and it does it fairly and without cheating. 
Mr. Carmen Provenzano (Sault Ste. Marie, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Revenue.  
Ms. Beth Phinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, fairness is a fundamental and core value of public service. 
The department is committed to fairness.  
Revenue Canada is considered a world leader among its peers. 
Its fairness practices have been implemented around the world.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this government understands very well its obligations to aboriginal Canadians. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
I would appreciate a clearer response today.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
CAPE BRETON DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION 
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Will the government commit to opening the Donkin mine, yes or no? 
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
The other members of the union- 
The hon. member for Cumberland-Colchester.  
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
It is an incredible precedent to set.  
The hon. Minister of Labour.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
My hon. colleague must have the answer.  
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the President of Treasury Board.  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I do not think the member can do that. 
It was a good try. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau, Lib.):
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
FIRST NATIONS LAND MANAGEMENT ACT 
The hon. member has the floor.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Canadians want to know if we have changed the meaning of rule of law. 
From time to time we hear the term self-government. 
If we ask a municipal official, he will tell us what self-government means. 
Everybody needs to know.  
We have introduced a bill. 
It does not give them the authority from the bottom up. 
It does not give them the right to control. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
He could then make his decision when the bill comes back for third reading.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his comments. 
That is exactly what I am talking about. 
There are six Indian groups, six reserves, in my constituency. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague's intervention on this subject. 
We do not want small nations within a nation. 
Mr. Speaker, I certainly will take the message back. 
I will go out with that message. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
I would like to see it move ahead in that way.  
Mr. Speaker, that is a good question. 
No one disputes that. 
They want control over the development of business. 
No one disputes that. 
I live in Canada. 
They have to be the same.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
All other levels of government have to be at lower levels to the federal government. 
All governments and all laws have to be subject to the House.  
It had a lot of good features to it. 
I will deal with some of their concerns in my speech today. 
It should have included built-in democratic guarantees to all aboriginal people. 
That would seem to be pretty basic to any self-governing democracy. 
This was brought to my attention many times, over and over again. 
When there are hereditary chiefs we do not have a democracy.  
They were a fact of life of aboriginal people. 
True democratic institutions are what are required by aboriginal people. 
That could have been built into all agreements with our aboriginal people. 
Without it there is no accountability of elected officials who manage agreements.  
How can people be governed and assess- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I do not see a quorum. 
It is a very important piece of legislation and we should have a quorum.  
And the count having been taken: 
I see a quorum.  
They see a gigantic gap between rich and poor. 
This opposition to self-government includes women's rights. 
Bill C-49 deals with land management. 
The framework agreement grants these powers of self-government in two primary ways. 
Clause 37 is particularly questionable. 
However, it certainly seems it will have that effect. 
I would like to see an all encompassing application of Canadian law to aboriginal peoples. 
That is what they are basically demanding and asking for. 
We lay them out in our own words.  
I had a meeting in Winnipeg on October 31. 
I heard the same thing.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
I would like to question the member on that.  
What is the Reform Party position? 
The first nations involved have endorsed this process. 
It seems to be a contradiction.  
They tried Indian affairs. 
The last one was on October 31. 
I saw a member from the Manitoba legislature. 
One of the Progressive Conservative members saw fit to come and contribute to the meeting. 
How many countries do we have in Canada? 
Do we have one country? 
We also have to clarify just where the process is going to end up. 
I have done that because I believe this is a great country. 
It can stand improvement in areas, certainly in the financial and spending areas. 
Their complaints reflect exactly what I am saying. 
They do not feel that self-government is going to protect them. 
They have stated in the letter exactly why that is the case. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
I am not quite sure where the member for the NDP was coming from. 
I actually believe the bill provides for this. 
I do not believe the bill does that.  
The difficulty is that there cannot be accountability without transparency. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, what we are doing here is reversing the roles. 
Really what he was doing was questioning our position on this. 
The reason for this is to provide the opportunity to get it right. 
Perhaps that is why I am so slow all the time. 
It is very, very important to get it right.  
In this instance, this legislation has a lot of flaws. 
We split up people and start pitting them against each other.  
The Constitution provides special treatment for Canada's aboriginal peoples. 
That is in our Constitution. 
In essence we would have the federal government and the municipality.  
Unfortunately there has been a great misuse of language in the debate. 
I find that unacceptable.  
We want to have some say in our lives in that context.  
It is not trying to create sovereign states. 
We are embarking on uncharted territory. 
The legislation may have flaws. 
What legislation that comes before the House does not have flaws? 
I have found one area of concern. 
Economy of words is something that is in my repetoire.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
People have explained what the legislation says. 
Reform MPs have expressed their concerns about it.  
When I speak about improved accountability I am talking about the area of fiscal accountability. 
Some of the calls were very disturbing.  
He said they could not live like that. 
They could not go on like that. 
Many drove new cars. 
They seemed to have money. 
I did not really know what to do. 
I asked what we could do. 
They expressed the desperate need for something to be done. 
They were in a crisis situation. 
The things I heard were not uncommon to us. 
We hear them all the time.  
One member left shortly after so we had three aboriginal people and me. 
We went through a three step process. 
We listened to 55 people in this confidential way. 
I will never forget in my lifetime what I heard from these people. 
I heard articulate people express their concerns about what was happening. 
They gave the task force recommendations as to what they thought should happen. 
It was am experience I will truly never forget. 
I am thankful to those people, some of whom I believe are my friends now. 
I did that and received over 50 responses. 
The third phase was to hold public meetings. 
I held three public meetings in the constituency. 
The largest meeting was in St. Paul with about 70 aboriginals in attendance. 
It is the town nearest to two of the reserves. 
That was the process.  
There were three aboriginal people on the task force and me. 
She has worked as a social worker for at least 20 years. 
The second member was Gina Russell from the Cold Lake First Nation. 
She also works at the friendship centre in Cold Lake. 
It gets no government money and it is doing good work. 
I commend both these women for the work they are doing.  
He has an incredible background. 
He was a member and supervisor of the Lac La Biche-St. 
His background is absolutely noteworthy.  
I have talked about why I initiated the task force. 
We heard many concerns and complaints. 
Many were aimed at chiefs and councils. 
These people got beyond that. 
They gave us recommendations for change that would improve the system. 
That is what I want to focus on.  
I would like to first talk about five of the nine recommendations. 
In category one we talked about financial accountability. 
This information must be freely available to all members and to the general public. 
These recommendations are not all supported by Reform policy. 
I do not support completely all the recommendations. 
But I was not there to put a Reform platform into this process. 
That was the first recommendation. 
That was heard from several participants. 
Mr. Favel went on to say: ``All the money benefits are certain family groups. 
Mr. Favel in his presentation spelled it out about as clearly as one can. 
The way the money is spent on his reserve is not right at all. 
The money is not getting to the people most in need.  
They made no excuse for this. 
But they need help to properly account for funding. 
This is from George Forsyth from the Onion Lake Band. 
This is exactly what this piece of legislation is doing. 
I was clearly getting the message they were concerned about the movement toward self-government. 
This was a meeting recorded by two television cameras. 
They are concerned that is not what is happening.  
The other task force members reinforced that. 
This was very simple.  
We have been talking about it. 
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
This agreement creates no protocol. 
There needs to be protocol. 
It has nothing to do with what should be here. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his questions.  
With regard to the issue of transparency, I have eight reserves in my constituency. 
We also had people participating from four Metis settlements. 
In every single case there were many concerns expressed about a lack of transparency.  
That is something that was made very clear again and again. 
That is something that has to start happening.  
That has not happened.  
ACCESS TO INFORMATION ACT 
The bill was amended with some reluctance. 
I think all has been said that there is to say. 
Once again I would like to thank all members.  
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Even the former information commissioner has said so in his most recent report.  
His Progressive Conservative government introduced such legislation in 1979.  
I encourage all members to do so. 
I take this opportunity to thank all the members of the justice committee.  
Without doubt, Bill C-208 is short but its importance greatly exceeds its length. 
The bill would add an offence to the Access to Information Act. 
This flexibility also applies to the possible maximum penalty.  
Canadians have been the beneficiaries of a federal Access to Information Act since 1983. 
She declared that her bill was about accountability. 
The bill before us today remedies that shortcoming.  
Bill C-208 would prevent this.  
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
I wish to begin by commending the bill. 
Clearly, manipulation of documents in this manner is not an acceptable operating principle. 
Accountability is the essence of Bill C-208.  
Bill C-208 ensures this outcome.

This is the basis of Bill C-208.  
Is the House ready for the question?  
The question is on the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.

That concludes Private Members' Business for this day.  
It is a date we might remember.  
I do not think any of us present today were here on that occasion.  
Have a nice week away, my colleagues.  
(The House adjourned at 1.51 p.m.)
