Thursday, April 15, 1999 
The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Montfort Hospital of Ottawa 
Hon. Jean-Robert Gauthier :
Suspicion that the negotiating process was futile was thus confirmed.  
Improvements were therefore needed.  
Without that minimum, the hospital cannot carry out its teaching mandate adequately.  
The Montfort crisis has now reached a decisive phase. 
This week, we turned to the courts.  
Nothing will change so long as the matter is before the courts.  
Hon. Catherine S. Callbeck :
One particular municipality is celebrating its bicentennial this year. 
Promotion for the bicentennial is obviously key. 
International Assembly of French-Speaking Parliamentarians 
Visit by Canadian Delegation to Louisiana 
Hon. Rose-Marie Losier-Cool :
Back then, the parish was called Saint-Charles-aux-Mines. 
He was not an Acadian.  
Honourable senators, as Cajuns in Louisiana say "Let the good times roll."  
Contributions of the Black Battalion in World War I 
Hon. Calvin Woodrow Ruck :
These men served their country and deserve recognition. 
We will continue to go to Pictou to honour those men. 
Many of our young men are now in the military forces. 
We have people who have risen to the rank of lieutenant-colonel. 
Now we do have commissioned officers.  
We love this country. 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The leader has said that Canada is consulting. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
My question to the Leader of the Government is:
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I did not indicate that Canada had put forward a resolution. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Perhaps I am wrong.  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
The newspaper says that she "struck a defiant tone." 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I would regard that as purely speculative.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Let us pass the bill. 
Why have all these hearings when we are in favour of the concept? 
We are in favour of cultural protection for our country and our magazines in particular. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I refer to Bill C-40 and Bill C-43. 
There has also been talk of amendments on other pieces of legislation. 
The point is that this bill is a very special bill. 
It is not an ordinary bill. 
I am using the minister's own words:
Let us stop being bullied around. 
The longer we wait, the weaker we appear. 
Stretch the hearings right through to June if you want. 
When will that be?  
Unlike our predecessors, we act in a very democratic way.  
She said emphatically they were not taking place and that discussions were ongoing. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I am not aware of any ongoing negotiations. 
It was not the best likeness of the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
Could the leader perhaps explain what the difference is between negotiations and discussions? 
That would not be a negotiation, it would be a discussion. 
Hon. Jean-Claude Rivest :
This bad project is still around and the money is available.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I, too, have seen and heard the news. 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
I do not think we gave you the opportunity to elaborate. 
I would like to give you that opportunity today. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
We are very cognizant of the feelings of the people of Russia. 
I emphasized and underlined yesterday the close relationship between Canada and Russia. 
We are continuing a very close dialogue.  
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I am not sure of the exact contents of the discussion. 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
NATO's strategic concept will be on the agenda. 
It is a very important political document. 
What is Canada's position? 
Do we want to keep the current strategic concept? 
If we want another one, what should it include?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Possible Retirement of Wayne Gretzky-appointment to Hall of Fame 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, perhaps I may be permitted to reflect just a little? 
I am interested in seeing the game tonight. 
However, I started canvassing too late. 
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I have, indeed, asked that question. 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
That has not come within my purview of discussions. 
However, I shall attempt to obtain an appropriate answer for the honourable senator.  
I have not discussed this with him. 
I would be prepared to initiate those talks as soon as possible.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, we would certainly welcome that kind of initiative. 
I thank the Leader of the Government for his efforts in that regard.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I was not specific with respect to ministers. 
On that point as well, I received a positive response. 
Whether or not it would be ministers at the outset, I could not guarantee. 
However, I think we are taking a step in the right direction.  
Honourable senators, we would be happy to collaborate with our colleagues on the government side. 
However, in times like these we recognize the tremendous extra burden that ministers are under. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Would the minister respond, please?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
We support the position put forward by the Secretary-General of the United Nations. 
That position is supported by Canada.  
The General Assembly is not in session at the moment. 
However, an emergency session could be called under its rules.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I am not aware that consideration has been given to that particular point. 
Some reservations have been expressed by certain countries. 
However, they are still on the table.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
It is Mr. Barry Gorlick, President of the Canadian Bar Association.  
I am sure my colleagues will permit a small parochial note:
Mr. Gorlick is from Winnipeg, in the great province of Manitoba.  
Permission having been granted to revert to Senators' Statements.  
That is of some interest. 
Tours of the Supreme Court and the Federal Court of Canada are offered in Ottawa.  
Canada Customs and Revenue Agency Bill 
Third Reading-Motions in Amendment-Debate Adjourned 
First, the minister told us that he would continue to be accountable. 
We will not be the only ones watching. 
Garth Whyte of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business said: 
Then, honourable senators, there is the matter of the user fees. 
Levon Markaroglu of the Customs Brokers Association of Canada told us: 
Is that a coincidence?  
Owen Lippert of the Fraser Institute noted: 
We have been promised cost savings and simpler tax administration. 
Nor are we alone in our scepticism. 
Walter Robinson of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation told us: 
I reiterate that, to the best of our knowledge, no province has signed on.  
Your guess is as good as mine.  
The new agency will be subject to the Access to Information Act. 
However, Revenue Canada has been notoriously bad in complying with this law. 
It is far from being an open department. 
I feel it will give less control.  
Finally, the minister told us: 
I have no intention of leaving them in the lurch. 
Vacancies will be filled faster. 
Recourse options will be more accessible and efficient.  
Ms Stewart told us: 
Honourable senators, when does this government intend to fix the system?  
Then we have the matter of federal-provincial relations. 
The "big brother" issue must also be remembered. 
I trust the minister and I trust 99.99 per cent of his officials. 
It has happened in the past, as we know. 
This, too, we will be watching.  
Tax collection agreements can be reached without an agency. 
Revenue Canada's personnel problems would be fixed without an agency. 
There is no need for this agency.  
I would even say it is an essential public service. 
That is the first criterion of selection for the public service. 
It mattered little if you could perform a job. 
I share those concerns. 
That must be fixed. 
It must ensure that its human resources plan incorporates the merit principle.  
Bill C-43 imperils this noble tradition. 
That is why I propose, honourable senators, an amendment.  
Honourable senators, I move, seconded by Senator Beaudoin: 
(3) The Commissioner must exercise the"; and 
(b) by renumbering all cross-references accordingly.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion in amendment?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those honourable senators opposed to the motion in amendment please say "nay"?  
The Hon. the Speaker:
In my opinion, the "nays" have it.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
I assumed that there would be participants to the debate on the other side. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Third Reading-Motions in Amendment-Debate Adjourned 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I refer honourable senators to the Debates of the Senate of yesterday, page 3033. 
He repeats later on: 
I agree with the honourable senator.  
Therefore, we can proceed with the debate.  
I declare that debate can continue.  
I wish to point out that Senator Grafstein exhausted his 45 minutes yesterday. 
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Honourable senators, I intend to be very brief. 
They had raised some questions.  
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Honourable senators, I move: 
The first amendment, honourable senators, refers to clause 44, pages 17 and 18. 
I am prepared to read the amendments in total. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I have a couple of questions for Senator Grafstein. 
They concern his address to us.  
If the honourable senator agrees, could we have leave to table that document?  
It is a short memorandum. 
I am in the Senate's hands on that question. 
The memorandum is not long. 
I thank the honourable senator for that. 
I appreciate the response from my honourable friend.  
Perhaps we could have a copy of that correspondence?  
Let me tell you what those documents are. 
I would certainly again undertake to facilitate the delivery of that material to the senator. 
That is what gave rise to a question from our colleague Senator Bolduc. 
Thus, I would ask the honourable senator if he would comply with my request.  
Honourable senators, this raises another matter:
Nevertheless, the matter must be clean.  
I believe they will be self-explanatory. 
I am not sure one can conclude whether they are contradictory or not. 
We spent a fair amount of time on this matter yesterday. 
I have made these amendments and tabled them. 
They are fairly simple in principle. 
The fundamentals are fairly clear. 
The drafting is another question; however, I believe that the questions are clear. 
My personal preference would be to proceed with the debate. 
The principles of my view are quite clear.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, the issue before us goes beyond the bill itself:
His Honour will rule on that shortly. 
It also involves the accuracy of the representation of the judge's comments. 
Bill C-40 has attracted strong support from the current Chief Prosecutor, Louise Arbour.  
It could be that Madam Arbour does not favour this bill. 
Honourable senators, I have a question of Senator Grafstein. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
I have but a few more things to say. 
Continuing with the same quotation: 
Honourable senators, let me be absolutely clear. 
I thank the Honourable Senator Milne for raising the question. 
The issue remains tangential.  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, my question is to Senator Grafstein. 
My question for Senator Grafstein is:
No, honourable senators, that is not my view. 
Mr. Greenspan did not opine directly on those particular amendments. 
However, I wished to table them as another view.  
That is the subject-matter before the house. 
That is the subject-matter with which I should like to proceed.  
I thank honourable senators for listening so carefully to my concerns. 
I characterized the two issues carefully yesterday. 
I hope other senators will also amplify whether or not they agree with those propositions. 
I am satisfied with that. 
I believe we have enough information here. 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
I should like to ask the honourable senator a question. 
He then went on to talk about these amendments.  
That was not the committee's position, nor is it my position. 
However, I want to know if you are tying those two issues together.  
Honourable senators, I think they are tied together, but yet they are separate.  
First, let me tie them together. 
That is well known, and I take it as a fact.  
Justice delayed is justice denied. 
It is to be hoped that we can learn from the past.  
That was my purpose. 
I think I made that clear by differentiating the two.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
On motion of Senator Carstairs, for Senator Bryden, debate adjourned.  
Merchant Navy War Service Recognition Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I yield to Senator Atkins.  
Hon. Norman K. Atkins :
On May 19, 1941, the Government of Canada stated: 
Merchant mariners were treated as prisoners of war by multinational agreement after 1942.  
Bill S-19 does not spend money. 
Clause 3 sets out the purpose of Bill S-19: 
There should not be any second-class war veterans in Canada. 
On motion of Senator Carstairs, debate adjourned.  
Privileges, Standing Rules and Orders 
Consideration of Ninth Report of Committee-Debate Continued 
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I move the adjournment of the debate.  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
He will be there and we will not. 
We will not be there and he will.  
Honourable senators, this is a complete report. 
We may agree or disagree, but we must take cognizance of it. 
May we ask him when we can participate?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Those opposed to the adjournment motion, please say "nay."  
The Hon. the Speaker :
In my opinion, the yeas have it.  
On motion of Senator Kinsella, debate adjourned, on division.  
Consideration of Report of Special Committee-Motion in Amendment-Debate Continued 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
They have covered virtually all of the areas in contention. 
I simply wanted to add my comments and my support for this report.  
They had their work cut out for them. 
I wish to thank the committee members for their diligent study in this area. 
We expected to have some difficulty with the intrigue surrounding the subject-matter. 
We also owe a debt of gratitude to all the officials. 
Their answers were facilitating. 
I believe they served Canada well in this area.  
The sphere of activity has enlarged greatly. 
That contact is now virtually unnecessary. 
I believe the report addresses the accountability issue in great length. 
We are demanding more accountability from our officials and, in fact, are getting it. 
Those who work within CSIS and the RCMP are also concerned about that possibility. 
At the same time, the situation could turn within minutes. 
I want to underscore in this report my greatest concern. 
I feel that the Americans overstate the situation. 
We are more receptive to people coming into our country. 
We are a much more open society. 
This is something about which we should be aware. 
The ability to move funds by electronic means is phenomenal. 
Cellular telephones and new-age machinery is being developed on a daily basis. 
The tracking of these means is not the same. 
In many cases, telephones are passe. 
The type of technology that officials are using now is way beyond that.  
We need the capacity and the capability to rebut that activity. 
I am pleased to say that they are. 
They are keeping in touch with other agencies around the world. 
They are trying to build the linkages that will help our system here in Canada. 
What is missing is the manpower to do the job fully.  
Honourable senators, we need to work on our alert systems. 
We need to work more fully, and in a coordinated way, with other agencies. 
You will see in the report recommendations in this regard. 
My first concern is with Recommendation No. 13, which states: 
This is the area which caused me the greatest problem. 
It is a way for them to learn more about Canada. 
It is important that we thwart this kind of activity within the voluntary sector. 
I believe that is inappropriate. 
We are also aware that a number of these people do intimidate. 
They do it quite well and quite surreptitiously. 
We did not want to reinforce or support that activity.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted for the honourable senator to continue her remarks?  
I believe our Recommendation No. 13 should be read in that light. 
The second recommendation I wished to comment upon was Recommendation No. 33. 
It would have the capacity to become very pro forma. 
Is there a more efficient or unique way in which this can be done? 
We only touched on that aspect in the report. 
They will be seen in a more positive light. 
Nothing in the report should be seen to the contrary.  
It was his insistence and persistence that made this report possible.  
I believe the report is worthy of a reading. 
In particular, I would encourage the Government of Canada to act upon it. 
I would commend them to continue along that line.  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Having said that, CSIS is now in place. 
Time has passed, and we have two agencies. 
On the ground, CSIS and the RCMP do work together. 
Those are the ones we hear about. 
They have rules in place, and protocols are being used to cover these areas.  
I think it would be destructive at this point in time, not constructive.  
On motion of Senator Corbin, debate adjourned.  
Statement of Minister of Finance-Inquiry-Debate Continued 
I wish to address three deficiencies in the recent budget. 
Partial de-indexing has outlived its usefulness. 
Several OECD countries have used it. 
Some abandoned indexation entirely.  
High rates of inflation disappeared years ago. 
All that remains of partial de-indexation is its negative aspects. 
What were the consequences? 
To cite one example:
That hidden tax increase came about in two ways. 
These are statistics for which I have documentation. 
Now it is time to end partial de-indexing.  
Income taxes will dip a small amount, then begin their steady climb. 
There is another matter in which this budget is deficient. 
The government knows full well that the climate is changing.  
The water level of Lake Ontario dropped by more than a metre. 
What is the action to confront this major issue? 
The action is creating tables. 
The Kyoto deadline is just 11 years away. 
Red Book I said: 
They might agree on measures for so-called "immediate" implementation. 
Most of all, this is just talk. 
The time for action is now.  
I merely want to cite one comment on this situation. 
In June, they delivered their message to the Prime Minister. 
The time for action is now.  
The nub of the problem is inadequate supply. 
The Quebec government says it intends to meet the demand. 
Parents in other provinces are unlikely to be as lucky. 
A difficult situation will grow worse unless the federal government intervenes. 
Indeed, we have stasis. 
On the tax side, we are moving by way of "bracket creep." 
It is time for change.  
On motion of Senator LeBreton, debate adjourned.  
Response of Government to Requests and Recommendations-Inquiry-Order Stands 
Honourable Senator Prud'homme, P.C. ). 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
We know the rules. 
I hope my honourable colleagues use them. 
I know that some people have strong views on the subject. 
We live in a democracy. 
Honourable Senator Graham, P.C. ) 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
As Prime Minister Chretien said: 
In this respect, UN-building was Canada-building. 
The Canadian human security agenda is an ambitious one. 
It will demand much patience and much forbearance. 
Until this time, the council had defined those threats exclusively in military terms. 
These actions also demonstrate how much is to be done in the future. 
Reform is urgently needed.  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, I have a question. 
My question is to the minister. 
When will Canada stand up at the UN? 
We were very generous with someone's land. 
I respect that resolution. 
We have not pushed that any further.  
From time to time, individual Canadian parliamentarians are invited to be there.  
It was edited by Clyde Sanger. 
There is a picture of him and former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. 
I commend the reading of this particular book to all honourable senators. 
I will return it to the library shortly. 
I used it as a reference point.  
I look forward to other honourable senators participating in this very important debate.  
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
He tied them to the United Nations and to Canada's role. 
I was following the speech very closely. 
That is what the universal declaration is all about. 
I should like to know the honourable senator's view on this subject. 
On motion of Senator Andreychuk, debate adjourned.  
The public opinion polls have shown that a majority of Canadians support the bombing. 
I have received several hundred responses. 
The NATO bombing must be stopped. 
Not because it lacks Security Council approval. 
Not because that would end the killing and ethnic cleansing. 
Bombing doesn't work.  
I do not imagine that the government will take up that suggestion. 
It was an overflowing audience that was not ambivalent at all. 
I leave that to others in the Senate who may want to address that issue.  
Commerce in Europe is now being severely affected. 
All the neighbouring countries of Yugoslavia have been destabilized. 
They stated that thousands of farms have been destroyed, abandoned or left untended. 
This disruption of commerce, coming on top of the human tragedy, is itself bad enough. 
Indeed, that is imperilling the non-proliferation conference of 2000. 
All of this is a consequence of what is going on.  
We do not know what the results of this European plan will be. 
Thus, honourable senators, we come to the role and, indeed, the dilemma of Canada. 
He explained in that place what Canada is doing. 
I see that I am probably coming to the end of my time. 
If honourable senators will give me three or four minutes, I will then conclude.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Thank you, honourable senators, for your courtesy to me.  
This action is not good enough. 
We are, in the presentation of our work as Canadians, caught in a dilemma. 
I think, here, we should face up to this. 
All that is on the one hand.  
Now the Cold War is over, and NATO has been searching for a new role. 
Of course, the expansion of NATO is part of that.  
That, honourable senators, is a role for the United Nations. 
The conflict is particularly apparent in the issue of nuclear weapons. 
The United Nations wants to eliminate them; NATO says they are essential. 
Honourable senators, they are in conflict. 
I would leave aside nuclear weapons. 
What is this NATO mandate today? 
We will not be able to fudge much longer. 
We must decide where our pre-eminent allegiance lies. 
That, honourable senators, is the dilemma that we face as Canadians.  
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
The senator places before us not only a conflict but a dilemma. 
I think it was UNAFOR.  
What should we have done when we found out?  
In fact, he did that. 
I think is was called Operation Horseshoe. 
He planned this in advance of the NATO bombings.  
What do we do about the human suffering and the ethnic cleansing in the interim? 
Obviously, we will ask that question.  
What is one to do in the face of evil?  
Let me go back in history. 
The senator will recall this. 
There was a chance in - 
I apologize, senators, but there is a history here.  
Speak to the inquiry, then.  
Perhaps the senator will respond to that question, and I will add one more footnote.  
Italy moved against Ethiopia.  
Honourable senators, I rise on a point of order. 
After a senator's speech, the Senate provides for a period for questions and answers. 
Senator Grafstein is participating in the debate without debating.  
I will come back to that later. 
What was one to do?  
He began by asking what we should have done. 
Well, what should we have done in Rwanda? 
What should we have done in Somalia? 
Given some strength, it could play a stronger role.  
We must build an architecture which will guarantee peace and security. 
Hon. John B. Stewart :
Well, we did not have such a UN force. 
It seems to me that, in those circumstances, something else had to be done.  
I thank Senator Stewart for his question. 
The technical reason for the bombing is to save the Rambouillet agreement. 
The Rambouillet agreement is dead. 
Honourable senators,I thank the honourable senator for that answer. 
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
Honourable senators, I would also like to ask Senator Roche a question.  
They intentionally ignored the UN. 
Honourable senators, I thank Senator Taylor for that question. 
However, their lack of confidence is well known. 
On motion of Senator Andreychuk, debate adjourned.  
Take, for example, the rights to freedom of assembly and expression. 
This is what is meant by "self-executory" rights.  
In the event that those rights are violated, there are sanctions. 
That, however, is a topic for another day.  
I invite my colleagues to join in the debate on this very important issue. 
We must not sit back and let that happen. 
On motion of Senator Forrestall, debate adjourned.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Fernand Robichaud (The Hon. the Acting Speaker) :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, I do not know how this place wants to function. 
There are enough senators who do not want to do anything. 
For once, you have three or four volunteers. 
I do not understand why you keep postponing and postponing.  
Cape Breton Development Corporation 
Motion for Production of Documents Relevant to Proposed Privatization-Order Stands 
( d ) minutes of departmental, inter-departmental and other meetings; and 
Honourable Senator Graham, P.C. ) 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, it is my intention to speak to this particular item. 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
Special Committee Authorized to Extend Date of Final Report 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall , pursuant to notice of April 13, 1999, moved: 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I should like to ask a few questions on this particular motion. 
It addresses a number of the questions that I wished to put before him.  
It has, quite frankly, addressed a number of very important issues.  
The extension of this special committee and the request for that extension is very long. 
I thank the honourable senator for that question and her observation. 
My answer is that I certainly hope so. 
I would not want to go back and repeat what has been done.  
May I say that this is the end. 
As well, we have one or two more hearings with respect to marine safety. 
I have omitted from this motion the question of further costs. 
If there are any other questions, I would certainly try to answer them.  
We need help with professional writing. 
That will be the bulk of the budget. 
There will be some travel, but quite limited. 
The balance will be quite routine. 
If we finish early, of course, that will be a prorated amount.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. James F. Kelleher , pursuant to notice of April 13, 1999, moved: 
-- I move the motion standing in my name.  
Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
