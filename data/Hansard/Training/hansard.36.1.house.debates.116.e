REPORT OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
PENSION BENEFITS STANDARDS ACT, 1985 
EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 116 
Friday, June 5, 1998 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
Many of the proposed changes are relatively minor, or are administrative in nature. 
Such protection would be similar to that provided to witness statements.  
We believe that both of those amendments improve the bill.  
A third amendment was made to widen the meaning of on-board recordings. 
Further, it makes it difficult to take remedial measures when procedures require amendments. 
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
At no time should the transportation committee be left out of the process.  
That makes a lot of sense. 
Is it necessary to have three full time members all the time? 
This is indeed unusual in most government bills.  
An investigation for any other purpose is sanctioned.  
The Reform Party supports the bill. 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
This concludes the aside I wanted to make regarding the unusual procedure used.  
I hope the government will not make it a habit. 
We work hard in this place. 
We have a number of bills to examine. 
But it is true, there is not much to work on. 
There is no need to have bills introduced directly in the Senate.  
That legislation provided for a review mechanism. 
The issue is transportation safety, it is about saving human lives.  
The board's purpose is not to cast blame. 
Right now, the board can press charges against individuals refusing to testify. 
The issue is one of being compelled to testify. 
Our party is pleased with this procedure. 
It is faster, less costly and more effective.  
We in the Bloc Quebecois are not narrow-minded. 
That is stipulated in clause 14.4. 
My second remark concerns the role of the provinces. 
Paragraphe 15.1 provides that provinces can use the board.  
The process is underway. 
Of course, the costs of the investigation must then be recovered from the provinces. 
We acknowledge that this is bound to make the board more cost efficient.  
In 1993, the Liberals were voted in, but the practice was maintained. 
Today, it is alive and well. 
I have nothing against Mr. Portelance. 
It should have taken the opportunity to provide for transparency in the appointment process. 
But no, the partisan appointment process lives on.  
Everyone will find some benefit in my last comment on the issue. 
A country's transportation system depends essentially on the degree of confidence. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
The main idea underlying this act is supportable in principle. 
These accidents resulted in 127 deaths. 
An investigation into an accident is not something that can be rushed. 
It should not be this way. 
This organization is supposed to advance transportation safety in Canada. 
Apparently the government would rather save money than lives.  
At present the board consists of four members. 
This is a big step in the wrong direction.  
This is necessary so that witnesses can be candid with investigators without fear of retribution.  
It gives workers the freedom to co-operate with safety board investigators and protects them. 
It has historically played the role of advocate for the privileged few. 
In the context of the rest of the bill this one amendment is an anomaly. 
That is the whole point. 
This is a glaring contradiction. 
Thus the safety board is not independent like it should be. 
It is subject to undue political influence.  
Comprising the board's independence and neutrality in this way is scandalous. 
It risks the health and safety of Canadians for the sake of politics. 
The bill would make these submissions secret. 
They are covering it with a shroud of secrecy. 
It shows how out of touch the Liberals are with ordinary Canadians.  
I am forced to wonder what the Liberals are trying to hide. 
By placing this shroud over the safety board they are shattering the illusion of independence.  
That is why they need a safety board that is independent, neutral and adequately funded. 
To deny the board these essential necessities does a great disservice to Canadians.  
As I indicated, there are beneficial aspects of the bill. 
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
It will require unanimous consent on that. 
We were denied access to those presentations. 
I feel very strongly that we were sent here to serve the people. 
I will be opposing unanimous consent on this.  
I am not going to make that mistake again. 
I want to hear both sides of the story, not just one.  
They are supportive of this bill. 
We asked them several months ago and then asked them again yesterday. 
I do not have a satisfactory explanation of what that was all about. 
Why did the government move the amendment in the first place? 
Who was affected by it? 
Now the government wants the amendment withdrawn with no explanation, no hearings and no witnesses. 
If it is a good bill it will pass committee. 
The only people we heard from are those we reached out to and contacted ourselves. 
Is the House ready for the question?  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
I declare the motion carried on division. 
The bill is therefore referred to the Standing Committee on Transport.  
PENSION BENEFITS STANDARDS ACT, 1985 
I am sorry, there is nothing to speak on at the moment. 
We are on report stage. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Things are moving ahead very rapidly and without the full consent of the House.  
There is not a matter of consent. 
The motion for concurrence is not a debatable motion. 
I was required by the rules to put the motion to the House. 
The motion is put and carried.  
When shall the bill be read the third time? 
Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Eighty-four percent of British Columbians want elected senators. 
He said he would reform the Senate, but he is not doing that.  
The Prime Minister is letting the Senate continue its downward slide. 
Shame on the Prime Minister for talking the talk, but not walking the walk. 
Shame on the government for doing nothing to reform the Senate. 
Shame on the Liberals for allowing the Senate to continue its downward slide.  
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
Mrs. Judi Longfield (Whitby-Ajax, Lib.):
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Canadians have a great deal to offer the world. 
Congratulations on a job well done.  
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
All the statistics are true. 
It is going to be part of the solution. 
I choose to be optimistic.  
COLONEL F. G. NOSEWORTHY 
It is my pleasure to congratulate him on such a great accomplishment.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
I had the opportunity to question the chair of the CRTC on this issue. 
Therefore, I call upon the CRTC to reconsider its decision.  
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, there is a long and sad history of environmental neglect in the north. 
A man was even trapped and died there.  
It takes 200 to 700 years to grow a tree in the north. 
At the very least it would have been cleaned up.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
Mr. Zundel and his kind do not reflect Canada, its people or its values.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
We in this House should salute this spirit of compromise. 
Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):
This rapprochement will fool no one. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Do these eight inspire in anyone a feeling of safety and security for Canadians?  
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Maybe the member should speak to the deputy leader.  
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
NATO was flexible on the time lines. 
Why the double standard?  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member as usual is confused on the facts. 
The contract with Frontec expires March 31, 2000. 
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is obvious it is the minister who is confused on this issue. 
Canadian taxpayers might have to put up with this but foreign governments do not. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
If it was good then, it is good now. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Yesterday there was an unprecedented and bizarre decision. 
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
That said, the ruling is a very recent one. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Even two of the judges say it is a terrible decision for Canada. 
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
We will respect the rule of law in the legislation that we have.  
We have other tools in the Immigration Act right now. 
We will take our responsibility here.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the EI reform was absolutely essential. 
It had to be modernized and adapted to contemporary reality.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
We are not complete imbeciles.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
What he is responsible for is employment insurance and the transitional jobs fund. 
And he has failed on both counts.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
What does this government have against Canadian workers?  
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have nothing against Canadian workers. 
On the contrary, our government is working to find them jobs.  
We are now looking at the overall picture.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Again, is the minister prepared to stand up for Canadian workers?  
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I stand up for Canadian workers. 
I also stand up to respect the legislation in this country.  
That is why we had that problem. 
It is the role of the federal government to have a national policy. 
That is why we will revise it.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is simply ill informed. 
The quota allocation dealt with two sets of components of the fleet. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the minister of immigration.  
The minister can change this decision. 
She does not have to study it. 
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have already replied to that question, but I will do so again.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Are drug dealers going to take precedence over genuine refugees? 
When will you intervene and kick- 
The hon. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.  
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is always a problem with the Reform Party. 
As an immigration matter there are very complex issues here. 
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, B.Q):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Is this what the minister means by partnership?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Absolutely not, Mr. Speaker. 
That is why we are working in conjunction with the provinces.  
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
That is a bad sign.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I too have seen what Premier Tobin is calling for. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
I am referring to victims of forced sterilization in Alberta. 
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
It was such a position that was presented to all victims. 
The hon. member for Calgary-Nose Hill.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
The minister brought his colleagues from across the country together to the table. 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Mr. Speaker , 600 maple syrup producers are threatened because of his inaction. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have already done a lot to help maple syrup producers. 
We are aware of certain difficulties.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Let me tell her about the rule of law. 
Will this minister act or not?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
It did not say he should be allowed in the country. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the legislation in question was a product of the work of government. 
She is not even going to wait for that. 
She is going to see what other parts of the existing laws should be used.  
It is not doing that at all.  
Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Will the minister answer my question, yes or no?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin-Middlesex-London, Lib.):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
What about our children?  
Why will this government not just simply throw this drug dealer out of the country?  
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I think the Reform Party is looking for questions this morning. 
They do not know what to ask.  
This is the fourth question on the same subject. 
This is not a simple matter. 
It is an important one. 
In the meantime we can act on that individual.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
We have a convicted drug dealer. 
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
CANADA CUSTOMS AND REVENUE AGENCY 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the minister of national revenue. 
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member. 
He is quite wrong. 
With one stop shopping, a single window administration, we will better off as Canadians.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
We have a very good established relationship.  
The agency will create an opportunity to even advance that for provincial participation. 
Is the hon. member against provincial participation? 
The provinces have been asking for it.  
This agency will include the provinces. 
That is good for Canada and that is good for the provinces. 
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health.  
Premier MacLellan is now saying 1984.  
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
It says an agreement between the provincial, territorial and federal ministers.  
Somebody is wrong here. 
Will he tell us which one is wrong?  
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thought it was pretty clear. 
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her question. 
There will be an amnesty for law-abiding Canadian citizens.  
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
That is where the bottleneck seems to be.  
Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
How can he explain that?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
In particular the government passed a law in 1978 that talked about equality.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
I am proud to stand by that.  
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):
Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
On the contrary, it is good news for corrections. 
It is consistent with our goal to have effective corrections.  
Correctional officers do not simply perform guard duty. 
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
We are taking the lead; we are not lagging behind.  
We are certainly willing to review the act to see what improvements can be made. 
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  
Sudan is currently experiencing a terrible famine. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
REPORT OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, for eight months Question No. 21 has been languishing on the Order Paper. 
It takes nine months from conception to delivery.  
When will the government give birth to the answer to Question No. 21?  
Mr. Speaker, I know the member has been concerned regarding Question No. 21.  
We have completed well over 80% of the responses to petitions. 
We are at 70% or 75% in other responses.  
Shall the questions stand?  
PENSION BENEFITS STANDARDS ACT, 1985 
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
These reforms are long overdue. 
These plans are administered by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, or OSFI.  
This also added to the challenges. 
In some cases insufficient contributions were made to fund these improvements. 
The range of powers and regulatory components needed were just not there. 
Bill S-3 is our effort to meet these challenges. 
Regulation and supervision must be cost effective. 
The measures in this bill are as a result of a very broad consultation process. 
I have highlighted the important issues dealt with in this legislation. 
We are confident of that. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
We hope that it would take precedence over the Supreme Court of Canada.  
We also have a responsibility in standing here. 
I would like to give a statement that will put you at ease, Mr. Speaker. 
We believe very strongly in the Reform Party that that is backwards. 
This bill is called S-3. 
That means it started in the Senate. 
However, there are also some extremely odious components. 
One of them is that the superintendent must consent to the refund. 
I will come back to this in a few seconds.  
So red and Liberal sort of go together. 
Red is also a warning. 
In traffic it means we need to stop. 
It is a warning for danger. 
Whenever there is extreme danger the colour red is used.  
This is what I want to talk about. 
Is the employer entitled to a surplus or are the workers?  
The Minister of Finance acquired Canada Steamship Lines in 1981. 
The society's obligation to the beneficiaries was $84 million in 1997. 
This information begs a number of important questions. 
We have searched for an answer to this important question for some time. 
We would like an answer to our second question. 
Is Mr. Martin's pension plan still registered under the- 
I know he would not want to make that mistake.  
I know that, Mr. Speaker. 
Does this put the minister in conflict of interest? 
That is a very important question that needs an answer.  
How did the misinformation come to him? 
Did it make its way from the minister's office? 
This looks like a suspiciously close relationship and it gives rise to the follow question. 
We are suspicious about the secretary of state's independence for a particular reason. 
This gives rise to yet another question. 
There is no division formula in the present act. 
There is no vote required in the present regulations. 
There are some examples. 
Later that was changed to 90%, which is the current requirement.  
Only the provinces of B.C. and Quebec allow for mandatory arbitration.  
This act will make the surplus much more accessible to the minister. 
Is this not in itself a conflict of interest?  
Very few plans in surplus have levels of surplus above these thresholds.  
Those companies may not be individuals but corporations. 
Mr. Black is also listed on the board of directors of Canada Steamship Lines.  
What was the subject of the meeting or meetings?  
We are not accusing the minister of wrongdoing. 
We are simply doing our job by asking questions. 
This government ran on a platform of openness and accountability. 
I have raised a bunch of questions. 
They are red flag questions and they are questions that demand answers. 
I urge them to vote against this legislation. 
Why not let this be the first bill that this government actually loses? 
It comes from the Senate. 
Let us defeat this one because of these unanswered questions.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
What is Bill S-3 intended to do? 
Why are we opposed to this? 
There are three major reasons we oppose Bill S-3. 
There is no evidence that such arbitrary carte blanche is needed. 
The solvency ratio is defined by regulations. 
We have a major problem with this concept.  
What happens if a stringent solvency ratio is imposed? 
We are uncertain as to which problem this government is trying to resolve.  
There is no solvency crisis in the private pension system. 
Of these only nine terminated in less than fully funded status. 
In that case the members received approximately 80%. 
OSFI is taking a major policy position without any broad discussion. 
Even the U.S. has much more relaxed rules.  
The system works well. 
Why not pursue this avenue at the federal level?  
It condemns an increasing number of workers and retirees to poverty.  
We saw it earlier this morning and we are seeing it again.  
Canadians want to believe in the House of Commons. 
We give up on democracy to deal with mountains of legislation. 
The government has no legislative vision. 
We saw this with the changes to CPP.  
We can hardly change one without knowing what is going to happen to the other. 
Yet the government failed to act. 
There is a lack of consultation. 
Only two groups appeared before the committee. 
Members on the opposite side of the House are very comfortable with their slim majority. 
Canadians see them forcing through legislation. 
On behalf of that member I present his words.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Canada's system of retirement income has three pillars. 
The bill before us updates that act.  
However the bill is not particularly controversial. 
The legislation will help improve that process.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ) moved: 
This very tense situation could have ended in violence. 
It took six months for the matter to be brought before the House. 
Guards know all these problems. 
It is quite understandable. 
Violence does not stop when the door of the cell is closed. 
It often goes on inside in many different forms. 
We must not wait for guards to lose their lives before we react. 
Many inmates who are behind bars in 1998 have done time before. 
I fully understand that one is innocent until proven guilty. 
I agree this is a very important concept. 
Does it have to be one or the other? 
In some cases, it took years before some people finally got their day in court. 
Finally, the trial takes place and a verdict is rendered. 
Is it the whole judicial system that needs to be reviewed? 
Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Such was the case regarding the events of August 29, 1997.  
He did not raise any specific problem. 
I thank my hon. colleague for expressing his concerns on the matter.  
Canadians pay high taxes. 
It is our civic duty.  
It is the government's responsibility to protect society.  
I therefore call on the government to overhaul the entire justice system. 
When it does that, it will be serving decent folk.  
These people will be marked forever. 
We cannot ignore these problems. 
The system must be reformed and our society protected.  
(The House adjourned at 1.23 p.m.)
