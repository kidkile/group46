EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 196 
Monday, March 15, 1999 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
Is it agreed that the parliamentary secretary table these documents?  
The ramifications of the legislation are I believe a little different and quite important. 
I will now take a moment to outline the reasons for this proposal. 
I will provide an example. 
The police are called. 
An arrest is made and a charge is laid. 
In other words, the judge may impose a curfew.  
What if the parent has been part of the problem all along? 
Like all hybrid offences, the crown has the option. 
A parent, by definition, should be setting a proper example for the child. 
Of course the parent should be made to account for this failure.  
My amendment to the law is merely one step to broaden this accountability. 
Jesse was 16 years old at the time. 
Obviously the young offender was not complying with that condition on that night. 
That is the injustice of this case. 
He promised that the youth would attend court. 
He promised that the youth would abide by a curfew condition. 
The young person is solely accountable for their own criminal activity. 
They have broken a contract.  
Others suggest that some parents are unable to control their children. 
By doing that the parent has acted in a responsible manner. 
My amendment is simple. 
Is that really too much to ask?  
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
I appreciate my colleague's valuable contribution to the justice committee. 
Indeed, he asked a number of very thoughtful questions. 
That in itself is quite a scheme.  
It is called a hybrid offence. 
It is a worthwhile and laudable initiative on the part of the member opposite.  
Last year the crime prevention strategy was announced. 
That does not initiate a judicial process. 
That is the second level of parental responsibility.  
The third level of responsibility with respect to parental attendance is found under clause 27. 
I suggest that these are reasoned and balanced responses to parental responsibility.  
It is easy to state, but much more difficult to put into legislation. 
Individuals, including persons and their parents, must be held accountable for their actions. 
Consequences must flow from the wrongdoing. 
He has acted honourably and in the finest traditions of a parliamentarian. 
I congratulate him personally on behalf of the House for his initiative.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Our caucus feels strongly that he has handled it very well.  
That is the best way I can put it briefly.  
The kids literally have no choice. 
That is often how they get sucked into it.  
We have to take a dispassionate view of the impact on victims of crimes. 
You let my friend go and you can have your kid back''. 
It was very terrifying for my whole family.  
It is fundamentally wrong. 
It made me a very angry guy for a long time. 
This was eight or nine years ago. 
There should be some satisfaction there, I would hope, for the member.  
They actually have break and enter rings where they divide up neighbourhoods. 
One person will be in charge of a little crew of break and enter artists. 
It is almost getting to be an organized crime ring of young people.  
It is incorrect and it is actually maligning young people to call them youth gangs.  
It is only a very few when we look at the larger picture.  
Desperate people take desperate measures.  
These people are torching the whole community. 
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
We as a parliament ought to take a look at that.  
Bill C-260 would change this to a dual procedure offence. 
Parents will not be jailed for their children's criminal behaviour. 
That is in my opinion reasonable and responsible.  
That testimony was incorporated into the committee's report.  
Nevertheless, it was not placed before the committee. 
To leave it to the provinces is wrong. 
It is going to create a checkerboard approach to dealing with these young people. 
I have concerns in those two areas. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, there are a couple of rather interesting points.  
Then I see what just happened. 
I just had to comment on that.  
The impetus for this bill comes from personal experience. 
<-obviously in violation of that curfew. 
My son, my family, paid the price.  
That is so critical in this.  
The Minister of Justice has recognized the significance of this kind of an amendment. 
Why am I skeptical that that will not happen?  
We hear about boot camps being the solution. 
People thought that was the solution.  
There is a lack of a role model. 
There is a lack of discipline. 
The member has put forward a very thoughtful solution to a very serious problem.  
Where do these kinds of half-baked ideas come from? 
It pales in comparison to the kinds of issues we are talking about. 
Justice issues and violence issues are not simple.  
He does his son's memory proud. 
I congratulate him for bringing this forward. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
This section, proposed in its current form, is very commendable. 
This is after the fact treatment. 
That is not the case at all. 
It is important for that to be clarified.  
This section will accomplish that. 
It does accomplish that and does so with the best of intentions. 
The member for Surrey North should receive great accolades and great congratulations for this.  
We need to ensure there is an entry level emphasis and a proactive approach taken. 
The member has six minutes remaining. 
The time provided for the consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
ALLOTTED DAY-PAN-AMERICAN MONETARY UNION 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ) moved that: 
Mr. Speaker, the matter we are debating today is a very important one. 
Thomas Courchesne and other economists have spoken and written about it. 
The European Economic Community is, naturally, the most developed. 
NAFTA, I repeat, brings together the countries in North America. 
The Caribbean countries have also established a form of economic co-operation. 
We do not need to reinvent the wheel. 
These countries have a much longer political history than ours. 
These countries will lose their currency.  
A large number of less important currencies are surviving alongside these three major ones. 
There is an intermediate category, which includes currencies such as the pound sterling. 
Negotiations are well underway in Great Britain to start using the Eurodollar. 
Right now, our exports are primarily affected by the weakness of the Canadian dollar. 
To ask the question is to answer it.  
There would be repercussions to this.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, it is neither. 
That is why I am using the term pan-American.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the leader of the Bloc Quebecois. 
Mr. Speaker, there are two questions there. 
I say that it would be in 20 years, half the time.  
We can draw on the experience of the Europeans in this matter.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
The hon. leader of the Bloc Quebecois.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Everybody knows I have been interested in this issue for some time. 
The European Union, NAFTA and MERCOSUR are examples of that.  
Where does the Canadian dollar fit into all this? 
This makes it all the more important to think things through carefully.  
Perhaps, then, the Canadian trade situation ought to be looked at.  
What about the independence of Canada's monetary policy? 
There is no such independence, it is a myth. 
There is no Canadian monetary independence.  
Let us take a closer look at the figures. 
What would be the main advantages of a common currency? 
In short, as parliamentarians, we should be debating all of the above. 
The train is already leaving the station. 
Before it goes too far, we should get on. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the amendment is in order.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I listened with interest to the debate. 
I find it a fascinating discussion so far. 
Here is an example. 
The Eurocoin, the new European currency, is France's idea. 
The franc was very closely linked to the Deutschmark, Germany's currency. 
It had no representative in the Bundesbank. 
What did it do? 
It proposed the adoption of a common currency. 
France did not lose any sovereignty; it gained some.  
He has been quoting these examples from Europe.  
For 107 years Puerto Rico has had the U.S. dollar but nothing else. 
It is rather distressing.  
They are comparing apples and oranges. 
This gives us some idea of how low they can stoop.  
Canada is G7 country. 
Its economy ranks 7th in the world. 
This is an opportunity we must not let slip through our fingers.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Would it lead to higher living standards for Canadians? 
Remember when in the 1960s Canada had a system of fixed exchange rates. 
However, this did not eliminate speculation against the value of the Canadian dollar. 
In fact, it in some cases led to currency misalignment. 
Eventually the fixed exchange rate regime was abandoned in the 1970s.  
Today there is the Euro. 
That is the basis of this whole motion. 
The bottom line is clear. 
This takes me to the underlying point. 
This is no small or abstract sacrifice.  
Some might ask about the recent movements in the Canadian dollar. 
These movements represent the natural response to international shocks. 
Let us put this into context. 
The U.S. on the other hand is a net importer of primary commodities. 
This is an important difference between Canada and the U.S. 
This is truer of our relationship with the U.S. than other G-7 countries.  
There is an important corollary that we must remember. 
Here is something for the hon. member of the Bloc to think about. 
I encourage all members of the House to vote against the opposition motion.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Some of his points merit more thorough study.  
There are arguments both for and against.  
There are countries that want to integrate their economies. 
We have seen the impact of that. 
Madam Speaker, I listened with great interest to the remarks of my colleague. 
I mentioned before the case of Puerto Rico. 
It seems to me the debate is about extending the U.S. dollar. 
Would my colleague care to comment on these two examples? 
Has Puerto Rico been a success? 
Has Liberia been a success by extending the U.S. dollar?  
Madam Speaker, one just has look at what most economists are saying. 
The two examples the hon. member has drawn upon speak for themselves. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
We ought to give them a reluctant commendation for at least thinking ahead.  
The level of our currency is a measure of our economic health. 
They are asking us to strike a committee to debate the issue. 
I am certainly in favour of debate. 
An analogy might be appropriate. 
I do not know if members have ever seen a house going down the road. 
I have seen this in Saskatchewan and Alberta. 
Quite frequently they move buildings down the road on many wheels. 
The analogy I want to draw is how those wheels were constructed. 
Two things can happen. 
I was intrigued when I looked at the mechanism. 
It is never relieved of carrying its share of the load.  
What happens if we have a larger currency? 
My constituent suggested a time line. 
There is merit in that suggestion. 
Eventually we would anyway, I believe.  
I think there are a couple of reasons. 
I seriously question it. 
They are very highly taxed as is every Canadian citizen. 
I think that is a political reality.  
Economic stability correlates very closely to political stability.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Madam Speaker, the answer is maybe, and that is final.  
Over and over we see the Liberals on the other side not having debates. 
In that sense, I would support a wider debate and I would support this motion. 
I am going to decide that after listening to more debate and more thinking. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
There are members on all sides of this House who certainly enjoy debate.  
The hon. member talked about the economic health of the country of Canada. 
He made reference only to the exchange rate. 
He talks about fixing the currency to the U.S. dollar. 
He has a constituent who has put forward that proposal. 
Madam Speaker, the parliamentary secretary has gone on to stage two. 
I agree, there are many, many measures of economic health. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
However, we only have a certain amount of time.  
The motion put forward by the Bloc today has me puzzled. 
Then I thought of one idea. 
What else could be done? 
I now understand at least why we are having this discussion today. 
I will set that aside. 
That is the motivation. 
We saw that with the MMT legislation. 
That is not right. 
We are losing our sovereignty.  
We have seen imposed on us a form of economic feudalism. 
Our country was founded by people who fled feudalism. 
We are proud of our currency. 
I am a bit critical about monetary policy. 
Let us acknowledge those who argue ``Look what Europe has done''. 
I listened to my friend and I respect him. 
He said that we are seeing the French franc go out the door. 
We are seeing the German mark go out the door. 
That is the American way.  
It has an incredible amount of power. 
It has the power. 
That is what it is.  
Here we are talking about monetary policy.  
That is the way that system is operated. 
We almost had the MAI imposed on us. 
That is not what Canadians want.  
Canadians have this sinking feeling that their voices are not being heard. 
They have a sinking feeling that they are alienated from the political process. 
There is a good reason for that feeling, because they are. 
The voices of Canadians are not being listened to.  
They want Quebec to be a banana republic.  
What is a banana republic? 
In the end, later today we will not be supporting this motion.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
That said, my question is very simple. 
That is what he said.  
What does the hon. member think of that?  
Behind the initiative of a North American currency is corporate America. 
We have done all those things. 
We as a country followed the advice of the BCNI. 
Having taken all of these steps, Canada has not increased its productivity. 
Those are some of the reasons we have to discuss.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
He is a man of considerable insight in a lot of things.  
How do I put this without insulting him after what I just said? 
We have different ways of measuring things. 
We used to measure things in inches and now we measure in centimetres.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I must interrupt the hon. member as his time is over.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
That is what this motion is all about.  
The leader of the Bloc Quebecois spoke earlier today. 
I guess he previously had some ties to the Marxist-Leninist Party. 
The European comparison and the Euro comparisons that have been made are highly specious. 
This is a very complicated issue. 
To permanently entrench that position of weakness would be inadvisable.  
The fact is that we would not be getting any money for those goods. 
Those issues need to be addressed. 
We also believe that Canadians have to be prepared to embark on that journey. 
That takes certain types of economic policy.  
I have a great deal of respect for my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois. 
Sovereignty is a very important issue. 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
With the introduction of the Euro, France now has its say. 
My question is simple. 
I heard all the arguments, and some deserve more in depth consideration. 
These important issues transcend party lines.  
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.  
The Conservative Party will be supporting this motion this evening. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
I thank them for their initiative.  
Naturally, there is a downside to abandoning national currencies. 
The new currency must also be given time to settle in. 
Otherwise, the Euro would never have seen the light of day.  
But still, which one should we choose?  
All this is hypothetical, at least for now. 
But this issue is already raising hackles, particularly in Canada. 
Recent developments in Europe, including the introduction of the Eurocoin, raise new issues. 
This requires a great deal of thought. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
What I have heard so far has been pretty esoteric. 
Prepared to fight to the death to maintain the Canadian dollar. 
We will not hand Canadian sovereignty over to the Americans''.  
Members can imagine how far behind we are right now. 
The Liberals are not interested in talking about this. 
They would rather talk about Canada's independence. 
That is real power, real sovereignty. 
It did so by banding together.  
The same is true for international economic integration, economic interdependence. 
All members of the House should know this, but they are obtuse. 
That is real independence, true national sovereignty.  
I listened to the speech of the member for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys. 
I am sorry, but the member is really out of touch with reality.  
We hold 25 per cent of the money supply. 
That is very clear.  
They do not want to hear about it. 
It would bother me too. 
Obviously, the hon. member does not know how monetary policies work.  
Do they have similar unemployment rates? 
Do they have similar domestic policies? 
What we heard here makes no sense at all.  
Quebeckers are sure about their identity. 
I must interrupt the hon. member. 
I remind him there are five minutes remaining for questions and comments. 
It being almost two o'clock, we will now proceed to Statements by Members.  
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
They will be disappointed.  
British Columbians have additional concerns. 
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
Too often, however, it is also a way of injury and death. 
Six hundred and ninety-seven Canadians died in farm related accidents between 1990 and 1996. 
Most of these deaths could have been prevented.  
I congratulate the organizers of this well attended program. 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Once again Canada's women's hockey team has done us proud. 
It is the guys turn now. 
Mr. Rejean Lefebvre (Champlain, Ind.):

Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):

This is tremendous uplifting news for all men who have experienced dysfunctional problems. 
SEMAINE DE LA FRANCOPHONIE 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Let us learn to appreciate our rich heritage.  
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):

Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Why can it not be- 
The hon. member for Medicine Hat.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Michael Wilson's way, it drops down to 70, it collapses. 
The Canadian dollar should be 78 cents''.  
The hon. parliamentary secretary.  
Mr. Bob Speller (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Unfortunately the minister did not borrow a page from Stockwell Day's book.  
He does not have Mike Wilson to blame anymore.  
Mr. Bob Speller (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this government is stuck in a fog of unreality. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
He will not be able to find one.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We have the third lowest corporate income tax rate for manufacturing in the G-7. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
I thank them for their co-operation.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
It proves nothing else.  
Could the minister tell us what regional component means?  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
I invited her to take part in the international network, and she refused. 
Why did she refuse? 
Because she does not want to be part of the Canadian delegation. 
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
We can work in partnership. 
Such is the policy of the Bloc Quebecois and of the Parti Quebecois.  
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is direct contact on a daily basis. 
All we want is respect of countries' sovereignty.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, that is right. 
Canadians have a right to have their say. 
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, plutonium may be retroactive as well. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Merchant navy veterans are dying at a rate of 13 per month. 
I am delighted that parliamentary processes kicked in.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
In other words, sell Canada at bargain basement prices.  
Does he feel good about that?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I feel very good about selling Canadian products.  
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
That is what they are telling them.  
Our high taxes and costly overregulation are keeping us uncompetitive.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That is why they have done well.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
As a government, we have carried out a reform of employment insurance. 
Naturally, we feel that this reform meets all our constitutional and legal obligations. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
It is an error the preceding generation made for 30 years. 
We encouraged people to leave school too early. 
PUBLIC SERVICE OF CANADA 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, as of this morning grain shipments in Vancouver had completely stopped.  
Other labour unions are not crossing the picket lines.  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
We are encouraging them to get back to the bargaining table. 
Unfortunately an impasse has been reached.  
They are beginning to get nervous as well. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
It is that government over there.  
What is the excuse? 
What is the reason? 
They have broken the negotiations. 
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
Had these two subcontractors been security cleared?  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
It is important to note that the Prime Minister was not involved.  
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Bill C-55 is poor policy, period. 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
They should be ashamed of themselves.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, in fact we are trying to stand up. 
That is what it is all about.  
Bill C-55 is dead and this minister knows it. 
Sure, it may pass the vote today, but it will never been enacted. 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party talks about censorship. 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
PUBLIC SERVICE OF CANADA 
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Revenue.  
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for her excellent question. 
We will not tolerate any illegal activity at our tax service offices. 
The hon. member for Surrey North.  
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
We are not talking about protecting the identities of nice people.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
In fact, it is for us a case of balancing those competing values. 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are in fact not protecting the identity of predators.  
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
I want to thank the hon. NDP critic for the question. 
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
We have no intention of abolishing Bill C-55. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):

Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):

Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We have made progress in this area. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
The hon. Minister of National Revenue.  
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, as usual Reform does not have its facts right.  
I would hope the member would check his facts more appropriately before asking questions.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
He also said that Continental Asphalt was recommended by the RCMP.  
How can he say that?  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
The Prime Minister did build a home. 
He had his own road. 
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the federal government is productivity's worst enemy.  
They are undermining the productivity and international competitiveness of Canadian businesses.  
Mr. Speaker, the cost recovery policy has a very simple basis. 
We have dealt with the business community and have had discussions. 
They are now part of our stakeholders group. 
We continue to have discussions with them. 
I must say the policy has been quite well received.  
Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, Lib.):
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
In the result, Canada is losing billions of dollars in taxation.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We are one of the leaders in this area. 
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Is it not enough?  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I welcome the report from the Senate committee. 
Many parts of that report are excellent. 
There are the steps we took in the budget. 
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
We have had discussions with all parts of Canadian industry. 
We have listened to what they had to say. 
We have dealt with them and we now have a better system.  
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Hon. Claudette Bradshaw (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
STANDING COMMITTEE ON CANADIAN HERITAGE 
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
It is no coincidence that every committee does this.  
We cannot allow a committee to enjoy that kind of independence from the House. 
Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation 760(2), states: 
Mr. Speaker, I would ask that you rule on this matter. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
What the hon. member is telling us is not that. 
Those were his words.  
I would challenge that and say I do not believe that such is the case. 
This does not make the rule redundant. 
That is the appropriate interpretation.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
The member is describing a kind of two pronged problem for an opposition party. 
That means this standing order is of little use to members of parliament.  
The points that are being raised cause a bit of concern to the Chair. 
I would address myself to the member for Dauphin-Swan River. 
Could he please clarify his statement for me?  
The order was very specific in terms of what the request was to the committee.  
Could he please clarify that?  
Mr. Speaker, it was the standing committee meeting in camera.  
I believe you said 10 sitting days. 
Was the meeting held? 
According to the hon. member the meeting was held.  
Was it held in public or was it held in camera? 
I do not know if there is a difference. 
Is what I am saying so far correct? 
I just need a yes or a no.  
I will deal with that now.

Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk-Brant, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
The first one has to do with international trade agreements and water.

Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I suggest that all questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on two points of order. 
My constituents have been waiting 112 days.  
When can my constituents expect an answer to Question No. 169?  
Mr. Speaker, I know the member is concerned about this question. 
I have been waiting twice as long as the standing orders require. 
The government is interfering with my ability to do my job. 
As it is, I am getting fewer than two answers per year.  
At what point does this become a question of privilege? 
That committee deals with, among other things, changes to the rules of the House. 
At least he could get his questions asked even if he did not get answers. 
I know he would find a very receptive ear in that of the parliamentary secretary.  
I suggest we leave the matter there. 
That is always a helpful thing and will save time.  
Shall the remaining questions stand?  
ALLOTTED DAY-PAN-AMERICAN MONETARY UNION 
The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the amendment.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Their arguments are half baked. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Drummond for her excellent question.  
That is entirely natural because we are in lockstep with the American economy. 
What was the result? 
The Bank of Canada is not independent.  
We had another example of this as recently as August and September. 
We are continually following the evolution of American monetary policy. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is not the point. 
The issue is whether we are going to take a back seat to global progress. 
That is what we are asking for.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
That is not it.  
Perhaps this causes difficulties when doing business over a long period of time. 
We could find ourselves producing goods or services in Canada which are not competitive. 
However there is a way around that. 
However there is a certain homogeny, a certain sameness about the countries. 
The inevitable result would be that we would lose our monetary policy independence.  
This is not true.  
We also saved a lot on debt service charges. 
If we had the same currency, what would have been the result? 
It is very simple. 
We would have seen a cut-down in Canadian production. 
Our currency, the Canadian dollar, has gone down a bit. 
It has gone down 7% vis-a-vis the American dollar.  
We could look at other countries in the world that have suffered. 
Never will we support such an assumption or such ideas. 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
I wish I could show them to the House. 
They are exactly the same. 
Where is the independent monetary policy in all this?  
I would like to mention the six points our finance minister presented to the IMF. 
We worked together with other countries that have a strong economy. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Let us look at the facts. 
Quebec was the one with a vision for the future.  
The situation here is exactly the same. 
What does my hon. colleague has to say about that?  
Mr. Speaker, our exchange rate is floating. 
It is not fixed, it is not set. 
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak in this debate. 
As they say, the rest is history. 
I will leave it to others to debate the merits of that agreement.  
Then they would probably be told that they speak French up there. 
That is kind of nice, sort of like Louisiana. 
And that Quebec has civil law. 
That is kind of quaint, a novel idea. 
The monetary policy for a North American currency will be set in Washington. 
That is a reality. 
To think otherwise would be completely naive.  
It is a perfect case of taxation without representation. 
In particular, this is the creation of monetary policy without representation. 
The argument was that it went relatively smoothly. 
There were 11 countries, 11 currencies, 11 different sovereign jurisdictions, et cetera, et cetera. 
I would argue that all it does is encourages assimilation.  
There is a certain cleverness to the resolution. 
I have to admire the other side in that respect. 
That is clearly the reason they are here in Ottawa. 
Then we would have this strange understanding of a joint use of the currency. 
We will do what we want.  
I commend the hon. member for the cleverness in his resolution. 
We are not going to get that. 
We will not be able to achieve it in any event. 
We will have absolutely no control over fiscal or monetary policy in this country. 
It is an analogy which simply does not make sense. 
That makes no sense. 
It is a false analogy and needs to be denounced as such.  
That will in one respect create winning conditions. 
We will just go from stage one to four like that. 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the poor content of the member's speech is not surprising. 
One can understand why his arguments are so weak.  
He said the Americans give no thought to this debate. 
That all brings us to the original motion proposing such a debate.  
I have thought about the issues it raises on many occasions. 
Mr. Speaker, I thoroughly enjoyed my colleague's speech. 
I know my colleague is a very quick study. 
I know he follows the economy of Africa with great interest.  
Liberia is a country which long ago took the U.S. dollar. 
It moved under the protection of the U.S. dollar.  
I would respectively suggest that this motion lays an egg. 
The only question is how to poach it.  
We on this side of the House will resist very strongly.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
The Liberals started by shouting their indignation. 
Once elected, the new Prime Minister, Mr. Jean Chretien, finally signed the agreement.  
I would say finally with pleasure- 
Mr. Speaker, I was talking about the hon. Prime Minister. 
I hope you will forgive the history teacher when she gets the upper hand.  
Why should we prepare? 
We do not suggest this should be done tomorrow. 
When Ontario was overheating, the rest was just beginning to warm up a little.  
I am most anxious to see a committee struck to continue this debate. 
The Alliance of Manufacturers of Canada has developed a competitiveness index. 
Mr. Speaker, I have two questions for the member. 
I listened very carefully to what she had to say.  
The first question is one which I posed previously. 
Second, I wonder if the hon. member would comment on this. 
I will read the last paragraph of the article: 
Mr. Speaker, two fine questions from my colleague. 
However, the first one concerns me.  
What is being proposed is a committee for Canada. 
He is assuming that the model will be that of Liberia.  
Let us all use our brain a little. 
As to his question on Pierre Fortin, I do not understand it at all. 
Everyone is becoming poorer. 
That is what it means.  
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Everyone here is on continuous training these days. 
So we agree to go on.  
In this vein, I would ask my colleague what she thinks.  
This is what we must look at.  
This is true for the economy, but also for other areas. 
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
What have they done since? 
It might decide we should adopt the American dollar or a pan-American dollar. 
I would like them to respond to my arguments. 
Why do they not want to do their job as parliamentarians? 
Do they oppose it too? 
I have news for them. 
This has absolutely nothing to do with today's debate.  
Is that the federal government's monetary policy? 
Perhaps it should tell us that too. 
Is this what MPs should be, mere rubber stamps? 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
I have a question for the member across the way. 
This is an issue which the committee could examine. 
We might put this question to my colleague.  
That question could be raised in committee.  
What is the extent of this independence when we look at the curve since 1950? 
In the meantime the curve of trade with the U.S. continues to climb.  
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
A lot of the uncertainty has been created by people across the way.  
As we know, European countries have come together to create a common currency. 
I think it is appropriate that we ask ourselves why they did that. 
They want to come together to have a common currency. 
As other speakers have mentioned, there are 11 independent countries. 
The thought process is quite different in Europe than it is in North America.  
We talk about currency as if it is unique. 
Seashells have been used in other places. 
These things only represent a modicum of the exchange between people. 
The important thing is the value of the trading relationship.  
I will deal with the issue of a Pan-American monetary union.  
We know that our neighbour to the south dominates the economy of North America.  
The GDP of the province of Quebec is about $185 billion. 
That represents approximately 20% of Canada's GDP. 
These figures do not include Mexico. 
Why do we have our own independent foreign exchange rate and currency? 
It allows us to manage the economy. 
The exchange rate actually represents the underlying economic forces. 
These have all had an impact on commodities in Canada.  
Quite frankly, those are all commodity based industries.  
On top of that, it would also reduce their sovereignty.  
It is strange to have this kind of misguided approach to foreign exchange. 
I was also surprised to find that the Conservative Party supports this.  
What has happened to them? 
Yes, foreign exchange is part of that. 
It does not even seem to suit the Bloc's own agenda.  
We should be celebrating the fact that the Canadian economy is robust. 
It has the opportunity to be competitive in world markets. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, this does not make sense. 
Is the member making fun of us? 
We never have any input. 
This will not change in an American context.  
Now let us look at the facts. 
Canadian businesses already have bank accounts in U.S. dollars. 
Is it Great Britain? 
Our businesses here in Canada already work in U.S. dollars. 
We already have a highly integrated economy.  
I would like to point out the obvious. 
We deal in foreign exchange relationships all the time. 
In fact foreign exchange conversion is quite healthy and quite easily done.  
Brazil just devalued its currency. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
We are supporting this motion.  
Economists are discussing this issue as we are here today. 
They have been discussing this issue for months. 
They are many of the same reasons the hon. member articulated. 
His party was the same party that opposed free trade in 1988. 
Where does that put him?  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
That coin said Rome.  
Money still conveys that image. 
It still has that purpose. 
Earlier this year I was on holiday in Belize. 
Belize uses the Belizean dollar. 
It looks identical to the Canadian dollar, complete with the Queen. 
Nevertheless, when it is flipped over, the Queen can be seen. 
It is similar to a Canadian bank note. 
I suspect that the Belizean dollar is actually manufactured in this city. 
Of course, the Canadian authorities print money for many countries around the world.  
In Belize things can equally be bought with the Belizean dollar or the American dollar. 
Money in those days had scenes of Canada. 
I remember as a child looking at those bills and thinking that is my country.  
That has no part in the American plan.  
I see members of the Bloc Quebecois smiling. 
We are in a global economy. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
I think Albertans are Canadians as well.  
It is in power. 
I just checked today and the GST is still there. 
The Liberals changed their minds.  
I see free trade is still there. 
The Liberals changed their minds.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
It is not so much sovereignty. 
We are supporting, however, looking at this issue further in a committee. 
That is the position we are putting forward.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
There is not a single economic argument in his remarks. 
His favorite words were pride, symbols, and value. 
That reminds me a lot of the debate on free trade.  
Here is my question to the hon. member. 
The hon. member is absolutely right. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
That is not a problem at all. 
I will address that in a moment.  
Many people have discussed this lately with the advent of the Euro. 
There are some good aspects and some bad aspects. 
The sovereignty issue is one of the biggest issues people are concerned about. 
Their concerns are very valid. 
The Canadian currency is a repository for many of our symbols. 
My colleagues in the Liberal Party have made some good arguments about that. 
We acknowledge that that is a big issue.  
All of a sudden that would be gone. 
There are disadvantages too. 
We have seen this recently. 
We should have that discussion but it is not timely to have that discussion today.  
We should become concerned when we see it fall to record lows. 
We saw that happen this summer. 
Frankly, it has barely budged from that point.  
Under this government it is at 65 cents. 
It is bad enough that the dollar has fallen. 
That in and of itself is a bad thing.  
It goes beyond that. 
Let us discuss some of those. 
We know Canadian productivity is absolutely in the tank. 
We have report after report drawing attention to this. 
We know from companies like Nesbitt Burns that our productivity is in the tank. 
That is a tragedy. 
We say that when you have high taxes you have a weak currency. 
That is exactly what we told the government again today.  
Talk about trying to put the best face on a bad situation. 
The people who are being paid those low wages are not very thrilled about it. 
They want to see wages going up.  
Canadians do not buy it for a second. 
Say don't come to Canada.  
Do not get me started on that. 
I do not think the minister wants to hear about that again.  
We encourage the government to face this issue head on. 
Those people should be rewarded. 
In so doing we will find that our dollar will start to strengthen. 
Why do we not start to cut taxes? 
Why do we not pay down the debt?  
The government had a golden opportunity with the last budget. 
What did it do? 
Its spending budget was $104.5 billion. 
However, each and every year the government goes over budget. 
It goes on and on.  
It simply refuses to act. 
We say that debate is much too premature. 
We do not need to have that discussion today. 
We would much rather see it address this issue head on.  
Let me quote from people who watch the performance of the government. 
Here is a March 5 press release from Nesbitt Burns: 
I will not only criticize. 
I will offer some concrete solutions on what to do about this problem. 
Like on health care and education.  
My friend across the way says ``health care''. 
No, I am not talking about health care. 
The government will argue it gave tax relief. 
That is no solution. 
We need to have dramatic net tax relief.  
This would be a tremendous amount of money left in the pockets of Canadian taxpayers. 
That money could be used to spend on things they want to spend it on. 
That would help our productivity. 
We need to start paying that down.  
It is time to give Canadians a break. 
They are the ones who balance the budget. 
They are the ones who produce the wealth in the country. 
Let us give that money back to taxpayers. 
They are the ones who balance the budget. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
I would like the member to answer my questions. 
Our economy is not just based on primary products. 
Our economy is more diversified. 
We have problems with the rate of exchange.  
Let us consider hockey players, for instance. 
Now in our national sport, hockey, players want to be paid in U.S. dollars. 
How much will the Canadian dollar be worth then? 
Let us go back five years. 
Our dollar was worth 70 cents. 
There are many issues we should address and I will conclude on that. 
Should we have a common North American or pan-American currency? 
This is why the Bloc Quebecois is suggesting that a committee be struck.  
I think we need to have this discussion somewhere down the road.  
We do not need any more high tax policies. 
We need to put emphasis on fixing the fiscal policies of the country. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
As a matter of fact it is more tied to purchasing power.  
I am talking about rent, foodstuffs and whatever.  
Our standard of living is very high. 
It is a net positive thing rather than a negative thing.  
Does he not agree that is pie in the sky, a total dream? 
Madam Speaker, as the member knows, never is a long time. 
In a sense I think the debate is irrelevant. 
My friend has said that a low dollar is a positive thing. 
Then we could imagine how prosperous we would really be.  
The government should be bloody well ashamed of that argument. 
I hope they apologize.  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We are on television. 
School is out completely in Ontario and in many other parts of the country. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I would ask the hon. member to be very prudent in his choice of words.  
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
I think the debate is badly aligned. 
It talks about a pan-American monetary union. 
This in no way excludes national currencies.  
It may be a discussion for somewhere down the road.  
There is no magic bullet to fixing this problem. 
There is no single solution that will fix it. 
That is the way to address this.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Let me tell the member what he will be leading. 
It is truly mind boggling. 
It is quite remarkable. 
The member for Saint John must be shaking her head. 
Why would that bother a true Canadian? 
My colleague from Wentworth-Burlington hit the nail on the head. 
What is the driving force behind the Bloc every day?  
It's the Bloc.  
It's a paycheque.  
It is absolutely amazing.  
There is a point of order over there. 
He does not like the amount of his paycheque, I guess.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye:
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Madam Speaker, I thought I did. 
I made the point and I will make it again. 
If they want to take offence that is their problem. 
It is really quite amazing.  
What we see is this crowded bed. 
That is their goal. 
No one can deny that. 
They can rise all day long if they wish.  
This motion is supposedly not about common currency. 
It is about a united pan-American monetary policy without currency. 
We will have funny money, Canadian Tire money. 
Maybe they will accept that.  
What is wrong with Canadian Tire?  
Nothing is wrong with Canadian Tire. 
This member would obviously try to build an economy on a foundation of coupons. 
It would undermine anything that stands for principles of democracy in this country. 
That is its goal. 
It wants to destroy the country. 
Let us be soft and gentle. 
Let us send it to committee. 
It really will not hurt anybody. 
This is an opposition day. 
Why would it not talk about poverty? 
It is a problem. 
We in the government have to acknowledge that. 
It is a problem that we intend to do something about. 
We will work with the Canadian people toward ending it.  
Why would it not talk about housing programs? 
We know what the provinces have done across this land. 
He cancelled all social housing in the entire province.  
Why would we not have a debate about that? 
It is time we got involved in housing.  
Why would we not have a substantive debate over something like that? 
I want to talk about the Reform for a minute. 
I do not often do that. 
They have trouble taking it back.  
We have a wonderful country with wonderful people in it.  
I fail to understand it. 
I wrote it down the minute he said it.  
Let me tell the member what they do understand. 
They understand they are not Americans. 
They understand they are not extremists. 
A Conservative member made reference to the ides of March. 
This is clearly deja vu all over again.  
The Tories will support this motion. 
I find it astounding.  
I am not sure what the member means by that.  
I am pleased to say that.  
In this section why are those members doing this? 
They want to drive the agenda. 
It is not a problem.  
Why would they not? 
It does not surprise me at all.  
What we have is a regionalization of the political spectrum across this country.  
Brian Mulroney did that. 
I thank the member for asking the question. 
Keep throwing me more little tidbits. 
Can anyone imagine a standing ovation? 
I could not understand how this could happen.  
There are no separatists out there. 
They were not very happy and a little confused. 
A number of the Conservative riding associations fired any of the delegates who attended. 
They kicked them right out of the party. 
That is called inclusiveness. 
It was quite interesting. 
In a certain way I do not blame the Conservatives. 
Why would they want to do that? 
The question has been put as to whether it would be the American dollar. 
That might lead to the break-up.  
Who would Quebec have to deal with in that event? 
It just would not be accepted or tolerated.  
That could be a little more than expensive. 
In essence that is where this would lead us if we were to follow it.  
I am chairing a task force on youth entrepreneurship. 
The reality is that young people realize economic times have changed. 
It is amazing how creative our young people are. 
I met with eight young entrepreneurs in Regina at a round table. 
I have news for them. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, should we laugh or cry? 
It would appear some people are suffering from microcephaly.  
Quebec contributes 24% of the funds in the federal coffers. 
This is unacceptable, and I hope my colleague opposite will withdraw what he said.  
This issue deserves to be reviewed. 
These are questions we have. 
This is about giving up sovereignty. 
This is about destroying the country. 
I do not care if the member is happy with his paycheque. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
I did not create it.  
We gave him a proud standing ovation and I would do it again. 
This member who was present has it all wrong.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
How long will it be before the member changes his mind?  
The hon. member for Scarborough-for Mississauga West.  
Mr. Speaker, what is the problem? 
It has a wonderful mayor and a wonderful council. 
It is a great place. 
It never rains or snows in Mississauga. 
What else can I say?  
This member will not run on that.  
I believe most Canadian subscribe to what this party stands for. 
It was obvious in the election results. 
We have eliminated the deficit, no thanks to the Tory party. 
We have the country working again. 
We have created 1.6 million new jobs since we took office.  
Let the hon. member read it and weep.  
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Surely he should respect the people of Quebec. 
I noticed that the House leader was here. 
The least he could do is- 
The hon. member for Mississauga West.  
I will always speak against the Bloc because they are trying to destroy my country.  
The future leader of the united alternative had better watch out. 
The time for questions and comments has expired.  
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
This is a very serious issue and I am very proud to speak to it. 
Every day, the media report large business and economic mergers. 
The debate on a common currency for the three Americas should start right now. 
We know that sovereignists are for change. 
They were against the idea, including the then premier of Ontario, David Peterson. 
In 1999, it is the same scenario. 
The issue of a common currency will also be considered.  
Twenty years is not a long time. 
Therefore, we must prepare ourselves for that economic possibility.  
The Bloc Quebecois has taken the lead. 
Our members want to talk about this issue right now. 
Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre-Rosedale, Lib.):
People who are interested are very concerned about this. 
I do not understand that paradox from their perspective.  
I ask the member another question. 
We are going to have to deal with the American Congress.  
The pan-American currency is a project for the future. 
We have to talk about it. 
This is our position and we want to set up a committee. 
Is there anything more democratic that a committee?  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
He also gravely inflicted damage on the people of Quebec. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Is this relevant to that speech?  
The parliamentary secretary is correct. 
I am sure he was getting to that point.  
Mr. Speaker, I was coming to that point, precisely.  
Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise to demand one too.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
The question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
All those in favour will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the amendment, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the amendment defeated.  
The next question is on the main motion.  
Is there agreement to proceed in such a way?  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
(The House divided on the motion, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the motion defeated.  
The first recorded division is on Ways and Means Motion No. 23.  
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.

Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
There is enough wealth in this country for everyone. 
Tuberculosis, diabetes and cancer rates have soared. 
With 95% of the adults unemployed, social ills have taken an enormous toll. 
This is a similar situation faced by first nations people all over the country.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
I raised this question after we received this information.  
Then came the big leak to Canadians about $11.5 billion. 
What would that $3.6 million have bought? 
It would have paid many times over for training of emergency nurses. 
All these things are absolutely needed.  
That is the message Canadians send to the government. 
I look forward to an answer from the government on this critical issue.  
This budget has been a very, very powerful good news message. 
The media has been anxious to analyse its content exactly for Canadians.  
That is exactly what this budget does. 
That is quite a substantial amount of money. 
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 7.38 p.m.)
