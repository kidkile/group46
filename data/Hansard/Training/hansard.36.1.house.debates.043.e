Wednesday, December 3, 1997 
The House met at 2 p.m. 
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, today is International Day of Disabled Persons. 
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
I ask that he apologize to the Seaforth Highlanders today.  
Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
INTERNATIONAL DAY OF DISABLED PERSONS 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
Guaranteeing access is a collective obligation. 
May the week of the disabled raise our awareness of that reality.  
STANDING COMMITTEE ON FINANCE 
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Vaughan-King-Aurora, Lib.):
Canadians have demanded accountability from the government as well as responsibility from themselves.  
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is a historic day in Canadian foreign policy. 
We have participated in a remarkable global effort. 
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Do you see a pattern here? 
That is the motto of these Liberals. 
Ms. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
THE LATE MICHEL BELANGER 
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
Canada has lost a formidable ally and builder. 
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member. 
The hon. member for Acadie-Bathurst.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
This trend towards assimilation of francophones is unacceptable.  
I am a proud Acadian from New Brunswick. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
These people and thousands of others do not have this priceless privilege. 
They are locked into the limitations of their bodies.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Such behaviour is unworthy of- 
We will now proceed to Oral Question Period. 
The leader of the official opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
The industry department is looking at how to hand grants to friends of the government. 
The hon. Deputy Prime Minister.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
The government is supposedly good at setting targets. 
The Prime Minister claims to have a target for CO2 emissions. 
In fact he had three of them in the last three weeks. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
There has not even been a hint of real tax relief.  
Canadians are demanding debt reduction. 
They are demanding that their taxes be lowered.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
That was $143,000 for a $30,000 a year job.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
We are very conscious of the need to have a balanced approach. 
We are interested in tax reductions. 
Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):
What is the heritage minister's reaction to the appeal made by the federation?  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Indeed, it is not a net decline but an increase.  
Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
What does this say about the Quebec government? 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Examples like this can be found across Canada.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
I would ask the member to be very careful in her choice of words.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
She said ``As a French Canadian, I am a second class citizen. 
As a Quebecker, I am a first class citizen.'' 
That is the difference. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the minister responsible for Canada's youth.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We are helping about 110,000 young Canadians a year with our present strategy.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the leader of the NDP has her numbers completely wrong.  
That is as a result of our strategy.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
The seasonal fund-raising- 
I ask the hon. member for Sherbrooke to put the question please.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
The hon. Deputy Prime Minister.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Frankly, I did not hear my hon. friend's question. 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
The minister is down in the United States giving our quotas to the Americans. 
When is he going to stand up and do something?  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Who is this government standing up for, Canadians or Americans? 
When is the government going to get on its feet and do something for Canada?  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the minister of fisheries is making no such announcement. 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
As I said, I hope discussions will be held soon.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Perhaps he was on his way to Paris for lunch with Ted.  
There has been nothing drawn to my attention that indicates any irregularity whatsoever. 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
They appointed directors and so did the government. 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
The majority of its members are not appointed by the government.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
The hon. Minister of Transport.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
There is no change in regulations.  
There has been no change in the enforcement. 
Let us not alarm Canadians.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Not one Canadian is going to be affected this Christmas. 
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Trade.  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Gar Knutson (Elgin-Middlesex-London, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Natural Resources.  
All of that is 100% consistent with what the provinces have suggested.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
That is a hypothetical question. 
If the parliamentary secretary wants to answer it, he may.  
Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
We are leading the world again and again. 
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport. 
This obviously creates a very dangerous situation and puts lives at risk. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
This is something that the managers at Nav Canada pride themselves upon. 
I would ask the hon. member not to alarm people unduly. 
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I have a problem with that. 
I understand that at this moment Vancouver has 27 air traffic controllers available. 
NavCan set the minimum standard at 36 air traffic controllers. 
This is extremely dangerous. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
They are meeting that level of service and they are doing it extremely well. 
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
SUPREME COURT OF CANADA 
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
How does the minister see Canada supporting this undertaking by the European parliamentarians?  
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Canadians are very concerned by the situation in Algeria. 
As yet undetermined is who will be part of that delegation and under what terms.  
I thank the hon. member for his question.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Diamonds are said to be a girl's best friend. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
How are those issues being addressed in western Canada?  
One of the better programs is the community futures development program. 
And Mr. Speaker, it works.  
I will take them in this order. 
DECORUM IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
I did so and saw two people. 
My interventions were specifically directed at the people of Abitibi and postal workers.  
It is regrettable that because of these gestures- 
Dear colleagues, I am unable to hear the question of privilege. 
I would like to hear the question of privilege. 
The hon. member for Abitibi has the floor.  
Mr. Guy St-Julien:
In conclusion, I forgive the CUPW negotiator- 
You've got some nerve.  
Mr. Guy St-Julien: -for his gestures at my person. 
Mr. Guy St-Julien:
That is a statement, Mr. Speaker. 
I thank my colleagues.  
My dear colleague, that is not a question of privilege. 
The hon. member for Burin-St. 
MINISTER OF FISHERIES AND OCEANS 
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
I take exception to what the minister said.  
So, Mr. Speaker, I submit to Your Honour that the minister of fisheries- 
I do thank the hon. member for bringing up the point. 
I have ruled that this is not a question of privilege. 
It could be that the member would have a grievance of some sort. 
DECORUM IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
Standing Order 16 of the House of Commons provides that: 
The hon. members from what I can understand had a joust of words. 
We have that every day in the House of Commons.  
Dear colleagues, I will read the blues again.  
No, he didn't.  
I beg you, my colleagues, that I am not in a debate with you. 
I take that as an apology.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
I would like to table the document that details the information for the minister.  
The hon. member can deposit the document with the unanimous consent of the House. 
He wants to table a document. 
Does he have unanimous consent of the House?  
There is not unanimous consent.  
DECORUM IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
I would ask all hon. members to conduct themselves honorably. 
After all, we are the parliamentarians of Canada. 
I would like to leave it at that. 
I think the point has been discussed enough, my colleague.  
Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):
On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
Does it pertain to another matter? 
Is it a new point of order? 
I am putting the question directly to the hon. member for Richelieu. 
In a word: is this a new point of order?  
Mr. Speaker, the matter can be settled easily. 
This confirms that he apologized to the House. 
Is the member apologizing? 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
Is there another point of order?  
Come now, this is turning into a debate. 
We have work to do here.  
That tradition calls for respect of the Speaker's decisions, and I agree.  
That tradition does, however, also call for decorum in this House. 
Point made and accepted. 
Now, that is that for the moment.  
MINISTER OF FISHERIES AND OCEANS 
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the Chair for recognizing me. 
The short answer is yes.  
ORDER IN COUNCIL APPOINTMENTS 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
On the strength of these and other observations, the committee recommends as follows: 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, Question No. 23 will be answered today .[Text] 
The Cassiar asbestos mine in British Columbia has not been reopened. 
To date, there has been no industrial production.  
The pilot project is financed entirely by the private sector. 
I ask, Mr. Speaker, that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
Is it agreed that the remaining questions be allowed to stand?  
The motions will be grouped for debate as follows: 
Motions Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 12. 
Motions Nos. 18 and 19.  
The voting patterns for the motions within each group are available at the table. 
The Chair will remind the House of each pattern during the time of voting.  
A corrected version is available at the table.  
The chief government whip on a point of order.  
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I will be making copies of this technical amendment available at the table immediately. 
I thank in advance members opposite for their co-operation.  
Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. 
The Chair will do so as soon as possible. 
You are asking us to speak to the amendments first.  
This is the report stage of the bill. 
It is for the purpose of discussing amendments to the legislation. 
We are now on Group No. 1. 
We will be debating Motions Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 12. 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ) moved: 
``(ii) one individual appointed by each of the'' 
``matters and zoning by-laws that apply to neighbouring lands.''  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
First, marine infrastructure and services will respond to user needs. 
Sixth, overall levels of subsidization, direct and indirect, will be significantly reduced or eliminated.  
I think that is extremely important in the whole context of land management.  
That is extremely important right across the country. 
It is now in the bill if it passes. 
The second level of institutional control is of prime importance. 
We have made some modifications. 
We have made some real progress in certain areas. 
I mentioned Toronto a few minutes ago. 
They look like they are on their way to resolution. 
It seems only appropriate to include Hamilton in the bill.  
I exhort my hon. colleagues to allow this bill to go forward. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
This is a flawed bill. 
It had a lot of promise. 
Unfortunately, the builders lacked finishing skills. 
The final construction has a leaky roof and rather ill-fitting doors. 
There are no real excuses for the deficiencies in this bill.  
I will be introducing proposed amendments to this bill. 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
In this vein, I will not repeat the remarks made by my Reform colleague. 
The increased flexibility we are seeking in our amendments is necessary for the following reasons.  
First, we must discuss the limits of the areas managed by local port authorities. 
This is the thrust of one of our amendments.  
We will come back to that.  
This is the intent of our Motion No. 12, which the government will support.  
It is used for recreation and tourism.  
What is to be done, then, when several municipalities are affected by port operations? 
We know this often leads to more complex problems for community integration.  
In conclusion, I would like to take a few minutes to explain Motion No. 3. 
First I will read clause 14(1)(d): 
On the one hand, the government is privatizing. 
The government is privatizing but still retaining authority for appointing directors.  
We wanted to focus on the key points.  
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Therefore, I feel that the committee and Parliament were let down quite a bit. 
We think that would be a mistake. 
There have been some very exciting examples of this lately. 
However, this motion would deny them the right to continue to grow. 
It reduces flexibility and creates an impedance against growth for successful port authorities.  
That really would restrict imaginative, successful, viable port authorities.  
We feel that this is a much better idea than the original one. 
It creates flexibility and removes politics from the board. 
This removes some of that and we support it. 
This amendment goes a long way toward that.  
Motion No. 12. I am going to vote against this motion. 
We feel that this amendment is too vague. 
It gives too much control to the neighbouring jurisdictions. 
We do not support this motion.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
I do not make any bones about my background. 
I am comfortable with my position within the labour unions. 
In putting that point straight, I would like to comment on the motions. 
I will be recommending support of Motion No. 1. 
Therefore, I would also recommend that one.  
There is no question that Motion No. 3 will lead, I hope, to less patronage. 
I would strongly urge the government to move on that motion as well.  
I will be recommending support for all these motions.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
This is a bill which requires our uninterrupted attention.  
A balance must be struck in the amendments. 
I think that was a move in the right direction.  
The amendment and the bill must therefore be clear. 
That is the reason behind the proposed amendment.  
It is also important for zoning bylaws. 
I have an example that unfortunately is giving us pause right now. 
In my riding alone, there are three different ferries. 
That will result in a more worthwhile piece of legislation.  
We will probably get to the third reading on Friday. 
That is when the question will have to be asked. 
Let us look at how it can be done under the best possible conditions.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
I want to make a few comments about the modernization of the ports. 
I have some quarrels with one area however. 
This bill is not designed to favour municipal governments. 
As a result of that I cannot support Motion No. 1.  
It may vary between Port Alberni and so on. 
It seems to me that this somehow limits the growth. 
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
There is a port back home I want to mention. 
It is ideally situated, if you wish, and blessed with a good geography.  
They are big, extremely big.  
It is an industry that is practically impossible for a Canadian company to break into. 
The Americans have set their sights on taking over this port.  
Now this is interesting. 
Please hon. parliamentary secretary listen very intently to this. 
What party was he from?  
It was obviously the Liberal Party. 
He is a former minister in Mr. McKenna's government. 
The name of that individual is Mr. Al Lacey.  
Because they are hiring the best consultants they know how. 
That is why this bill is flawed. 
The group is no slouch when it comes to doing business. 
This group is a multilayered group of companies. 
Here are some of the companies which Mr. Randy Waterman is involved with:
Does this not sound much better, Charlotte County Ports? 
It does not end there. 
It does not end there. 
They pay them through a company called Trapp Hill Holdings.  
They will not correspond with a member of Parliament. 
They will not correspond with anyone. 
It is absolutely ludicrous to think the government would entertain doing that.  
Who is being paid off? 
I do not think I would. 
Who else in the House would? 
We do not need these types of people in Canada. 
We do not want these people taking over our ports. 
That is why we have to beef up the legislation. 
I hope to speak later to the same issue.  
Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne-Blainville, BQ):
We will try, through our amendments, to have this amount increased.  
It will no longer pay anything towards port administration. 
What does clause 14 say?  
(c) the province or provinces- 
Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
It is a great port. 
I agree wholeheartedly with the hon. member. 
He understands his constituency well. 
I say good for them.  
Let them come forward. 
We welcome everyone's participation in the process.  
The hon. member referred to Mr. Waterman. 
He wants the stone next door to the port.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I have a document which disproves that.  
The hon. member has to listen to the debate. 
He was very thorough in his examination of No. 12. 
We want it commercialized. 
Boy, that is a lot of government representation. 
That can be found under subclauses 8.2(c), (d) and (e).  
Do we want all lawyers running a port? 
You have a couple over there.  
Mr. Speaker is a lawyer and I respect the Speaker. 
However, we cannot support this particular motion. 
That can happen if there is a preview of the list of names. 
That list of names should not be sheltered to just four. 
(Divisions deemed demanded and deferred) 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.) moved: 
That Bill C-9, in Clause 31, be amended 
(a) by replacing line 14 on page 22 with the following: 
``(3) Subject to subsection (4), a port authority may not mortgage,'' 
(b) by replacing lines 18 to 26 on page 22 with the following: 
``revenues of that property.  
That Bill C-9, in Clause 46, be amended 
a) by replacing lines 3 to 7 on page 29 with the following: 
``property that it manages but it may 
(b) to the extent authorized in the letters patent, 
(ii) dispose of fixtures on federal real property.  
``195.1 Section 589 of the Act is replaced by the following: 
Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
The proposed act makes it easier for ports to operate according to business principles. 
It enables the Minister of Transport to commercialize the operations of the seaway. 
It improves the way pilotage authorities operate.  
They will be incorporated or continued by letters patent. 
We are also clearing up any defective section reference relating to the Canada Shipping Act. 
In some cases, municipalities never received this before. 
Agent status reinforces the port community from provincial taxation and regulation. 
The crown will not back up port loans.  
The borrowing limits for pilotage authorities are to be set by the governor in council.  
I urge all hon. members in this House to support Bill C-9.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
We only have half an hour left.  
Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
I am sure the House will be permissible for that.  
Is their consent to proceed now with Group 3?  
(Divisions deemed demanded and deferred) 
The motions are deemed to have been moved, seconded and read.  
``referred to in subsections 38(1) and (1.1) 
That Bill C-9 be amended by deleting clause 43.  
``tems and practices referred to in subsections 85(1) and (1.1) 
were, in the period under examination'' 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the House for its courtesy in speeding things up here.  
These address the problem of conflict of interest. 
Incredibly, Transport Canada made no objection to this clear conflict. 
This is the type of thing we would like to avoid.  
This is what the bill is about. 
Its determination would then be reported to the transport committee. 
Finally, Motions Nos. 9 and 17 are merely consequential to the other eight motions. 
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
He is a fellow by the name of Al Lacey.  
Who is Al Lacey? 
Al Lacey owns Lacey and Associates. 
Al Lacey is a former minister of economic development in the province of New Brunswick. 
That was the Liberal Party spelled with a large L . 
Mr. Paul Zed is in business with Mr. Doug Young, the former minister of transport.  
Would there be a possible conflict of interest? 
Doug Young, the former minister of transport charged with the overseeing of this bill. 
He was the minister. 
The name of the document is ``Bayside Port Acquisition and Development Proposal''.  
They want to take ownership of that port. 
That is why the make-up and integrity of that board is so important.  
The parliamentary secretary did mention an individual by the name of Fred Nicholson. 
Fred Nicholson is an honourable man. 
He is a lawyer. 
He is a very bright individual. 
I want to point this out- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The hon. member is absolutely correct. 
I had cautioned the hon. member for Charlotte. 
So I know he will not want to use props. 
I invite him to continue his remarks without any aids.  
I wanted to make a point with regard to Mr. Nicholson. 
He is an honourable man. 
He is representing the community well. 
There is no question about that.  
It does not end there. 
Can you believe it, Mr. Speaker? 
It is absolutely ludicrous that it would entertain doing that.  
This is terribly wrong.  
Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Another point that the member for Charlotte might want to recognize.  
Ports cannot dispose of federal land. 
Agent status will be limited to core port activities. 
Non-core activities will not receive agent status. 
The government will have to approve which non-core activities a port may undertake.  
Ports will not be able to borrow as agents. 
They will have to convince commercial lenders of the merits of their proposed investments. 
The crown will not back up port loans. 
Borrowing limits will be established for each port. 
The Minister of Transport will specify the maximum terms of leases. 
Port development aspirations will be subjected to ordinary measures of commercial risk. 
Did the port follow the rules? 
Do the records provide a full and fair disclosure of how the port was run?  
Does the port have the right set of rules? 
These are appropriate arrangements to support the commercialization of our ports. 
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to comment on Group No. 3.  
I add my support to the hon. member for Charlotte. 
Why does it have to hire a former member of Parliament to support it? 
Why does it have to hire that team? 
Motion No. 5 seems to be a reasonable request. 
In part it reads: 
-A port authority shall establish a code of conduct and system of practices- 
It goes along with clause 41 and we support it.  
Motion No. 7 states in part: 
Basically that is our position on those motions. 
Now I will move to Motion No. 13 and onward.  
Motion No. 13 states in part: 
Motion No. 15 states in part: 
It is a good position. 
Motion No. 16 states in part: 
We say no to this motion. 
We are against Motion No. 16.  
Motion No. 17 would delete clause 89. 
We are against this motion. 
Is the House ready for the question?  
(Divisions deemed demanded and deferred) 
Group No. 4, Motions Nos. 18 and 19, is the next group of motions.  
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ) moved: 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.) moved: 
That Bill C-9 be amended by 
(b) adding after line 8 on page 79 the following: 
This is thoroughly consistent with past practices.  
This is thoroughly consistent with past practices.  
Harbour commissions are the only group not included in this list. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
They have fallen through the cracks. 
Their pensions are not portable and the bill literally leaves them hung out to dry.  
They are not great in numbers but nevertheless these are real people. 
Some consideration should have been given to them.  
Motion No. 18 really has the same deficiency. 
Motion No. 18 looks after them so well that we will not support it. 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
Allow me to explain.  
So, Motion No. 19 moved by the government does not satisfy us. 
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Madam Speaker, I rise on the last group of motions. 
I am little troubled. 
We prefer Motion No. 19. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
There had been little or no discussion with the employees. 
It then went toward insurable earnings. 
That person would not even be allowed to use it for retirement.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member for Churchill is the last member to speak.  
We are going through a major change here. 
This situation will not affect only Canada Ports. 
The issue will keep coming back. 
I will be supporting Motion No. 18 because I believe it is more encompassing. 
Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member for Souris-Moose Mountain.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Those were the terms that he used. 
May I present this to the hon. minister. 
Those are my two points.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
(Recorded divisions deemed demanded and deferred) 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I will start by quoting from the auditor general's report from 1993. He said: 
He went on to say: 
We believe that that is taxation without representation. 
Pretty clearly, others feel the same way.  
This should cause us to be pretty suspicious. 
The government was in a terrible pinch in 1995. 
That is being done through user fees.  
Apart from that is the issue of fairness.  
I can tell you that people are very concerned about it. 
They have to compete with the Americans and others around the world. 
These user fees make it extraordinarily difficult for them to do this.  
It is $3.8 billion a year.  
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):
This is not all. 
Crown corporations would effectively be paralyzed vis-a-vis the private sector.  
This would make the implementation of user programs virtually impossible.  
The user fee concept is not new. 
Canadians have paid passport fees since the 1800s. 
It is cost effective, administratively sound and a fair way to deliver government services.  
In 1992-93 we were spending $122.6 billion in program spending. 
We have succeeded in bringing our program spending under control. 
We have managed our affairs effectively while maintaining quality service to Canadians.  
Bill C-205 would not contribute to that success. 
It would indeed threaten it. 
The intentions of Bill C-205 are unworkable. 
I cannot therefore support the bill.  
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
This Reform bill addresses this legitimate concern by the auditor general. 
Who is paying for this new approach? 
Today, national camping facilities cost more than private camping facilities.  
Bill C-205 comes at the right moment to unmask the Liberals' game. 
Where is this money going? 
The Minister of Finance did not say anything about that either. 
Whenever this government has to account to the people, it shirks its responsibility. 
There is a long list of examples.  
What is it trying to hide from the public?  
Who are the losers in this economic debate? 
The workers, who are heavily penalized by this Liberal government. 
With this bill, democracy could make strides. 
The finance minister's game is obvious. 
The time has come to put a stop to these hidden taxes. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
The report of the committee is subject to the concurrence of the House. 
The regulating authority is bound by the decision of the House.  
There is a lack of scrutiny.  
User fees are more and more present for services which the government provides. 
It is easy to show a surplus when services are cut. 
People are affected by these user fees that are imposed on them. 
They are hitting us from every angle. 
As the years went by the list got longer and longer. 
Such is the case with the Government of Canada.  
This legislation would be a start. 
They would have a chance to have public debate on user fee increases. 
This is why I will be supporting this bill.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
There are others who say he should be ignited. 
It is a very serious topic.  
I will talk about some of these fees.  
First, the fee must be based on the actual cost of providing the service. 
Some fees are much higher than the cost of the service being provided.  
Second, these services must be provided cost effectively. 
This is an important point. 
We have seen too much of this kind of thing in the past. 
Cross-subsidization should not be occurring.  
Some general concerns have been expressed by farmers and others in the agriculture industry. 
Some of these concerns have been expressed to me by many different groups. 
There is the Crop Protection Institute. 
We have to look at them and their cumulative effect on industry. 
These are my concerns. 
I see that my time is up. 
Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
I must say I am still looking.  
What is the intent of this bill? 
That was my question. 
The definition of user fees is too broad. 
I think this is going too far. 
Charging user fees is good government. 
The same might also happen with programs. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Does the hon. member for Medicine Hat wish to conclude for five minutes?  
I think hon. members across the way are simply raising bogeymen. 
This would actually give committees something meaningful to do. 
This would probably draw more attention to committees. 
There is no doubt about that. 
That is something that belongs in a third world. 
That opens ourselves up to corruption and those sorts of practices. 
We do not want to have that in our country. 
This would be a wonderful opportunity for the government to do that.  
People are not going to argue about the price of firewood if it looks reasonable. 
That is probably good.  
We need to have that kind of mechanism in committee. 
We do not have it in the House of Commons. 
We do not have a problem with user fees. 
That has not happened. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House?  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Health Canada statistics illustrate the extent of this tragedy.  
These numbers are just the tip of the iceberg. 
What is our government's response to this crisis? 
Is the government hoping to improve the situation by reducing already scarce resources? 
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):
There is no pressure on communities to take up the transfer.  
I assure the member- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member for Dartmouth.  
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
One year after it was tabled and where are we? 
Persons with disabilities and their services are under attack more than ever. 
Disability pensions will be harder to get and worth less.  
How are people supposed to go to work or to the doctor? 
How are they to visit their mothers? 
Attendant care is being slashed. 
People have to fight for the right to have a bath once a week. 
What about protection under the law? 
It is time to safeguard the quality of life for our most vulnerable citizens. 
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):
The national forum told us that we should preserve what we have. 
We can do better with respect to the services provided. 
We can do better with respect to the use of prescription drugs, compliance and prescribing. 
They are of relative importance compared with other elements of health care.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
That is not good enough. 
Presently in Canada we spend $10.8 billion annually on drugs. 
Out of that $10.8 billion about $5 billion is for prescription drugs. 
It did not stop there. 
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):
They have increased in relative importance compared to other health care sectors. 
We are now just beginning this dialogue.  
A new federal-provincial-territorial working group is beginning a process. 
Stakeholders must also be involved in the dialogue.  
The development of a national approach to pharmacare will be collaborative. 
It is must be done- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member for Waterloo-Wellington.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
I wondered where that left Canada.  
There is tremendous trade potential in this hemisphere for Canada. 
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Canadian business representatives are bullish on the region.  
Fast track is not a technical requirement for the negotiations to begin. 
We hope for a successful result in time for the Santiago meeting.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
(The sitting of the House was suspended at 7.03 p.m.) 
The House resumed at 10.15 p.m. 
A message was delivered by the Usher of the Black Rod as follows: 
Accordingly, the Speaker with the House went up to the Senate chamber.  
(The House adjourned at 10.27 p.m.)
