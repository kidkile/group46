The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Congratulations on a job well done.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Canada Lands Surveyors Bill 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Recombinant Bovine Growth Hormone 
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Tuesday next, May 12, 1998, I will move: 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I suppose we could make an estimate. 
We look forward to that response.  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
By February of 1995, this requirement had been dropped. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Reports indicate that the cod stocks have not returned. 
Hon. Duncan J. Jessiman :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Duncan J. Jessiman :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Is that their intention when they go to the meeting?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I have heard other suggestions that it may be held on Wednesday. 
I would think that that would be the indication at the present time.  
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Yesterday, the Prime Minister of Canada all but contradicted his health minister. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, Minister Rock has taken leadership on all of these issues.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Can the Leader of the Government shed any further light on this situation?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Answer to Order Paper Question Tabled 
Income Tax Conventions Implementation Bill, 1998 
Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
Let us take a moment to put this bill into perspective. 
Major changes have taken place since 1971. 
Tax treaties are very important for our country. 
Let me give you a few examples. 
I would now like to talk about source deductions. 
In addition, these conventions will promote better relations with these countries.  
On motion of Senator Kinsella, debate adjourned.  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-debate adjourned 
Needless to say, Canada's marine community deserves better.  
The marine sector can only benefit from a modern act.  
Canada must preserve its competitive edge on the international market. 
The other provisions will be incorporated into the second track of the reforms.  
There has been an extensive overhaul of the administration of pension plans in recent years. 
In addition, these changes will improve the corporation's ability to manage the pension fund.  
This addition will provide direction for the remainder of the legislation. 
The government will take another look at the existing provisions on licencing.  
On motion of Senator Kinsella, for Senator Forrestall, debate adjourned.  
Hon. William M. Kelly :
Honourable senators, I move the adoption of this report.  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Report of Special Committee Requesting Authorization to Meet In Camera Adopted 
Hon. William M. Kelly :
Honourable senators, I move the adoption of this report.  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
2. the then Deputy Minister of National Defence; 
3. the then Acting Chief of Staff of the Minister of National Defence; 
4. the then special advisor to the Minister of National Defence (M. Campbell); 
5. the then special advisor to the Minister of National Defence (J. 
6. the persons occupying the position of Judge Advocate General during the relevant period; 
7. the then Deputy Judge Advocate General (litigation); and 
8. the then Chief of Defence Staff and Deputy Chief of Defence Staff.  
"9. the present Minister of National Defence.".  
At that time, certain members of the special committee refused to continue the inquiry.  
Such is the case with the Somalia incident.  
They are only now starting to get back on their feet. 
Several extensions were granted to the inquiry.  
No one condones the terrible events that happened in Somalia. 
We were all saddened by their impact. 
Honourable senators, the time has come to move on. 
We have learned the lessons of Somalia. 
It is time to stop damning the military and their families. 
It is time to call a halt to suspicions, unfair accusations, insinuations and hostilities. 
The planned amendments will mean greater honesty, fairness and transparency within the system.  
Let us not raise that red flag again.  
On motion of Senator DeWare, debate adjourned.  
For the rest of you, the minister said, "the file is now closed." 
In other words: "See you in court if you feel badly done by."  
Honourable senators, a file on human tragedy is never closed. 
I will summarize them as follows: 
If he had added that proviso, he would have been on firm ground. 
Perhaps, legally, he is on firmer ground. 
I should like to return to the Krever report, which states in part: 
However uncertain the results may be, the costs of litigation are unreasonably high. 
They pose a significant problem in respect of access and the affordability of civil justice."  
The evidence points out how we ignored the cautions taken in the United States.  
Senator Graham, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, replied on the same day: 
No one could help but be moved by the plight of those affected, the victims. 
We accept those conclusions without reservation. 
We accept them in their entirety.  
The victims and their families are suffering because of official negligence. 
Canadians overwhelmingly support them.  
Hon. Celine Hervieux-Payette :
Some people have apparently died as a result. 
I could name many other illnesses. 
Should this system apply in all sectors?  
As parliamentarians debating this important issue, it is easy to hand out money. 
We are well aware that this money comes from Canadian taxpayers. 
We must act responsibly. 
We are all saddened by this situation. 
In this case, it was done with knowledge. 
It was known that the blood was tainted. 
That is the difference.  
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
Does the honourable senator agree with that?  
I quoted from that recommendation, and I can quote it again. 
They are boasting about taking the lead. 
The federal government drew them into this.  
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Honourable senators, this is a complex subject. 
The senator mentioned a universal program. 
How many people are we talking about? 
When should the payment be made? 
How should the payment be divided between the federal and the provincial governments? 
Perhaps the honourable senator could cite a precedent. 
If there is such a precedent, what would be the consequence of that?  
I have asked a series of questions. 
Perhaps the honourable senator cannot respond to them today. 
However, when he rereads them, he may be able to respond at a later date. 
This is of concern to all of us.  
Are we creating a precedent with this? 
Surely to God we are not. 
Surely to God we will learn from this. 
This is the tragedy. 
The government knew the blood had not been tested. 
They refused to implement testing procedures which were already available. 
Surely to God this will not happen again.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, "The file is closed." 
Honourable senators, governance cannot be allowed to mean "managing the file." 
The role of government is to serve the people. 
The case was not closed.  
The Premier of Ontario continues: 
Details aside, the issue is not one of dollars but one of compassion and humanity. 
I urge the federal government to make the same commitment.  
This will allow officials to work out the details of assistance in a timely manner.  
Honourable senators, I endorse the recommendations of the Krever commission. 
They will meet representatives of the people who have been affected. 
They will follow the instructions of the House of Commons. 
I see my honourable colleague nodding in acquiescence.  
Tainted by the Mulroney system.  
Let me complete my question, please.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
That is such a narrow-minded approach.  
I think he was fair in his comments.  
We need this kind of exchange more often in this chamber.  
We are engaged in a serious debate on a matter of national tragedy. 
Honourable senators, we shall vigorously participate in this debate. 
On motion of Senator Carstairs, debate adjourned.  
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, May 12, 1998, at 2 p.m.
