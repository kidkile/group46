Committee Authorized to Meet During Sitting of Senate 
Thursday, March 19, 1998 
The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
The Honourable Leonard S. Marchand, P.C. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
They had paddled the wilderness waters and knew the pain of the portage. 
They knew the treeless lands and the unspoiled rivers. 
They were the key to a vital part of our identity. 
He has been a strong catalyst in affecting that change. 
He has brought the voice of Canada's First Nations to centre stage. 
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
Senator Graham pointed out that he beat Davie Fulton. 
They were just resting and making the position available to each other. 
I would like to believe that anyway, on the part of both these gentlemen.  
Senator Marchand was, for the lack of a better phrase, a pioneer in Canadian politics. 
He first got involved in politics in 1965 as a political assistant. 
This, honourable senators, cannot be said about Senator Marchand. 
I have great respect for his integrity. 
When hunting elephants, we were never side-tracked by rabbit tracks.  
Jet lag is an ongoing state. 
Len Marchand is a great storyteller. 
I am sure we have all shared in Len's stories. 
I would also like to remember Len as Len the scientist. 
In conclusion, I pay tribute to Len and Donna as parents. 
I hope that our paths will cross again soon.  
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Len was a distinct and unique member of that unique and distinct class. 
As with the Okanagan tribe, he was always peaceful and productive. 
For Len was - and is - first and foremost a Canadian.  
For me, Len's life serves as a living idea of Canada. 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
For that, I am deeply grateful.  
He was, as others have said, a first.  
Senator Marchand was the first aboriginal cabinet minister. 
Senator Marchand never gave up. 
Beyond all that, Len Marchand is a close friend. 
I know he will never cease serving.  
I will miss him a great deal. 
I wish him good health. 
Honourable senators, I served in the political process of this country with Len Marchand. 
We worked together as assistants to a minister. 
He served as a minister, as I did at a different time. 
We both served in this chamber.  
I can do little more than summarize Len Marchand's career. 
Freedom of Speech and Parliamentary Propriety 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
The following quotations are taken from the House of Commons Hansard: 
The public ... is left with the impression that Senate seats are for sale.  
Was it a downpayment on a seat in the Senate?  
Unfounded smears and fallacious allegations aimed at its members, however, are completely unacceptable.  
International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Racism has no place in this society.  
Hon. Rose-Marie Losier-Cool :
I must limit myself in my examples for lack of time.  
And this vitality may be found among the over 53,000 francophones in Alberta.  
But this Canadian Francophonie is also a reality. 
Writer Antonine Maillet compares this Francophonie to a symphony. 
That is how I see it, too. 
Clarification of Previous Statement 
I therefore wish to correct this part of my speech.  
Racial Discrimination in Justice System in Nova Scotia 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
In 1997 this situation remains unchanged.  
This report also comments that: 
They have not allowed it to gather dust on some bookshelf. 
Instead, they have responded positively by hiring an equity officer. 
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration 
Fourteenth Report of Committee Adopted 
Thursday, March 19, 1998 
Professional and Special Services $ 30,000 
Transport and Communications 146,594 
All Other Expenditures 6,500 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?

Transport and Communications 13,049 
All Other Expenditures 5,500 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
The Hon. the Speaker :

Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Small Business Loans Act 
Bill to Amend-First Reading 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
International Summit of Sexually Exploited Children and Youth 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
I should like to start with one today.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
It will be managed by a board of directors composed of citizens.  
I did not say "Liberals." 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
That takes a lot imagination!  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the Honourable Senator Oliver is correct. 
It is an extremely good question.  
The answer is a very positive yes.  
Continuing Increase in University Tuition Fees-Government Position 
Honourable senators, I should like to ask a further question regarding education funding for students.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
That must be in Manitoba.  
They have risen 100 per cent in Manitoba, with a Tory government. 
Honourable senators, I am aware that tuition fees have risen across the country. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Why is it in the budget, then?  
What is the reply of the government to those representations?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
What has that to do with it?  
This is not something new. 
It is something that has been done on a continuing basis.  
The Leader of the Government speaks to us of the Canadian millennium scholarships. 
The students are satisfied and they pay back their loans. 
What more could anyone want?  
I cannot understand the comments by the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
Answers to Order Paper Questions Tabled 
Depository Bills and Notes Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
This year, 1998, is very special year for the Yukon. 
The lure of gold was astounding. 
You will be well received and certainly will enjoy our great territory.  
However, the process of transferring responsibilities is far from complete. 
It will be done at the territorial level. 
The Yukon territorial government has offered its unqualified support for Bill C-8. 
Yukon First Nations also support this bill. 
The bill is also supported by industry. 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Honourable senators, I have a question. 
I do not want to speak to the substance of the bill. 
I am in support of it generally. 
Senator Lucier expressed an interest in seeing all of us come to the Yukon. 
He extended an invitation for us to visit. 
The invitation is gratefully acknowledged. 
As long as he is paying the bills, we will all come.  
On motion of Senator DeWare, on behalf of Senator Spivak, debate adjourned.  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
This is Senator Di Nino's private member's bill. 
This bill is short and, I might add, to the point. 
My comments will be equally so. 
Let me state from the very beginning that I support the principle of this bill. 
I am concerned about the definition of "reading material." 
What exactly would be encompassed by this bill? 
For instance, most books are good and valuable. 
I for one would be very loath to censor any book, periodical or reading material. 
They were correct in their concern. 
However, honourable senators, that raises a most interesting question.  
Reading opens a whole world of opportunities for people of all socio-economic classes. 
We want to encourage our children to read. 
She was not a TV watcher. 
She still is not.  
I look forward to the deliberations of this committee.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Consideration of Final Report of Special Committee-Debate Continued 
I have known Dr. Bonnell for close to 30 years. 
The President of McGill University, Dr. Robert Shapiro, said last year: 
The capacity of Canada's universities to reinvent themselves over time is quite stunning.  
The President of York University, Dr. Lorna Marsden, has remarked: 
We do both, and we do them both well.  
Good, accessible, higher education is one of the things that makes Canada Canada. 
The two go hand in hand. 
Two million people will pursue some form of study this year. 
However, try telling that to students. 
I do not think that is the approach we want to take.  
This is not acceptable.  
We cannot settle for less.  
Let me turn to some of the recommendations in the report. 
There are two areas which tie all the others together: accessibility and quality.  
Today, that number has doubled.  
I have no hesitation in supporting these proposals.  
Prince Edward Island has made some important strides in this regard. 
Our technical college, Holland College, exports educational programs. 
There are tremendous benefits to be gained, both culturally and economically.  
One of the most important things that - 
We can take pride in the kind of higher education system this country has produced. 
In some other countries, higher education is limited to the rich and the brilliant. 
They are our future. 
On motion of Senator Carstairs, for Senator Forest, debate adjourned.  
Report of Social Affairs, Science and Technology Committee Adopted 
I commend this modest budget to the support of colleagues.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Statement of Minister of Finance-Inquiry-Debate Continued 
First, I should like to congratulate the minister on achieving a balanced budget. 
The article itself goes on to state: 
Martin has benefited from some huge strokes of luck. 
That is not me who is saying that; that is someone else saying that. 
The article goes on about the future, and states: 
Honourable senators, that gap continues to widen. 
I will try to tell you. 
Real incomes are standing still. 
From time to time, the government tells us that payroll taxes are a problem. 
Pick a colour, any colour. 
Second, whatever happened to the Liberal support for medicare? 
To quote Susan Riley of The Ottawa Citizen in her article on March 11: 
I quote from The Ottawa Citizen of March 11, 1998: 
He said in a press release dated March 2, 1998: 
The crisis exists today and must be addressed immediately.  
Honourable senators, imagine what we are in for. 
They are predicting 60 million deaths should this occur. 
Mr. Charest is noted in The Toronto Sun on February 26, 1998 as stating: 
- "He" being the PM - 
To quote The Globe and Mail of February 26: 
It is also politically egocentric, administratively inept and strategically stupid.  
Hon. John G. Bryden :
The Globe and Mail .  
Hon. Philippe Deane Gigantes :
The distinguished Mr. Thorsell.  
To quote Saskatchewan's Finance Minister, Eric Cline: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
May I have leave to continue?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Then leave is not granted.  
They should reduce it to 74.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Leave is not granted.  
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Honourable senators, it is my pleasure, on behalf of Senator Stratton, to finish his speech.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I believe this was a motion by Honourable Senator Stratton. 
He was speaking in closing.  
I am the next speaker on the same subject.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
He has never spoken. 
This was his first speech.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Did he not speak when he introduced the motion?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I have a point of order.  
I will close in about 12 seconds.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Senator Bryden on a point of order.  
He just finished speaking on it. 
Is Senator Stratton now speaking again?  
I did not say that.  
If that is so, the debate is finished.  
I said that I would finish Senator Stratton's speech.  
Can we get the comment read back? 
We used to be able to do that in court.  
He said he was speaking for Senator Stratton.  
I do not speak for anyone else but myself at any time.  
You said you would finish his speech.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, this is a very interesting point. 
He is certainly the only one I see on his feet.  
We need a little livening up here on Thursday afternoon. 
Will your speech be more accurate?  
If I may continue, honourable senators, here we are.  
I would like to make some suggestions to the minister. 
On motion of Senator DeWare, for Senator Spivak, debate adjourned.  
Concerns of Albertans-Inquiry-Debate Continued 
Hon. Philippe Deane Gigantes :
That may be easy to dismiss. 
That is not very well thought out.  
Without it, we do not have a democracy. 
It is wrong to say, "Ah, if only everyone were non-partisan." 
Consider this business of not wanting an elected Senate. 
There would be errors and difficulties in electing the Senate. 
They are not supporting our proposition." 
If the Senate opposes their proposition, they say, "What good is the Senate? 
It is opposing something that we want." 
Therefore, not electing the Senate is not necessarily a good solution.  
These are serious matters that must be considered. 
I do not think Senator Ghitter gave them sufficient consideration. 
I think we should examine this issue. 
This is too serious a matter. 
Consider the appointing process. 
Senator Ghitter wants to substitute a committee for the Prime Minister.  
I like Senator Jessiman. 
I think he is a fine senator. 
Senator DeWare is magnificent. 
I find Senator Lynch-Staunton a difficult but effective Leader of the Opposition. 
But it was Mr. Mulroney who appointed him, not a committee. 
Committees, remember, given the job of designing a horse, often come up with a camel.  
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Is this what you are saying?  
I much admire many of the qualities of Senator Ghitter. 
I did not expect you to feel the same way on that side.  
Hon. Duncan J. Jessiman :
Honourable senators, I, too, rise to speak on this particular matter. 
- and I emphasize the word "independent" - 
Region 1 - British Columbia and the Yukon 
Region 2 - Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut 
(2) Provisions in respect of the Appointments Commission should include the following: 
(e) term of office of its members 
(f) the filling of vacancies; 
(g) the remuneration, if any, of its members; and 
(h) the appointment of officers, e.g. Chairman.  
(i) Academics who have distinguished themselves in their field of expertise; 
(iii) Persons who are well versed in the subject of agriculture; 
(v) Politicians or ex-politicians who have served as a: 
(aa) Minister in the House of Commons; 
(bb) Minister in a Provincial Legislature; 
(cc) Leader of an official party in the House of Commons; 
(dd) Premier in a Provincial Legislature; 
(ee) Leader of Opposition in a Provincial Legislature; and/or 
Honourable senators, here I set out the regions. 
Region One is British Columbia. 
Region Three would be Ontario, 24 senators, 1 vote each, 24 total.  
Region 4 would be Quebec, 24 senators, 1 vote each, 24 total.  
The total ends with 24 votes each.  
That formula would result in equal representation by region. 
(7) The Senate, by a majority vote, shall recommend to the Governor General in Council: 
(a) the person who should hold the office of Speaker of the Senate; and 
(b) the term for which such person should hold office.  
More power to Ontario!  
Or a commission of doctors at least.  
On motion of Senator Carstairs, for Senator Lucier, debate adjourned.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Leave having been given to proceed to Notice of Inquiry No. 21: 
Hon. Jean-Robert Gauthier rose pursuant to notice of Tuesday, March 17, 1998: 
In addition, there are 62 million occasional francophones.  
The Francophonie is political, cultural and technical. 
Within the Francophonie, no single head of state has supremacy over the others.  
In the Commonwealth, a number of countries have English as their sole official language. 
As in the Commonwealth, there is a diversity of political structures in the Francophonie. 
In Tunisia, Canada helped build three secondary schools. 
It introduced a livestock vaccination program in Niger. 
More tangibly, there is the field of communications. 
Who has not heard of the Communaute radiophonique des pays de langue francaise? 
Who has not heard of TV5? 
Need I mention the diversity of Canada's contribution to culture? 
Our artists perform on stages throughout the French-speaking world.  
Its founding members were all Canadians or Africans. 
As can be seen, La Francophonie has many faces. 
It is present at numerous international events. 
La Francophonie is also present in the world of sports. 
It holds its own games. 
Clearly, the French-speaking world is constantly evolving. 
Its roots lie deep in a shared culture anchored by a common language.  
Hon. John G. Bryden :
His most remarkable speech gave me great pleasure. 
On motion of Senator Gigantes, debate adjourned.  
Legalization of Industrial Hemp Cultivation 
Hon. Lorna Milne rose pursuant to notice of March 17, 1998: 
There will be a new crop growing in Canada. 
For the first time in over 60 years, hemp will be legal. 
Not only did he understand, he took action.  
As I said in this place on June 19, 1996: 
Two groups appeared before the committee to talk about hemp. 
The Canadian Industrial Hemp Lobby also gave evidence. 
They cited high workloads as being the major reason for their lack of progress. 
Honourable senators, they came through on their deadline.  
Essentially, hemp can be grown across Canada. 
That means only three parts in 1,000. 
All they will get for their purposes is a massive headache.  
Farmers constantly feel that they are under threat by urbanized society. 
We often forget that food is essential to life. 
This will give all of Canada a great advantage in the world economy. 
There is also potential for a great deal of spin-off benefits to Canadian industry. 
Now and then, opportunities such as this arise. 
Be on the look out for them, new senators. 
Watch this new opportunity being harvested in August. 
Watch history being made. 
Just watch our Canadian farmers beat the world.  
On motion of Senator DeWare, debate adjourned.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Committee Authorized to Meet During Sitting of Senate 
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, March 24, 1998, at 2 p.m.
