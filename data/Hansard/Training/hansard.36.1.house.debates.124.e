Wednesday, September 23, 1998 
The House met at 2 p.m. 
Members sang the national anthem ] 
Mr. Carmen Provenzano (Sault Ste. Marie, Lib.):
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
The accident left him unable to fulfil his dreams of becoming a police officer.  
I think he deserves more than just a form letter from the government benches.  
``Will incidents like mine be properly dealt with by the law? 
All we victims ask for is justice.  
Mrs. Claudette Bradshaw (MonctonRiverview-Dieppe, Lib.):
My sincere congratulations to Mr. Doucet for this well-deserved honour.  
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):
This is a win-win program. 
Canada wins because young Canadians are made more productive. 
Participants win because they acquire new skills and confidence. 
Funding comes from the private sector and Human Resources Canada.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
His reply was ``We cannot turn back the clock''. 
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
It has been acquired by Peterborough This Week , one of our community newspapers. 
I urge all members to renew their subscriptions to the Oldtimers' Hockey News .  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
His wife and four children survive him.  
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
I urge the minister to continue to build on this success.  
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
Why, Mr. Minister, are they driven to such dire straits? 
RIDING OF BEAUPORT-MONTMORENCY-COTE-DE-BEAUPRE-ILE-D'ORLEANS 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
That name is Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-ile-d'Orleans.  
I will explain the characteristics of this designation:
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Federal employees have been waiting far too long. 
Let me tell the House about one of these employees. 
She strongly believed in pay equity.  
That letter was really important to Ms. Wry. 
She held on to this letter until her death last January. 
It was in vain.  
How many more women will have to die before this is settled?  
Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):
Congratulations to them both.  
TORONTO INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL 
Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
I am delighted to rise today- 
The hon. member for Portneuf.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
The hon. member for Langley-Abbotford.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is the week the UN has declared to be World Maritime Week. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Five of them became so violent they actually had to be arrested themselves.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, they were arrested.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, five were arrested- 
The Leader of the Opposition.  
Five were arrested, Mr. Speaker. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The exact same rules applied to everyone. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Who will be investigating the role of the Prime Minister in this whole affair? 
Will the Prime Minister co-operate fully?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have nothing to hide. 
They have volunteered to be there. 
The sherpa responsible for the conference will appear also.  
The commission will decide who it wants to hear. 
It will do its work. 
Let it do its work.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
In fact, Canadians have every right to the truth on this matter. 
I really wish that they would let them do their work.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my supplementary question is to the Prime Minister.  
We, like all Canadians, want to know the truth. 
We know there is a commission. 
We know the commission cannot investigate the government. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the answer is no.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. 
He has now had time to reflect on those facts.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
There is an inquiry and the inquiry will ask questions.  
Everything will be available for the commission to look at.  
We received these leaders and everything went according- 
The hon. leader of the New Democratic Party.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
There is a process in place. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We know that she understands the party has to evolve a bit.  
And we are very happy that Nelson Mandela is coming here.  
The hon. leader of the Conservative Party.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Indonesia under Suharto killed countless people. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
This minister has a responsibility as the solicitor general. 
He is not just a cabinet minister. 
He is the Solicitor General of Canada for all Canadians.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
That is quite right, Mr. Speaker, and I am very much aware of that. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
We will get to the truth, as Canadians expect. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Our candidates are here today. 
They are off and running. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
He became Prime Minister in the fall of 1993. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We cannot do it alone.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
However, it is certainly not our intention to accept the Bloc Quebecois' suggestion.  
This sort of spectacle will not help the dollar''. 
So much for the suggestion of the Bloc Quebecois.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
I think the minister should take note. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, once again, I am not saying you should take my word for it. 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I have named people of different religions and different colours. 
I have given them the chance to be in the other house.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
There are similar projects just about everywhere in Canada.  
PRESIDENT OF SOUTH AFRICA 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
I would like to know what Canada intends to do to mark- 
Now we will proceed with wonderful Wednesday.  
Nevertheless, Mr. Speaker, my question is harmless enough.  
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
Tomorrow, President Mandela will address Parliament.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (LaSalle-Emard, Lib.):
That was the first time I had heard of that. 
Let me be clear- 
The hon. member for Calgary-Nose Hill.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to do so. 
I do not make those. 
Mr. Dussault reports to the Superintendent of Financial Institutions.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the document of the ambassador speaks for itself.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Once they got here, they threatened to shoot Canadians.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Mr. Speaker, in case this government does not know, I will inform it.  
Suharto's army has killed millions of people in Indonesia. 
These are the very soldiers they let into Canada.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
There are public hearings being held now across the country. 
Halifax earlier this month.  
We also appointed an arm's length science advisory board.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Twenty-four hours have elapsed. 
What NAFTA or WTO action has been taken?  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
We will follow the legal course that is available to us through NAFTA and WTO.  
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
The disease has to be treated in that way. 
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, quite the contrary. 
We have been assured by the public complaints commission that these processes are done informally. 
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We are well aware that we had to make very, very difficult decisions.  
We have come with what I think is a fair and balanced package. 
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Trade.  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Our patience is not unlimited. 
That brings to a conclusion our question period for today.  
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour, Lib.):
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
PUBLIC WORKS AND GOVERNMENT SERVICES 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
This is the exact House that these renovations apply to. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Now we will return to the daily routine of business.  
Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
We almost got the United States to agree.  
Mr. Joe Comuzzi (Thunder Bay-Superior North, Lib.):
That is one of the real achievements of the Canada-United States Interparliamentary Group. 
We have several others on which I will report at a later date.  
COMPREHENSIVE NUCLEAR TEST-BAN TREATY IMPLEMENTATION ACT 
CANADA SMALL BUSINESS FINANCING ACT 
CANADA POST CORPORATION ACT 
I am speaking about the rural route mail couriers of which there are 5,000. 
LABOUR MARKET TRAINING ACT 
This bill would amend section 161 of the Criminal Code. 
Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Middlesex, Lib.):
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions to present to the House today.  
POST-TAGS EARLY RETIREMENT PROGRAM 
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
There are grave injustices and inequities in the present program. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions to present today.  
The first one is from both British Columbia and Alberta. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
I present this petition on behalf of those constituents.  
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Motion No. P-30 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I therefore ask the hon. member to withdraw his motion.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Chair recognizes the solicitor general.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I suggest the motion be transferred for debate.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The motion is transferred for debate pursuant to Standing Order 97(1).  
Mr. Speaker, there is a second point.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Just a moment, please. 
On a point of order, the hon. member for Saskatoon-Humboldt.  
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
These questions have been on the Order Paper for over seven months. 
I am asking for a third time. 
Could the parliamentary secretary inform me as to when I can expect a response? 
I want to know when I will have an answer.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Motion No. P-31 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, transfer for debate.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The motion is transferred for debate pursuant to Standing Order 97(1).  
Motion No. P-4 
Motion No. P-29 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I will now speak to my two amendments. 
I had the encouragement of the industry minister throughout. 
I will only keep you for a short minute or two. 
By the way, do you have children or grandchildren or your own? 
It is a charity, however. 
I will cite an example. 
The International Fund for Animal Welfare is an organization based offshore. 
The reality is that it is against the law to kill white coats. 
We do not do that here in Canada.  
However, they have no compunction. 
They are known worldwide. 
We must remember that the operative word is wilful. 
Accidental is one thing but wilful is another. 
If is a partial first step.  
I will give a little example. 
In other words, they have the same account with Canada Post.  
This again is an enormous step.  
I will give an example of the problem. 
Again the operative word is wilful. 
It does go on and on. 
One would think they would be able to do it on their own. 
The International Fund for Animal Welfare. 
They do not even do their own work on their own. 
That is not a charity. 
There are some 22,000 of them.  
It is interesting that only these two United Way organizations appear. 
I guess other United Way organizations deal with other direct marketers in the United States.  
Voter Education South Africa Canada, Whale Adoption Fund, the White Ribbon Campaign. 
It was up here a few years ago. 
Wildlife Preservation Trust Canada. 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
It has three components to it. 
It is a whistleblowing amendment. 
The other element of the proposal deals with prohibition. 
There is a third component to this proposal which deals with offence and punishment. 
This amendment deals with this.  
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
The most important element of this legislation deals with telemarketing. 
First, telemarketers must identify who they are representing. 
Second, they must disclose the price of the services or products they are selling. 
Third, they must tell why they are calling. 
Without these provisions a telemarketer is given complete license to mislead the consumer.  
The telemarketing business in Canada is a billion dollar industry. 
Without adequate protection against fraud this industry will not continue to grow. 
To have a free market, the government must leave the markets alone. 
To have the state make markets free is again a contradiction of terms.  
That is exactly the role that government should play in a free economy.  
This government is a disease on the economy masquerading as its own cure. 
The entire purpose of being in business is to drive your competitors out of business. 
This according to the Competition Act is illegal. 
It is called anti-competitive pricing and dumping.  
Sorry, that too is against the rules. 
It is called collusion.  
It is called price gouging.  
Our competition laws are an unenforceable mess of contradictions. 
The minister will tell us that he is just trying to protect Canadian consumers. 
This is simply not true. 
The minister is an old friend of the Canadian consumer.  
I would also like to touch briefly on the amendments to merger regulations. 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
For that I congratulate them. 
They looked at the interests of consumers in establishing their position. 
I thank them for supporting most of the amendments we have proposed.  
I again pay tribute to the support of NDP members.  
I will quickly review the various motions. 
It means that the requirements for establishing guilt are no longer the same. 
These are sometimes large outfits. 
This is a serious and significant problem. 
Legislation has to be good. 
The issue here again is intent. 
Within this period, businesses can reach an agreement with him. 
There is, however, one thing I do not understand. 
This is already a reality.  
That is the way of the future. 
That is a lot of power for one person. 
I now know why the Liberal government wanted to take this route. 
It needs a lot of improvement.  
We are also unhappy that all the amendments we proposed were rejected. 
But we do not think this to be the case, quite the contrary.  
The same thing happened with the elimination of the GST. 
They blamed the Conservatives for doing just that. 
They paid the price, in the Maritimes, for example, as we know.  
Today, however, the Liberal Party has left these concerns far behind. 
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
The second part of Bill C-20 is much more troublesome. 
It is that part which falls short of what Canadians need.  
I will talk briefly about the telemarketing fraud provisions. 
These senior citizens could ill afford $500 let alone $12,000.  
Those operators have made a lot of money in the process.  
We know about the issue dealing with the Internet. 
We have all probably used the Internet for these purposes.  
The argument was that it did not quite fit within telemarketing.  
It does not fit perfectly but it does not fit badly either. 
We have a new form of marketing which is based on technology. 
It is not all that different from telemarketing. 
I would have hoped that the government would have taken note of these suggestions. 
I know the parliamentary secretary is very diligent in these matters. 
He is nodding his head so I am sure that is what will happen.  
The government is making a fundamental mistake regarding the competition provision. 
It should have been made tougher, not weaker. 
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
While most telemarketing activities are legitimate, unfortunately some are not.  
It is those initiatives I am concerned about. 
This figure ballooned to over $75 million in 1996. 
In Canada that would mean $400 million annually. 
It is time to bring this act up to date with contemporary business practices. 
This framework is an essential contribution to sustaining the competitive strength of the private sector.  
On this point we agree with the government.  
Canadians have shown a preference to sales and sale priced items. 
The business of mergers was not satisfactorily dealt with in the bill. 
Simple inflation would have dictated that this was a reasonable request. 
We acknowledge that there are several discrepancies.  
They also want the intention of parliament to be clear. 
The definition of telemarketing should be clearer. 
What exactly does telemarketing constitute? 
So too was the recommendation from the Canadian Bar Association. 
That means putting a clear definition in the legislation. 
However, this is a way to capture this focus in the law.  
My party would liked to have seen this provision opened up to more public input. 
However, stringent guidelines should be set to stop this activity.  
Immediate and effective steps need to be taken. 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
And the division bells having rung: 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
(The sitting of the House was suspended at 4.43 p.m.) 
The House resumed at 5.14 p.m. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I declare the motion carried.  
(Bill read the third time and passed) 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
One of the things they speak about is the economy. 
Today they are concerned about the falling dollar and the problem of future economic prospects. 
It just did not quite know what to do.  
They wonder if they are safe on the streets. 
My constituents are very passionate on these issues. 
Certainly we can do so much better than this.  
These are the types of issues my constituents are talking about. 
Of course maintaining correctional centres is not inexpensive. 
But is it not also the best insurance that money can buy? 
He felt that was barbaric. 
I would not want to be locked up. 
It is not necessary for the proper administration of justice. 
It has no place in criminal law. 
It undermines the system. 
However, repeal would come with a twist.  
It was an issue of retroactivity. 
As a country we want to feel safe. 
The last point is important because Liberals are ignoring it.  
I felt angry but I shouldn't feel angry. 
I felt hurt but I shouldn't be hurting. 
I felt betrayed and I felt panic. 
I couldn't breathe and I couldn't stay still. 
I kept pacing from room to room. 
Why do we have to go through this again? 
I felt weak and vulnerable. 
I could not lose my dignity again. 
He looked so perfect.  
He was beaten beyond recognition. 
I will not let Olson and the system do that again.  
It is easy to talk the talk. 
Liberals preach that we should really give murderers another chance. 
Would they maybe change their minds?  
These victims deserve the right to have a voice. 
They deserve the right to be shown the utmost respect. 
That is the impression the Canadian public has.  
Every time this happens, victims will be made to endure agony. 
As legislators we are bound by so many things. 
That is the purpose of this small bill.  
That is not the issue. 
I ask, for once do what is right and get rid of section 745.  
Many have asked for the repeal of this section out of concern for public safety. 
This would include serial murders. 
These amendments came into force on January 9, 1997. 
Yes, we are bleeding heart Liberals. 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
I believe the entire Canadian system is a bit like a giant jigsaw puzzle. 
Much has been said on this. 
Where the justice system is concerned, we must not go overboard. 
This is not the way the problem can be solved.  
This is extremely important.  
Rehabilitation is not automatic, obviously. 
A case is examined and an extremely important review procedure takes place.  
We must live with it and make the best of it.  
The review is rigorous and has two stages. 
He must convince the jury of the validity of his application for release. 
This is no easy matter. 
The procedure is highly complex. 
I am not saying it is too complex for the criminal. 
Our system has been improved over the years. 
This is a matter of fairness. 
I will sum up very briefly why the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to this bill. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Three fundamental changes were enacted at that time. 
While those amendments were certainly well intentioned, they contained a number of flaws. 
It is a sad and telling statement on the priorities of the government. 
This would be consistent with that wish. 
Victims would be given a greater voice within the justice system. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
This evening we are discussing what the appropriate penalty should be for that crime. 
That was not the case. 
That is simply not acceptable.  
That is another debate. 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
I will keep my comments rather brief and to the point through a personal story.  
Mr. King is the father of one of Olson's victims.  
That is what this is about. 
We have heard in the House today philosophical difference. 
There certainly is a very big philosophical difference. 
The parliamentary secretary mentioned the changes the government has made. 
Mr. King's comments are comments I will never forget. 
That is the tragedy we are talking about.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
I want to re-emphasize the position of the government. 
Section 745.6 sets out an extremely rigorous procedure. 
There is a great deal of public concern about section 745.6. 
This would include serial murders. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Section 745 has to go. 
It serves no positive benefit for the administration of justice. 
I have been on the line supervising parolees. 
I have heard all the games. 
It has no place in Canadian criminal law.  
That is the people's agenda, the agenda from coast to coast. 
Thousands of names have been tendered in petitions here in this parliament on the subject.  
What does it take to get it done? 
However, it is still a national issue that will not go away. 
I brought my bill forward again to bring it up.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
There is not unanimous consent.  
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
I would like to thank my hon. colleagues for the opportunity to address this issue. 
I should first clarify my position on this. 
I think it might impact on some of the hon. members of this House.  
The children dealt with it as children some 17 or 18 years ago. 
They were able to put it behind them and get on with their lives. 
That had a very negative consequence on their lives. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
I am hoping the government can clarify the increasingly muddy waters.  
This clearly sets this government in opposition to the interests of aboriginal peoples.  
The 1993 report of the Canadian Human Rights commissioner states: 
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
The federal government takes very seriously its fiduciary relationship with aboriginal people. 
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
I think it is putting many Canadians at risk.  
It endangers every Canadian.  
What will the person do? 
He will clean up his act. 
That is exactly what happened in the case of the Red Cross.  
Clinical trials, for example, are threatening the health of every single Canadian.  
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
We understand the very important role that is played by the health protection branch.  
We have begun a countrywide consultation.
