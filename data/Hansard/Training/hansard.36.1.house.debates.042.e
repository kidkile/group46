GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
POSTAL SERVICES CONTINUATION ACT, 1997 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I move: 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
I move that all questions be allowed to stand.  
POSTAL SERVICES CONTINUATION ACT, 1997 
I am a firm believer in the democratic concept of free collective bargaining. 
Fortunately the Canadian experience has been that these occasions are relatively few and far between. 
There are basically two reasons for this. 
Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay-Okanagan, Ref.):
That is a $4 billion cost to the Canadian economy. 
Unfortunately the government completely ignored its responsibility to the Canadian people.  
They are going to find that those charities do not have the money. 
They have no cheque from wherever that source was supposed to be. 
The cheque is already a week late.  
That woman had no food in the house to feed those children. 
Maybe the government does not care about that. 
I guarantee we do.  
The government's legislation does not provide that.  
The government must accept a large portion of the responsibility for this current dispute. 
It provided no reasonable alternative to a strike. 
It has intentionally provoked CUPW throughout the negotiations. 
It is to be congratulated for seeing through this ploy of the government.  
Those organizations are acting on behalf of their membership in a proper manner. 
That business has employees, quite possibly union employees. 
I am going to deal with why I call this meanspirited in a minute.  
That is what CUPW was saying going into this. 
It seems that something happens when they walk across that floor. 
This is a very onerous and draconian piece of legislation''.  
It provided three mandates for Canada Post. 
The first was to reduce the deficit. 
It has reduced the deficit. 
In fact, it has eliminated the deficit. 
The second part of the mandate was to improve service to the public. 
In my rural riding in particular the service has gone downhill by a great deal. 
It has not lived up to the second part of this. 
Service has gone downhill.  
The third mandate was to improve relationships with its employees. 
I mentioned that our solution to this is final offer arbitration. 
This is something we have talked about a lot. 
Some people have asked what exactly it involves. 
We have fleshed it out in great detail. 
I think this is something the government should pay attention to.  
In fact, it was the right wing party that took it out. 
This notice may be provided during the interim submission period.  
The arbitration panel may not change or modify the position of either party. 
The factors which must be considered by the arbitration panel are: 
Second, the average public sector increase since their last contract. 
Third, the impact on postal service. 
The financial impact of the contract settlement. 
Fifth, any changes in job descriptions. 
The final item is any public sector comparisons of any of the disputed items. 
What is the norm out there? 
These are the amendments we will be asking for. 
We all have regrets that this strike has taken place. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, here we are discussing back to work legislation. 
That is how our system usually works. 
But that is not how it is going to be now at Canada Post. 
It will not be like that because the government has decided to intervene. 
Of course everyone wants to receive his or her mail at home. 
Everybody considers this an essential service, a normal service.  
But it cannot be otherwise. 
We should normally be letting these workers exercise their rights.  
By definition, a strike hurts. 
What exactly is the situation with respect to the negotiations that have taken place? 
We have even questioned the Prime Minister. 
What we have been asking is:
What is going on with Canada Post? 
Is the government going to give negotiation a chance? 
They are talking, everything is going fine. 
We hope it will be settled''. 
The minister responsible for Canada Post has been saying the same thing. 
Right up to the Prime Minister who told us ``Let those people negotiate. 
They are capable of negotiating their working conditions. 
We hope it will be settled''.  
Very simple: they have not played fair. 
They have lost their power to negotiate.  
He felt as comfortable with them as with his buddies. 
He told them ``Don't worry about a mail strike. 
They will definitely go out on strike. 
They will look bad as a result of that. 
The big bad posties will be forced back to work. 
This game the government is involved in is unacceptable. 
There was an altercation between the union and management negotiators. 
The government, the Canada Post Corporation has changed. 
It is all related. 
These people are in touch every day. 
They are one and the same.  
Things fell back to their original inflexibility.  
Can we blame them? 
We cannot blame them for wanting to improve their working conditions. 
It is normal, human and proper. 
They exercised their right to strike to preserve a number of jobs. 
Of course, they want to defend themselves. 
Of course, they want to do some damage control. 
It is important to understand that the Canada Post Corporation is a public service. 
The corporation must be efficient. 
Yes, performance requirements are necessary. 
Yes, Canada Post must be as competitive as possible. 
We got this assurance and we are proud of that. 
We will also table other amendments. 
There is also the question of salaries. 
In closing, I will say that the Bloc Quebecois is against this bill. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
I cannot say that today. 
I am not happy to be here speaking on this particular piece of legislation.  
We certainly have no intention of doing so.  
It is an unfortunate intervention into the free bargaining process. 
What we should be looking for is a lasting resolution. 
That should be the goal and the objective. 
That did not happen.  
It is not a recipe for any kind of lasting solution. 
It is the thin edge of the wedge. 
Mussolini made the trains run on time. 
I would argue it is not.  
We might think that a strike is a violent thing or a disruptive thing. 
That is not necessarily so. 
There has been an enormous increase in productivity.  
At the same time, it had reduced its staff by 25%. 
It is really quite simple and easy to trace back. 
I would like to point out a quote from that mandate review. 
He quite specifically referred to this a year ago. 
There is a need for expansion of services.  
That takes a bit of explanation.  
That is what this clause would give licence to do. 
That is why it is offensive to us. 
(a) that Canada Post Corporation must-perform financially in a commercially acceptable range, 
None of this can be found in the mandate review. 
None of this has been agreed to. 
We were not privy to the debate. 
We do not have access to the books. 
We do not know the bargaining history. 
The people at the bargaining table do and the arbitrator will. 
It should be up to the arbitrator to make that ruling.  
We are going to kick them while they are down. 
We are sending them back to work. 
We are taking away their right to strike. 
By the way, we will take a little away from them too.  
There is another more costly significant change in here. 
They are delaying the imposition of the increases by six months.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
This is very important. 
The member says that the legislation is offensive to the NDP. 
They want their Christmas. 
The member knows that this situation is also offensive to charities. 
I do not think like the NDP.  
A three year agreement should not be found in this legislation. 
All our information is anecdotal, driven by a motion. 
Granted it lost some in some areas and gained in others.  
We can do it. 
We are sensitive and sympathetic to that but the fix was there. 
There was an easy solution early on in the strike. 
As I said it is manufactured crisis.  
I hope that answers some of the member's questions.  
Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay-Okanagan, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like ask a question.  
The hon. member said that the bill was unnecessary. 
I have another question. 
I am having a little trouble understanding the position of the NDP in this regard. 
It says it is totally opposed to the legislation. 
That really does not add up. 
I would point out that his party did the same thing. 
We did that because there are a whole bunch of interests at stake. 
Canadian business is suffering. 
However, there are 45,000 postal workers whose interests also have to be recognized.  
The legislation was being brought down. 
By the end of the week it would have been done. 
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
What do these numbers mean? 
Telemedia Publishing is losing hundreds of thousands of dollars a week.  
He is not alone. 
The Salvation Army reports that it too is hurting. 
Seventy per cent of its revenues come in the mail. 
It is now in a state of near crisis. 
What are these organizations supposed to do this Christmas? 
These groups help hundreds and thousands of Canadians in need each year. 
Where was the Minister of Labour when they needed him?  
Fortunately he is now okay.  
Our government waited until yesterday. 
What has been the government's response? 
It has not finished reading it yet.  
What about the year 2000 problem? 
It does not have one yet. 
It said ``We'll write the cheques out by hand if necessary''. 
Then there is fish. 
Leadership, that is what successful government is all about. 
Where can we look to for an example of real leadership? 
This took three steps. 
The third step was to provide the parties with an alternative dispute settlement mechanism. 
Unfortunately the problem does not end here. 
Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay-Okanagan, Ref.):
It reacted by bringing in legislation. 
Talk about the children of this country. 
Santa Claus is a big thing for them. 
I totally disagree with the government's route on this that it waited so long. 
Canada Post is losing $20 million a day. 
I have been in business for some 15 years. 
I do not know of one. 
After five days of this strike there goes its profits for this year. 
Oh, now it is up to the government. 
It is the Canadian people. 
I say enough is enough. 
We are here to do a job. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
What has been brought before the House today is shameful. 
I would like to ask a question of my colleague from the Conservative Party. 
He says he does not want any more strikes at Canada Post. 
Is that what my colleague is telling us?  
This is not how collective bargaining is meant to work. 
We are not against unions at all but we need to be responsible.  
The union at Canada Post represents 45,000 workers. 
Canada Post has been losing millions and millions of dollars. 
Businesses have been losing millions of dollars. 
In this country we have a law that police officers cannot strike. 
I am not against the union. 
I support the union in some cases but there has to be fair bargaining.  
This strike has dragged on for the last week and a half. 
Something has to come out of this.  
Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
He wasn't here.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
We were on debate.  
Madam Speaker, I thought we were on questions and comments. 
I did not hear your comment about debate. 
I thought I was recognized as being up on questions and comments. 
Could the member have a chance to respond before the debate begins?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member for Tobique-Mactaquac, if he wishes to respond, but very briefly please.  
It goes for both sides. 
Back in 1987 and 1991 we were in power. 
There was no strike. 
The member's own government voted for it. 
Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for Mississauga West.  
They are about who manages and controls the workplace. 
That is clearly the mandate of this government. 
Let us examine the other side of the question. 
It will control the workplace and everything its members do. 
We tried very hard to get negotiations through. 
We tried mediation and conciliation. 
We had to look very carefully at what was happening within the jurisdiction.  
It is now time to get back to work. 
Many Canadians are hurting because of the postal strike. 
I would like to talk about the terrible impact this strike is having on charities. 
Nicole Mirault of the Canadian Cancer Society said: ``We risk a catastrophe. 
In Quebec alone millions of dollars come through the mail each year. 
We don't have the means to use couriers. 
We rely on direct mail service. 
Therefore we would be grossly negatively affected''.  
This time is very important. 
When it comes to business, of course there are many areas which are affected. 
Everybody agrees that these companies are engines of our economy. 
Every hour that passes is costing our economy millions. 
Let me give some examples. 
As a result it had to lay off 65 of its 80 employees.  
Layoffs will continue if the strike goes on.  
Christmas will make or break many of our small companies. 
It remains to be seen whether we recover from the effects of the strike. 
The postal strike has forced many businesses to lay off people. 
There is an economic cost. 
But there is also an enormous human cost. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, no one can ever fault the Liberal members for a shortage of gall. 
This is circular arguing. 
It is absolutely ridiculous.  
Quite frankly, there is a system and that system must be maintained. 
We must give opportunity for systems to resolve the problem. 
That will best serve Canadians in the long run. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert, BQ):
Madam Speaker, 30 seconds is a bit short. 
The result is that this is a balanced approach. 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Final offer selection is a process that has been around for some time. 
There is no in-between.  
Those are issues that require much more sophisticated negotiations.  
That is not the case here. 
In fact, Madam Speaker, ask yourself why are we here. 
Why are we seeing such a rise in the militancy of the labour movement? 
And your left wing agendas do what?  
We are not talking left wing. 
That is what the hon. gentleman does not understand. 
In this case the rights of the Canadian people must also be recognized.  
We are seeing this increase in militancy. 
I would say to those labour leaders that what they are saying is totally irresponsible.  
It is pretty fundamental and it makes no sense.  
It could not be further from the truth. 
We cannot simply leave that to the private sector. 
We see E-mail becoming a more important opportunity for people. 
We see couriers for businesses. 
We have attempted to conciliate this problem. 
The government appointed Mr. Marc Gravel who is a respected and neutral third party. 
As a result, we wound up in a strike position.  
What is the government to do? 
We have tried the conciliation process. 
We have tried to mediate this process with respected, talented Canadians being involved. 
The union leadership stands up, goes in a rant and leads everybody out on strike. 
It is Christmas time. 
They are worried about their families. 
It is the extreme comments from many of the union leaders. 
Yes, it is, I say to the members opposite.  
Do members know what we were hunting? 
We were hunting for more members. 
Do members know why? 
It was more money.  
Somebody do the math quick. 
The big companies do not care. 
They can use their own internal staff or couriers. 
We think this bill does that. 
Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):
What we are doing here is putting postal workers on trial. 
The government is the good guy, while the workers have no sense of responsibility.  
Why then did the government pretend to give them the right to strike? 
Today, they supposedly have the right to strike. 
Why bother giving them this right only to take it away? 
Do you have the will and the courage to do that? 
You are taking this right away from them. 
You are here blaming them for everything. 
What a fine scenario. 
And I agree with him.  
Everything was arranged ahead of time by this government, including the Prime Minister. 
Now the government is trying to sound and look good. 
It says: ``Look, the workers are the bad guys. 
We are introducing legislation to make them go back to work. 
We are good enough to send them back to work. 
We are restoring peace with the workers.''  
I was not castigating post office workers. 
What kind of a democracy do they think we live in?  
There is the right to organize. 
There are rules and regulations within federal and provincial labour boards. 
They do not have a right to break the law. 
Nobody has that right.  
We support the rank and file. 
We do not support the militancy of the leadership of that union.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Would he tell them that the wait and see attitude was a good idea?  
Mr. Speaker, I say exactly what I said in my speech. 
We attempted to conciliate and we attempted to mediate.  
We would rather see a negotiated settlement. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
I have been involved in arbitrations. 
I have been through strikes, walkouts and lockouts. 
The Minister of the Environment was awestruck, quite frankly. 
She did not even understand what he was talking about. 
That is a lack of leadership from the Liberal government. 
We look at the postal strike today. 
Royal commissions, which were poorly implemented, were disregarded to some extent once recommendations were made. 
What we have is lack of leadership.  
It should be the government.  
It has only been seven months.  
I hear that charities are losing money. 
We have been talking about newspapers, periodicals and magazines that rely on the mail. 
We have talked about human cost. 
This is not a surprise. 
Yet there is a substantive lack of a strategic plan in the organization. 
The government is responsible for today's postal service.  
The Tories were no better either.  
Many of us talk about whether or not the strike was preventable. 
Somebody just faulted the Tories for an earlier strike. 
We all know about it. 
It should come on well before that, long before that. 
They know what the issues at the table are. 
It does not take seven months to know the issues.  
There are two positions on every issue at all times in negotiations. 
The Liberals do not know what they are talking about.  
We have to figure out where to go from here. 
Our amendments to the legislation will describe that process. 
We outlined it in writing. 
They utilize the services of Canada Post almost exclusively. 
Not once did they mention that they would look after small business. 
I doubt very much if it were even a consideration.  
That is why small business has a real problem with Liberal government. 
It is the engine of our country. 
It is nice to know that the Speaker is on the ball here.  
Let us talk about the costs of this strike. 
I would say that is a very conservative figure.  
Now the Liberals sanctimoniously stand in the House to acknowledge it. 
How ironic it is that the organization which needs the money is losing the money. 
The fact is that strikes very seldom, if ever, help anybody.  
The fear of the public was out there, yet the government let it happen. 
That is poor leadership.  
Is it any wonder why the general public has come to that conclusion. 
Do the employees really want it that way? 
Is that what the Liberals want? 
Is that what Canada Post management wants? 
Because that is what the general public is beginning to say. 
What does the government do about it? 
Does it say, ``There is a concern out there, Canadians have a concern''? 
Now we should introduce legislation''. 
There are people who are getting laid off because of this''. 
I have talked to a few. 
Yes, they are hurting. 
This could not have happened at a worse time. 
But then of course the parties involved in the negotiations knew about that. 
The parties that want to strike pick the optimal time. 
The parties picked the Christmas season to put the heat on the government. 
But what about the charities? 
What are we going to say to the charities? 
Gee whiz, we had seven months. 
We kind of forgot to think about the charities and we knew Christmas was coming. 
We heard rumours from the union. 
The postal worker negotiators knew all along what was happening. 
Well it has not saved it all. 
It has damaged charities by lack of action, by lack of leadership.  
We should not even have to come into this place and talk about this. 
They should know that. 
That is what is wrong with bad leadership. 
They do not know it.  
They are a big disappointment to charities. 
They are a big disappointment to all those people who count on Canada Post.  
To take that kind of position is somewhat irresponsible. 
Finally, this is yet another boondoggle of the Liberal government. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
My question to the member is, why the double standard? 
I would like to hear the answer.  
Mr. Speaker, I thought I made it clear. 
The answer is that there are no double standards here. 
All of this could have been prevented. 
A responsible organization would have reacted three months ago, not today. 
There is no double standard. 
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
Reformers are no different. 
The bill before us is a band-aid solution. 
The Reform Party is supporting that band-aid solution. 
There will no longer be any strikes in those essential services''? 
My question to the hon. member is: what does he have to suggest? 
This is my question to the member from the Reform Party.  
Mr. Speaker, where has this guy been? 
I thought this morning we articulated our position rather well. 
However it was not just this morning. 
I am not sure where this member comes from, to tell you the truth.  
It is essential for the government to get a clear message here. 
It seems of no consequence over here. 
That is the real galling part of all of this.  
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
If he knows, I would like to have the hon. member name those countries.  
The fact of the matter is there has been collective bargaining. 
The fact of the matter is it did not work. 
The fact of the matter is it was preventable. 
The fact of the matter is the Liberal government did nothing. 
Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert, BQ):
My own little survey of residents in my riding was particularly revealing. 
I will vote in favour of this bill. 
Sovereignists are not all left wing, socialist and pro-labour. 
I have a question for the member. 
I am speaking about the public in general.  
At the very minimum, there have been delays.  
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
We believe in the collective bargaining process but it is time. 
We need your help''.  
In Canada we are fortunate to have an excellent system of labour management relations. 
A majority of disputes are resolved without a strike or lockout. 
We can no longer wait. 
Yes, small business has been affected. 
This postal situation has hurt charities in four ways. 
I am going to share those concerns of the charities with the member.  
Charities are reluctant to mail and consumers are reluctant to respond. 
The most important giving season, the Christmas season, is now in jeopardy. 
We are aware of what their needs are. 
Therefore being aware, it is time for us to legislate.  
Some organizations are now faced with laying off their processing staff.  
The charities are losing $10 million a day. 
It is important now that we put postal workers back to work.  
I will be doing that.  
I regret that we have had to do this. 
I believe in the collective bargaining system. 
However, my constituents want the postal workers returned to work. 
Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay-Okanagan, Ref.):
She said it was time to legislate.  
It is long past time to legislate. 
We have been calling for this since the summer. 
Why has it taken it two weeks to do this?  
Charities are losing money, 80% of their revenues. 
That is also true, and it has been true for the last two weeks. 
We told the Liberal government. 
Why did it not listen to us?  
The member talked about the collective bargaining system. 
It has three parts; negotiate, conciliate and mediate. 
It has always been there. 
The previous government recognized the need to legislate. 
This government, belatedly, is recognizing the need for legislation. 
The Liberal government believes in the collective bargaining process.  
Those are the solutions.  
With all due respect, we are doing just that. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, honestly I think my colleague should have become a movie star. 
She almost got me crying this morning. 
One issue cannot be looked at, such as why this, why not that. 
I think that is something the mediator probably asked. 
Where do we get these figures? 
What about those people? 
How can we quantify? 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
The time had come to make a decision. 
This strike is also hurting community associations considerably. 
Now we have before us a special law.  
I met unionized workers. 
When questioned, they all say they support the national union. 
We all know that Canada Post employees work very hard. 
Many families have yet to receive their cheques. 
From the union, the reaction was very different. 
Even hospitals have experienced, on the union side, lots of cuts. 
I am asking only one thing. 
They meet many seniors on their run. 
The public wants to know what is what. 
In 1996, a commission was set up. 
The main issue is not excessively high rates of pay. 
The public may not be aware of these considerations.  
Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert, BQ):
Many postal workers themselves are fed up with this drawn out dispute. 
Mr. Guy St-Julien:
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask a question of my colleague.  
Well, I got it from their side. 
They apparently do not consult each other. 
My colleague confirms it, he is aware of that.  
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
People can always catch up after the three years, though.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I will share my time with other Bloc colleagues.  
To put it simply, the dice were loaded. 
This means converting overtime into permanent jobs. 
We must not forget that Canada Post is not running a deficit.  
Clause 15 also poses a problem. 
That was very interesting. 
Unfortunately, we have run out of time.

Canadians feel that this House is too partisan to focus on important issues. 
Many members occasionally did not even know what they voted for.  
Let us act as responsible democratic law makers. 
THE LATE MICHEL BELANGER 
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
The achievements of such an active man are too numerous to list here. 
You shall not be forgotten, Mr. Belanger. 
Thanks a million for your outstanding contribution to the development of Canada. 
You remain the model of a hard-working, conscientious person striving for perfection.  
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member. 
The hon. member for Okanagan-Shuswap.  
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
The report released yesterday reveals a chain of obvious preventable safety problems. 
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
All countries will have to co-operate with a compliance regime. 
The Canadian government and NGO organizations aim for a total ban of these mines. 
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Parizeau-Bouchard, same difference. 
Did you get that? 
In Quebec, we only have first class citizens.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):
THE LATE MICHEL BELANGER 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, Michel Belanger has just died. 
The Bloc expresses its condolences to Mr. Belanger's family and friends.  
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Mr. Speaker, it is time for the federal government to invest in our future. 
I call upon the Minister of Finance to earmark more money for post-secondary education. 
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Canada's automotive industry is booming. 
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
Mr. Speaker, it has been one week since the Krever report came down. 
Do not wait for the provinces. 
Show the leadership that we expect of the Minister of Health. 
They need your help.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Well, we've got trouble my friend 
Right here, I say trouble right here in Liberal City 
Why sure, it's the patronage 
They're always mighty proud to say they're always 
mighty proud to say it 
They consider that the time that they spend with 
a lobbyist friend is golden 
Helps 'em cultivate good friends 
with the big cheques 
and the wish lists 
Did you ever take and try and give an ironclad 
leave to yourself when there's Liberal hacks involved?  
Well, I call that the trough 
the first big step on the road to the depths of 
a teaspoon, then beer from a bottle 
And the next thing you know their buddies are 
working while ordinary folks get squat 
Listening to some big out of town jasper 
Hearin' him talk about holiday time 
and guaranteed wage, all taxpayer paid 
Now friends let me tell you what I mean 
You've got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 patronage appointments 
Appointments that mark the difference between a 
gentleman and a Grit 
And that starts with G and it rhymes with 
T and that stands for trouble 
Oh, we got trouble 
We got terrible, terrible trouble 
Those Liberal handouts are the sign of the 
Yes, we've got trouble, trouble, trouble 
with a T and that rhymes with G 
and that stands for Grits 
Right here in Liberal City 
We've got trouble.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Anything I say will be anti-climactic, Mr. Speaker. 
Last month the environment minister met with her counterparts and they agreed to certain levels. 
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have made a proposition at Kyoto for negotiating purposes. 
In the discussion we had with the provinces we discussed many aspects of it. 
It was said that we needed some flexibility.  
We are going to negotiations where there will be 150 nations sitting at the table. 
We decided to have a position- 
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
That is why the provinces are upset.  
Other people are sharing their views on the cost.  
Does he think that this level of cost is acceptable?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We are a great exporter of energy.  
We would like to get credit for that.  
We are going there with a very good negotiating position.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
There was no real deal in Canada. 
There were unrealistic targets. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is not just Ottawa where we have trouble. 
Kyoto is getting us into a lot of trouble too. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have a very reasonable position. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister talks about a very balanced position. 
In fact the Liberals have come up with three balanced positions. 
They do not have a plan to pay for the Kyoto deal. 
They do not have a plan to implement the deal. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
This government believes there is an international problem that needs some attention. 
Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Send them another cheque.  
We are well placed to build up French throughout the country.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Vanier school or at a francophone chamber of commerce.  
AUDITOR GENERAL'S REPORT 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the industry minister.  
The banks have spent millions to plant one question. 
Can a bank change? 
The hon. Minister of Industry.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
I am delighted to be able to stand behind that.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
I want to repeat the question I asked yesterday. 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Then there is the signature process. 
Then there is a ratification process. 
Then there is a coming into force process.  
The hon. gentleman just does not understand the process.  
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
As the hon. member knows, I cannot comment on that specific case. 
The hon. member for New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby.  
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
What does the minister say to the disabled who are now in fear? 
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
There continues to be a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years.  
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
Yet, according to the auditor general, federal departments are major users of such substances.  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the auditor general's report is taken very seriously by my department. 
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
We have set in place targets which we have exceeded. 
We hope this will set a good example for Kyoto.  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
This guy is completely out of control.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
I have taken steps.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
How could the minister make such a statement in this House?  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
I am very proud to have made this statement yesterday and I reiterate it today.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
The hon. member for West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Only 4,000 have been deported. 
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Therefore we will be able to use that to change the process.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
And that is exactly what we will be doing.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We will spend $211 million during the next five years.  
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
What is happening is quite normal. 
The Canadian Transportation Agency reviews periodically all the regulations. 
It has solicited public reaction to a certain set of proposed regulations. 
Then they are presented to me as minister. 
No regulatory change will be made without a cabinet decision.  
I would ask the hon. member not to believe everything he reads in the newspapers.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Why does the minister want to restrict overseas travel to well heeled Canadians?  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, to the contrary. 
What the CTA regulations intend to do is further liberalize the air charter industry.  
The hon. member and others are giving that comment. 
That gives an informed debate to a very interesting and important issue.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's reference to illegal theft is interesting. 
The overkill that he uses in this issue is demonstrated by that comment.  
The hon. member for Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Will the Minister of Justice tell us if she is going to act- 
The hon. Minister of Justice.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
We received the final report of Mr. Justice Richard yesterday. 
My officials are reviewing that report. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my supplementary question is for the Minister of Labour.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Indeed we worked with them to find an alternate source.  
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are following the situation very closely.  
We are certainly getting ready for the end of TAGS. 
It is absolutely not the case.  
We will assume our responsibilities as a government. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
We are anticipating extensive reform of the act. 
I will take into consideration all recommendations at that time.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Trade. 
Lantic Sugar refineries in Saint John and in Montreal are suffering because of this.  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, are you saying that it takes three to tango?  
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
We have not achieved hospitals or schools. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Now there is an elected president and an elected parliament. 
Colleagues, that would bring to a conclusion our question period.  
We will begin with the hon. Minister of Veterans Affairs.  
THE LATE JACK PICKERSGILL 
His passing last month marked the departure of an extraordinary individual. 
My colleague, I know this is a very serious issue we are addressing.  
I apologize to the member for interrupting.  
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
I appreciate your intervention. 
The public contributions he made during his lifetime were remarkable. 
Despite two great wars and some personal sorrows, mine has been a happy life. 
Jack will always be remembered as a rare Canadian treasure. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
He lived from 1905 until 1997.  
Maybe he really did see Canada whole. 
That is certainly a good thing to have in this place. 
A good sense of humour does not do any of us any harm.  
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
As was mentioned before in the House, he was a very unique individual. 
However, when I arrived here I heard many stories about the effectiveness of Jack Pickersgill.  
They were members of the pre-television age in this place.  
With that, I want to extend our condolences.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Many members in this place know the distinguished writer Doug Fisher. 
The title therefore has great meaning, seeing Canada whole. 
One was the provision of unemployment insurance for fishermen. 
He also said, ``I was never bored by Parliament. 
I would try again''. 
His assessment though is far too modest. 
I think we all recognize today that Canada has truly lost a giant.  
POSTAL SERVICES CONTINUATION ACT, 1997 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Jonquiere has five minutes for questions and comments. 
Any questions or comments? 
Mr. Rejean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):
From then on, everything became a matter of cost-effectiveness. 
I am not inventing anything. 
There is no doubt about that. 
The large mail users are already benefiting from the lowest postal rates in the world. 
Well, he kept his promise. 
The Minister responsible for Canada Post said so himself. 
It was up to the two parties to negotiate a new work contract. 
Through its repeated interference, the government has made a mess of things. 
There has even been talk of civil disobedience by postal workers. 
We have the government to thank for this.  
Canada Post Corporation is going to become a cash cow for the government. 
The bill represents much more than the end of a strike. 
The Bloc Quebecois is in favour of resolving labour disputes through negotiation. 
The strike has cost millions of dollars. 
The government planned the outcome well in advance.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Remember the rail strike. 
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Canada Post is one of our country's most important institutions. 
It was among the first departments to be established after Confederation, in 1867. 
The best case in point is the possible privatization of the Canada Post Corporation. 
Both former ministers repeated it over and over again. 
This decision was not made lightly. 
The conclusion was very clear.  
Canada Post has already moved on many of these items. 
It has opened its books and published its annual report. 
This is why it has become a key factor in the current negotiations. 
Ritchie came to this conclusion: 
Excessive wages are not the main problem.  
Pay for time not worked is an even more substantial direct cost burden.  
This is precisely what is at the heart of the present dispute. 
Canada Post must be able to adjust its work force to its needs. 
Let me illustrate this point with a concrete example.  
This staff movement will have, in the end, involved hundreds of personnel. 
And altogether it will have taken a year.  
But this should not in any way be seen as blaming Canada Post's employees.  
Indeed, the vast majority of them are devoted and qualified workers. 
Rather, the flaw comes from an obsolete system that badly needs modernizing.  
Their collective agreement forbids it.  
But this is not allowed either by the current collective agreement.  
The union refused again.  
As I said earlier, this labour conflict is in a class of its own. 
This conflict, like previous conflicts, will leave scars. 
Many customers will not go back to Canada post. 
In the absence of postal services, they have found alternatives, and often permanent ones. 
Those postal revenues are lost forever.  
Some progress is already obvious. 
This is a first step in the right direction. 
Many others will be needed.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
As a matter of fact, that is not accurate. 
Consequently, the statement the minister made is really not accurate.  
Definitely I will send him the appropriate documents so he can see them.  
There is nothing new, as a lot of people know. 
The last strike was in 1991. 
Mr. Rejean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, according to the minister, they will make $200 million a year in profits. 
Mr. Speaker, I listened to the speech made by the member earlier. 
Unfortunately, the member wants to see only one side of the issue.  
The government's mandate is clear. 
Of course this is a government decision. 
We could have made another decision. 
We think this mandate will help us reach that goal. 
We are asking the Canadian Union of Postal Workers to sign.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to the minister's speech. 
Can we get a comment from the minister to that effect, please.  
This was an offer from Canada Post. 
Again the union turned it down.  
Since that offer, Canada Post has lost $17 million a day. 
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
What do we say to these people?  
We need to research. 
I thank the member for his question. 
The question we have to ask ourselves is should we continue? 
How do we balance that 45% and 50%? 
Should we have the right to strike and a monopoly? 
What about the competition with the private sector?  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I realize I have only a few minutes. 
There are just a few points I would like to make. 
How much time do I have Mr. Speaker? 
I thought I had only a few minutes.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The member is correct. 
The debate concludes in three minutes.  
The legislation as a result will be much fairer.  
Not enough offence was taken yesterday in the context of what went on.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I declare the motion carried.  
House in committee of the whole on Bill C-24.  
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
Mr. Chairman, I rise on a point of order. 
Shall clause 2 carry?  
(Clauses 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7 agreed to) 
Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):
Mr. Chairman, I would like to move an amendment at report stage.  
That Bill C-24, in Clause 8, be amended by 
(a) replacing line 39 on page 3 with the following: 
(b) adding the following after line 45 on page 3: 
Has there really been any true negotiation? 
I will quote that report if I may.  
He said, rather than remain neutral, that the union was pretending to negotiate. 
This is quite surprising from the minister.  
Canada Post is a partner in this company. 
Is it in conflict of interest then? 
Why did Purolator also sign an agreement, and quickly I would add? 
Canada Post owns 75% of it. 
There have been such rumours. 
Super mailboxes are used instead. 
What is the point of eliminating interesting jobs?  
They want to eliminate part of letter carrier services. 
How far do they want to go? 
What is the future of Canada Post? 
But what do they want in their regions? 
Part time jobs paying $6 or $7 an hour? 
What Canada Post is doing is distributing money. 
It should be remembered that Canada Post does not have a deficit. 
At the moment, it is showing a profit. 
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
I never said that I wanted to make the union look bad. 
I told them clearly that I recognized their right to strike. 
It is not because of you, but because of the postal workers.  
They are at their mercy. 
I never made the comments attributed to me by the hon. member. 
This is what we are doing today.  
That is plainly what he said on television.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
I think the government should receive it in this spirit. 
There have been difficult periods In 1995, there was almost model bargaining. 
He should bring the parties to an agreement.  
Earlier, when the minister spoke, I just listened to what he had to say. 
If the government is unable to take this issue seriously, we can.  
Let us go back to the purpose of the amendment. 
We just want to ensure the best conditions possible. 
We are also taking clause 9 into consideration. 
We have showed what is most important.  
This is not a question and comment period. 
Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay-Okanagan, Ref.):
In an hour and 25 minutes we are going to have bells.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Chairman, I just have a couple of comments.  
Canada Post is the people of Canada. 
It is a crown agency. 
It is the interests of the people of Canada that are at stake.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
I think this has to be pointed out.  
This is unacceptable in any circumstance. 
That is the thing.  
That is not what it was about; it was about not bargaining in good faith. 
The Assistant Deputy Chairman:
I should point out that we do have 15 amendments. 
Shall Motion No. 1 carry?  
The Assistant Deputy Chairman:
The vote stands deferred.  
The union and employer shall select 3 people as possible arbitrators acceptable to them. 
(2) The arbitration panel shall therefore consist of 3 people, including the chair.  
This notice may be provided during the interim submission period.  
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
We agree with him. 
It is less than a perfect situation at any time.  
Mr. Chairman, I will just add very briefly to that. 
It was mentioned in debate today. 
The Assistant Deputy Chairman:
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
The NDP introduced it. 
In a limited application we see its use.  
Even in the province of Manitoba it was optional. 
Those were the windows during which we could opt for this FOS.  
The steelworkers played with it as did the carpenters union. 
The arbitrator can choose one or the other but not a combination of both. 
There is no cafeteria style shopping here. 
It is one or the other.  
It indicates to me a lack of knowledge of the subject. 
If I never hear the word again it will be too soon.  
I speak very strongly against any such introduction. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I will try to be as brief and as concise as possible.  
On the management side, in the public sector, there is a lot of time ahead. 
Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay-Okanagan, Ref.):
If anyone does not know what is going on it is him. 
However he is backing arbitration. 
They had an opportunity choose it but they did not choose that either. 
In this proposal they have an opportunity to bargain collectively and to negotiate. 
If they cannot agree on anything there has to be some final resolution. 
That is why we are here tonight.  
Mr. Chairman, maybe I can answer briefly.  
That is not clear. 
In fact nothing could be further from the truth.  
I think he could probably guess how we will vote on it. 
I can guarantee it will not be the same way he is thinking.  
It was a flawed idea to begin with it. 
Shall the amendment to clause 8 standing in the name of Mr. Gouk carry?  
The arbitration panel shall be guided by: 
(a) cost of living index since the last contract settlement 
(b) average public sector increase 
(f) any change in job descriptions 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I will be brief. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Shall the amendment to clause 9 standing in the name of Mr. Gouk carry?  
Pursuant to order the vote on the amendment is deferred.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP) moved: 
(a) that the Canada Post Corporation must, without recourse to undue increases in postal rates, 
(ii) improve productivity, and 
(iii) meet acceptable standards of service; and 
Mr. Rejean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):
This indication from the government is not made at random. 
We must also remember the famous rail strike.  
At first reading, that seems like a fairly innocuous statement. 
In fact, it read like a wish list for Canada Post.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Mr. Chairman, it is always a pleasure to speak under your supervision.  
Productivity does not come out of thin air. 
It comes with motivation in the workplace. 
Labour-management relations may be considered as an acceptable requirement. 
That is what this amendment encourages us to do.  
Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):
Mr. Chairman, I will be brief. 
He wanted to thank the Bloc Quebecois for defending his interests. 
His first name is Ron. 
By this he meant that the negotiations were biased from the beginning.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Chairman, I agree with this amendment. 
These instructions require that Canada Post make a certain profit. 
This is necessary to ensure co-operation, viability and stability.  
As well, the arbitrator will have to balance good labour-management relations.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
We must congratulate ourselves on reaching this degree of unanimity. 
The present rules of the game must be respected. 
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
I have said it many times. 
I repeat that the government has no intention of doing that. 
I would also note what the amendment adds. 
Sometimes there are good days and sometimes there are rainy days. 
We want Canada Post to exist for years to come. 
It was the first institution in this country. 
We want it to continue to exist for a long time. 
We believe that Canadians should receive mail from coast to coast to coast. 
We said not to close any more rural post offices.  
We believe Canadians in rural communities have the right to a postal service. 
It is the only Canadian identity in those communities and we believe in that. 
In order to keep those services, we want improvements. 
I said it clearly. 
The government said it clearly. 
And my predecessors have said it very clearly. 
I hope that with that it is clear. 
Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Therefore, the government recognizes this.  
But it should also be remembered that there are two components. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Mr. Chairman, I want to say a few words on this particular amendment.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
It must operate that way.  
Let us look at the reality. 
We must all operate with that in mind.  
If it does not, it will lose customers to other businesses. 
Obviously it has to operate that way. 
Is that a cash cow? 
Shall the amendment carry?  
The amendment is carried but the clause will be- 
No, because there were two amendments. 
The first amendment did not carry. 
Mr. Chairman, I just want the point of order to be clear. 
Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay-Okanagan, Ref.):
Mr. Chairman, I rise on a point of order. 
The vote will be on the Reform amendment. 
If that is clear, we will go on to clause 10. 
(Clauses 10 and 11 agreed to) 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ) moved: 
We must understand these people. 
Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay-Okanagan, Ref.):
Mr. Chairman, very briefly I have two points.  
That one frankly confuses me a little. 
That is the reason we are opposed to this motion.  
It is almost merging these two resolutions. 
It would give them a range to choose from. 
It would give them a scope the arbitrator could draw from. 
We believe that would be the best resolve to the whole matter.  
There are quite a number of amendments yet to come.  
This debate will end in 27 minutes. 
The hon. member for Richelieu.  
Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):
That is where the problem lies. 
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
The hon. member for Bourassa.  
Mr. Chairman, this is a bad case of increasing cloudiness. 
That is the first point.  
That should also be taken into consideration.  
Charities that should receive millions of dollars through the mail are not getting anything. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
This afternoon, some were talking about people with experience in negotiation. 
I can tell you that I have been involved in collective bargaining since 1979. 
Again they tell us they are not involved in the negotiation. 
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
It will handcuff the arbitrator.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
One has to catch him at the right moment.  
This is the main guideline, the leitmotiv of the government. 
This is and has always been the main focus of the negotiations.  
What rule of generosity are they obeying?  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Chairman, there have been negotiations going on since April. 
That is fair for CUPW and it is fair for the post office. 
That is why the rates are there.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
The member who just spoke was the Minister of Labour. 
In this debate, he should be neutral. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Chairman, I will be very brief. 
How could there be any good faith bargaining? 
I just want to reinforce our concern. 
Are we ready for the question?  
The question is on Motion No. 4. 
Shall the motion carry?  
Pursuant to order made earlier the vote is deferred.  
We will proceed to the second amendment on clause 12. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP) moved: 
It would give the arbitrator a range within which to choose. 
Kick them while they are down. 
That much we would think would be corrected automatically just out of good faith. 
It amounts to pennies.  
That amounts to a lot of money. 
It is simply taking advantage of a bad situation. 
We would appeal to the other parties to support this amendment. 
Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):
Mr. Chairman, I will be very brief. 
You are not allowed to name members.  
Yes, we can name them. 
He said ``I looked at their collective agreement. 
They are paid well enough, I think. 
They have good wages, good conditions. 
This petty amount of $20 million will do nothing for it. 
Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay-Okanagan, Ref.):
We think there is still a problem with that. 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
Mr. Chairman, I listened very carefully to the Bloc Quebecois member. 
He talked about backstabbing. 
These people are now elsewhere.  
So do small and medium size businesses.  
They are here on this page. 
There is no one from the Abitibi-Temiscamingue region in this chapter. 
The member talks about backstabbing. 
I realize that he is not even a hunter. 
I support the bill. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Chairman, I would like to draw the debate back to the bill before us. 
Those are the objectives and criteria applicable.  
Mr. St-Julien should understand this concept. 
This is an insult to all union officials. 
It is also an insult- 
I will conclude on this. 
I hope that the member will respect the rules of the House on this.  
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have been insulted today. 
And who is financing you?  
What are the people telling me? 
That they are losing money. 
Come and try this where I live.  
Personally, I have chosen to help the companies, I have chosen to help the citizens. 
I have chosen to help the charitable organizations. 
I have chosen to help my fellow citizens because people are losing money. 
I have decided to help the Salvation Army. 
I have decided to help Enfants Soleil. 
We gave them a settlement, and they refused. 
This is a government law. 
We must follow the rules of the Treasury Board.  
Instead of going to Florida, Mr. Plamondon should be going to his riding. 
That is the problem, Mr. Chairman.  
I have a point of order.  
I rise on a point of order.  
I am sorry, but we no longer have time for a point of order.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):
Perhaps the Chair could put every question and then we could proceed with the vote.  
I should say that every one has been deemed to have been proposed. 
It has not been put. 
The vote on the amendment stands deferred.  
Is it the pleasure of the committee to adopt the amendment?  
The vote on the amendment stands deferred. 
The next question is on the amendment by the hon. member for Kitchener-Waterloo.  
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.) moved: 
Shall the amendment carry?  
The vote on the amendment stands deferred.  
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
Shall clause 13 carry?  
The vote on clause 13 stands deferred.  
Shall Clause 14 carry?  
(Clause 14 agreed to) 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ) moved: 
``and may be recovered as such from the employee in any court'' 
Is it the pleasure of the house to adopt the amendment?  
The division on the amendment stands deferred.  
(Clause 16 agreed to) 
Shall Clause 17 carry?  
The division on the motion stands deferred. 
Shall clause 18 carry?  
(Clause 18 agreed to) 
Shall clause 19 carry?  
(Clause 19 agreed to) 
Shall Clause 20 carry?  
(Clause 20 agreed to) 
Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay-Okanagan, Ref.):
I am afraid the hon. member will not get the chance to withdraw it. 
Shall clause 21 carry?  
The division on clause 21 is deferred.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
There is no valid amendment to clause 21.  
There are two amendments.  
I have not seen a second one.  
We cannot pass 21, because there is an amendment to this motion. 
I think the government House leader would agree with me. 
I will now put the question on the amendments.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabasca, PC) moved: 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
The division is deferred.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabasca, PC) moved: 
Once the Bill comes into force, the employer is required to: 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
The division on the amendment is deferred.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabasca, PC) moved: 
The division on the motion is deferred.  
And the bells having rung: 
The question is on Motion No. 1.  
(Motion No. 1 negatived) 
All those in favour of the amendment will please rise.  
Is it agreed without counting the yeas that the amendment is defeated?  
(Motion No. 2 negatived) 
Shall clause 8 carry?  
(Clause 8 agreed to) 
Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay-Okanagan, Ref.):
Is it agreed that the amendment be withdrawn?  
(Motion No. 3 withdrawn) 
Shall clause 9, as amended, carry?  
(Clause 9, as amended, agreed to) 
The next question is on clause 12. 
Is it the pleasure of the committee to adopt the amendment?  
All those in favour will please rise in their places.  
Is it necessary to count the nays? 
Is it agreed that the amendment is lost?  
Does the committee give its consent to apply the vote just taken as indicated?  
It is not the same thing we have here. 
Mr. Chairman, it is Motion No. 5 of the Bloc.  
I declare the amendment lost.  
(Motion No. 5 negatived.)  
Shall clause 12 carry?  
(Clause 12 agreed to) 
Shall clause 13 carry?  
(Clause 13 agreed to) 
Shall clause 15 carry?  
(Clause 15 agreed to) 
Shall clause 21 carry?  
(Clause 21 agreed to) 
I have three amendments in the name of Mr. Bachand. 
The question is on the first amendment.  
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
I think it will be necessary to put the question. 
The next question is on the second amendment. 
The question is on the third amendment. 
Shall clause 1 carry?  
(Clause 1 agreed to) 
Shall the title carry?  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
When shall the bill be read a third time. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
You asked when the bill could be read a third time. 
Is the House ready for the question?  
However, this particular bargaining dispute is not just impacting- 
The government has not been insensitive to these concerns. 
The government takes its role as protector of the public interest very seriously. 
Despite the efforts of the conciliators, the parties remained deadlocked.  
Canada Post must have sufficient flexibility to manage in a competitive environment. 
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we are on the eve of getting the mail moving again. 
There is a point on which the minister and I can agree. 
There is no alternative to the post office. 
Nobody is running in competition with the post office.  
The Canadian public simply cannot withstand this kind of blow. 
A good case in point is a local newspaper back home. 
Every week it mails out its papers to the outlying areas. 
It is an ad journal with no subscription rates. 
They will all get their paper the same day.  
CUPW kept saying that they were- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
There is a quorum. 
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
I suspect that losing the market share is going to hasten that kind of activity. 
That is a sad state of affairs. 
Why do we continue to legislate them back over and over again?  
There is no compromise position in between.  
We need to have a balance.  
I am sure that all parties would like to come to a negotiated settlement. 
I do not think it does. 
Everybody likes to have some control in their lives. 
We agree with that. 
Something has to be done. 
We and everybody agree that the best solution is a negotiated solution. 
I was surprised to see a Liberal government bring this in. 
The NDP and the Bloc agreed to this mandated settlement. 
That really surprised me. 
We think that part of the bill should have been removed. 
We suggested that and put forth amendments to that effect. 
How has the last nine or ten days affected average Canadians? 
They have not received their newspapers through the mail. 
They have not received their cheques. 
They say that it is December 1 and they do not know what to do. 
What can I say? 
How can I check it out for them since the post office is not working? 
In a small town it is a place where you meet your business associates. 
They raise about 80% of their funds in the month of December.  
I am very pleased to see that the post office is going back to work. 
I can hardly wait to get the mail system back to its normal condition.  
We hear a lot of talk about fairness in this House and about balance. 
I could probably continue and make several other points but time is running short. 
I look forward to hearing what my colleagues have to say.  
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
This is the first 40 minute round. 
Does the hon. member for Trois-Rivieres have the unanimous consent of the House?  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their understanding.  
Therefore, what we witnessed is a sad masquerade, made even worse by some disgraceful actions.  
You will have understood that I am referring to clause 9, which I shall read: 
(i) perform financially in a commercially acceptable range, 
(iii) improve productivity, and 
(iv) meet acceptable standards of service; and 
I quote Mr. Ramonet: 
Financial globalization has created its own government. 
The situation continues to worsen. 
And I said parliamentary democracy.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
It is important to explain what happened. 
I have seen the union try to resolve problems. 
The most important aspects of this mandate are as follows: 
And the first point was about performing financially in a commercially acceptable range. 
This is completely inconsistent with a public service.  
and the financial stability of the Canada Post Corporation.  
The service must operate on a self-sustaining financial basis and workers agree.  
With 45,000 workers, it is a strong union. 
The mediator-arbitrator will be able to take this into consideration. 
His mandate is to stand up to the employer. 
Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne-Blainville, BQ):
(a) that the Canada Post Corporation must, without recourse to undue increases in postal rates, 
(i) perform financially in a commercially acceptable range- 
The government wants Canada Post to bring in $200 million. 
VIA Rail would not exist. 
I return to my quote earlier. 
That is so obvious. 
Under these conditions, what does the right to strike mean? 
The president of Canada Post is a former Liberal minister. 
The corporation is full of former or current friends of the Liberals. 
So, what happened should not come as a surprise. 
The government is the father figure, while Canada Post is the son. 
And that way is called social democracy.  
The hon. member is taking the words right out of my mouth. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
You are splitting your time. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
I thank my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois for his very good comments. 
We agree with just about everything he has said. 
This has truly been an historic day in terms of back to work legislation.  
The direction of the government has been toward back to work legislation.  
We understand those concerns.  
Why has the situation deteriorated so badly? 
The fundamental role and mandate of Canada Post are at issue. 
The government has created a financial and management crisis. 
We have already seen the massive privatization that has taken place.  
We have to stop blaming workers. 
We have to demand that the government act responsibly as an employer. 
In the final analysis we in the NDP reject the back to work legislation. 
We support the rights of workers to collective bargaining and to strike. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
I would like to pick up where I left off.  
It is a longer story.  
All members of the opposition should be concerned about the nature of that motion. 
It could have done it without the consent of the House. 
That is not observed because it has to be observed. 
It is just convention. 
It is an optional process because when the government wants to do otherwise it can. 
That is what should worry all members of this House, particularly opposition members.  
I believe this standing order was brought in, in 1991, by the Conservative Party. 
Lots of members were present. 
That is what I meant by Parliament at its best. 
I have heard it from some members of Parliament. 
We hear it on the street. 
We hear it here and there. 
People say these guys are paid good money. 
What are they complaining about? 
That is what has happened.  
The NDP is here to say we do not buy it. 
We do not buy when it is done to postal workers. 
We do not buy when it is done to railroad workers. 
Sometimes it costs just as much to contract out. 
All this is wrong. 
We are losing that and it is because of legislation like this.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with my colleague for Richmond-Arthabaska.  
All we can say today is: finally. 
Negotiations began eight months ago in April. 
But he refused to do so. 
Consider for example small and medium size businesses. 
This is absolutely incredible. 
And the government did nothing.  
These have experienced a dramatic drop in the money they raise. 
There is not much that can be said about that, is there?  
My children need their support payments to survive. 
All businesses had plans.  
Neither government or union care. 
Why aren't they thinking about children and women?  
But the nightmare stories do not end there. 
Why did this happen? 
Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my answer is yes. 
We voted in favour of this.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
As you know, I come from the academic community. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
This is not a point of order but of debate.  
In response, the hon. member for West Nova.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabasca, PC):
We have to be careful about the statements we make. 
The hon. member for Frontenac-Megantic should know about that. 
He should be aware of that. 
And it was a social democrat government that implemented the freeze.  
Unfortunately, it did not work out.  
When we want to bring in real solutions, they are not there. 
We have brought forward solutions. 
It has become fashionable to bring in special legislation. 
There have been cuts everywhere. 
Frankly, it is extremely disappointing.  
They should remember negotiations last year and this year. 
The government sent us a bill. 
Whether it was right or wrong is not the question. 
What kind of negotiating is this? 
This is not negotiating. 
The same thing is happening now with Canada Post.  
Because of the setting up of a co-op. 
This example has occurred in a Quebec town. 
My friend from Frontenac-Megantic knows all about it.  
This is what the Conservative Party stands for.  
That having been said, I will conclude. 
For our part, we will keep an eye on him. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank you for giving me the floor. 
I was surprised by what the last speaker said.  
Second, there was a contradiction in his speech. 
He talked about dictatorship. 
I would like to know if he really came here to defend Quebec's interests.  
He referred to the government as a dictatorship. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Richmond-Arthabasca.  
I need only two minutes, Mr. Speaker. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I was saying that particularly in Quebec- 
You spoke only about Quebec. 
Yhat was the way to negotiate. 
And as for Quebec, I will always defend it.  
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
Yet today there is talk of negotiation, of special legislation.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Did he feel that they were excessive demands? 
Does he feel what is proposed in this legislation is appropriate?  
Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. 
It is about the way you allocate speaking time.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
There is no question this evening that that general principle has been followed. 
Your comment is well made. 
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there are two sorts of laws. 
Then there are those that the government is obliged to adopt. 
We have heard all sorts of mud slinging from the members of the Bloc. 
This is another plus for the Liberal government. 
Give me a break. 
This special legislation was one hundred times worse than Bill C-24.  
None other than Lucien Bouchard. 
We are losing $54 million a day. 
You did get that, but I wanted to make sure.  
We are losing $54 million per day. 
Dozens of jobs are lost.  
On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
It takes unanimous consent to share one's time. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Unanimous consent is not required at this time.  
Mr. Speaker, I can talk for 20 minutes if you want. 
You want me to conclude? 
I can talk for a long time.  
One thing is certain: this government acted responsibly. 
It took its responsibilities. 
We believe in the right to strike. 
We believe in collective bargaining. 
We let the two sides have a go at it.  
I have a right to ask myself this question.  
The special law, when it is passed, will be extending this collective agreement.  
I am on the side of the people and I support the special legislation''.  
He said ``Cow dung is more useful than dogma. 
At least it can be used as a fertilizer''.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
I am not ashamed to explain this to the people in my riding.  
My question is for the member for Bourassa. 
One thing is sure, we stood up for Canadians. 
So it is clear that those people over there have lost touch with reality.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
I think everybody in Canada knows that I am a unionist. 
The member for Bourassa insulted us a while ago. 
The hon. member for Acadie-Bathurst is an honourable man. 
Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I will not take up much time.  
He just stated that he has some respect for unions and union members.  
I want to remind the House of what he said earlier this afternoon. 
He added that it was time to introduce a special legislation- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We are running out of time. 
Please, give a short answer.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien:
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien:
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Many of them receive most of their income during this Christmas season.  
In short, the public interest requires that the federal government bring forward this legislation. 
The alternative, to let the work stoppage drag on indefinitely, was no alternative at all.  
For all of these reasons, collective bargaining is very important in this process.  
I do not believe that I am alone in thinking this way. 
Was it when Canada Post reached the point of no return financially? 
Was it when thousands of Canadian businesses went under and jobs were lost? 
That is what effective governing is all about. 
It is about taking everybody's legitimate concerns seriously. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Then he denied it. 
Then he reiterated that it was true. 
It was this Liberal government that made promises behind the back of the negotiation process. 
That is where the problem was, and the NDP stands behind bargaining.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Waterloo-Wellington.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Kootenay-Columbia.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am speaking on behalf of the postal workers in Revelstoke. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Waterloo-Wellington.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the question. 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Waterloo-Wellington has the floor.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
That is the only reason we are supporting the legislation.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have a specific question for my colleague. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That is not a point of order and it is out of order.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we could certainly resume debate- 
Mr. Guy St-Julien:
Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. 
But when he said, on the same point of order, that- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
With respect, that is not a point of order. 
The hon. member for Edmonton North has the floor.  
Mr. Speaker, we will let the boys carry on in the background.  
People were concerned that the postal strike would occur. 
They were trying to make alternate arrangements for the delivery of mail. 
We certainly hoped that as well.  
The Reform Party believes in the collective bargaining process. 
We believe in conciliation. 
We believe in the mediation process. 
Unfortunately that did not happen. 
That is exactly what made me and the people in my riding nervous. 
We heard him say ``I am the one that will look after everything''. 
It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.  
It could have bargained in good faith. 
I am not going to lock my door on you. 
I believe your members have the right to protest peacefully.'' 
I said to these union members: ``Come into my office. 
I spent 45 minutes talking with them. 
A couple of the union people said: ``We think we should negotiate a settlement.'' 
Basically, it is just the flip side of the same loonie. 
Then the other side that is in opposition goes hysterical also.  
There has to be a better way.  
We think that final offer arbitration is the way to go. 
The Maple Leaf meat processing packing plant in Edmonton is on strike right now. 
We could buy wieners at Schneider's. 
We have a choice. 
There are not a lot of options to delivery service.  
It is an essential service.  
The postal service is fundamental. 
I said: ``You are about 100 here today''. 
I thought there had been a change of heart by the government. 
Then all of a sudden it brought in legislation.  
If the speeches today were not so sad they would be laughable. 
Canadians want to make sure they receive postal service.  
We commission a scientific poll that by proof- 
It is certainly a start to know what people think. 
I challenge the members, who are howling, to stand in their places. 
It is something that is scientifically balanced and reliable. 
I agree the MPs might be fishing or looking for some sort of result. 
Heaven help them if they go against that.  
I commissioned that poll on Friday afternoon. 
It went to work as soon as Saturday morning arrived. 
I commissioned the poll late Friday afternoon. 
That is the important point.  
Edmonton North constituents were asked one very simple question. 
I think people get pretty tired sometimes of pollsters phoning around.  
They were not sure and did not understand the process of back to work legislation.  
Is that a really noble and democratic way to work around this? 
What a pathetic, irrelevant thing to say.  
It is not a very nice situation for postal workers to be in.  
They wanted to get back to work.  
Is that the scientific poll?  
I had 125 people through my office. 
That is the idea.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Chair thinks that is entirely appropriate.  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
(Bill read the third time and passed) 
Hon. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):
That this House do now adjourn.  
(The House adjourned at 10.29 p.m.)
