EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 5 
Friday, September 26, 1997 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE 
RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
My riding of St. Catharines is known as the garden city. 
Each day across this country new libraries are being connected to this excellent program.  
It helps them improve their competitiveness and create new opportunities.  
In 1996 the centre responded to well over 10,000 requests. 
That was an initiative with IRAP, the grape growers and the wine industry.  
We must continue to work at it in this mandate.  
I want to thank you, Madam Speaker, and again congratulate you on your appointment. 
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
This is a serious matter. 
This was all done without the knowledge of defence counsel.  
This too was done without the knowledge of defence counsel.  
It could precipitate the resignations of the minister and the chief justice. 
In a second memo dated May 12, 1996 Mr. Amerasinghe states: 
I invite all Canadians to look at the facts, to review the evidence. 
I am confident a reasonable person would reach the same shocking conclusions. 
And there is more.  
He does not seem to care what happens. 
Mr. Amerasinghe attributed the associate chief justice's behaviour to the state of his health. 
I quote from the same memo: 
On May the 29, 1996 the former justice minister stood in this House and stated: 
The minister's statement was wrong and is wrong. 
I have no doubt he will advise you.  
That is unacceptable and is shameful. 
In my opinion, Mr. Dubin's report was a whitewash. 
We witnessed political interference in the Airbus affair and in the Krever inquiry. 
Then there was the Pearson airport contract. 
And if you get caught, nothing happens.  
In the case of Mr. Thompson, he was transferred to somewhere else in the department. 
These people have to go. 
They do not belong in our justice system. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
I am encouraged by the member's vigorous pursuit of this issue. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the kind words from my hon. colleague. 
Again, I thank the hon. member for his kind remarks.  
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
There is great dissatisfaction and the polls are showing that.  
We heard that over and over again.  
Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):
We are hearing this all across the country. 
The polls are reflecting it.  
Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):
The throne speech was very up beat. 
It spoke of the great opportunities that await us in the new millennium. 
I would like to make one thing perfectly clear. 
It has been said many times that a healthy economy leads to a healthy society. 
This government also believes that a healthy society contributes to a healthy economy. 
These areas represent the greatest potential for Canada.  
As the prime minister said, our children are our most precious resource. 
In short, our government will secure Canada's future through our youth.  
At the same time, we must maintain a public health care regime. 
There is no escaping the needs of a growing population. 
Our international competitors are not standing still, so neither can we.  
It is unprecedented for the House of Commons to have five official parties. 
Since 1993 Canadians have wanted a change in the federal system. 
Most of this change concerns increasing the role of an MP. 
Currently each committee must apply for funds for each individual study. 
I do not believe this is good enough.  
The government must change its approach and be more open to change. 
We have here a wealth of knowledge. 
One final point concerns private members' business. 
Part of our role here should be to act as legislators. 
Currently really the only legislators here are those in cabinet.  
Suffice it to say I believe the time for change is now.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
I would like to ask the member, very briefly, to comment on this question. 
I want to give the House an example. 
My children have attended there and they tell me what is going on. 
There is a serious problem with young offenders. 
This has a very negative effect on all the other students. 
They begin to say ``what does it matter what I do, who cares?'' 
It affects their studies. 
It affects their job.  
The glue which holds us together becomes soft.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his questions.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
NIAGARA GRAPE AND WINE FESTIVAL 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE 
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Vaughan-King-Aurora, Lib.):
On June 2 Canadians voted for success. 
They voted for kept promises and they voted for a better tomorrow.  
These initiatives demonstrate that this government is- 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Civilians, most of them women and children, continue to meet ghastly deaths. 
Mrs. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Bravo Minnijean Brown Trickey, a proud Canadian.  
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
GFI employs 102 full time people and uses 64 local suppliers.  
Congratulations to GFI and congratulations to Technology Partnerships Canada.  
POLICE OFFICERS OF CANADA 
Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):
Even more remain permanently injured as a result of their work.  
Our safety is very much a result of their bravery.  
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
It is called Canadian culture the Liberal way. 
The sugar plums that dance in her head are coated with taxpayers' dollars. 
She does not understand. 
She cannot manufacture culture. 
She cannot buy patriotism.  
Your famous goal is part of what it truly means to be Canadian.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday this House paid tribute to one its greats, Stanley Knowles. 
I commend the organizers and supporters of tomorrow's fundraising event. 
Ms. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or, NDP):
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood-Assiniboine, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
I do apologize, Mr. Speaker. 
It was a rookie mistake. 
I would like to thank the leader of my party for being there.  
I would like to make a very brief comment or observation. 
It would seem that yesterday we accomplished what we set out to do. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
But now that the Liberals are back in power they have changed their tune. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
To be knowledgeable about great ancient music is very important for some people. 
I am not an expert but I love Gregorian music. 
It was part of the services in the Catholic Church when I was a kid. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
I heard the Prime Minister whistling another ditty yesterday. 
I think it was called ``Smoking in the Boys Room''. 
We suspect he has been blowing smoke about this whole budgetary surplus thing. 
I think that is a given. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
They do good work. 
They deserve to be complimented and I am proud to do it.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
We also know that the Prime Minister enjoys a good golf game. 
But does he really have to waste taxpayers' dollars on it? 
My question is obvious. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
It is an area of Canada that needs economic development.  
The people who play there pay and that helps. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
The hon. member for Macleod.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Dr. Brill-Edwards is an expert. 
Why is the health minister afraid of this scientist?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
My question is a very simple one:
This is clear from the recent election.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
How does secession square with democracy? 
There is no model for it anywhere.  
I must give you the following information, which is important to the debate. 
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE 
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I will use my example of Wales another time.  
Many of us benefited from them, including perhaps the hon. member. 
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the prime minister.  
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. leader of the NDP for the question. 
This is my first opportunity to reply.  
Hence, the attempt is being made to create the MAI.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Hon. David M Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
This is a federal-provincial funding agreement. 
Highways are the responsibility of the provinces. 
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Hon. David M Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
I have undertaken to get the facts for the hon. member. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, they are at it again over here. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, how do they spell relief over there? 
The prime minister could be whistling ``Pennies from Heaven''. 
I would like to remind this government that it did not win a lottery. 
Any surplus belongs to the Canadian people, not to the Liberal Party.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Saint-Maurice, Lib.):
That has been reduced to $104 billion or less.  
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
Hon. David M Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
The Aeroports de Montreal group made a decision to transfer flights from Mirabel to Dorval. 
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my next question is for the Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Transport just answered the question.  
It is not a transportation issue at this point in time. 
This is a long-established system. 
They are the ones making decisions. 
That is why we are willing to consider transportation issues. 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
But what does this have to do with secession?  
Ms. Jocelyne Bujold-Girard (Jonquiere, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Labour.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
He was not able to bring about a settlement. 
Ms. Jocelyne Bujold-Girard (Jonquiere, BQ:
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
It speaks exactly to the heart of the bill.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
I only wish he would answer the question. 
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, what we are discussing here is a principle of democracy. 
Perhaps what the hon. member- 
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the new member on her question.  
Mrs. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
We are waiting for the position of the Ontario government. 
Until we know the position of the Ontario government there will be no further negotiations.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
How will she continue to justify gouging taxpayers?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Its members made it very clear that they would see it destroyed.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member should get his facts straight. 
Second of all why does he not deal with the real numbers? 
Mr. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is also to the Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Perhaps before asking the question he might want to read it.  
What is important to understand is the position of the NDP. 
Is the hon. member saying that he is against an independent investment board? 
The hon. member for Qu'Appelle.  
Mr. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Why is he playing Robin Hood in reverse in this country?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
My question is directed to the Prime Minister. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
That was part of our program.  
We were successful in that respect. 
I am pleased the system is working well.  
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We found that improvements were necessary. 
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I welcome the hon. member to the House. 
When the facts are known we will be in a position to discuss it.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
I encourage the hon. member to contribute constructively to the process. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and Youth), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is a major concern. 
We are working very hard on this. 
We will get back to the member with detailed information.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and Youth), Lib.):
COMMENTS DURING QUESTION PERIOD 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
My dear colleague, two things. 
Second, individual members cannot table documents such as these. 
I guess it could be tabled if the hon. member had unanimous consent.  
I am addressing myself directly now to the member for Winnipeg North Centre. 
Were you seeking unanimous consent?  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
The answer is yes. 
Now, is there unanimous consent?  
There is not unanimous consent.  
THE LATE ALISTAIR FRASER 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Fraser was born into a family that values public service. 
He will be sorely missed. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
Mr. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
I felt particularly moved when I heard about his passing. 
The two of them were friends and colleagues. 
The two of them were experts in the rules. 
The rules were changed, which radically changed the operation of the institution. 
He was above the partisan battle of the House of Commons.  
Best of all, he was a friend. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
He was, like I, a Nova Scotian. 
His brothers and their families shared that home. 
Mr. Fraser loved this Chamber. 
He devoted much time to explaining it to the people who came here.  
He was critical to the success of parliament and the parliamentary internship program. 
He took this honour very seriously. 
Parliament has too few friends. 
I acknowledge that everything which has been said about him is true. 
The words which have been uttered about him by all hon. members are very fitting.  
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
MACKENZIE VALLEY RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ACT 
They want the penalties made tougher in order to make control easier. 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to introduce this bill. 
This can happen in an unending cycle.  
I urge its adoption as it reflects public expectation of the law.  
ACCESS TO INFORMATION ACT 
This bill is about the protection of our public records.  
It is a $1.6 billion problem, and that problem is auto theft.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Surrey North for seconding this motion.  
The Reform bill does much more. 
A Reform government would hold a binding national referendum on capital punishment. 
LOUIS RIEL DAY ACT 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I move, seconded by the member for Langley-Abbotsford: 
Mr. John Maloney (Erie-Lincoln, Lib.):
I would remind him of that rule.  
RIGHTS OF THE CHILD 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
It is sponsored by the Canadian Automobile Association.  
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE 
RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Vaughan-King-Aurora, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would first like to congratulate you on your role. 
You rightly deserve your position.  
The government knows where the people of Vaughan-King-Aurora stand on such issues.  
In 1994 the words were cautious, the commitments solemn. 
But this one was different. 
It was full of hope, optimism and excitement about what the future holds. 
This three pronged approach has proven successful.  
These programs and measures are only part of the solution. 
I have found that the most innovative solutions come from young people. 
Our country is moving forward. 
We must all move forward together. 
As a member of Parliament I have also seen success at the local level. 
Our youth will look to the future with confidence and enthusiasm as they should.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member for Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
I have a question which to me is entirely reasonable.  
But there was not a single word about redressing these inequities.  
Madam Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for his question. 
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I am splitting my time.  
It has been a long voyage for society, from tribalism to this Canadian Parliament. 
We indeed have accomplishments in Canada. 
We have built a country out of a harsh but bountiful land. 
However nation building is a passage, not an arrival. 
Canada must continue to live, renew and flourish. 
Unfortunately a downward spiral of cynicism has gripped many. 
The Liberals have charted a course with their statement. 
The bunch cannot be trusted.  
They have become very cynical about politicians and the process of elections. 
They do not know who they can trust.  
It could be so much better.  
Canadians do not ask for the impossible. 
They have reasonable expectations for their representatives. 
First we want our politicians to be honest. 
We want leaders to be forthright and have character. 
We want to be able to believe and trust what we hear. 
Second, Canadians want competence. 
We have much incompetence in government. 
And now he wants to lead a spending charge again. 
In Canada the crime rate is too high. 
Tragic 745 hearings continue to tear communities apart. 
That is the sorry Liberal administrative record. 
They are not competent.  
Third, Canadians desire real leadership. 
We need inspiration and leaders who can lift us up. 
We have a vision of a new Canada. 
We can make our country fit for heroes to live in.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
It is an honourable position, which I am sure you know. 
Last, I remember her saying clearly that she was going to deal with victim rights.  
None of those things are in the throne speech. 
That is why we see the alternative package.  
He also talked about some of the principles which guide us.  
I know he has extensive personal experience in the field. 
This is not simply a theoretical exercise for him. 
It should be an electable offence.  
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
In this week's throne speech the government talked of partnerships. 
It now states that the federal government cannot act alone. 
It is indeed unfortunate that the previous government did not understand this concept.  
Then we have victim rights. 
There remains a great deal to be done''.  
He promised to address this deficiency in our laws. 
We must assume one of two things. 
Regardless, Canadians are still waiting.  
It is hoped that this government's priorities on justice have been inadvertently forgotten. 
Otherwise Canadians will also be greatly disappointed.  
We now have a fresh new Minister of Justice. 
I have made my home in British Columbia since 1971. 
He applied for parole last March. 
Our family spent nearly two years before the courts. 
I have come to the House of Commons with the support of my constituents. 
Little regard is given to the specific damage done to individual law-abiding citizens. 
I am serving notice that I fully intend to be particularly vigilant on this issue. 
She has promised a policy of co-operation with the provinces. 
There are few words available with which to describe it. 
Mockery and travesty come to mind. 
The Reform Party has been the most active in recognizing victims' rights. 
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I can relate to the business that the hon. member mentioned. 
It was not followed through in the courts. 
It could have been.  
We would like to see that moved into something more of an indictable area. 
That is not a route that should be taken. 
It is just one extra roadblock on the way to recovery. 
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
I have a question for my hon. colleague. 
I for one do not believe it works all the time. 
There have been any number of instances of that over the past number of years.  
It just does not work.  
Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):
He mentioned in his remarks the 745 hearings. 
There has been no closure.  
Would the hon. member like to comment?  
You had to be there.  
It was an absolute travesty. 
There were 22 family members representing eight of his 11 victims. 
We have restored their optimism and renewed their hope for the future. 
I am a Liberal of the English school. 
That is what Liberalism is all about.  
We also know that the government cannot act alone. 
Canadians want their government to work in partnership. 
A federation is not static, but rather constantly changing. 
Together we will decide how it will change.  
Job creation and economic growth are and will remain our first priorities.  
This new project will help to create nearly 200 jobs in Ahuntsic. 
Investing in our youth has the largest return for Canada. 
We need to give children the best start possible.  
Who can argue with that?  
We must do everything to guarantee our young people a better future. 
I thank the prime minister for giving me that opportunity.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
I want to assure you of my full co-operation.  
Am I to understand that we will fight together for the same cause?  
We must never forget that there are French Canadians outside Quebec. 
I will repeat what I said in my speech. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
My question to her concerns her being Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice. 
At that time the judge said it was an awful crime. 
I could see that in the eyes of these people when they met with me. 
This is a very serious question on behalf of these very distraught people.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice.  
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
We do not question the integrity of our justice system.  
We tightened the rules for early parole hearings. 
We cracked down on child prostitution and child sex tourism. 
Mrs. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, congratulations on your appointment.  
The people of St. Paul's are big picture people. 
The CEOs of this country are really learning directly from the recent grads.  
The tenets of the Canada Health Act presumed high quality care. 
We can no longer tolerate benchmarks that are not based on quality.  
As we move toward the millennium I feel extremely proud to be a Canadian.  
I was asked to help them differentiate between Canadians and Americans. 
There is also the wonderful Canadian nurse who looked after the English patient. 
Our respect for diversity also makes us different. 
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
I had a child 22 months ago. 
She was born on Wednesday and Friday morning I was out. 
Friday night I was back in with my daughter.  
Believe me it is not only the problem of the premier of Ontario. 
I want to make it clear that it is happening in the Atlantic provinces.  
Madam Speaker, I am aware that this is a problem across the country. 
We do not really know the readmission rate of maternity patients.
