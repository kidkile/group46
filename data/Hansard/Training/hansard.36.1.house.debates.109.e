Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
CANADA POST CORPORATION ACT 
An extraordinary amount of Canadians are inadvertently subject to these fees and moneys are collected. 
I think it is a consumer rip-off.  
This is again intended to confuse or rip-off Canadian consumers. 
I think this is an important piece of legislation.  
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
The petition is signed by several hundred petitioners from our ridings.  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
ALLOTTED DAY-CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM 
Two Montreal rapists received conditional sentences. 
The list goes on and on.  
It works great for the criminals, that is for sure. 
Victims are still waiting and still nothing from the justice department. 
It tabled a comprehensive report in April 1997. 
Did she bring in legislation? 
No. Did she introduce tough new measures to deal with young thugs? 
And what is the justice minister's response? 
How much longer do Canadians have to wait? 
The minister's proposals leave too much discretion in the hands of judges. 
We have seen where that has led with conditional sentencing. 
So-called special sentencing options will also be left to the discretion of judges.  
What kind of pattern? 
How many offences make a pattern? 
The minister is also vague about non-violent offences. 
Is break and enter going to be considered non-violent? 
What about drug trafficking? 
Will these youths be sentenced to community work? 
Let us look at what others are saying about the minister's paper. 
It is not about anything. 
It is just hot air, more talk and more debate.  
People are afraid to walk the streets at night. 
The guiding principle of the justice system should be the protection of society. 
The rights of criminals should be secondary. 
There should be parental responsibility for their children's actions. 
We also need to promote personal responsibility. 
Individuals must be responsible for their own actions. 
The Liberals believe that our environment is responsible for criminal behaviour. 
They believe individuals have no personal obligation whatsoever. 
Criminals must be held accountable for their actions.  
They want to strengthen the Young Offenders Act. 
The Liberals bring forward this meaningless paper. 
They want truth in sentencing. 
Canadians want a victims bill of rights. 
The Liberals continue to champion the rights of criminals. 
I guess those are really one and the same.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
The first step involves early intervention and prevention. 
We had a town hall meeting recently in Saskatoon. 
Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to comment on the opposition from the Bloc in Quebec. 
I applaud the system of youth justice in Quebec because it is well integrated. 
We are not at the planning stage. 
We are at the implementation stage. 
I wish the justice minister would take some initiatives at the federal level.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
This is about one of these characters. 
His name is Clinton Dale McNutt.  
Maybe we should intervene. 
Maybe we should look at it.  
What happened five years later? 
He was sentenced in 1990 to eight years for attempted murder. 
This is the day care of all day cares for criminals. 
There are no fences, no guards and no security system. 
The female victim required hospitalization. 
Even the workers are not very safe from this guy.  
What happened after April 14? 
This is what should be noted. 
On April 25, 1997, disclosure court was adjourned. 
On May 23 the discovery was adjourned. 
On June 24 disclosure court was adjourned. 
On July 15 disclosure court was held. 
We must keep this in mind. 
He is now guilty of indecent assault. 
He said ``Yes, I did it''.  
On February 16 sentencing was adjourned to obtain a psychiatric report. 
That was after four adjournments.  
We have to piece this together and think about it. 
On February 26 they fixed a date for sentencing. 
On April 20, 1998, the dangerous offender hearing was adjourned. 
The victim who was indecently assaulted was sitting there listening to this stuff. 
What is going on? 
This goes on every day in almost all our cities. 
Look at them over there laughing at it. 
We should take that for what it is worth. 
That is what victims are going through day after day. 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
I think I have figured out what the hon. member's problem is. 
I think that he is comparing apples and oranges, and scaring everybody in the process. 
We may not have adopted it, or signed it, but we do respect it.  
They cannot understand for they are not listening.  
Instead of yelling, the hon. member should perhaps listen to what I have to say. 
He would hear somewhat more balanced and realistic speeches. 
People would not be alarmed. 
The game they are playing here is a dangerous one. 
Crime, the judicial system and public safety are nothing to joke about. 
I think their remarks are outrageous.  
Furthermore, I am receiving applause from the Liberals, the New Democrats and the Conservatives. 
Something is wrong in this system.  
I am coming to my question and I will be brief. 
Perhaps it could be improved. 
This is about politics. 
Thanks to me, the hon. Liberal member says. 
I would like an apology for that insult.  
I would like an apology for that insult. 
It is the Liberal government that is at fault. 
The government is deliberately denying victims in this country their rights.  
I do not have any time to answer that real dumb question.  
It is exaggerating the extent of the crime in this country. 
Crime has gone down in Canada. 
It is exaggerating and fearmongering which is typical of the Reform opposition. 
It highlights the exceptions to the justice system rather than the rule.  
That is exactly the Reform philosophy as far as justice goes.  
We are on the record- 
The punishment should fit the crime.  
This new legislation will enhance the requirement that community based approaches be- 
I think the parliamentary secretary has the floor. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I caution him very much in respect of those words.  
There are many models already in use across Canada. 
We must do a better job of ensuring that this is the case. 
The victimization rate has gone down between 1998 and 1992. 
What is it that is broken in Canada? 
The best way to fight crime is to ensure that crime is not committed. 
A second phase of the crime prevention initiative will soon be launched. 
Such a bill could only address matters within the federal government's jurisdiction. 
I believe that the federal role in that area is rather limited. 
They often forget that.  
They also forget that. 
I have no doubt that the Minister of Justice will be interested. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, statistics across this country do show that crime rates are going down. 
That is what your member said.  
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Could the member please explain to the House what kind of system we would have?  
We know that with the Reform Party there would be no real social programs. 
I will talk about what this government wants to do. 
Poverty is an important issue in terms of preventing crimes, starting at age zero. 
We consider community based initiatives as being the most appropriate way to begin. 
That is the route we are taking.  
We can talk about fetal alcohol syndrome and all the other syndromes. 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
I could debate this all day long. 
I know the subject well and am passionate about it.  
The Reform Party proposes a motion and attacks three subjects from three different directions. 
I will deal briefly with each one.  
There is always room for improvement. 
There is obviously room for improvement. 
No. The law must be enforced.  
I referred briefly to the ACFAS earlier. 
This is the secret of our current success.  
We have two different ways of looking at the problem. 
The Reform position is incompatible with ours. 
The second point deals with parole for violent offenders. 
Some offenders are harder to reintegrate than others. 
I am told that pedophiles do not respond to treatment. 
The Bloc Quebecois does not just criticize. 
It comes from crime. 
Certain provinces are undoubtedly more advanced than others. 
They will invest this money where it is needed.  
I could go on for hours, but my time is up.  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
He talked about the administration of justice within his province.  
There is a biker war there. 
We have seen murders, including the murder of a young child. 
We saw the gangland type of execution of two prison guards. 
Does the member support that? 
Or, if he had the power, would he change that? 
If he would change it, to what extent would he change it? 
I have not criticized the administration of justice. 
As I have said, there is room for improvement. 
That is not how things work in real life. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am sorry to interrupt.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
The topic is an important subject which Canadians want to talk about. 
I would ride my bicycle to the store, buy the milk and return home.  
Now a parent simply cannot do that. 
It would not be smart. 
They would not be doing their child a favour.  
They have a right to be angry. 
I can relate to it. 
Those are urgent circumstances.  
In fact, they do not threaten the little children with beating them up. 
They are almost getting to the point where they are hyper acute. 
They are always restless. 
So it is very hard to reason with them. 
A lot of us are victims in the inner city of Winnipeg. 
I have had my home broken into many times. 
I have actually caught kids breaking into my home. 
It was a blackmail situation. 
It turned into a horrible mess. 
It took me six months to clear up that mess. 
So I have been there. 
I have been a victim.  
That I have seen time and time again. 
I think it is really shameful.  
Those kids were not even charged yet, never mind convicted. 
What about the presumption of innocence? 
Reformers are capitalizing on that. 
In fact they are marketing the malice which some people have inside them. 
Let us face it. 
I do not think they have thought it all through.  
We are critical of certain aspects of the criminal justice system. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Better yet, just do it. 
The Liberal government talks about the new legislation that is coming in. 
There is no legislation. 
There is only more talk. 
The NDP is already supporting this more talk philosophy. 
There is nothing happening from the Liberal government. 
Yet the NDP is already supporting it.  
It has brought the country to the crime ridden state that exists. 
Until we change things it will go on. 
That is a real problem. 
However I know it is more costly to rehabilitate than it is to punish. 
Every soul we save will be a net saving in the end.  
The economy was ground to a halt. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am afraid I must interrupt the member.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to participate in the debate. 
A very important motion has been brought forward on this supply day. 
I commend the mover of the motion. 
It is also a subject area that is very close to my heart. 
The application of criminal law is playing a predominant role in society. 
Canadians are shocked almost daily at the way our judges are applying conditional sentences. 
This is an extremely crucial issue. 
It is one I am glad we are having an opportunity to debate today.  
I look forward to the worthwhile and productive discussion that will take place.  
We have seen the minister's response which was released to the media. 
This seems to be the justice minister's preferred method of making public policy statements. 
What can we say about this initiative? 
We are missing in this initiative concrete legislative initiatives. 
We do not see a commitment to funding for such initiatives. 
I applaud the announcement of the minister. 
The $32 million crime prevention fund announced through the media will be useful. 
The Young Offenders Act is an area fraught with difficulties. 
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
I listened with much interest to what he said.  
Drug abuse seems to be the matrix of much of the crime that occurs. 
Could he comment on that?  
Madam Speaker, I appreciate very much the question. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
That is the kind of system Liberal governments have allowed to carry on.  
He was very remorseful at the time. 
It happens an awful lot.  
I cannot say specifically what happened in that case. 
That would be one way to address it. 
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague who has just spoken. 
We worked with the committee. 
Our approach is early detection and prevention. 
It was not helping young people. 
That is a phenomenal success rate. 
We support that very much.  
We asked Ms. Chapman what she considered a success. 
That is one of the key elements to their success.  
Those are the two first levels we very strongly advocate. 
It is also encouraging to hear that those programs are spreading. 
It is having the same very high success rate. 
Over 90% of young people are being rehabilitated. 
We find that by and large rehabilitation in closed custody facilities simply has not worked.  
The issue is very clear. 
What would we do in that area? 
What she is recommending is of course only a recommendation. 
She has used unspecified terms without definition. 
We really do not know what the bill will look like. 
She promised one in the fall. 
He recommended it be lowered and he had a very sound rationale for doing so. 
We are not inventing anything new. 
There was a young person in that situation in Edmonton. 
They cannot act on a criminal matter because they do not have the authority. 
They enter into federal-provincial financial agreements to do so. 
The government is not offering Manitoba anything. 
She has four areas of violent offences. 
We say that is wrong. 
Why would we not want the judges to have this discretion? 
To suggest otherwise is utter nonsense.  
I should correct that. 
Not yourself, Mr. Speaker, but to myself and my colleagues. 
We want early detection and prevention. 
We want them to expand. 
We want them to have the support of this government and the provincial governments.  
Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Let us look at what is actually going on in criminal justice reform.  
The governments in Canada are not exactly starving the justice system. 
I would like to give you a few examples. 
A new initiative to this end will soon be implemented. 
It is aimed at developing short term solutions and concerns mainly minors.  
In 1997 we increased funding for the community action program for children. 
In 1995 the Liberal government introduced the head start program. 
This administration has not abandoned its criminal justice agenda. 
The bill targeted three areas. 
Bill C-55 made this mandatory. 
It was already evident that the dangerous offender procedure worked. 
Bill C-55 also created a new long term offender category. 
It is a measure that demonstrates this government's concern for public safety.  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
My hon. colleague referred to 250 changes and covered them quite well. 
We are to expand funding to do what for child sex tourism? 
It is window dressing.  
Clifford Olson was allowed a full court press with a judge and jury. 
We saw that happen. 
It is tinkering again and it is window dressing.  
I have never in my lifetime seen such a precedent as this one.  
Mr. Speaker, I have been here for five years. 
We are constantly striving to improve the system. 
I recall several attempts by the government to improve the system. 
They have had a fixation on trying to solve a particular problem. 
Section 745 legislation was a clear example of that.  
There are other initiatives like DNA, for example. 
The member has identified a problem in the area of funding. 
It is not just the federal government. 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
We know about narcodollars, money laundering, etc. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a good question. 
Our government is concerned by this issue. 
We have been consulting the various stakeholders for two years now. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Surrey North.  
He said that Reform has not given many concrete suggestions. 
How totally inaccurate that is. 
The Liberals consequently swept it under the rug. 
That is again totally inaccurate. 
The Liberals should be listening very carefully.  
She said ``I expected him to be in prison''. 
She is 24 years old and lives near Windsor, Ontario. 
She said ``I was amazed and very angry to see him there. 
This man received 18 months of house arrest. 
That is a symptom of what is wrong with our justice system.  
Let us put this in context. 
We need the rule of law. 
We need proper enforcement of the law. 
Those laws must be fair.  
Second, the laws must be enforced equally. 
There must be no exemptions. 
There must be no special status for certain people under the law.  
They are three basic principles of justice. 
That is why we are debating this topic today. 
The laws are too complex. 
I have had a lot of dealings with the gun registration system. 
It is not fair and it will not be respected. 
It is much too complex for one thing. 
It may not have been looked at or used for a long time. 
It causes people to disrespect the law.  
That is why people ask questions about what is going on.  
There is a problem right there.  
They have not agreed that this is a law which they want.  
Let me talk about another very recent example in my riding. 
A horrific murder took place approximately a month ago. 
Her body was found later. 
Do you know what it was set at, Mr. Speaker? 
That man is walking the streets today. 
Not only that, but the judge gave him custody of the children. 
The people in that community are very angry. 
They question a system that is going to allow for this kind of thing.  
The law needs to be seen as fair to all and applied properly. 
I will not go into detail. 
Look at it through the eyes of the victims. 
The parents of this woman who was killed see what is going on. 
They are absolutely shocked.  
What happened to them? 
They were punished and are out two and a half years later. 
We have huge problems.  
I have visited the inmates in the prisons across Canada. 
These are inmates in the prisons. 
All of these things have to be put into perspective.  
We need to have this balance. 
There are other aspects. 
I will emphasize them later on in the day. 
I wish the Liberals would test their laws by them.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Is there unanimous consent to extend the time for the hon. member?  
There is no consent.  
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
I listened to the member's speech. 
He made some excellent points. 
I would like to ask the member a question. 
At least that was always my belief. 
I would like to get the opinion of the member. 
He stabbed her 37 times. 
He was only given three years. 
Does the member see the same problem? 
Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague makes a very good point. 
The criminal element does have more rights than the victims. 
It was a bill that was passed with huge support in this House. 
I do not know why it has been stalled.  
The criminal is read all of his rights. 
The victims have access to none of them. 
We have to seriously question the justice system that allows this injustice to take place.  
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
The government does not appear to be too interested in changing the status quo. 
These three issues are prominent reasons why I became a member of parliament.  
The Young Offenders Act was first made law in 1985. 
The 10-year review was not completed until 12 years later. 
It is intended to balance the rights of victims and the rights of criminals. 
Canadians are still waiting. 
Only time will tell. 
What did the minister do? 
I guess that was too direct and uncomplicated.  
What kind of mess are we in? 
For one thing the former minister has definitely helped his colleagues in the legal profession. 
It has cost taxpayers in many different ways. 
Perhaps she should review some of the decisions of the various courts of appeal. 
Nothing, because the sentence had already been served.  
Ronald John Schmidt received a nine month custodial sentence for sexual assault. 
He was granted a nine month conditional sentence. 
Conditional sentencing does not carry with it society's denunciation for these offences. 
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened to the member's speech with interest. 
I have a couple of questions for him.  
Is this also going on in his area?  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question. 
They are the majority of victims of youth crime.  
That explains the kind of fear students experience in their schools. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his intervention. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question.  
It does not happen all the time, I must admit. 
It delays the grieving process. 
We will keep our fingers crossed and see what the government plans to do. 
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time.  
The Canadian criminal justice system is not broken. 
It is also a significant drop from the 37% level in 1991.  
He also began the process of reforming our youth justice system.  
I announced last week that the system will be improved to reflect these concerns. 
We can do much more to prevent youth crime in the first place.  
The new legislation will propose changes to several areas. 
This recommendation has been seriously considered by this government. 
Let me now turn briefly to conditional sentencing. 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not know why he is saying that. 
Obviously nobody is suggesting that is acceptable. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
I suggest that is not the truth. 
Mr. Jim Karygiannis (Scarborough-Agincourt, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to see the minister moving in that direction. 
There was a serious offence in 1984 in my riding of Scarborough-Agincourt. 
I want to thank the minister for moving in that direction. 
Could we not look at the legislation for automatic transfers? 
Could we not look for mandatory treatment? 
We have mandatory treatment. 
The animating spirit behind the member's question is important. 
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I seek the unanimous consent of the House to extend this portion of the debate. 
We have the minister with us. 
I do not hear consent.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on the same point of order. 
There was not consent. 
The Speaker is not saying who said it. 
I do not know who said it. 
I heard no, and that is enough.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
You may not enjoy them. 
I do not think they will- 
It might help in the circumstances.  
The operative phrase should be short term. 
That is exactly what they do. 
Those are the solutions of the ``ing'' party.  
Mr. Speaker, the members opposite do not seem to agree with that. 
Let me share with everyone something spoken by one of the Reform Party members. 
He was referring to caning. 
That is the Reform mentality. 
That is exactly the kind of thing we want to stop.  
That is going to solve our problems. 
We will throw them in a dungeon, lock them up and forget about them. 
That is just brilliant.  
Where in the world did you guys come from? 
I invite him to continue to do that.  
Mr. Speaker, my apologies. 
There is another problem. 
That has been announced by our minister. 
Why would they not support that? 
Do they just want to be negative? 
Do they not want to have input into it? 
This is a policy. 
They have a chance to have input into it. 
All Canadians will have that chance.  
I have heard members opposite call for that. 
The minister has said she agrees with that.  
What seems to be the problem here? 
Why do we not just get on with it? 
Let us take that policy statement and build it into legislation. 
That is what the Canadian people expect us to do.  
Let us do what they have suggested. 
Why would they not support that? 
If they commit a crime, their names should be published. 
Those members should be ashamed of themselves.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
I do not understand where the member is coming from. 
That is what we have come to. 
How does the member explain this terrible increase in crime? 
Does a little bit of discipline not ring some bells in his brainless head?  
I went to a catholic boarding school. 
Does the member want to talk about discipline? 
Does he want to talk about violence? 
That will scare the dickens out of my Johnny, but do not strap my Johnny''. 
That is the problem. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
The minister talked about working with the provinces. 
The minister talked about a consultative process with the provinces. 
The minister talked about cost sharing with the provinces. 
It is now funding only 31% of the programs in the province of Saskatchewan. 
I appreciate the question.  
It should be examined as to why that is happening.  
That is absolutely shameful. 
No one here is saying that there are not problems with our young people. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Unfortunately for them there have been parents who have lost their kids today. 
Because they were caught spanking their children. 
Is that not a shame? 
I would like to know where a person like the individual over there grew up. 
What era was he in? 
Did he come from another planet where discipline was never used?  
This is today's headline about a major school in Montreal.  
Some changes have to be made. 
However, my headline would give a little more of the facts. 
That group over there would not understand what we are talking about. 
Something has to be done about that.  
We tried desperately to get rid of it. 
They sat in the galleries begging us and asking us to do these things. 
We had their support and what we got from the other side was political nonsense.  
They said that we are exploiting these crimes for political gain. 
There are many ways to get political gain. 
Is giving them more golf courses a great way to do it?  
Drugs are rampant in the prisons. 
What are the wimps over there doing? 
They do not have the guts to do anything. 
I can say that because I have more hair than he has.  
This kind of sickness exists in the government. 
People will not have to put bars on their windows any longer.  
They have not done a thing. 
This whole outfit is absolutely ill.  
Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. 
He is also very well known for his candour as we can see today. 
It was kind of a last straw type of thing.  
He ought to try it some time. 
Maybe he should have received it. 
I received it and I guarantee it works.  
I wonder if the member would consider not using the word bull again.  
I would like to see it here for discussion. 
I think 90% of Canadians would say maybe that is what we ought to do.  
Mr. John Maloney (Erie-Lincoln, Lib.):
The list goes on.  
The personal human devastation is horrific. 
In reality we are all affected.  
Let us stop the waste of productive lives. 
Let us eradicate fetal alcohol syndrome.  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
Planes may not be able to fly. 
Heart monitors and health care systems may fail. 
Hydro grids might shut down. 
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
However, this road will not be an easy one for our upcoming generation. 
It will require the tools to compete in this ever changing world.  
Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):
Come and find out.  
Our beautiful landscapes await you.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Frankly, I am not surprised. 
Did the minister tell us how his department plans to recover the funds? 
Canadians are on the hook and in the dark. 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):
Admittedly, to that point islanders were reluctant brides.  
It was six years later before P.E.I. finally joined Canada.  
The hon. member for Mississauga West.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Is this what Canadians want? 
No. Canadians want public policy that makes sense. 
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
The Liberals have failed disabled Canadians. 
They have left many disabled Canadians with no source of income. 
Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne-Blainville, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the safety of air travelers is currently being threatened.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville, Lib.):
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
The Minister of National Defence has publicly characterized these incidents as poor behaviour. 
It actually wants to turn the clock back. 
THE LATE JEAN HAMELIN 
Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard-La Prairie, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
FEDERATION ACADIENNE DU QUEBEC 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Congratulations to these two award winners.  
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
The most recent involves Tasha Pederson. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I said that a lot of questions need to be looked into. 
When you talk about compassion you talk about only one type of people. 
It is the people who are sick who deserve compassion.  
I see that Reform is coming back to a notion of responsibility. 
Its members should make up their mind.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, again the Reform Party does not want to compensate everybody. 
It is passing judgment. 
It is changing its position again.  
They do not know what they are talking about.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
We are getting a little close with our language. 
I encourage members on both sides to stay away from too many personal comments.  
Why does he not change his mind?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
There was an agreement signed by all the governments of Canada.  
As Prime Minister of Canada- 
The hon. member for Edmonton North.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
I want to ask him about this hep C deal.  
That deal was scuttled.  
The hon. member for Edmonton North.  
Mr. Speaker, I want to know this from the Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Health has worked very diligently. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
It just instituted it with these victims.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The measures are passive, old hat. 
There is no constructive reform relating to the modern market. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
This is what our reform is all about.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We have greater ambitions for young Canadians.  
This would not be good for the future of young Canadians.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, such comments make no sense.  
Can he not admit and understand that?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
This is a sensible job strategy. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
The commissioner presents very important detail about my department. 
Some of it is already outdated because we have acted upon it.  
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Canada is threatened by pollution. 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
They work very competently and efficiently. 
We are fulfilling our obligations. 
We are absolutely committed to meeting our Kyoto protocol commitments.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Will the House ever see such a plan from the government?  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
My question is very straightforward. 
Who in the government is willing to take the blame for this dismal failure?  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
We are in the company of many other developed nations in the world. 
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
For years, employment insurance meant he had an income all year. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We could mention targeted salary measures to help him find work.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
And his case is not unique.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am not quite sure what the hon. member means by his question. 
I do not think anybody is sloughing anything off.  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
This is a fine example of someone with a diploma, minister.  
Dear colleagues, you must always address the Chair.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Now she is covered for all- 
The hon. member for Quebec.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, time for the minister to face reality. 
There are thousands of cases like that of Ms. Rainville in Quebec. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
That is what the unemployed want.  
No question from that side of the House, no positive contribution.  
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
I would emphasize they are just proposals. 
The minister still has not actually changed the law.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, these proposals are very serious. 
I would ask the official opposition to seriously engage in a meaningful debate. 
They are only interested in creating a culture of fear.  
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
BC MINE IN BLACK LAKE 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We were the first. 
Mrs. Judi Longfield (Whitby-Ajax, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Revenue.  
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):
Does the professor really think that 100 crimes a week- 
The hon. Minister of Justice.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the lights are really on over on that side of the House. 
The last I heard, a person under 12 could not be convicted.  
Are they to lie back, shut up and take it?  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
There is a shortage of albumin available from likely suppliers in Canada. 
The issue is not where the product comes from. 
The issue is, is it safe. 
It continues to certify the company. 
The product is safe and that is the bottom line.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
The hon. Minister of Health.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
The products in question have met safety standards in America and in Canada. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the Environment.  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
The Canadian Environmental Assessment Act is in its third year of operation. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
I also requested that the standing committee do a review of enforcement.  
Mr. Charles Hubbard (Miramichi, Lib.):
Like you, my colleagues, I really want to hear this answer.  
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, and so does the rest of the House.  
1997 was a banner year for tourism in Atlantic Canada. 
There are 96,000 people involved in tourism. 
The hon. member for West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
I think that the member should stop creating myths against refugee people. 
Refugees are not criminals.  
SOCIETE DES ACADIENS ET ACADIENNES DU NOUVEAU-BRUNSWICK 
Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Cutbacks of 33% were imposed on all organizations. 
The hon. member for Acadie-Bathurst.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Is he prepared to listen to the unemployed who are in difficulty?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
COMMENTS DURING QUESTION PERIOD 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I do not wish to be disrespectful, quite the contrary.  
I heard the word myself. 
I am now addressing my colleague, the member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, directly.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I have great respect for you and your office.  
I do not recall having used those words yesterday. 
Many words are uttered in the House of Commons in any given day. 
I am also looking at Hansard and I am not identified as being- 
I therefore accept the member's explanation.  
Mr. Speaker, I do not recall having used the word. 
As I understand it, if the hon. member used the word, he withdraws it. 
Point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
It has been done and I accept the withdrawal. 
At this point, the matter is concluded.  
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
That is all for this point of order.  
ALLOTTED DAY-CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM 
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
So how can we convict them? 
It does not have what it takes to do the right thing. 
It ought to be ashamed of itself.  
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
I am sure that getting rid of the name is very important too. 
This is a bureaucratic mess where the budget was blown long ago. 
Reform's approach to dealing with youth crime has three components. 
It was accompanied by a comprehensive list of recommendations. 
She also has the minority report submitted by the Reform Party. 
With all this comprehensive information what does the justice minister do? 
She admits that the current system is flawed and needs to be changed. 
Did we not know that already? 
This provision has been applied quite liberally. 
Violent offenders are still being put back into the communities.  
The motion read as follows: 
Since that time it has languished in the justice committee.  
Canadians are demanding change and it is past time for the government to listen. 
It must act with concrete proposals and substantive changes.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
I think he makes some very compelling points. 
That person is there to represent the interests of the inmate. 
There is no question that there is a need for that.  
However, this is the anomaly. 
They are continually reminded of their pain.  
I think that is the first step. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
I know he is very knowledgeable about the First Nations in his area. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
The topic is obviously very timely. 
Would they bypass the committee process? 
Ontario's Victim's Bill of Rights also includes a preamble.  
It is important to note that some provinces have used the term ``rights''. 
It is an important role.  
Provinces have done exactly that in their legislation.  
It is important to review some of the background information on provincial victims legislation. 
Section 7 addresses information that will be provided on request of the victim.  
The Ontario legislation has created a civil cause of action for victims of prescribed crime. 
I would like to highlight Alberta as well. 
The fund may also receive other revenue, including appropriations from general revenue. 
An appeal board is also established to adjudicate appeals of the director's decision. 
These are Criminal Code responses which Canadians think are very important and clearly support. 
I would like to highlight some of those now. 
In 1997 Bill C-17, the criminal law improvement bill, included amendments to benefit victims. 
More specific amendments came into force in May 1997. 
That is understood and that is clearly apparent.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Let me quote Phyllis de Villiers, president of CAVEAT: 
While inordinate attention is paid to the rights of the offender, the victims are marginalized.  
This was on May 30, 1997. 
He mentioned that we have to show courtesy, compassion and respect. 
That is only normal. 
The parole system is in a shambles. 
People are not happy with that. 
They dreamt that up and it applies to violent offenders. 
They do it, sit back and do nothing about it. 
What does the member propose to do for victims? 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
The member is wrong. 
This party wanted to put equability and fairness into the justice system. 
The facts speak for themselves.  
Some members have taken that hand and would like to work with us. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member opposite for his question.  
It is important we continue to do so. 
It is outrageous and too bad. 
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
The rest was simply window dressing. 
That is why we could not support the Liberal bills.  
He talked about Bill C-41. 
I find that ludicrous. 
Canadians see through that and they will not stand for it. 
That is the long and short of it.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
The problem today is that crime is increasing. 
Some like to trot out statistics that it is not. 
They say it is going down. 
It has doubled since 1986. 
What can we do?  
There has been a failure of the system to deal with it. 
Our traditional response of detection, detention and deterrence simply has not worked. 
If one looks at them carefully the statistics bear that out. 
We do not have a system that prevents crime, but there are solutions out there. 
What can we do?  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
When I look around I do not see that we have a quorum.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I hope it will live up to its advance billing.  
The first thing we have to realize is prevention. 
How do we prevent criminal activity? 
It starts often at time zero. 
It is increasing in geometric proportions. 
These people have IQs of an average of 68. 
It makes it very difficult for them to interact and engage in society. 
We need to prevent this. 
In order to prevent it, we have to work in utero.  
Head start programs are a win-win situation if they are done properly. 
My hope is we will be working together to make this a reality.  
The government should adopt it. 
In a restorative justice program the incidence of recidivism has dropped dramatically. 
My colleagues have put forth many constructive suggestions along those lines.  
There is no obligation. 
What kind of justice system is that?  
Also we have to look at post-discharge issues. 
Let us talk about streamlining the justice system. 
Justice delayed is justice denied. 
We can put forth a streamlined system and this is not difficult.  
This would be fair to society and to the victims. 
Why do we not examine electing judges? 
It is possible to have elected judges and to still maintain judicial independence. 
It is just the way in which the individuals are elected. 
We need to consider looking at changing our system of legal aid. 
Look at the public defender system. 
If we fail to act that will be our biggest crime in this House. 
Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
I know this member very sincerely believes in restorative justice.  
Could the hon. member advise me how this could be restorative justice?  
I know she believes in crime prevention. 
I was not privy to the previous discussion the member refers to. 
Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
The government has failed miserably on all three counts. 
They were questions about the terrible crime rates.  
The Canadian people have been saying do something to address crime. 
The government has failed miserably.  
They fled from the House. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
He keeps using phrases like fled from the House. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, the minister did have the opportunity to stay and answer the questions. 
She chose not to. 
She chose to not give unanimous consent.  
The Liberal government has continuously accused the Reform Party of fearmongering. 
That is what is scaring people, not the Reform Party.  
We talk about real life crime situations and things that are actually happening. 
When we talk about those things, this is reality. 
The government accuses us of fearmongering. 
The people are afraid of this government. 
That is what they are afraid of. 
They are afraid of the inaction that is happening with this government. 
It took well over a year to take some action. 
Day after day we asked her when she would bring it forward. 
There is no legislation. 
There are no changes to the Young Offenders Act. 
If ever there was a screwball idea in the justice system that was it. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there consent for that motion?  
Mr. Speaker, I would like to continue talking about conditional sentences. 
On December 10, 1998 the Ottawa Sun reported ``No jail term shocks victims''. 
I question once again the sanity of conditional sentencing. 
The fellow did no jail time. 
The man was convicted by Justice Cecilia Johnson of sexual exploitation. 
Something is wrong with this picture.  
People who are committing serious crimes are not spending any time in jail. 
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood-Assiniboine, Lib.):
They do it over and over again. 
What is that called? 
It is called fearmongering.  
We could spell it with capital letters.  
The member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley talks about conditional sentencing. 
He suggests that this is a terrible innovation in the criminal justice system. 
They are doing it again today. 
It is absolutely unacceptable.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The fact is that crime is happening, serious crime. 
He talks about our talking about the judicial system. 
Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. 
Those circumstances are the very circumstances these members are complaining about.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley.  
Mr. Speaker, this is absolutely amazing. 
That is where the mistake was made. 
We will never stop talking about the deplorable state of our justice system. 
We will never stop talking about the reality of the crime that is happening.  
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
I do not think young people do this in a vacuum. 
Most of them have parents and teachers. 
Perhaps they have support through sporting activities and their daily lives. 
They look like every other child on the street. 
They look the same as they walk down the street. 
They walk in groups and not in gangs. 
Most of them are wonderful children. 
The Reform Party never seems to want to stay and listen.  
My point is that a lot of good children are growing up healthy and responsible. 
I wanted to start with that premise.  
The vast majority of them get into trouble because they commit property offences. 
Canadians value and want a safe community to live in. 
They do not want to be fearful.  
That is important to understand.  
They correlate quite well. 
It just means that we must be doing something right. 
Something must be happening inside the system, inside society. 
A safe society, how do we accomplish that? 
And it means giving an individual in this country a chance to rehabilitate. 
Does that mean we ignore victims? 
I think back to situations where we did change those rules. 
We strengthened the rules with respect to DNA situations. 
We strengthened the rules with respect to gun control.  
We have a different set of values. 
People are not clones of one another. 
They come with their positives and their deficits.  
In fact many do.  
There are situations where we have good integration. 
There are provinces where there are gaps. 
We know from evidence. 
We have to divorce the perceptions from the realities.  
That is where there needs to be some financing. 
People often talk about costs and wastes in government. 
Eighty per cent of adult offenders will be on the street again. 
What do they learn while they are incarcerated? 
They learn about brutalization and anger.  
I have been in our penitentiaries. 
I am five foot one. 
There are sleeping accommodations and a toilet facility in the cell. 
It is not in line with the values of people.  
They regularly talk with me and voice their ideas. 
Alternate measures are much cheaper than incarceration, especially for juveniles. 
They are trying to figure out what created the problem. 
There is often a community working restitution order. 
As members of parliament we should be there as facilitators. 
In that way we can build the values.  
Some of those systems are there now. 
What I am saying is that Canadian youth are far from perfect. 
Our justice system is far from perfect. 
However those crimes are the minority.  
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
I think we all participate in that. 
I know I do. 
Some of them were young people. 
I commend this young woman. 
She has taken an initiative to tackle the problem.  
Should our laws act somehow as a deterrent to crime?  
They actually believe that. 
So that is just wrong.  
There is a misperception about the system. 
It is not sport.  
If I was really, really sick, I would want the best specialist I could get.  
I think that is important to remember in this debate.  
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
The First Nations people have the option of circle sentencing. 
That also makes the community responsible for that person. 
Can the member see that sort of situation becoming available to all of us? 
It does put a lot of responsibility on individuals to follow it through. 
Can the member see that?  
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for that excellent question.  
That is happening in my riding right now. 
It was an interesting partnership that started it. 
It is a very inexpensive thing to do. 
It is done mainly with volunteers and expert supervision.  
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
When the Liberals say we are extreme, they are just plain wrong. 
It is the failing system that is extreme. 
When are we going to have some legislation rather than continued reports and press releases?  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Quebec's expectations are incompatible with the perceptions of the rest of Canada. 
Need we add anything? 
I do not think so. 
This is the crux of the problem. 
The same conclusions are based on two completely different realities.  
I urge all colleagues in the House to support us in this undertaking.  
Before all else, we must think of these people, the innocent victims.  
I appreciate the verbal support of my colleague, the member for Richelieu.  
And others as well.  
And others as well who are with me in this august Chamber.  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague from the Bloc for his comments. 
That is very sad for me to hear that.  
We were in western Canada. 
I wonder if the hon. member would care to share the response of the authorities. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Crowfoot for his question. 
The hon. member referred to an editorial in The Gazette . 
That is, to put it mildly, an understatement.  
I believe the answer is yes. 
Do the facts justify that fear? 
Not as much, I think, as some would have us believe.  
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
The second question is of more general interest. 
We did not refuse.  
I hope the parliamentary secretary is listening carefully. 
We want a certified cheque. 
We don't trust you.  
It is simply a mechanism I proposed to remedy a legislative error.  
This motion does not propose something concretely unpalatable to any members of this House. 
Conditional sentencing is a recent development. 
It did not take effect until September 3, 1996, so the answer is no. 
``What are those purposes and principles? 
Those were the words of the justice minister in June 1995. 
He received an 18 month conditional sentence to be served in the community.  
We are not talking about fearmongering here. 
We are talking about legal precedents. 
The victims of these criminals deserve better. 
Imagine how this must feel to the victims of these crimes. 
Since he is not in jail he is able to strike again. 
The two fundamental reasons for sentencing are punishment and deterrence. 
They are immediately back out on the streets on a conditional sentence. 
The best source of income they know is to continue pushing drugs. 
There is certainly no deterrence. 
I ask that question to the government.  
The B.C. court of appeal agrees. 
it could have done so in clear language''.  
I believe we and this government have an obligation to do so. 
Let us not get into blame and partisan finger pointing. 
We owe that to Canadians and we owe that to the victims of crime. 
Canadian courts are already bogged down in legalities and appeals. 
Since parliament is responsible for initiating this ambiguity, parliament must also rectify the situation. 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
At the present time, I believe the legislation on parole protects the public. 
Does it protect enough? 
Can it be changed? 
We are therefore going to take a closer look at the accelerated review procedure. 
Whatever the case, the exception applying to drug traffickers is still not included.  
But this is a long time in coming. 
The government does not seem to be in any rush.  
Yes, in the end these are violent crimes.  
This is precisely why our appeal courts are so useful. 
As usual, the opposition is passing off the exception as the rule.  
I would like to say a word about the case law that is developing. 
Over 200 conditional sentences have been appealed since September 1996. 
I think that these citations should reassure the House. 
The court orders the offender to spend a certain period of time in prison. 
Trial courts have, for the most part, exercised their discretion with prudence. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased this afternoon to be able to speak to this motion. 
As I have said, members of the Conservative Party support the motion. 
I know that this particular section of the Criminal Code originated from this government. 
That is what lawyers are going to do when given the opportunity. 
I do not argue with that philosophy. 
We are becoming far too tolerant when it comes to offences of violence. 
The minister herself has said time and time again that this is a priority.  
That is not the way our criminal justice system should operate in this country.  
That was not the intent. 
It has to be corrected and it has to be done quickly.  
This is something that Canadians would want''.  
That, again I would emphasize, is the litmus test. 
Does it offend Canadians' sensibilities? 
Surely that is not the case. 
Unfortunately I am afraid that will not happen.  
No one should be getting a free ride in our justice system. 
As I said earlier, it is a halfway measure. 
That decision can be made by our correctional services. 
We are not saying to do away with conditional sentences altogether. 
That is not the intent of the hon. member's motion. 
It is to specify when it is appropriate to use them. 
That is the key issue here. 
In conclusion, the government has an opportunity. 
That is what we are here to do in the Chamber. 
We are here to make laws. 
We are here to make changes when they need to occur. 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
My comments in that speech are just as applicable here.  
In the meantime those Canadians affected are holding our justice system in disrepute.  
We all know of the damage done to our society by the sale of drugs. 
I will now move on to some sexual assault cases. 
A conditional sentence was applied.  
Surgery was likely required and she suffered serious psychological injuries. 
The experience had a very serious effect upon her life.  
More individuals will likely be victimized in the future.  
The concept of conditional sentencing is not at issue here. 
What is at issue is who should qualify to benefit from it. 
I urge the government to fix this problem immediately.  
Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):
This sentencing mechanism was introduced into Canadian law quite recently. 
I recall being in the House when it was introduced. 
I recall sitting on the committee when it was reviewed. 
There is always an exception to the rule in other words.  
I sense the possibility for change. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
She says it is.  
Why did she not tell us how many? 
Because if it is one, then it is one damn well too many.  
That is about all bloody well good this government is for, to monitor. 
I see I am about out of time. 
Yes there are always exceptions to the rule. 
That was one of the conditions. 
That is what conditional sentencing does. 
It imposes these harsh conditions on rapists.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would like that withdrawn.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
Canada is a pretty generous country. 
We are ranked number one in the world by the United Nations. 
They want all victims compensated.  
The Prime Minister presented a new twist to the compensation package the other day. 
The Prime Minister stated: 
The Prime Minister does not get the message. 
There is something wrong when that happens. 
I think all of us agree on that. 
When the Prime Minister clouds the issue there is something wrong with his thinking. 
What we are talking about is compensation for innocent victims.  
He is solely responsible for the safety of Canada's blood supply system. 
It is as simple as that.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
It serves the interests of all when we achieve it. 
It serves the interests of none if we fail.  
Leadership is best tested during difficult times. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Financial experts are uncertain as to what to advise their clients. 
These proposed changes were called the seniors benefit. 
The official opposition and other parties have asked many questions in this House. 
Still from this government there are only trial balloons, empty rhetoric and more foot dragging.  
I look forward to the answer.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That is what we have done. 
Now we are reviewing the proposal based on what we have heard. 
That is why an announcement has been delayed. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Fifty-six days later continuing silence. 
The community has already laid out its plan. 
Since 1939 what has this community received from the government? 
Lung cancer, bone necrosis, and rapid anaemia are possible''.  
While the community buries its dead the government tries to bury the tragedy. 
There are literally millions of tonnes of this poison buried in the region. 
It is in the water and the food chain. 
This community is now losing its elders to this tragedy.  
Where is the Minister of Health while people are dying? 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The next steps will be determined as our collaborative work with the community progresses.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
The Liberal majority on that committee voted it down.  
Here is what the Liberals want to do instead. 
Three of its members have already had to resign because of a conflict of interest. 
They were employees of the banks that want to merge.  
Who will benefit from the bank mergers and who will suffer? 
How many jobs will be lost and where will these jobs be lost? 
Small business is very worried about the future of banking sector. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The proposed mergers have the potential to fundamentally change our domestic banking sector.  
I invite the hon. member to participate.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.50 p.m.)
