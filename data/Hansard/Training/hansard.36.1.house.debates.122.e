BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 122 
Monday, September 21, 1998 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
SPECIAL INTEREST GROUPS FUNDING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT 
With your permission the hon. member will take five minutes at the beginning.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there unanimous consent to proceed in such a manner?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
There is not consent.  
I can tell the hon. member that I used his material.  
Let us bring this to debate so that Canadians will have accountability.  
We would not argue with that.  
It is hurting them because it is forcing them to pay higher taxes.  
This is not a witch hunt. 
It has to hire an administrator who is bondable. 
How can this government do that?  
They can actually take that money and use it for any political purpose they like. 
I noted a few things this summer. 
I met with several museum groups in my constituency. 
What are these people doing? 
It is happening all the time. 
Canadians all across Canada say it is wrong.  
What we need are regulations in place governing the funding of any organization. 
I sat as a CEO to a school division. 
The lack of accountability of the taxpayers' dollar should show up come next election time.  
If this uncontrolled industry continues, what will we find? 
If they can do it, why can we not do it? 
No one could muster up or find a defence.  
Mr. Tony Ianno (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):
Bill C-310 is not necessary. 
Contributions are conditional transfer payments. 
They are unconditional transfer payments. 
The opposite is in fact true. 
Furthermore, departments have established verification procedures. 
Many organizations maintain close relationships with the recipients. 
These principles remain valid today.  
The third consideration was the focus of the group's activities. 
In conclusion, I am satisfied that departments and agencies- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am afraid that the time has expired.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
That is why the Bloc Quebecois supports this bill.  
I am referring to Option Canada.  
It would appear that they were.''  
He established the following facts clearly:
So, who was being led down the garden path? 
I will let you be the judge.  
What are we to conclude from this adventure? 
That Option Canada had people like Guy Bertrand and Howard Galganov on its payroll? 
No one can answer these and many other questions. 
It must be mandatory.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
He is a colleague of mine on the Standing Committee on Transport. 
That would explain how the flaws came about. 
That is what this bill would do. 
These people give so much of themselves already. 
It is hardly fair to expect them to fill out even more forms.  
Think of the bureaucracy it would take to process the reports. 
If they do not see results, they can simply discontinue funding. 
Instead of serving themselves, they exist to serve others. 
I for one have experienced some of the things the member talks about. 
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
As members know, the program review process is in its final year. 
The purpose of this exercise would be to rethink the role of the State. 
The program review routine will be maintained.  
This was achieved with program review. 
If not, which programs or activities will be dropped?  
These are part of an appropriate regime of accountability.  
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
They are getting the basic simple premise of this bill confused. 
I will reread the intent of this bill. 
This is an issue of accountability.  
As members of parliament we are accountable. 
I asked for a copy of its expenditures. 
I did that and I am still waiting for the report. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
It did bring greater transparency, greater accountability to those groups involved in contributions. 
Bill C-310 should be supported. 
I support and endorse this bill one hundred per cent. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member for Wentworth-Burlington's giving support.  
That is what this bill is all about. 
That is why this is wrong.  
I am not talking about charities. 
This would change that. 
If they want to raise money let them go out and raise it themselves. 
I want to turn to what the hon. member did in his report. 
The hon. member said it is a system that has gone sour. 
I am glad some progress has been made in this. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The motions will be grouped for debate as follows: 
Motions Nos. 1 to 3. 
Group No. 2, Motions Nos. 4, 5, 7 and 8. 
Group No. 4, Motions Nos. 9 to 11. 
The Chair will remind the House of each pattern at the time of voting.  
I shall now propose Motions Nos. 1 to 3 to the House.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (for Ms. Francine Lalonde) moved: 
``interest, by any means whatever, make a representation to the public'' 
``(2) Subsection 52 (2) of the Act is replaced by the following:'' 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
But let us get back to the real issue. 
This is why we are proposing some amendments today.  
Thus, Bill C-67 died on the order paper.  
We must be very careful. 
We do not want to prohibit telemarketing here. 
The United States recognized the problem much earlier than did Canada. 
Some organizations are talking of losses of $40 billion for individuals. 
So this a significant phenomenon.  
One reason this is the case is the reduction in long distance costs. 
Telephones are now available reasonably everywhere.  
At first glance, going after deceptive telemarketing appears to be a good thing to do. 
Everyone agrees, including the members of the Bloc Quebecois. 
That strikes us as paradoxical.  
There are other paradoxes as well. 
Apparently to speed up the process, there is a series of fines. 
So then the matter becomes civil. 
Quebec's civil code differs from that of the rest of Canada. 
In our view, section 52 of the old Competition Act was preferable. 
It is the elderly who are most often the victims of deceptive telemarketing.  
People might think that the bill would offer better protection. 
On the contrary, we think that the bill is weakened by this provision. 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak on these motions today. 
I cannot support these motions. 
That is not the case.  
In particular it supported the approach contained in this bill.  
It is better protection to the consumers and will encourage greater compliance by business.  
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
The current procedure, however, is to insist that at least six individuals submit a complaint. 
This is not an unreasonable demand to place on the Canadian consumer. 
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
This is a practical solution that achieves several goals. 
The bill in its form does this. 
Critics may claim that this is a watering down of present legislation. 
The Progressive Conservative Party does not see it that way. 
In fact quite the opposite is true. 
This is an enlightened and reasonable approach to legislation. 
For that reason we cannot support the proposed amendments by the Bloc.  
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
Rather than weaken these provisions I think we should be toughening them. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
The official opposition supports this bill. 
We agree with the objective of this bill. 
The government has accepted all those amendments. 
Therefore we approve of the efforts by this government to modernize the Competition Act. 
In Group No. 1 the first motion and the third motion are unnecessary. 
Bill C-20 is aimed at addressing the telemarketing industry. 
It is more interactive. 
No doubt there is a need for some rules to be applied to Internet communications. 
The current procedure requires that at least six individuals submit a complaint. 
The purpose of this bill is twofold.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We should be addressing only the first three.  
The hon. member for Markham is quite correct. 
I believe there are other groupings that will be debated later.  
Perhaps hon. members can confine their remarks to the motions before the House.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on the same point of order. 
I have indicated that. 
He will now want to resume.  
It streamlines the approach to merger reviews. 
New provisions under Bill C-20 will address deceptive telemarketing practices. 
This bill addresses streamlining the merger process. 
The amount of information required will depend on the complexity of the merger. 
The government will have time to examine the critical merger proposal thoroughly. 
We have to stop all these practices. 
We must address these unfair practices and ensure fair competition. 
That is what all members of the House should be doing. 
We should work toward fair competition in the marketplace.  
The official opposition believes in a competitive market arena that serves consumers well. 
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
The parents do not want to tell because they feel embarrassed. 
We never hear about those cases.  
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
I am sure he will do just as good a job. 
I look forward to working with him over the course of the next year.  
All I really have to say is that I oppose the amendments.  
Is the House ready for the question?  
The question is on Motion No. 1. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The recorded division on Motion No. 1 stands deferred.  
The recorded division on this motion will also apply to Motion No. 3.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (for Mrs. Francine Lalonde) moved: 
``means the practice of using the internet or interactive tele-'' 
``internet or telephone communication, of the identity of'' 
That Bill C-20, in Clause 13, be amended 
(a) by replacing line 40 on page 11 with the following: 
``was not requested during the internet or telephone com-'' 
The hon. member for Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere.  
We will get used to it. 
What we are talking about here, of course, is fraudulent telemarketing. 
I am referring to the word ``knowingly''.  
How can we prove that someone does something knowingly? 
The legal provisions that deal with this issue are often challenged in court.  
This is very much a grey area. 
I think a better definition is in order.  
No one can oppose virtue. 
If the best legislation in the world cannot be enforced, it will be useless. 
We want our work to produce results. 
We do not want to take futile measures.  
This is what we are concerned about. 
We must try to make it easier to enforce.  
As for the Internet, I think it goes without saying. 
Many companies will do business through the Internet. 
This is already possible, but it will be done on a larger scale. 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
These are being actively pursued.  
This discussion was held at the industry committee.  
I have difficulty supporting this motion. 
I must emphasize that we do have legitimate telemarketers.  
It is for that reason we speak against the motion.  
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I got a little ahead of myself this morning. 
They should be opposed.  
That is largely absent in Internet communication.  
I would like to commend Industry Canada on this initiative. 
It deserves our support. 
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
It does not look very complicated to me.  
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
It needs to be done in a thoughtful manner with greater public involvement. 
This is an issue where the public demands to be heard. 
The Internet is necessarily a colder, more impersonal means of communication. 
It lacks the necessary characteristics to create trust and empathetic relations.  
At this time our priority must be telemarketing fraud.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, earlier I addressed the four groups together. 
Now we are on Group No. 2 of Bill C-20. 
Industry Canada deserves our support for this particular initiative. 
We know therefore it is not pressing at this time. 
Canada's high tech economy will become Internet dependent one day. 
The time will come when we have to address this issue. 
I agree 100% the Internet must be regulated. 
This issue should be studied at the steering committee.  
Bill C-20 is aimed at addressing the whole telemarketing industry itself. 
It is difficult for senior citizens to hang up sometimes.  
We should get on with passing this bill so that those people can be protected.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The recorded division on Motion No. 4 stands deferred.  
The recorded division will also apply to Motions Nos. 5 and 7. 
Mr. Antoine Dube (for Mrs. Francine Lalonde) moved: 
(i) a warranty or guarantee of a product, or 
(a) make a representation that is false or misleading in a material respect; 
However, the important points are not indicated.  
We consider these important points. 
This clarifies much of the bill which remains imprecise. 
If these points are not spelled out, this person will have a difficult task. 
Our aim in making these proposals is to improve the legislation.  
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I have difficulty supporting this motion.  
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
For these two reasons I would recommend that Motion No. 6 be opposed.  
Let us look at ways to try to eliminate that and make it easier.  
We need a balance between the protection of consumers and the freedom of business. 
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
It is important to add this kind of provision. 
It is a common practice amongst most legislation of this sort. 
It would add extra specificity to the section dealing with telemarketing practices. 
I would like to emphasize a point made by last the speaker. 
If the member wants to protect illegitimate business that is another matter. 
It seems to me that it is in everyone's interest.  
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Perhaps these amendments are reasonable. 
That is the purpose of our parliamentary committee work. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
I recently did a comparison. 
The government's response is regulate it. 
This seems to be the Canadian way, regulate everything in sight.  
I suggest what we need is less regulation. 
What are we talking about? 
We are talking about regulating competition. 
Why not repeal Newton's laws? 
Why not repeal the laws of supply and demand? 
Government can do it. 
Obviously it has the power to do it. 
That is what the government is intent on doing.  
By the way, competition is good for the consumer. 
What we talked about here in the House is regulating competition. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
There are four groups of amendments put forward by the hon. member for Mercier. 
So it should be the responsibility of the manufacturer and not that of the telemarketer. 
As the hon. member for Skeena has mentioned, we are talking about businesses. 
On the other side we are talking about consumers. 
The official opposition supports small businesses. 
But we know the red tape is too much for them. 
Government is always on the back of small businesses. 
The cost of doing business in this country is going up. 
We have to protect them immediately against telemarketing fraud.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Why would our party support this bill? 
This is an important point. 
We are suggesting that is going a little too far. 
The responsibility should be in the correct place and left with the manufacturer. 
This debt is sucking the lifeblood out of our country.  
We see the Liberals talking a little about debt and tax relief. 
Canadian taxes are the highest of the G-8 countries. 
This bill tries to make sure the purpose of communication is clear. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
I certainly share his concerns.  
Already the Competition Act is complex. 
Putting this amendment forth would provide the wrong direction for this legislation.  
That has been dealt with already.  
I believe that this motion is out of place here. 
The RCMP in two cases I know of dealt with this. 
This is not the way to deal with it. 
I will close by saying that I certainly cannot support this group. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The recorded division on the motion is deferred.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (for Ms. Francine Lalonde) moved: 
(a) the name and address of the person making the request; 
(d) a summary of the evidence supporting the allegations in the request; 
This person is going to report only to the Minister of Industry.  
When something is complex, it needs to be clarified. 
Some sense must be made of it. 
(1) A person, other than a corporation- 
(a) the name and address of the person making the request; 
(d) a summary of the evidence supporting the allegations in the request; 
I see the hon. member for St. Catharines on his feet. 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):
We offer our condolences to his family and his friends.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
At age 15 for most Canadian teens 
This summer was full of joy, 
A swimming hole, a trip away 
Brought smiles to girls and boys.  
But there is one young lad I know 
Who rode his bicycle cross this nation, 
He had a cause, a major task 
For him no relaxation.  
To keep his issue in our minds 
He ended his ride today.  
A giant of a lad is he 
It couldn't be much clearer, 
Is a genuine Canadian hero.  
Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):
This government has clearly demonstrated that it has the best interest of Canadians at heart.  
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Congratulations to all involved with this excellent initiative.  
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
I am sure that the upcoming year will be enriched by such resolve.  
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
And that is just too bad for Jean Charest.  
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, here we go again. 
Long live the separatists' version of democracy. 
It suits us just fine!  
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
What about the so-called united alternative? 
Reform MPs are not united. 
Canadians do not see them as being much of an alternative.  
The summer was not all bad. 
They managed to recruit a high profile Quebec separatist to their cause. 
I guess this means the marriage between- 
The hon. member for Bas-Richelieu-Nicolet-Becancour.  
Mr. Louis Plamondon (Bas-Richelieu-Nicolet-Becancour, BQ):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
We are talking about a deadbeat government when it comes to pay equity. 
We are talking about Liberal inaction in the face of huge bank mergers. 
The hon. member for Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington.  
Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, Lib.):
Like every other Canadian I want to see our athletes on the podium. 
I thank team Canada for the wonderful performances.  
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this story has been coming out in dribs and drabs. 
The Indonesian bodyguards were given the right to shoot Canadian demonstrators. 
The Prime Minister has a chance today to clear the air. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, Canadians want answers, not evasions.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Protesters were in areas where everyone could see them. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Canadians want to know why and what it was he said.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
That is how Canadians will find out the answers to the questions.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Why would that be?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the public complaints commission has existed for a long time. 
It has done very good work. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
It was an initiative of the federal government. 
We are in the process of negotiating. 
The leader of the Bloc Quebecois.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, it was not one of the premiers' demands. 
That was what they asked.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, provincial elections are going to be held soon. 
I can see the PQ and their little brothers, the Bloc Quebecois, are nervous.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
All the provincial premiers are unanimous on this. 
The Prime Minister is the only stubborn one.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
I am asking the Prime Minister:
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Today I ask the Prime Minister one simple question. 
Was it worth it?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Some people from other delegations were not comfortable. 
Some even protested to me because they saw some signs they did not like. 
It was a good example to the others to see that people can protest- 
The hon. leader of the New Democratic Party.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, an inquiry has begun on that. 
I have to repeat that we had 19 leaders in Canada. 
We had to offer them a secure place. 
There was room for protesters. 
It will conduct its inquiry. 
We will look at the report and advise.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, they do not know. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
This is a violation of her human rights, of her freedom of speech. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
That is why it is called the public complaints commission.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, we are not asking for the videotape.  
Does the Prime Minister confirm this statement?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, all the questions being raised are subject to this inquiry. 
As I said, I think we should let that inquiry do its job.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
That is the process in play. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we very clearly understand what the process is. 
The process is called cover-up. 
That is exactly what is going on in this case.  
I ask the hon. member to go to his question.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
He met with the Prime Minister today. 
The Prime Minister said ``Sorry, Joey. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We think we have seven provinces on side at this time. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We believe that when people in this country are sick, they require treatment, not payment. 
Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Mrs. Judi Longfield (Whitby-Ajax, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the President of the Treasury Board.  
The issue is very clear. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
It is time for action. 
We want action now, not six months from now. 
When is he going to wake up and realize that?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Throughout the whole last mandate we could count on it like clockwork. 
The only thing they want to do is get together and talk.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, look who is here. 
We have not seen him all summer. 
That is $1,500 per person, an incredible amount.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I want the member to know his constituents want me to say hello to him.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
It is important that we have public debate. 
I thought the member would support that.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I will take the minister up on his offer.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
What I do not understand is how the member can contradict himself. 
There really is a contradiction in the member's two questions.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Colleagues, I urge you to be very judicious in your choice of words.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
That review is being undertaken right now. 
That does a disservice to this exercise and to the truth.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
There is absolutely nothing to prevent the government from answering questions in the House. 
Why is he afraid to talk about this issue in this House? 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Ms. Colleen Beaumier (Brampton West-Mississauga, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
What is the significance of the 40th country's ratifying the Ottawa convention? 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
In other words, the land mine treaty has now become international law.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Saint-Maurice, Lib.):
I have to respect the constitution and I will not- 
We want to listen to the questions and the answers.  
Mr. Chretien (Saint-Maurice):
I am very proud that Doug Roche will be in the other house.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is not true. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Prime Minister.  
Human rights are not negotiable. 
When will the government stop violating the human rights of Canadians?  
I agree that a negotiated settlement would be the best way to solve that problem. 
The union has refused to propose to its employees- 
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
My question is for the Solicitor General. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Fredericton, Lib.):
The public complaints commission is going to get to the bottom of this. 
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia, Lib.):
It is further alleged that this is disrupting American grain prices and hurting American farmers.  
Is there a scintilla of truth to these allegations?  
Mr. Speaker, the allegations are not true. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, Canadians have just received some very alarming news. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That is what happened.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
The hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Ministers met with that group. 
It is about time the hon. member started recognizing the truth.  
ASIA PACIFIC ECONOMIC COOPERATION SUMMIT 
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
My question is an easy one. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
It would be completely inappropriate to discuss any of the details around that investigation.  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We will spare no effort. 
We will solve this mystery and put to rest their burning questions. 
They offered helping hands and a friendly ear. 
On behalf of the people of Canada I attended the memorial service in Halifax. 
They will take this precious memory back to their homes.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
We all hoped on the night of September 2 that survivors would be found. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
It is a stroke of fate to which we cannot remain indifferent.  
It was a very moving moment.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
While the sadness persists, there is also an element of honour. 
Efforts have been made to resolve this very real problem. 
I on behalf of my constituents will continue to work co-operatively in that regard.  
May God bless and comfort all of us.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Efforts continue to be made in the search for answers to this tragedy.  
I want to thank the Prime Minister for attending the special service. 
We really appreciate that, sir. 
To all of them, we say God bless them all.  
Under extraordinary circumstances, my colleagues, we sometimes take for us extraordinary measures. 
Will you please stand and join with me in a moment of silence.  
The House stood in silence ] 
I believe that is wrong. 
That is the object of the bill.  
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
The petition is too long to recite. 
It goes on to give hundreds of reasons to oppose the MAI. 
REDUCTION OF GAP BETWEEN RICH AND POOR 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
It states that these human rights abuses cannot continue.  
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
FOOD AND DRUGS ACT 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
The seven petitions are similar in form and content. 
Therefore I will refer to only one of them.

QUESTIONS PASSED AS ORDERS FOR RETURNS 
Question No. 85- Mr. John Reynolds: 
Question No. 98- Mr. Eric Lowther: 
*Question No. 88- Mr. Ted White: 
*Question No. 99- Mr. Jim Hart: 
*Question No. 100- Mr. Jim Hart: 
Safety and Health Reasons 
Canadian Forces personnel take pride in their uniforms. 
*Question No. 113- Mr. Ted White: 
*Question No. 115- Mr. Paul Forseth: 
Since 1996 CMHC has committed approximately $1 million to this area.  
I have three requests for emergency debates. 
I will deal with them in the following order. 
I have received letters from all three members and all three members are present. 
I will hear them one at a time.  
REQUEST FOR EMERGENCY DEBATE 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
I urge you, Mr. Speaker, to consider favourably this request. 
I thank my colleague from Winnipeg-Transcona. 
I received his letter about an hour and a half ago. 
I will now listen to the hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
I therefore ask that you give favourable consideration to my request for an emergency debate.  
I will now hear from the hon. member for Kootenay-Boundary-Okanagan.  
Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay-Boundary-Okanagan, Ref.):
Someone does have to look out for them.  
A point of order.  
I just want to check on one thing here.  
I address myself to the hon. member for Kootenay-Boundary-Okanagan. 
I have the letter in front of me and have of course listened very attentively. 
Now I will deal with the point of order.  
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
I would like to rebut some of the items the member from Levis mentioned earlier. 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
The current procedure, however, is to insist that at least six individuals submit a complaint. 
This is not an unreasonable demand to place on the Canadian consumer. 
Motion No. 11 is one that I strongly considered supporting. 
Consumers never benefit from creating a regulatory environment. 
That drives up the cost of business and places those costs on the consumer.  
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
The opportunity for abuse by a corporation with an axe to grind is brazenly apparent. 
As law makers we need to be setting an example here. 
Toward that end the Progressive Conservative Party will be voting no to these motions.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Finally we are debating Group No. 4. 
The government has accepted all those amendments. 
The Reform Party supports vigorous measures to ensure the successful operation of the marketplace. 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
That is what the bill is trying to do. 
Are we driving it home and achieving the results in the most cost-effective manner?  
We do not think it is a move in the right direction. 
It is not serving the Canadian taxpayer. 
Is the House ready for the question?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen : 
The recorded division on the motion stands deferred.  
And the bells having rung: 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
DNA identification is that type of tool.  
The murders must be committed separately. 
This is totally unacceptable.  
Bill C-3 provides a dangerous and unnecessary exemption. 
Think of the added security that this would mean to all Canadians.  
His criminal convictions date back to July of 1957 for break, entry, and theft.  
Under the proposed legislation this would be a secondary designated offence under section 487.04. 
Pursuant to proposed paragraph 487.05(1)(b), 
By this time Olson had already killed his first known victim.  
It is unlikely that authorization would have been sought in the first instance. 
However, many more opportunities presented themselves over the following years.  
Until 1980 there had been no primary designated offence for which he had been charged. 
Olson's first known murder victim died November 19, 1980. 
In April 1981 these charges were all stayed by the crown.  
The murders continued into August. 
This is very important. 
He continued before the committee: 
One is that violent sexual offenders progress through a pattern of other criminal activity. 
Submissions of the DNA profile upon charge affords the opportunity to address these concerns.  
Searching and cross-referencing, once the infrastructure is in place, will be relatively fast. 
Now we are at third reading. 
The police in our land are asking for help. 
It is really said.  
The government has this thing about the rights of the perpetrators. 
The public wants DNA testing. 
In the meantime they are not going to commit more crimes against humanity. 
There is no difference. 
The invasion of privacy has already taken place in the Criminal Code. 
It looks after that. 
Is there any difference at all? 
I do not see any difference. 
These blood bank files are not being exploited. 
Why would a DNA bank be any different? 
Why is the government afraid to take the next step? 
It will do it sooner or later. 
Why wait when there is so much that could be done?  
I go back to the Clifford Olson case. 
We could have saved some people from being murdered if this was in process then. 
It was not but we can stop other crimes from happening in the country.  
We all want to solve crimes. 
My party does not understand why the government is so upset with this.  
That is why we are here as legislators. 
We want to make better legislation. 
This piece of legislation is flawed and it needs some improving.  
I move, seconded by the member for Medicine Hat: 
The debate is on the amendment.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
I know they have said that on a number of occasions. 
We have to give the police the tools to work with. 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
There is not much point in doing it. 
The current state of the bill almost makes it ineffective and not that beneficial. 
The change the hon. member is calling for makes it worthwhile and effective. 
Mr. Speaker, my answer to that is what the police testified before the committee. 
It would have matched itself right away.  
The government talked about a cost of $4,500 to process all this stuff. 
I showed you some bloodstained cards. 
Here is a case of 15 to 20 minutes.  
That is what this is. 
DNA is life insurance for Canadian citizens.  
I had an interesting case today about people going through the system. 
He was ordered deported with his conviction. 
The system is failing. 
I use that as an example to match against the DNA. 
They know how to disappear very fast. 
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
First of all, I would like to address the question of sample retention. 
Bill C-3 provides for the storage of samples of bodily substances. 
For example, the RCMP will be responsible for the safe storage of all bodily substances. 
This is because the police must take other considerations into account.  
In addition, Canada's forensic laboratories are currently developing regulatory standards. 
Rarely is someone convicted on the strength of DNA evidence alone.  
Let us be quite clear on this point. 
The government must continue to act carefully, responsibly and thoughtfully in this respect. 
Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):
The question I have for my colleague concerns the innocent person. 
He talks about protecting the rights of innocent people. 
I know a lot of police officers in police forces across this country. 
They obviously have some strong evidence in order for them to make that arrest initially.  
It is almost an ironclad guarantee with the use of DNA evidence.  
I would ask my colleague that very simple question. 
It is very, very simple. 
The only condition that there must be to fulfil it is to get a warrant.  
That is a fundamental philosophy.  
You may also differ with me, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
I know he has received a copy of it as all members have.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
I do not believe judges should be making political statements either. 
The charter of rights allows us to fingerprint people. 
If people get arrested their fingerprints are taken. 
Why does the member think this would be any different? 
It is a very simple thing to do. 
It does not affect anyone's rights. 
It certainly will save a lot more people. 
Our fingerprints are taken for a passport. 
We do a lot of things in life. 
I would not mind having my DNA somewhere either.  
Mr. Speaker, there is one thing I would like to understand.  
When we take fingerprints we take a picture of a finger. 
It does not reveal anything else but identity based on a picture. 
DNA is much more revealing than simply a picture.  
The likelihood of the occurrence of a genetic sickness, for example. 
I do not want to get into a debate on that. 
It is much more revealing. 
My colleague is right. 
This balanced approach and interpretation of the charter must be maintained. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
I am pleased as well, Mr. Speaker, to see you back in the chair.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I apologize to the hon. member for interrupting his speech. 
I wish to designate tomorrow as an opposition day.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
As I indicated before we are in support of the bill in principle. 
It seems absolutely asinine that we would pass up this opportunity. 
Is that not what it is all about? 
Should we not be doing everything in our power to try to prevent crime?  
We are talking about the use of exculpatory evidence.  
Why would we want to discourage that from happening?  
Certainly the solicitor general and this Liberal government should be able to recognize that. 
I would like to address that momentarily.  
This is the standard that is applied universally in our justice system. 
I am not going to cast aspersions on that opinion. 
There are safeguards in place. 
I would emphatically suggest that we have to move forward. 
It would not surprise me if the opinion had come back the other way. 
This is part of the process. 
There are safeguards in place within this piece of legislation.  
I commend it for its decision to introduce DNA. 
It is extremely useful. 
It is absolutely vital to furthering the cause of justice in this country.  
This legislation in its current form does not go far enough. 
It is something worth discussing in this chamber, in this public forum.  
On behalf of our party, we support this amendment. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this is a very important debate that we are having today. 
Obviously, the committee has heard all of the different witnesses. 
That is what I have been gathering here. 
I would like him to clarify that.  
Perhaps I can have the member respond to those two questions.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his questions. 
Perhaps I will respond to the last one first.  
I did attend faithfully those committee hearings when this discussion took place.  
That threshold of reasonable and probable grounds and evidence has then been met. 
There is sufficient evidence to lay a charge. 
That is the standard which all peace officers in this country must meet. 
Having a DNA sample only furthers that. 
I am publicly here chastising them. 
Why are they sitting on their duffs? 
This is an important issue. 
Let us get with it here. 
Let us do something about it. 
Let us make sure this bill is handled correctly.  
One might ask is that intended to kill it. 
No, it is just the opposite. 
It is true the Liberals have a majority. 
It is a small one. 
They want a smaller level of error in those things.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his comments. 
I am not going to say that definitely indicates a lack of interest. 
I do not think it does but it is somewhat disappointing. 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Clearly the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to this amendment. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I was listening to the remarks of the member for Elk Island. 
There is something more than crime prevention here. 
This is something that I hope to address in my own remarks. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am glad that finally we woke up one Liberal over there. 
That is a much greater invasion. 
One can give a DNA sample by very simple means compared to that. 
We want this to fly but we want it to be an effective system.  
Maybe we should start abridging their rights. 
Certainly an accused person has a right to a fair and speedy trial. 
A person charged has that right. 
It would be a valid part of reducing crime. 
This is something we have to give second thought to.  
I will make one final comment. 
This is big brother. 
This is the new world order. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
I feel that is simply a major step backward in the fight against crime.  
I listened to the arguments by the member for Wentworth-Burlington. 
That is just an elementary goal. 
That is something elemental about the whole justice system. 
It is supposed to be something that does exactly that.  
It would make about as much sense. 
Even elected officials of a school board know of their own abilities and authorities.  
I think the police officers were referred to as an interest group. 
You bet they are an interest group. 
That is going on too much in this country. 
They will pull the string and they will vote the way they are told. 
There are not many but there are a few and I thank them for that.  
Look at another paragraph from this letter. 
It states ``This issue is paramount to Canadian police officers and by virtue the CPA. 
I would encourage everybody in this place to stop and think about it. 
It will cost extra billions of dollars to put into place. 
I do not know if that is necessarily true. 
Let us do the right thing.  
That brought out quite a cheer from a lot of people. 
I know it meant a lot to the Manning family.  
The mechanisms were there.  
However, we are not willing to pay attention. 
Let us not judge too quickly that that will not be the case.  
We are working on phase two of this legislation. 
Their victims certainly have. 
We do not always have to listen to the lawyers and the judges. 
They are not the only smart people in Canada. 
There are a few more around. 
I hope they take the time to check who they might be. 
Let us please not pass this bill at third reading. 
I encourage hon. members to think about it.  
Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):
I would like to ask the opinion of the member for Wild Rose on this. 
I want to know from my colleague from Wild Rose if that is his opinion. 
Madam Speaker, I certainly do agree with that. 
It would be extremely effective.  
That is our plight. 
A statement was wanted before they asked their question.  
Someone who is willing to do it should be sent here instead.  
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
I have been listening to the debate and it is certainly food for thought.  
I also think it is odd. 
We are trying to balance various rights and privileges here.  
How can we decide when the CPA is right? 
Is there a quick way of determining that?  
There are experts out there. 
We do not know what all the answers are. 
Sometimes even the experts foul up. 
There is no doubt in my mind.  
Let us throw it out there and give them the opportunity. 
I appreciate the member listening seriously to the debates. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
I listened very intently to the comments made by the hon. member for Wild Rose.  
I received a comment in that vein very recently. 
This is something, again, that has to be taken into consideration.  
I think that is an important backdrop here. 
There is no guarantee that will happen. 
In British Columbia alone there are over 600 unsolved murders. 
The use of technology to have closure on those matters is extremely important.  
He said what needs to be said.  
It is so important and the listening part has to happen.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I am delighted to speak on this particular amendment to the bill. 
DNA identification is that kind of tool.  
The Reform Party fully supports the creation of the DNA databank. 
Bill C-3 does not grant our police forces full use of DNA technology. 
This is where fingerprints are taken. 
This is exactly the time to take DNA samples. 
This is a needlessly restrictive use of DNA in Bill C-3. 
It does not go far enough and we must not be fooled. 
It is an inadequate piece of legislation and we cannot support it.  
On the first page it reads: 
The CPA has lobbied for the creation of a DNA databank for many years. 
Do not underestimate the importance of this issue to the CPA. 
We will do that again regarding Bill C-3. 
This is not an issue to play politics with. 
The Liberal government is supposed to be responsible for shaping our justice system. 
This is the government of the day. 
Canadians are relying on the government but the government is just sitting on its hands.  
The safety of our society is a secondary issue for this Liberal government. 
DNA samples are conclusive if processed carefully and correctly. 
During the summer I did some door knocking in my constituency. 
This Liberal government is spineless, heartless, gutless, deaf and blind. 
Everyone knows that the government is not getting tough on crime.  
My constituents and I are warning this government to get tough on crime. 
We want it to do the work that is necessary to protect our society. 
Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):
When I campaigned in 1997 that was one thing I took note of in Saskatoon. 
Saskatoon is number three on the crime list in Canada. 
What steps could the Liberal government take in order to get tough on crime?  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for asking this question.  
They probably could have put a stop to the murders before more were committed. 
He was on the loose and we could not convict him. 
Why are we not giving such an innovative and modern tool to police forces? 
Who are we afraid of? 
Are we afraid of the violent criminal? 
Do we not want to protect the rights of the victims?  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Basically it curtails the ability of police to do their job effectively. 
It can lead to the flight of criminals who have not gone to trial.  
I want to be honest and straightforward.  
Let me give an example. 
What good is the gun?  
We have given the fingerprint tool but why not DNA identification? 
The Canadian Police Association is asking for it. 
Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):
We went down there for what I think is a very important reason. 
Jim is as interested in reforming the criminal justice system as I am. 
From that perspective I am glad we live in Canada.  
We had an appointment with an academic in his office. 
That is what he was. 
We could tell he had something to say. 
We spent about two hours in his office. 
I obtained a book down there of case studies from both sides of the coin. 
I applaud the government for bringing this issue to the House of Commons. 
However that is as far as I can applaud the government. 
I want to use a good example that is very well known in Canada. 
We now have another person who is to stand trial for that murder.  
No one would argue with that except lawyers and the odd Liberal.  
I have spoken with the victims. 
I was at the committee meetings that were held on this bill. 
I do not see anyone who really seems to care.  
I will not stand here today and say that the opposition parties are always right. 
We are not perfect. 
That is a systematic problem and one that needs to be changed very quickly.  
I think about this in the same way I think about a breathalyzer test. 
Obviously we use blood samples. 
Therefore that argument does not wash with me. 
I think the government is on track on that part of the bill. 
I do not argue with that.  
That is great and so it should be. 
No one in this House I believe would ever argue that point. 
Therefore that argument does not wash.  
The argument that does wash with me is the protection of people. 
I do not think it will happen overnight. 
Our social system is in such a state that it could perhaps get worse. 
We have to take every step in order to protect people down the road.  
They know that DNA evidence and the use of it is available. 
Everybody should have a token lawyer. 
There is no question about that. 
I want to sum up what I have said. 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Whose privacy are we actually talking about? 
We are talking about the privacy of people who have been indicted. 
The police do not indict someone without good cause. 
They would not put those children at risk again.  
This is the key difference. 
Are we going to protect citizens as we have been elected to do? 
The Liberal approach is just not working. 
They are not seeing it as a deterrent. 
It has become a laughing stock.  
They are on the front lines. 
They hear the stories. 
They see the broken lives. 
They have to live with the tragedies. 
They have to pick up the pieces.  
Mr. Speaker, may I just ask at this point how much time I have left?  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
The privatization of CFB Goose Bay has caused considerable hardship. 
Close to 200 workers were not rehired by SERCO. 
Six additional sites have been designated to go through the alternate service delivery process.  
How committed is the government to this process? 
The workers of these bases have a right to know what their goal is. 
The financial security of entire families hangs in the balance. 
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Our question addressed this, and is still pertinent today. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Projects approved to date are expected to create over 31,000 sustainable jobs. 
The transitional jobs fund is under review. 
After that review is completed a decision will surely be made.  
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6:55 p.m.)
