BUSINESS OF THE SENATE 
The Hon. the Speaker:
I wish you all welcome back on this occasion.  
The Hon. the Speaker:
Premier Tobin is also accompanied by some ministers from his cabinet.  
The Hon. the Speaker:
Sheila Finestone, P.C. 
Ione Christensen, C.M. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
In part it reads: 
To no one will we sell, to no one deny or delay right or justice.  
That, honourable senators, is the wonderful privilege of public service.  
The Yukon is truly a land of mystery and a land of magic. 
"Where are the Newfoundlanders?" 
"Please prepare me measures whereby 1,000 may be sent at once." 
This flag, the French tricolour with a yellow star, is a symbol of national pride.  
It was once said that a teacher affects eternity. 
He or she can never tell where his or her influence will stop. 
As a young Metis, he knew personally the hopes and dreams of our First Nations. 
He knew the secrets only our First Nations truly understood. 
They had paddled the wilderness waters and knew the pain of the portage. 
They were the key to a vital part of our national identity. 
Her personal success has been based on some pretty timeless truths. 
Isobel has always given a little more than she had to. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition):
Honourable senators, I rise on a question of privilege. 
If there is unanimous consent, I will proceed with this matter tomorrow.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
At the appropriate time tomorrow, we will proceed with the question of privilege.  
In Memory of Passengers and Crew of Swissair Flight 111 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall:
It was a human tragedy of unimaginable magnitude for our quiet and somewhat peaceful province.  
To the families, I once again extend my heartfelt sympathy. 
He was finishing his last year of medical school. 
Day after day, hour after hour, he had the responsibility of waiting, hoping, and administering.  
That knowledge will save lives at another time and in another place.  
Tribute to Allan McLean 
Yesterday, we celebrated the labour of Canadians, their hard work and their dedication. 
Nor did he win a Nobel prize. 
Al is not really shy. 
Al and his wife Shirley have two children, Tracey and Kirk.  
Al is retiring from his job at the Toronto-Dominion Bank. 
Shirley worked for the Dominion Bank. 
Al and Shirley met and they married shortly thereafter.  
Everyone who has come in contact with Al loves him. 
He has been a hard-working, dedicated employee and friend to many. 
In all that time, he took only 11 sick days.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I regret that the honourable senator's time has expired.  
Your Honour, I request leave to continue.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted for Senator Tkachuk to continue?  
He was the last remaining Bank of Toronto employee on staff.  
May life be long and enjoyable. 
May we continue to be inspired. 
Thirteenth Pan-American Games-Tribute to Volunteers and Citizens 
Manitobans can be particularly proud of this achievement. 
To them we owe a great gratitude.  
We especially thank the athletes who made the games possible.  
The private sector showed superb participation.  
Congratulations to Organizers of Meeting in Moncton, New Brunswick 
Canadian Environmental Protection Bill, 1999 
Report of Committee-Request for Further Instruction 
The Hon. the Speaker :
This motion was subsequently passed by a majority of the committee: 
Honourable senators, I came here at twelve o'clock today. 
Obviously, no one was here to receive it. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Leave was granted to hear the Honourable Senator Ghitter. 
Is leave granted to hear other honourable senators?  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I am unable to hear any other speakers in that regard. 
Is that agreeable, honourable senators?  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
We have graciously given our consent to Senator Ghitter to speak. 
We know who has the majority; however, we must do things according to the rules.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, we gave leave to honourable Senator Ghitter. 
Senator Kinsella spoke without leave. 
Then why do we have this motion?  
Then Senator Spivak says: 
I am sure you are right.  
We were working out a timetable for the committee's work. 
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
We knew that, and Senator Ghitter knew that at the time. 
He is splitting hairs. 
Senator Ghitter is grasping at straws.  
That permission was not granted in June.  
That is the way the matter stands.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Rule 98, on page 104 states: 
It states that the bill is to be reported to the Senate. 
During the debate on the motion in committee, Senator Kenny said: 
He indicated that other senators agreed with that proposition.  
The committee would only be concluding its business at noon. 
Is the motion carried?  
The motion carried on division.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, the chickens have come home to roost here. 
We were then presented with this motion. 
It is really quite simple. 
The English language is not that difficult. 
There is no magic in it.  
I submit that the matter is easily resolved. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, it is now six o'clock. 
Is it your wish that I not see the clock?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I have not yet been asked to rule. 
The matter is not in my hands; it is before the Senate. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is there a disposition to accept that proposal?  
The report is available and he has copies of it.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I cannot accept that motion. 
It would require notice.  
The Hon. the Speaker:
Public Sector Pension Investment Board Bill 
Tuesday, September 7, 1999 
The Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce has the honour to present its 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
With leave, honourable senators, later this day.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave is granted, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
There is no leave.

Hon. Norman K. Atkins:
Plight of Chinese Immigrants on West Coast 
Canadian Environmental Protection Bill, 1999 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition):
Honourable senators, my question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
I have read the act, honourable senators. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I shall certainly undertake to do so. 
I thank Senator Kinsella for bringing the matter to my attention.  
Air Canada-Private Sector Proposal-Request for Details 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition):
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau:
My question in fact concerns the summit. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I am not aware of who was responsible for compiling the invitation list. 
I was not aware that he had not been invited. 
I shall make further enquiries. 
I do not believe that anyone would be excluded deliberately. 
I think that it was probably an error of omission.  
On behalf of the government, I hasten to apologize. 
I shall make the appropriate enquiries.  
I was aware of this delegation. 
The PMO was aware. 
The word from the Prime Minister was not to meddle in this. 
No, I certainly was not aware of the decision. 
Nova Scotia's parliamentarians also want to take part in the talks. 
I would ask you to remember that in future.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Now there is another example of a culture of violence. 
What is the determining factor with respect to when Canada will act in such cases?  
Honourable senators, I wish to assure the honourable senator that Canada is acting. 
As I indicated, we are making special representations at the United Nations. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall:
I have the following questions:
If it has, where will these troops come from? 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I will be happy to bring in a report as soon as one is available.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall:
Honourable senators, I should like this to be clear:

Business of the Senate 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government):
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, the honourable senator was kind enough to consult with the independent senators. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
