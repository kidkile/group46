Business of the Senate 
Thursday, February 26, 1998 
The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
The Honourable Richard J. Doyle 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Attendance is attainment; absence is abdication.  
Take Senator Doyle, for instance. 
He was an active and conscientious member of the Joint Committee on Free Trade. 
He was an active and conscientious member of the Standing Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs. 
He was - but enough. 
Just look at his background. 
Somerset Maugham once wrote of conscience as being the guardian of community rules. 
Senator Doyle was the guardian of ours.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Show business was never Senator Doyle's style. 
Bruce Hutchison once called the creation of a daily newspaper a daily miracle. 
We will not hold that against him.  
Senator Doyle went on to work with Howard Webster - 
Who was not a true Grit.  
Senator Graham : - succeeding the great Oakley Dalgeish as editor. 
That was a job for commentators, he said. 
The educated public would vote as it pleased without editorial advice.  
On that issue, as on some others, he has enlightened this nation and this chamber. 
Senator Doyle, you have made a very significant contribution to the work of this place. 
His prose also has a special place in my files. 
We were privileged to be allowed to be part of them.  
None of that matters. 
Many were startled by this appointment. 
Honourable senators, we have shared duties. 
I thank him profoundly for that. 
I will miss him very much. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Perhaps it was penance for some unpublished deed.  
The following is a passage from Seneca:
Perhaps this is the lesson he has been struggling to teach me.  
The Editor sat in the Editor's chair; 
Paper and pen and ink were there; 
(Not in the chair: that wouldn't be fair 
On the table round 
They lay; and the Editor looked and frowned, 
And carking care, and black despairs 
seemed settled for good as the Editor's share; 
On trousers and boots, pulled out by the roots, 
Were crumpled-up masses of Editor's hair!  
(Which meant what only the Editor knew), 
`By all that's blue, if ever anew' 
Ere ever again I proof such a flat; 
For nobody cares how the magazine fares, 
Or what trouble the Editor anguishes through!  
To you, my friend, God's speed:
Hon. Philippe Deane Gigantes :
I worked for him back in 1956, 42 years ago. 
Any of the faults that you have seen in me since then are not his. 
He did not teach me any of my bad habits.  
He made it what it became. 
She was - and is - so enchanting. 
She did not seem to mind. 
I have long admired him, and I still do. 
You are a great guy.  
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
We will all miss your wisdom and your wit.  
Hon. Therese Lavoie-Roux :
His appointment was applauded by all. 
A Time at the Globe , to which reference was made earlier. 
Senator Doyle was also appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1983. 
His talents as editor have also been of profit to the Senate. 
The sentence, as I recall, read: 
You have so many talents. 
Dic, thank you for everything.  
I wish you well. 
You will certainly be greatly missed, as many have said before.  
But, as the song says "We'll meet again." 
We will be seeing each other soon.  
Senator Doyle was already sitting on that committee. 
His speeches here have always been very interesting.  
We need people like him on every committee and in the Senate.  
If you ask me, Senator Doyle will be a hard man to replace.  
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Like Senator Fairbairn, a slight crush was developing on Senator Doyle. 
He kept it for all senators.  
There are many examples of good senators in this chamber. 
I wish him well. 
Hon. Richard J. Doyle :
Honourable senators, you have heard what I have heard. 
You have heard the evidence; so I say to you:
You have heard one and now you will hear another.  
If the heart should explode, or the bladder splatter, I was sitting pretty.  
Did I say "men"? 
My wife goes further than that. 
I am indeed a fan of Joyce Fairbairn. 
In this place, we should seek the truth and pray for justice. 
Brian Mulroney is the man who "brung" me to this house of opportunities. 
Don Oliver makes me stop and think. 
Gerald Beaudoin is the university I never attended. 
Michael Meighen is the link with party heritage. 
Norman Atkins and I mourn the passing of the same lost causes.  
My good friend Duncan Jessiman remains in the Senate until early summer. 
At that time, he will be unceremoniously kicked out like the rest of us. 
I leave with a confession for my whip - the party loyalist, Senator DeWare. 
What's more, I like Al Graham and I admire John Stewart. 
Marjorie LeBreton and I, for some time now, have been publishing an underground newspaper. 
"What a fine lot they are," said he, and the lot of us agreed.  
I must mention my old committee adversary, Senator Colin Kenny. 
I have been charged to do this. 
A family tree surgeon tells me that Colin and I might be cousins. 
Will my debts to Brian Mulroney never be paid!  
Canadian Wheat Board Act 
Bill to Amend-Second Reading 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this be read the third time?  
Committee Authorized to Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
Leave having be given to proceed to Motion No. 57: 
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson , pursuant to notice of February 25, 1998, moved: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
On behalf of all senators, I wish you welcome to our Senate chamber.  
The Honourable Stanley Haidasz, P.C. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
In the country of the blind, the one-eyed man is king. 
Natalie is in the gallery with their extended family today. 
Shall we judge a country by the majority or by the minority? 
"By the minority, surely," said Ralph Waldo Emerson. 
As a member of Parliament, Stanley represented a tiny microcosm of the planet itself. 
Many had lost everything. 
They came to Canada with hope and commitment. 
All sought a better life and new beginnings. 
Today, we see a free Poland evolving from an unhappy past. 
Stanley, you kept the struggle alive in the darkest hours. 
Your work has kept the one-eyed king in permanent exile. 
Senator Haidasz, you are truly a man of passion, principle and conviction. 
You have made an enormous contribution to this chamber. 
You will be missed. 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
During all these years, he has been faithful to his constituents and to his beliefs.  
My boyhood friends were principally of Polish, Ukrainian and Baltic backgrounds.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The special guest of the day was Senator Haidasz.  
They knew about his contribution to their community, nationwide. 
I will end my tribute on a humourous note. 
Apparently in his early youth, he had spent a year in the noviciate. 
Hon. Wilbert J. Keon :
Honourable senators, I, too rise to pay tribute to our honourable colleague Stanley Haidasz. 
Hon. Richard J. Stanbury :
Unfortunately, no one in the Toronto area survived the second Diefenbaker sweep.  
That is not the whole story!  
Those have already been mentioned substantially. 
I also know how deep is Stan's devotion to the members of his family.  
Our very warm personal wishes to Senator Haidasz and to his entire family.  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Senator Haidasz's achievements and contributions are numerous. 
He is a good man, a kind man, and a noble man.  
Senator Haidasz's devotion to his church, the Roman Catholic Church, is well known. 
Senator Haidasz's force of conviction is to be admired by all of us. 
He was also Canada's first minister of multiculturalism.  
It may be said that Senator Haidasz did much for many people. 
It may be said that he served God, Queen, and country.  
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Hon. Philippe Deane Gigantes :
There is something else for which I would thank him. 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
We also shared another interest. 
He and I have deep but different roots in Poland. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
However, I want to tell Senator Doyle that I appreciate having known him. 
I wish him a nice time with his family.  
Senator Haidasz, I wish you the best of retirement. 
I know you will enlighten us by continuing with your writing. 
Having said that, I want to pay tribute to a man I know better. 
I know he ran in 1957 and was elected. 
Someday, you will have to write about this.  
We were sure to go to election in 1978. 
I learned a lot from him. 
Senator Haidasz has done that in his own way. 
He has always been that kind of light.  
I thank him for that. 
He is an example to those who have problems affirming their faith.  
You knew my father. 
He was a doctor, and he delivered 9,000 babies. 
That has nothing to do with the debate on abortion. 
We should protect people. 
You can leave and rest, come back anytime, and be well received by us. 
However, other senators will continue the work you have started. 
I wish you the very best. 
Everyone was wondering about the new member. 
Please, come back and see us. 
My office is yours at any time.  
I am deeply thankful for these wishes.  
Mention was made by Senator Carstairs of my year as a noviciate. 
It was dark here because there was nothing going on in the evening. 
However, there was something going on in the other place. 
That was my first and only visit to this chamber.  
I had other ideas and other duties. 
However, I do not regret that somehow or other I was steered into politics. 
It was a great education.  
I wanted to do something. 
C.D. Howe had promised him he would be the justice minister. 
I did not return until 1962. 
I was also friends with his future wife. 
Nonetheless, these things happen.  
I only had three secretaries. 
She was the second one. 
I really entered politics to bring in medicare. 
I was pushing my minister, Judy LaMarsh. 
I was her parliamentary secretary.  
Then there was Allan J. MacEachen, the father of medicare. 
I also wish to pay tribute to the other ministers who followed me. 
Many were from the party opposite. 
I came to know them well and to love them. 
I am sorry to see that they are unhappy. 
Thank you for your assistance and counsel. 
Bear with me if you see me again.  
The New Civil Code of Quebec 
We are talking about political bribery. 
But why talk about it in a book? 
My employees are going to read that and say: 
He was a bloody thief. 
He paid out money to buy contracts.  
That is not the image I want to present.  
That is how Mr. Michaud put it in his delicate way.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I am sorry, but I have to interrupt. 
Is this matter currently before the courts? 
In this respect, let me quote Citation 505 of Beauchesne, which states: 
If that is the case, I would ask you not to continue.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
I would like to tell you about the life of Jacques Cartier. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
We understand why you say no.  
I will raise a point of order at the first opportunity.  
The Honourable Lucien Bouchard-Politics in Quebec 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Regrettably, contradictions continue to abound.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
It has not been decided yet.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
According to his thesis, equal treatment is not applicable. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted for the honourable senator to continue?  
Yet the contradictions continue. 
The Late W.O. Mitchell, P.C. 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
He could find absolutely no sponsor for that bill.  
And that was his absolute right.  
Certain incidents have been raised, by Senator Cools among others. 
We, however, question such behaviour.  
Second Report of Standing Joint Committee Tabled 
Hon. Celine Hervieux-Payette :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration 
Thirteenth Report of Committee Presented 
Thursday, February 26, 1998 
Professional and Special Services $ 3,570 
All Other Expenditures 18,285 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Tobacco Industry Responsibility Bill 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Delayed Answers to Oral Questions 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
(Response to question raised by Hon. Ethel Cochrane on February 10, 1998) 
Wheat Board-Amount of Unpaid Balance Owing-Government Position 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson on February 12, 1998) 
All countries with the exception of Iraq are current on their repayments.  
(Response to question raised by Hon. Mira Spivak on February 18, 1998) 
Seniors' health will continue to be addressed using this approach.  
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration 
Twelfth Report of Committee of Committee Adopted 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Ninth Report of Committee Adopted 
The percentage is set at the beginning of each year by the Treasury Board. 
For the Senate, this translates into an increase of $1,106,000.  
These new costs add at least 1.2 per cent to our 1997-98 budget.  
Honourable senators, this is not a perfect budget from the Senate's point of view. 
There are many areas which will continue to be underfunded. 
What, then, are the significant changes in this 1998-99 budget? 
In the House of Commons, recognized political parties are provided with special funding. 
Are Canadians getting value for this money? 
Honourable senators, I ask you to support the adoption of this report. 
To all of you, I express my deep appreciation.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I have a question of clarification. 
The chairman's speech just now provided a great deal more detail. 
Some of us did not get a copy of it. 
When was that detailed report circulated? 
The detailed report has yet to be circulated. 
I do not recall whether this has been the practice in the past. 
Hon. John B. Stewart :
Honourable senators, I have a question. 
I can only repeat what I said before, Senator Stewart. 
I understood that Senator Kenny wants to speak. 
Perhaps he could provide more information that would enlighten us.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Afterwards, I will not be able to entertain questions to Senator Rompkey.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I will read again the pertinent part from the remarks I just made.  
Honourable senators, I would like to pose a question. 
Yes, I would like to confirm that.  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
I did see a document and inquired of its meaning. 
However, I have no assurance that this will be done.  
I do not know. 
I wish to know more before I give my consent. 
Senators may do what they wish; however, I can also object.  
I had to discern what the item of concern to me might be. 
I should like to have a response to my query.  
No decision will be taken until there is adequate discussion within the caucuses.  
I am happy with the rest of the budget. 
However, that particular item merits further clarification and discussion. 
Is the Chair prepared to entertain my proposal?  
Clearly, it merits full discussion in both caucuses and in the chamber. 
Honourable senators, I wish to be very clear:
That is fine, but it confirmed what I had done before. 
Earlier this afternoon, I was given that line.  
Members of both parties do not agree as to the redistribution of that money. 
I do not know how the other independent senators feel. 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
We discussed the case of independent senators several times in committee. 
Unfortunately, you were not present during these discussions. 
The problem is finding the best way to do so. 
I cannot be told simply that I was not at the committee. 
Please be advised that I am not a member of any committee.  
I certainly have something to offer. 
I am not against it, per se. 
There is a notional amount in there. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Hon. Eric Arthur Berntson :
Honourable senators, this debate was adjourned by Senator Kinsella yesterday or the day before. 
Last night we had a fairly lengthy committee meeting. 
The decision will be made at that time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Rights of the Unborn Child 
Motion to Establish Special Joint Parliamentary Committee-Debate Adjourned 
Hon. Stanley Haidasz , pursuant to notice of February 12, 1998, moved: 
Hence, I am introducing this motion. 
This motion, therefore, is meant to replace the abdication of the government in this area. 
Thank you very much for your patience. 
Adieu and God bless you in your deliberations.  
Hon. John B. Stewart :
Honourable senators, I should like to ask Senator Haidasz a question.  
On Bill C-43?  
There is no law regarding the protection of the foetus. 
Have the people who were adamantly against abortion changed their position? 
Will we go through the same exercise, with the same frustration at the end? 
The social workers took her to court. 
There was a third case, also.  
The court has asked us on three different occasions to bring in some legislation.  
This motion covers that issue. 
We need some solution to declare the rights of the foetus.  
No one has taken up the challenge. 
Hon. Philippe Deane Gigantes :
My interpretation is that someone should take the initiative to study this matter. 
New reproductive technology is a burning issue. 
Parliament has done nothing. 
Will we abdicate our powers of legislating? 
That is my challenge.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition :
Mine is from a federal-provincial perspective.  
Therefore, there have been serious federal-provincial negotiations on this convention. 
Millions of dollars were spent on the study of reproductive technologies. 
The government has not issued any substantive long-term statement. 
If there is no interest, then there is no interest. 
As of this minute, I am leaving this place forever. 
I have said my last word.  
On motion of Senator Chalifoux, debate adjourned.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Our Chief Page, Greg Doiron, will be leaving us. 
This is his last day of service. 
Business of the Senate 
Hon. John B. Stewart :
However, if other committees are meeting, we, too, will meet.  
We will add the Foreign Affairs Committee to that list, then.  
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, March 17, 1998, at 2 p.m.
