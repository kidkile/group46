The estimated cost for the translation of those five documents is $10,878.  
Question No. 173- Mr. Randy White: 
There are three criminal offences reported in the above-mentioned surveys.

Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
The parliamentary secretary has asked that the remaining questions be allowed to stand. 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas-Charlottenburgh, Lib.):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
ALLOTTED DAY-REGIONS OF CANADA 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
We look forward to this debate today. 
Reform Party members participating in the debate will be dividing their time.  
I would like to read it into the record once again: 
I have a copy of their agenda here. 
This agenda was obviously put together months ago. 
Mind you, the chairman could be a bit gun shy of public exposure. 
This prediction appeared to become a self-fulfilling prophecy as the talk show progressed.  
It prevents them from representing their constituents.  
I would invite him to comply with the rules in that respect fully.  
No, not the separatist Bloc Quebecois, the Reform Party''.  
I know that my time is running short already. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, that is a really good question and I thank the member for it. 
He cares for his constituents and their opinions.  
Therein we have an answer to part of his question. 
People do not believe it will make any difference. 
Mr. Gerard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the question. 
It even elected two members in Alberta at one stage. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, unfortunately we cannot provide the agenda as requested by the member.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, there is something wrong here. 
Three or four senators are being sent on this little trip to the west. 
I am sure they might get the gist of things.  
We will see where they go. 
The Liberals do not win seats across the country. 
That is where the Liberals primarily have votes.  
I ask them to listen up, all five of them.  
One can understand that with the potential it has. 
It continues to remain on the horizon. 
Who knows where it will go from there? 
Yet the federal government did nothing but play games in that exercise. 
It is not even visible in getting this project active today. 
Some shake their heads, but that is what is happening. 
There is more to the country than one small region.  
Where are the Liberals today? 
How are they dealing with this situation? 
The government goes to Sydney, makes an announcement and walks away. 
No responsible government does that under any circumstances. 
Why do the people in Nova Scotia feel alienated? 
One problem is that the government does not ask why. 
It was not even supportive of the issue.  
What is the issue? 
Why not build some ships? 
There is the capacity in the shipyards in Halifax. 
The dedication is there. 
Holland is producing at a higher cost. 
Why can we not do it here?  
It must be renewed by 2004 to meet environmental standards. 
Many of the necessary tax acts and other incentives are already in place. 
Where is the government promoting that kind of thing?  
Talk about regional alienation.  
I could talk all day about the tar ponds in Sydney. 
I will be there on Thursday looking at them again. 
It is one of the biggest open sewers in the world. 
There has been study after study.  
It has not been solved. 
It has been going on for decades and decades. 
Except this government accepts it in Sydney. 
We could talk about the gun law. 
What did we recently see in Ottawa? 
No. Steve Gullon in Nova Scotia can tell us. 
He cannot live off his business any more. 
It is dying because of the cost and the exorbitant administration rates.  
I only have a minute, unfortunately. 
I could go on and on.  
The whole damned country is alienated.  
Therefore, I would like to introduce an amendment to the motion. 
The question is on the amendment.  
Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):
He knows it is contrary to the rules.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
He is only compounding the difficulties of the Chair. 
It was interesting to note in the byelection results in Windsor-St. 
Clair that a Liberal was returned to the House. 
How does the member figure that? 
I would encourage those committee members to try to be more realistic. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Speaker, we are going to hear a bit about this today. 
The first person said ``I really don't understand it''. 
Another two people said that it seemed rather silly. 
Another person said ``It makes no sense''.  
Even the most literate could not understand what that meant. 
Reformers did not even have the courtesy of having the formal title. 
They probably could not find it, or perhaps they could not understand it.  
There are a lot of issues that could have been raised in debate. 
We could have talked about building a stronger, more united Canada. 
We could have talked about increasing Canada's economic performance. 
What did they do? 
They picked a silly motion that does not make any sense to anyone. 
They are playing politics.  
Why would they be doing that? 
I participated for two days on the task force. 
I met with the mayor and councillors of the city of Winnipeg. 
It was an excellent meeting. 
We met with the Manitoba Chamber of Commerce. 
Were they friends of the government? 
This morning ``flunkies'' was used with respect to government members. 
I find that shocking.  
Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:
The good news is that they are not all like that. 
I will share what one Reform member said. 
That is what the member for Athabasca had to say.  
The Reform Party has a platform. 
It has not given an indication of how it would undertake economic development. 
What would they replace this by? 
They have no idea. 
I find this absolutely unacceptable.  
I want to talk this morning about western economic diversification.  
I am responsible for this portfolio. 
I want to further emphasize this agency's presence in western Canada. 
In the Atlantic provinces we have ACOA. 
Let us talk about the mandate of western economic diversification. 
It is to diversify the economies of the western provinces. 
What does that mean? 
We all know that traditionally we have made a good living. 
We also recognize that we are in a different world today. 
What does that mean? 
That is what it really means.  
If people have businesses that are doing well, can they do more with those businesses? 
Can they create more jobs? 
It makes for a stronger nation. 
That is what we are all about.  
Where is western economic diversification in the Government of Canada? 
Madam Speaker, I was under the impression that I had 20 minutes. 
Is that not the case?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Yes, I am sorry, but 10 minutes is the amount of time allotted.  
Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:
That is unfortunate, because I was told that I had 20 minutes. 
Therefore, I had prepared myself accordingly. 
I thought that as the main speaker for the government, I would have 20 minutes.  
We have a satellite in Regina. 
We have an office in Winnipeg. 
More important, we are in the small places.  
We have a number of partners. 
We have four women's enterprise centres.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Unfortunately I must interrupt the secretary of state. 
We now move on to questions and comments.  
Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
It is not just where I come from in the west. 
It is truly unfortunate that it has taken this stance. 
I hope it can do more.  
Would the hon. member do one thing at least? 
Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:
Madam Speaker, I will respond to my colleague's questions. 
First, I did not say it was a waste of time. 
Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:
No, I did not. 
I said people said it was silly. 
People said it made no sense. 
He is trying to embarrass the government.  
He could have encouraged me- 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. secretary of state still has two minutes.  
Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:
Madam Speaker, I would like to know what his point is.  
They do not want to hear about that. 
Because western Canadians are competitive.  
I cannot understand that logic. 
Frankly I am ashamed of that behaviour.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Madam Speaker, the member does not admit that there is any problem at all.  
Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:
Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for the appropriate question. 
Of course there are issues and I wish we would identify them.  
Let us talk about the $56 million that was invested in Synchroton in Saskatoon. 
Is that an appropriate investment? 
Are we for it or against it? 
Those are the questions we ought to be talking about.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
In Quebec, our region, this failure is only too clear. 
I am going to indicate some of these. 
This gives rise to a sizeable number of concrete problems. 
This in turn creates a number of problems. 
There is something wrong when a country is ashamed of its constitution. 
Why is it wrong? 
They should remember that for nine years there was a federalist government in Quebec. 
This does not seem to worry too many people. 
This is along the same line. 
Let us go back to specific examples, such as culture. 
This is a cultural element.  
There is also our ability to do things differently. 
Our policy on tuition fees is very different from that of Canada. 
So, the government came up with a coast to coast program. 
Yet, needs are not the same everywhere. 
You will settle them by negotiating with the government''.  
That is a problem. 
But the federal government does not see this as important. 
In the few minutes I have left, I want to look briefly at regional development. 
It is the same thing. 
Having lost its visibility in such a structure, it made us dismantle it. 
This is not conducive to economic development. 
This agency should be called Propaganda Canada, not Economic Development Canada.  
Mr. Gerard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):
I believe he is absolutely right. 
I have an anecdote to relate in this connection. 
It is a total administrative mess.  
I knew that by ``regional office'' she meant Montreal. 
For us, Abitibi-Temiscamingue is our region. 
We would like the government to think this way.  
What sets us apart is the number of mines we have. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
We are in a state of war. 
We are in an offensive operation against a sovereign nation.  
There seems to be an expansion of the war. 
Therefore my comments will focus obviously on that.  
Over the years there have been shared programs between the federal and provincial governments. 
There is not a single one.  
I would like to be contradicted. 
No, not a single cent. 
We could talk about the north, about Yukon. 
Yukon has been dealt devastating blows by the federal government. 
It lost its weather station. 
In Whitehorse a fee for cargo has to be paid as well. 
We now have the largest film industry in Canada. 
A disaster is unfolding. 
Mining has been essentially abandoned. 
I know it is not terribly romantic. 
I want to point out that the issue of water diversion concerns us. 
We passed that motion unanimously. 
What did the government do the next day? 
From where did that initiative arise? 
That is where we are today.  
I see the minister from British Columbia is here. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
None rose to their feet, so I will do my best to fill in.  
The same applies to my home province of Alberta. 
He said that time and time again during the campaign. 
People listened to him, believed him and elected him. 
I ask members if they have ever heard this hon. member speak in the House?  
I hear somebody saying ``Lou who?'' 
They could easily be sought out in terms of advice. 
I can tell the House how people feel about it. 
She goes out there regularly. 
I do not know who she talks to but she talks to a few folks. 
I know what people are saying on the street about these visits. 
That is the reason there is a feeling of alienation. 
We elect people and then the government ignores the individuals concerned. 
We elect individuals and they are completely ignored by the government.  
The level of arrogance will be almost intolerable as we move toward the next election. 
It seems to be a pattern that develops in this place. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
I have spoken to the budget, which I was very pleased to do. 
I cannot put this motion in with the other issues we have debated.  
Alienation is synonymous with the Reform Party. 
Let us make no mistake that Reformers have alienated the rest of Canada. 
We can see that on their benches. 
They have alienated Ontario. 
The members of the Reform Party have alienated eastern Canada, Atlantic Canada. 
The Reform members cannot do the same. 
What about Atlantic Canada? 
Let me deal with some of those issues.  
That quote, by the way, was made on July 25, 1996. 
Those are the chameleon policies of the Reform Party.  
That was in the Chronicle-Herald on February 22, 1995.  
It is the wrong thing to do.  
We should be debating something of consequence here in this House, but we are not.  
It is to go out and gain some public relations and some media attention. 
In fact, the chairman of the task force is a colleague of mine. 
He is also the chairman of the agriculture committee on which I sit. 
I find it rather amusing. 
I wish that particular individual had made some of the changes. 
It is the absolute wrong way to do it. 
Of course in doing that people are alienated and the government is learning from that.  
Perhaps we could all learn from our mistakes. 
Madam Speaker, I want to commend my colleague for his positive attitude. 
Let me give a few examples.  
In this case it happens to be western Canada.  
We deal with that task force from coast to coast. 
Will it work for the profile? 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Really, they are experts in alienation.  
In my riding around 60% of the people voted for me. 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, as it has just come up, why are we here today? 
Why are we debating this motion? 
Why do people want to be heard? 
What are their frustrations right now? 
There is no question that far too much power centres around the Prime Minister. 
It is a rubber stamp for these guys.  
I spoke with Irv Koombes from Burnaby. 
That came up over and over again.  
There are lots of examples. 
These examples happen over and over again.  
All he was suggesting was a fair process.  
Did the Prime Minister consider that suggestion? 
He punished the member by removing him as committee chair. 
This is the level of frustration we have.  
The Reform Party put its motion forward to deal with this as expeditiously as possible. 
When this motion was put forward we were not even aware of this letter. 
The letter came up after the fact. 
What did the government do? 
It again brought out the heavy club.  
The government has no concern for them at all.  
I personally witnessed it as a member of the fisheries committee. 
It fired the chairman, the member for Gander-Grand Falls, Newfoundland.  
The government punishes him because he is not a trained sheep. 
This is absolutely disgraceful.  
I could speak here all day on the things I have heard from British Columbians. 
That is what a parasite actually does. 
It literally sucks all the life out of something and offers nothing in return. 
That is how this member described the government.  
It thinks of British Columbians as nuisances.  
It is an opportunity for the Liberals to listen.  
The government is also aware of this. 
What did it do? 
It knows this is out there but is not dealing with it. 
It created a committee called the western alienation committee. 
That describes it in itself. 
It tells us that there is no representation.  
There are opportunities for the government to act for British Columbians. 
No, it is not taking it to task. 
Where is the government? 
How come it is not standing up and fighting for us? 
That issue resonates everywhere we go. 
They want people to come to Ottawa to represent their views. 
They do not want Ottawa to tell them what they think.  
The second issue is taxes, taxes, taxes and tax fairness for the family. 
They are outraged that the government could not support a very simple motion. 
I spoke with a family from Surrey. 
I hope the government is listening.  
Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):
We seen how much they have supported the Reform Party in that respect. 
That shows how its message is resonating to Canadians.  
That is Reform's new way of discipline.  
Maybe the hon. member would like to explain that to me.  
Madam Speaker, I will gladly explain. 
He resigned on his own and I will leave it at that.  
He was the only individual who voted against the government. 
It does not matter whether it is hepatitis C or child pornography. 
Here we had one on taxation. 
He voted against the government and where does he sit? 
He sits on this side of the House. 
The Liberals kicked him out of the party. 
I have been in Ottawa for two years. 
People ask me how I like it and what is happening here. 
It is controlled by one individual. 
They will not listen and it is very unfortunate.  
We need to change this institution. 
That is what we are talking about. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Just last night we were here talking about Kosovo. 
Of course no one was here to listen. 
It was a take note debate. 
Here are some of the things on the list that have alienated our province.  
First, we feel the federal government has become too intrusive in provincial affairs. 
The millennium scholarship is an example. 
The provincial education minister was not even consulted. 
There have been health care cuts of 40%. 
The federal government continually wants to blame the provinces for those cuts. 
Farmers, grassroots people, will save endangered species. 
People are responsible and do want to have input into legislation.  
Taxes cost this country in lost productivity. 
The incentive to work is destroyed by high taxes. 
The government just does not get it.  
Of course Alberta has led the way. 
We have the lowest taxes. 
We are going to an 11% flat tax in 2002. 
The federal government could learn a lot about that.  
That is a penalty against the free enterprise system which Alberta practises.  
The EI surplus is being taken as a tax. 
When only 38% of people can actually receive EI, the rest is just tax money. 
It is taxing us to death.  
Third, there were many mentions of patronage. 
The CF-18 bill is not dead yet in Alberta. 
We still remember that. 
One is to mention the name of Mr. Trudeau and the national energy program. 
Immediately individuals say ``I won't vote Liberal''. 
We have eliminated two parties right away just by saying those words. 
It becomes pretty easy.  
There is blatant patronage everywhere. 
We have example after example. 
The fourth is the judicial system. 
Albertans are concerned about victims' rights. 
That is wrong in anyone's books. 
They cannot understand how any government can agree with child pornography. 
The judges are making the laws. 
The fifth is gun control. 
They are disgusted by it. 
I asked the justice minister to come to my riding. 
But she should come. 
She is our Alberta justice minister. 
Why will she not do that? 
What is she afraid of if the law is so good? 
I will make sure the crowd is there for her.  
There should be Senate elections. 
The message is ``Wake up''. 
We are gaining population. 
My question is very simple. 
I will give him a couple of examples that I think might be useful.  
Perhaps he could enlighten us.  
But they are not. 
Let us run our province. 
Mr. Gerard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, time has a way of arranging things.  
We said the same things in 1997.  
Mr. Speaker, certainly Quebecers and Albertans have a lot in common. 
I am saying to the government that it has to start listening to regional concerns. 
Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for Waterloo-Wellington.  
This network has a proud history of over 100 years. 
That is the first time in history that has happened.  
These are some of the tangible benefits of federal agricultural research. 
There is at least one research centre in every province. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
That is one of the foibles of human nature.  
We want the government to give us freedom.  
That is the way a true national government looks at things. 
They grow fat on alienation. 
This is why we have this topic here. 
Just stop to think. 
Why would they switch their allegiance? 
As far as I am concerned, those members are missing the point.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
The presence of federal departments and agencies is quite astounding and remarkable. 
It is much more than just that. 
That is its purpose. 
This meets the needs of women in business. 
It offers financing, counselling and advice. 
There are also 90-plus community future development corporations across the west. 
Seven are aboriginal exclusive. 
That too underscores our commitment.  
Over 1,000 volunteers are part of the western Canada business service network. 
That too is important to note.  
They deliver national and regional programs on behalf of the federal government. 
They are agents of economic development and job creation. 
I would now like to talk a bit about aboriginal initiatives. 
This initiative will also see increased access to capital for aboriginal businesses.  
I want to turn for a minute to the Canada Foundation for Innovation. 
The aim is to make Canada the most connected country in the year 2000. 
We have connected 183 community access sites in Saskatchewan alone.  
All these things provide an overview of what we are doing in western Canada. 
They are important initiatives.  
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
No wonder there is alienation. 
It is not the least bit surprising.  
I have to ask him why then set up a task force. 
Why did the Prime Minister do that?  
What a pathetic and pitiful example that is. 
Where is the discussion about criminal refugee problems? 
We talk about the variety of issues that hon. member raised. 
We do so on a continuing basis. 
It is a very good foundation upon which to build. 
I am very proud of what our government has accomplished in this area. 
I will repeat what I said at the outset. 
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
The air traffic control tower will completely leave Yukon.  
I would like the hon. member to comment on that.  
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, the motion before the House today reads: 
Let me start with the Liberal alienation committee.  
Worse than that, three of the ten members of the task force are senators. 
Exactly how will it work?  
It does not make a lot of sense. 
They are the source of our alienation. 
They are the reason we feel resentment and we feel alienated.  
That is a slap in the face.  
What kind of leadership is that? 
He will not though, will he? 
He is the prime minister in control of the direction of the country. 
Why does he not reform the Senate? 
We have been asking for that for years.  
There is the language policy of the federal government. 
I will give another example. 
He was on vacation in the sunny south.  
Why was he not out there listening to the concerns of farmers? 
Nonetheless, I do not mind doing it. 
That is my job and I was pleased to be part of that process.  
On March 29 I urgently appealed to him. 
The program is fraught with problems and difficulties. 
He responded yesterday, the day before we had the debate on western alienation. 
Is that not ironic?  
The Liberal government wants to know why we feel alienated. 
We are consulting the people. 
As an elected representative I write letters to the minister. 
He would not even respond to my letter.  
I will use another example, that of the minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board. 
The Liberals voted against it. 
What did the Liberal committee do? 
I see my time is running short. 
Talk about a political ploy. 
They are making political hay out of it and westerners resent that. 
We do not need our votes bought. 
We want accountable government. 
My second point concerns the Official Languages Act. 
I have two questions in this regard. 
They want to speak their first language, French.  
It is not simply money that is tossed away. 
What is with them?  
People in Saskatoon are not stupid. 
They saw right through that. 
It is insulting for them to have even been there. 
Of course I do and I think that is wonderful. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
I have lived in my home province for a long time. 
I have only had two farmers admit that they filled out the forms. 
I wonder what will be the result in the province of Saskatchewan. 
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
I congratulate those individuals for even being able to find the elusive Liberal task force. 
Nobody even knows what its schedule is.  
If the committee actually listens to western Canadians its ears will be burning. 
I recently spent a good deal of time particularly in southwest Ontario. 
Tenth, the Liberals have little or no grassroots involvement. 
The concept is lost in the House.  
Ninth, the Liberals are not accountable for their actions. 
Yet the Liberals refused to account for and correct their past mistakes.  
Eighth, the Liberal government is arrogant. 
The Liberal government knows no bounds. 
The decision making process in the House of Commons is an insult to democracy. 
I find that absolutely appalling.  
Seventh, the Liberals run roughshod with aboriginal affairs. 
In 1995 Dudley George was shot and killed at Ipperwash. 
Sixth, the Liberals have poor ethics. 
Here we are in 1999 and guess what? 
This is not the case today.  
Fifth, the Liberals disregard the auditor general. 
New accounting methods have been invented. 
Other recommendations by the auditor general's office are blatantly ignored.  
Fourth, the Liberals are not trusted. 
The people of Ontario are not blind to this action. 
Third, the Liberals gag their backbenchers. 
The Liberal backbenchers are not allowed to speak out on behalf of their own constituents. 
Second, the Liberals have destroyed the health care system. 
If they live frugally they can just get by. 
EI payroll taxes are higher than the actuary recommends. 
Yet the Liberals just do not get it.  
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
I would like the hon. member to know that he answered it quite correctly.  
This does not mean I am in disagreement or at odds with my leader. 
It is an open and honest debate in our party. 
Mr. Marchand's vision was realized. 
Today, we have three economic development agencies. 
These agencies have maximum flexibility. 
They also had access to our services.  
The fairs are a mine of important information. 
We business people know we are living in a new era. 
As a government, we reacted quickly and very matter-of-factly to these new situations. 
This organization manages that fund along with its other responsibilities. 
I could also mention some of the results. 
We funded 3,250 projects under the Canada-Quebec infrastructure program. 
An estimated 35,646 jobs were created or maintained through this partnership. 
IDEA-SME is an intervention in the areas of innovation, design, research and development. 
Its results truly speak for themselves.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
I could speak on the issue quite easily.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
These issues affect my province of British Columbia.  
Why does it not sink into Liberal heads that all provinces are equal? 
Why is there discrimination?  
Madam Speaker, that is a subject on which I could talk for hours.  
That is why I have been explaining it for the past 20 minutes. 
We are working together to help Canadians across the country. 
Certain parts of Canada they will get more for immigration, for instance. 
Central Canada may get more in terms of economic development.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
He said it was intervention based on taxpayer dollars.  
I want to ask the minister a specific question. 
He talked about having an open attitude in his speech. 
If this government has an open attitude, why does it have closed meetings? 
Why does it not have open public meetings?  
Madam Speaker, the media were at the meeting to which they referred.  
There is something that is annoying. 
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
Manitobans know about their future and they also have a vision for their future. 
Does the government listen to the concerns that are raised in the House?  
If only the government would listen.  
Mayor Bill Schneider of the village of Benito said: 
The people of Benito don't have too much say. 
The reality is that the population is in the east. 
Mayor Lorne Boguski of the town of Roblin said: 
The decisions are made without the interests of the people from that region. 
This would develop rapport. 
Mayor Michael Spence of the town of Churchill said: 
This gives Churchill the opportunity to look after its own future. 
Ottawa is too far away. 
The federal government, when it comes to airports, lacks vision for the future. 
We are up against the big business of east and west coast terminals.  
Reeve George Richardson of the rural municipality of Dauphin said: 
They don't know that we exist. 
That is the real attitude of the rural municipality of Dauphin. 
The east has had all the power and still does today. 
Mayor Wally Yanchycki of the village of Erickson said: 
I don't think we get our fair share on transfer payments. 
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
ROYAL CANADIAN AIR FORCE 
Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):
In Rwanda, for a time, we alone provided airlift. 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Today that centre is called Erinoak. 
I have seen first-hand the wonderful work this centre does. 
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
I also did that when they were here in the House several months ago.  
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
TAIPEI ECONOMIC AND CULTURE OFFICE 
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
The new Bloc Quebecois researcher is clearly totally irresponsible. 
The Bloc should terminate his contract immediately.  
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
The evening gala revealed the tremendous musical and acting talent of the north. 
Overall, the show was fabulous.  
Thank you, Canada, for celebrating with us.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
``Vivre le monde de la francophonie'' was an incredible success. 
Just imagine bringing over 2,000 young people together in a huge event.  
We need the strongest political action from our government to oppose new restrictions.  
We need strong political representation. 
SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ASIA-PACIFIC 
Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard-La Prairie, Lib.):
Our secretary of state refused to be intimidated by President Habibie. 
The hon. member for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the results are in. 
The voters in Windsor-St. 
Clair gave us their answer. 
Who did voters from Windsor-St. 
Clair elect as their federal member of Parliament yesterday? 
We look forward to working with Rick as a great addition to our Liberal team.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
We offer her our heartiest congratulations.  
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister asks the people of Canada to trust him. 
CONSOLIDATED GROWERS AND PROCESSORS 
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, last Friday agriculture in Canada received good news. 
Hemp is a model crop that is environmentally friendly. 
This is good news for Canadian agriculture.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, April is daffodil month in Canada, an event formerly known as cancer month.  
The reward is wonderful.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We have had that and hon. members carried on until this morning. 
It is the best way to express our support.  
It was evidence of their support.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Today the Serbs occupied a town in Albania.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are not confronted with this problem at this time.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
I want to read something: 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Here we have had three debates so far.  
I think that we are giving opportunity to everybody to speak. 
Even tonight those who want to express their views will be able to speak. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
It has since been driven back. 
This is yet another sign that this conflict is escalating.  
The government clearly has a responsibility to plan for all possibilities. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
The hon. Minister of National Defence.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
We have not at this point in time been asked for any other additional resources.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the situation in the Balkans is evolving rapidly.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Naturally, the best solution would be a diplomatic one. 
I myself wrote to Russia's president. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I think the leader of the Bloc Quebecois is going a bit far.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
The communique announced that NATO would react if this occurred.  
Is it not a response to the position taken in yesterday's statement?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Apparently they turned around.  
Was this strictly a mistake, or was it provocation? 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I replied to this point yesterday. 
The leader of the the New Democratic Party approved of what I said yesterday. 
I have always spoken about the involvement of others, especially the Russians. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
The Prime Minister says that Russian involvement is hoped for. 
Other NATO members are speaking up.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the Yugoslav infantry occupied the village of Kemenica, Albania.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the answer is no.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
That number is absolutely outrageous.  
How much more money will the minister rip off from workers before he is satisfied?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
It is the largest decrease in EI premiums in the history of employment insurance.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
We have the tape running.  
Certainly the minister should not be proud of that fact.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Yesterday Canadians in Windsor-St. 
Clair told the Reform Party what they thought about its priorities.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Now, there is every indication that it is becoming less and less hypothetical.  
The right hon. Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
If the hon. member wants to make representations, he can do so this evening. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Low income Canadians and high income Canadians are benefiting at the same time.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is nice to have a job. 
It is also nice to keep the income that one earns. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Why did they vote against the prenatal nutrition program? 
Why did they vote against CAPC? 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
We decided unequivocally to continue the air campaign against the Milosevic regime. 
This is the best way to fight the actions of Milosevic. 
I call on members to support this decision. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Those talks are ongoing.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I see that the Prime Minister is exploring other job opportunities. 
He has taken to writing fiction for the National Post . 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have the letter I have written. 
I have given all the facts. 
As a good member of parliament I will still work to help my constituents.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we have already read the letter. 
That is not the problem. 
Canadians want to know the facts. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I replied to the question. 
I stated the facts. 
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
And, if so, what role will they play?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
What is the Government of Canada's response?  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
When will he table them in this place?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, only the Reform sees problems in these particular cases.  
The matter is crystal clear. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
So there is clearly no conflict of interest in my case.  
We will hear the question.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the process followed in every case is always the same. 
The Prime Minister did his job. 
It has worked and it has created real jobs.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Without that no agreement is worth having. 
We must protect those innocent people.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Will he not take that to NATO?  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
That is the fundamental fact that we are facing. 
Otherwise we will simply have a repetition of a- 
The hon. member for Richmond-Arthabaska.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
My question is for the Minister of National Defence. 
The Minister of National Defence.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I suggest that the minister call Kingston.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
I want to go back to one central point. 
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Today the official opposition has accused the federal government of alienating the west. 
Women have been extremely successful in business. 
They need to be supported- 
The hon. member for Saanich-Gulf Islands.  
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
He has said that he will make his decision based on sound science. 
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
On Saturday, April 3 we were accepting 5,000 refugees. 
Then on Friday, April 9 we were only accepting refugees with special needs. 
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Could she share with us as to how this is to happen? 
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
PRESENCE IN THE GALLERY 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Pursuant to the rules of Beauchesne's I am now tabling the letter.  
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
I ask that a copy of that letter be tabled in the House.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
I think there has been some misunderstanding. 
ALLOTTED DAY-REGIONS OF CANADA 
The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the amendment.  
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
Reeve Maxine Plesiuk of the rural municipality of Ethelbert said: 
We do feel alienated from Ottawa. 
Look at the distance. 
We are or appear to be out of reach of Ottawa. 
We sure were not contacted by them.  
Mayor Gary Hopper from the town of The Pas: 
The provinces do the same thing. 
Mayor Bud Oliver from the city of Selkirk: 
Mayor Bill Comaskey from the city of Thompson: 
The federal system has little credibility. 
The federal system needs fixing.  
We all know that discrimination causes only conflicts within our country.  
Reeve Dwayne Lawless from the rural municipality of Rossburn: 
Ottawa is far removed from here. 
They don't listen to our concerns. 
We've lost control over government. 
They do as they want. 
They keep pouring good money after bad. 
People feel alienated from big government and are not happy.  
I have received numerous calls on the farm aid package. 
These calls were very negative. 
Farmers are smart businessmen. 
Farmers are frustrated with the AIDA program. 
The task force of the Prime Minister started on the wrong foot. 
It is the process we object to.  
We are all Canadians and want to be treated equally. 
Manitobans have said to me that Ottawa does not treat them in an equal manner. 
This of course creates the feeling of alienation. 
All Canadians deserve good government. 
Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, Lib.):
We had the chamber of commerce and municipal representatives. 
For example, in Brandon, Manitoba council members were present. 
I understand that the mayor was out of the city. 
It was an opportunity to listen to people and to hear their concerns.  
We met with economic development groups. 
We met with the Canadian Federation of Agriculture. 
We met with the Keystone Agriculture Producers organization of Manitoba. 
We met with these people and listened to them. 
They gave us ideas to bring back to share with our colleagues.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite for the question.  
We received requests from constituents in terms of how to access the hearings.  
It certainly was one of the best kept secrets of the task force. 
That is the reality of how the task force worked in Manitoba.  
It was not a political exercise.  
The grassroots people are the ones. 
I spoke to probably 15 different mayors and reeves. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It is just the way debate is.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I was attempting to ask a question and the debate was going back and forth.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That is not a point of order.  
The snow has gone there and we have fresh clean air. 
It is wonderful that spring has hit Canada. 
It is certainly time for spring in Ottawa.  
We have to look at a new country. 
The next spring that this country sees will be in the new millennium. 
I wanted to ask the people of New Brunswick for some of their feedback. 
I put two comments on the form asking for responses: 
2. Here's how I would fix that Liberal policy.  
I have had several responses from people. 
It is amazing the feedback that came from them. 
Number one was no surprise, taxes. 
People were concerned about taxes. 
They say taxes are grossly unfair, discriminatory and too high. 
That is no surprise, no matter what corner of the country they live in.  
That is the saddest thing to me.  
What federal taxes do New Brunswickers want reformed? 
I feel single income families are unfairly taxed. 
Here we are in mid-April. 
Here's how I would fix that Liberal policy.  
What a smart, practical idea that is. 
Somebody else, Innis McCready, wrote: 
Taxes were too high for the average home owner and wage earner. 
How would this person change it? 
I am sure it was an accident on its part. 
Bernie Conway wrote that he was: 
I will be entering the workforce in the year 2000. 
The amount of money that I will be paying in taxes is very disconcerting. 
Lower taxes on retired people and pensioners. 
We do not have to live with the HST in western Canada. 
Maybe the Liberal task force has not come up with that yet. 
On second hand sales Susan Baxter from St. George, New Brunswick, wrote: 
We just bought a second hand camper trailer. 
There's no limit to the taxing.  
Eric Banks from Second Falls, New Brunswick, wrote: 
They call it amalgamation.  
I also heard the words partnerships and networking. 
The present plan will not work. 
The fourth issue is about protecting the east coast fishery. 
Again, Eric Banks from Second Falls wrote: 
What he would do to fix that policy? 
Many people in New Brunswick are seasonal workers. 
They have seasonal employment.  
Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, Lib.):
We held public sessions in several ridings, in several centres across Manitoba. 
We did not just target ridings held by one group of people. 
We got more votes. 
In fact I have been talking about New Brunswick.  
It seems to me those meetings were by invitation only. 
It would be really smart to put a general advertisement in the newspapers. 
Let us talk about the west because the hon. member seems obsessed with that. 
Let us talk about the seats that were lost in Manitoba by the Liberals. 
Let us look at Saskatchewan for just a minute. 
Let us move on to Alberta. 
Let us have a little look at Alberta for Liberals. 
They did not have a seat for a generation. 
It was a wonderful night in my life.  
Let us look at B.C. if we are talking about a national party. 
There are precious few Liberals left. 
What a steal, $800 to have supper with the justice minister. 
Guess who is not coming to dinner. 
What do we think happened? 
Guess who is not coming for supper. 
One of those Liberals. 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
They wanted to have a vote. 
It is their day. 
The Canadian people should know that this is opposition day. 
Why would we not be debating the issues that Canadians have on their minds today? 
Why would the Reform Party not do that? 
I believe it is not doing its jobs.  
Whether they care or agree is not the point.  
There is a good reason for that.  
I know they certainly did not vote Bloc. 
This is a message that some of them should think about.  
Members will hear shortly from the member for Vancouver-Quadra. 
We have the member for Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia. 
We have the members for Winnipeg South, Winnipeg North-St. 
The west wants in. 
How much more in would it like?  
Is that not a revolution? 
Is that not a reform? 
This minister is fighting for them as he is for the salmon in western Canada.  
The west is clearly in.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
It is interesting that the member would talk about all these issues. 
I will agree with him on something. 
We had better talk about this. 
Holy smokes, there is a scandal. 
We had better talk about this''. 
That is where they get their research.  
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
What a lot of bunkum. 
I have met with representatives of western diversification. 
I have met with the service delivery people. 
I have met with the young entrepreneurs in western Canada.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
I do not criticize that. 
Every party has its political chattering class. 
They hang around party headquarters. 
I am not even the next general manager of the Vancouver Canucks. 
But we are all optimistic in the west. 
The member for Saanich-Gulf Islands is a very promising younger member of this House. 
He has made some comments on the issue of APEC funding. 
I include my colleagues opposite in this.  
We are interested in getting results. 
We have to research a file; we have to meet the parties concerned. 
I think that is true of all members of the House.  
Some remarks have been made on the west. 
I would have to cavil with my colleagues on that. 
It has implications of course, concretely. 
I think the hon. member for North Vancouver would not disagree with me on that. 
I want to see proportional representation in federal institutions.  
When it gets beyond 13% I think we will ask for 20% as a region.  
They are plural also. 
That is good and healthy.  
We produce interesting political leaders. 
There is an art in doing that. 
You recognize the gain you have from an affiliation with the party. 
We are distinct and we are very proud of it.  
A French friend said we have a monarchical president. 
I said that sometimes it is an imperial president. 
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
A couple of interesting points came up in the speech. 
I wonder if he has done the numbers, as I have. 
He is to be congratulated for that.  
I have a feeling in some ways that it would be a more interesting House. 
This is a continent widely divided. 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
I would like to ask the hon. member a simple question. 
When may that happen?  
But it is just unforeseeable for another 10 years here. 
Give us a constituent assembly and all will spill. 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
The millennium fund is a prime example.  
This fund is nothing but another inefficient and costly Liberal policy. 
He is only interested in leaving his mark.  
I would like to shift to the topic of health care and the social union. 
However, the government and the Prime Minister did not take that seriously. 
Instead they played the money game. 
That is the success of this government. 
It continues to succeed by pitting one part of this country against another. 
It really is no surprise.  
Another issue I would like to touch on very quickly is that of taxation. 
We want to make sure we can provide for our families. 
The Reform Party and most Canadians seem to understand that. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
There was a sharing of the burden. 
There was a lesser percentage of revenue.  
There was a significant difference.  
Mr. Speaker, I will address the hon. member's question briefly. 
In the province of Ontario the same thing happened. 
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
ALLOTTED DAY-REGIONS OF CANADA 
The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the amendment.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
I wonder if it is to go and talk with constituents in Newfoundland. 
Predominantly oil and gas are the ones that come to my mind. 
They are depriving Newfoundlanders of their jobs. 
That is a crying shame. 
It is a joke.  
What does the government do? 
It goes ahead and tries to buy votes. 
It tries to hold it over people's heads. 
It is a shame that this is even carried over to the provincial government. 
Shame on the government that it does not have control over the fisheries. 
The fisheries are not the only resource.  
Offshore oil could be a great boon for the province of Newfoundland. 
As a result the fishery collapsed in 1992.  
It is sad that when there is no control there is little or no hope. 
That is exactly what has happened.  
What does the federal government do? 
It doles out its pennies and nickels. 
It keeps the people dependent and does not allow them local control over their resources. 
It did not step in when it was supposed to do so. 
Iceland, for example, had a crisis with its fishery and foreign fishing. 
It was able to make the decisions. 
Newfoundland recently had its 50th anniversary of joining Confederation. 
Some would say it was treated with some ambiguity. 
That is a shame. 
According to DFO statistics each seal gobbles up 1.4 tonnes of fish per year. 
I have talked about Churchill Falls. 
I could talk about Inco and the Voisey's Bay dispute. 
I leave it to the people of Newfoundland and Labrador to decide. 
They should vote for change.  
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
I would appreciate the member's comments on that.  
The hon. member is referring to the north. 
My speech was directly related to Newfoundland and Labrador. 
We have seen that in Newfoundland and Labrador.  
Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, Lib.):
Alienation is the only thing that the Reform Party knows. 
I think back to the time of the referendum in Quebec. 
It is one of the finest parts of Canada, located in the foothills. 
My question for the member is:
I am proud to be a member of a party which represents all Canadians.  
Let me tell him a bit about alienation, as the hon. member raised the issue. 
There are only 18 employees. 
The premier has to be jealous. 
Deep down in his bones I know that the premier of Newfoundland is jealous.  
Why did they build a new building? 
One could say that maybe St. John's has almost no vacant building space. 
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia, Lib.):
As I mentioned yesterday, the response to the task force was indeed overwhelming. 
That is what we are witnessing today.  
The Reform Party is sitting still in the polls. 
So much for the so-called united alternative. 
Rather than uniting it is splitting apart.  
There is no hidden agenda. 
There is no radical departure from what this government has done in the past.  
The government listened and acted. 
Again we listened and we acted. 
My province of Manitoba will receive $425 million in increased health care funding. 
Are these the actions of a government that is indifferent to regional concerns? 
I do not think so. 
Western Canada is a vibrant and exciting place. 
The region has experienced strong economic and population growth. 
The people have confidence in themselves and in their future. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Last Friday we in the task force went to Brandon, Manitoba. 
I will tell him about a couple of witnesses we heard from.  
I grew up 19 miles from Wawanesa. 
Who is Mr. Friesen? 
Who else did we meet at lunch in Brandon? 
As far as I know I have never seen him walk in Liberal corridors. 
Who is Mr. Dewar? 
He appreciated every minute.  
That is what these meetings are about. 
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
We will be there during the break week in the month of May.  
It is a bit of a shock. 
People in every other country want to be here.  
We all benefit from it enormously.  
I think about the sense of the regional divisions. 
I even heard talk of some port building. 
The B.C. caucus has been touring the province. 
We all do that. 
The government has done some pretty remarkable things over the last five or six years.  
I wouldn't brag about it.  
The member says he would not brag about it but I do. 
I admire our Prime Minister. 
When confronted with an issue he knows when to act and when to watch. 
We now have a surplus. 
Look at the question of lack of co-operation with the provinces. 
Again, there was no national referendum. 
We sat down and went issue by issue. 
We needed to look at the issue of training. 
We sat down an negotiated a series of agreements. 
Co-operation improves services to everybody.  
I believe this was the crowning achievement. 
I worked in social services for a great many years. 
That basically is what Canada is. 
Canada is a partnership. 
It is a partnership of regions. 
It is a partnership of people. 
Partnership works extremely well.  
Members in Quebec are doing this as well. 
They bring that to caucus every week.  
The Prime Minister sits in caucus every week to listen to us. 
He insists that people be there. 
I am a little saddened. 
They are energetic, smart, interested and not afraid of the challenges in this world.  
In western Canada we see the same thing. 
Two of the wealthiest governments in the country exist in western Canada. 
They are focusing on making this an even better country.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member pointed out that we worked together. 
Two things went on at that time. 
We were in the midst of trying to get government spending under control. 
There were some very definite changes in the benefit levels. 
I think we have seen some of that.  
It is not nearly enough. 
These issues should be brought to the floor of the House. 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
Mine I shall reserve for regional development.  
That is the budget for the three agencies.  
What about the Atlantic provinces? 
In western Canada, per capital spending is $285.30. 
I can understand the concerns and representations of western Canada. 
The federal government is treating us even worse than the maritimes.  
Let us now look at the situation inside the province. 
I could go on and on, but time is quickly running out. 
He wanted to take the high road. 
When I look at the numbers for some ridings, it makes me wonder. 
Westmount is in downtown Montreal. 
Questions are in order. 
It has been ages since that was renegotiated.  
Why does he not do so? 
He refuses to do so. 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have listened to the member opposite's references to the CFDCs.  
There is one thing he neglected to mention. 
They are the ones who want to duplicate. 
Quebec wants to duplicate what the federal government is doing.  
I ask the member whether all this has to be done away with?  
It is a fine effort, and we see what he is up to. 
The words are the same, the party is different.  
The member speak of duplication by the federal government. 
It existed 15 years ago and still exists. 
They do an excellent job, no one is criticizing them. 
They act as volunteers on the boards.  
He is the one currently blocking things now. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member said a lot of things. 
It can make different impressions.  
We are mixing apples and oranges. 
The figures I quoted earlier are in the budget.  
For fifteen seconds, I am going to comment on the social union. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Let me give you a few examples to support my point.  
The federal government decided to scrap this social pact. 
These are not hypothetical examples. 
I am talking about folks we see in our ridings. 
This is completely unacceptable.  
We have other similar examples. 
Another example is the millennium scholarships. 
Some will say that scholarships are far from being regional development. 
This is in direct contradiction with the basic principles of the Quebec program.  
Earlier there was a debate on the CFDCs. 
In that sense, the Reform Party motion is right on target.  
People are not stupid. 
They know what they are doing when they vote. 
They are sending a message to the government, and the government should listen.  
The decision was to let market rules apply.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):

CANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS ACT 
Since this is a private member's bill we will vote as we usually do. 
(The House divided on the motion, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the motion defeated.  
The House resumed from February 12 consideration of the motion.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
We want something that Canadians are asking for.  
All of us in this House were elected to represent the people. 
We believe that to be a disgrace.  
There is a national trend around the country. 
School boards and businesses are publishing a code of ethics. 
Some great democracies have made their codes of ethics public. 
I want to quote from an article in which the Prime Minister said the following: 
But I will never countenance unwarranted attacks upon my personal ethics and honesty.  
We believe that to be a fair statement. 
However, in the same article the Prime Minister goes on to say: 
That is an admirable statement. 
This Prime Minister could go down in glory. 
There are two basic questions which must be asked. 
First, is there a separate code of ethics for the cabinet? 
Second, like other democracies, will the Prime Minister make that document public?  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
The arrogance of this government truly knows no bounds. 
The Liberals cried foul toward the previous Conservative government for years. 
That is the only solace we have.  
A public code of ethics does not exist when it comes to the Prime Minister. 
I wonder if that would be an example.  
Perhaps the Liberal supporters could tell us about Pierre Corbeil. 
Why would the Liberals not want to try to increase the level of public confidence? 
I commend the hon. member again for bringing this motion forward. 
Once again, I support the hon. member in his efforts thus far.  
Mr. Richard M. Harris:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
Are there no other members to speak?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. John Maloney (Erie-Lincoln, Lib.):
Allow me to point out a few.  
In fact, in my area of Niagara, it is less than the national average.  
We promised to reduce the budget deficit and we did. 
It speaks to the commitment this government has to Canadians.  
These are promises made and delivered on by the government.  
It is an ongoing commitment we show Canadians each and every day.  
Allow me to elaborate.  
This is an obligation that we take seriously. 
Let us cut through the smoke. 
The heart of the Canadian system of government centres around collective responsibility. 
Mr. Richard M. Harris:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We have exactly 12 minutes left in debate. 
Mr. Richard M. Harris:
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I will make sure that I call him at the appropriate time.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I just made a request to the hon. member to withdraw his motion. 
He has not acceded to my request. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this is a subject which is very important to Canadian people. 
I had the extraordinary privilege of serving on that committee.  
It is not a simple issue. 
Everybody knows what you are doing''. 
That really is the essence of it. 
However, I am aware that there are exceptions. 
That puzzled me endlessly. 
The heading was at the top and then everything was whited out. 
That was the point exactly. 
It was really very bad.  
They are all on record. 
Bring them out and make copies of them. 
This is a very important issue. 
We know that it exists. 
We know that we have not seen it. 
They have read it. 
One cannot read nor understand that which does not exist. 
So we know that it exists. 
Of course we want to know what that code is.  
Of course they would want to have openness in government. 
It is probably one of the most important motions that we will debate this evening.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I had not intended to speak to this motion. 
It is just happenstance that I happen to be here. 
Yet many in this House would see nothing wrong with accepting those freebies. 
I think there is a real issue which pertains to the Access to Information Act. 
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
There is no comparison.  
That is not rocket science to understand.  
They would have no fear of their members breaking that code.  
If they have nothing to hide, then put it out in the public. 
That is what Canadians understand.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
In Quebec, the figure was $20 million.  
We did as the minister suggested and waited patiently.  
The situation is becoming difficult for the provinces. 
It is totally unacceptable.  
We must have proper care. 
This should be given high priority.  
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond to the member for Acadie-Bathurst.  
In the budget we saw the biggest single investment this government has ever made. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I did not realize the hon. parliamentary secretary was just winding up. 
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 7.26 p.m.)
