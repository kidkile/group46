EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 234 
Monday, May 31, 1999 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
Mr. John Godfrey (Don Valley West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Is there unanimous consent to proceed in such a fashion?  
AN ACT TO INCORPORATE THE ALLIANCE OF MANUFACTURERS & EXPORTERS CANADA 
The House resumed from April 21 consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
It is also transparent and fair. 
I will describe this process briefly.  
Once the strategy has been approved, a call for tenders is put out.  
There are other innovative procurement processes that involve new financial arrangements. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
The EH-101 helicopter is a prime example of political interference. 
The official opposition does not support adding another layer of political involvement.  
There is always a question of political interference in sole sourcing contracts being awarded. 
Committees are not managing their own affairs efficiently. 
Even having a quorum has been a problem many times. 
We have an ongoing problem of leaked reports from the committees. 
I do not see any political will by the government to solve the problem. 
Even the ``leaked committee report'' was also leaked.  
Is the government chickening out? 
I really have to wonder.  
The Private Members' Business subcommittee has serious problems. 
Heckling in committees and the House is excessive and absolutely unnecessary. 
Partnership prevails in all the Liberal dominated committees.  
There has been a problem with the fairness of the chairmen. 
How can we do that if we are looking through the lens of issues? 
Many times the committee set-up is inefficient.  
We do not even have a clear disallowance procedure in place in that committee. 
Ministers and agencies do not respond in a timely fashion. 
I will not be supporting the motion. 
It borders on sabotaging our defence procurement process. 
The motion would actually increase the opportunity for political interference in the procurement process.  
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
He was taking potshots with comments that had absolutely no foundation whatsoever. 
There is no truth to them whatsoever.  
It will not serve the public interest.  
That is the nature of the beast.  
I am right to do that. 
As well we are going to put that specific committee in an extremely awkward position. 
It is one of the finest systems in the world. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I appreciate being given this time. 
From that point of view, I will speak in favour of the motion. 
I am going to speak in favour of it for two reasons.  
It would increase the value of the committee. 
In this case the committee could serve a very important role.  
Those questions may well spark a more intensive study by the auditor general. 
That is not happening enough right now. 
So what it is the purpose?  
In this case that function would be worthwhile. 
I congratulate the member brought forward Motion No. 73. 
It makes a lot of sense.  
They have lost their value, which is unfortunate. 
It could help to improve legislation. 
The legislation would be debated in the House of Commons. 
It would be better quality legislation.  
Probably it would be the defence committee.  
Personally, I would like to see this motion pass. 
I encourage all members to look at it. 
It does not say that there would be political interference in the decision. 
I appreciate having had the time to make this presentation. 
I encourage other members to allow this change to take place. 
It would increase the value of that committee. 
This kind of motion is to be applauded.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
This motion tries to address the lack of respectability that government and politicians have. 
I listened to the hon. member from the Liberal Party speak. 
Do not be afraid to put it on the plate for them. 
If it is not working, then let the public know. 
If it is working, let them know. 
We must let the public gain back some trust in the processes.  
I believe we have really good public servants. 
With the way things are now, that is impossible.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
I would suggest that is not the case.  
Unfortunately there does not seem to be openness when dealing with estimates. 
There does not seem to be openness when the minister appears before the committee. 
This is, in our estimation, a reasonable option under the circumstances.  
He is right, that is what the auditor general does.  
The auditor general provides a very valuable service. 
The problem is that no one listens to him on the government side. 
They do not listen to the auditor general. 
That is a lot of money. 
That is not true. 
The government talks about Canadians having a return on investment. 
Canadians need a return on their investment right now. 
This is one area in which this could begin. 
If the committee system worked it would not be necessary. 
If investigation by the auditor general worked it would not be necessary. 
We will be voting in favour of this motion. 
In closing I would like to cite two other examples. 
It was done by the Liberal government. 
I wish the government would only listen. 
It does not understand that what it is doing is wrong.  
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, it is simply unbelievable. 
He was talking about simple things. 
It is simply not true. 
The hon. gentleman, and I use that term very loosely, simply does not know. 
He indulges in rhetoric. 
He waves his arms like a big water buffalo, and I mean that amicably. 
Let us look at what we call the optics. 
How does it look? 
Au contraire, we know that they are accountable and they will continue to be accountable. 
His hon. colleague, the member for Compton-Stanstead, is a member of the DND committee. 
One example is proprietary interest. 
The system is transparent. 
There is only one question remaining. 
I believe they are and the government believes they are. 
The mechanisms which ensure fair, transparent and accessible procurement are in place.  
What does the author of this motion suggest? 
Is there no standing committee on national defence?  
The Canadian public disagrees and the military disagrees.  
Is there no Standing Committee on Public Accounts?  
My time has run out. 
In conclusion, let it be said that the government is opposed to the motion. 
We will oppose the motion because it is right that we oppose it.  
The hon. member is correct; his time has run out. 
CANADIAN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ACT, 1999 
BILL C-32-TIME ALLOCATION MOTION 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I move: 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
This Rio definition of sustainable development states the following: 
These two work hand in hand. 
Simply put, if the money is not there, we cannot and will not take action.  
The precautionary principle allows Canadians to proceed with caution in the interim phase. 
Protecting the environment affects all Canadians.  
This is simply far too open ended. 
The internationally accepted definition is: 
The proposed definition reads: 
Anything can be interpreted as having use or value. 
This definition of recyclable material is clearly unacceptable. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The House will now proceed to the debate on the motions in Group No. 5. 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.) moved:

Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
There are also some with which we disagree. 
It spent its time saying ``We will endeavour''. 
In life, either you act or you do not. 
I cannot help but note that this government did not even deign to act. 
They said ``We will perhaps act'' to justify their inaction.  
There is a lack of consistency. 
They cannot agree among themselves. 
But that is not what it is doing. 
I could provide other figures. 
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
These figures speak volumes. 
The figures may vary from year to year. 
Problematical mills for these three years add up to a total of 45. 
His report makes this very clear.  
I am not the one saying this, the commissioner is in his official report. 
The commissioner said that also.  
This does not come from me. 
The figures are clear, and that is what is happening.  
I admit there are problems at the federal level. 
We always hear the same tune.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The House will now proceed to the debate on the motions in Group No. 6. 
This group contains Motions Nos. 36 to 38, 41, 70 and 73.  
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP) moved: 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP) moved: 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
They relate to hormone disrupting substances.  
For example, all things concerning children are under provinces' jurisdiction. 
These areas are of no concern to the Minister of the Environment.  
They wanted to ensure freedom of choice. 
But enough is enough.  
In 1997, all of the provincial ministers of the Environment attended a meeting.  
They submitted a common proposal to the federal government. 
They had accomplished quite a feat. 
This was too much for the federal government; finally, there was a coalition. 
But the federal government, and Liberal members in particular, are quite touchy.  
What did they do? 
When they arrived in Kyoto, they took a completely opposite position. 
I believe we could have introduced a truly progressive act. 
We were prepared to do so. 
We wanted to finally have an act dealing with urgent problems. 
This is why we will be voting against Group No. 6 amendments.  
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
For clarification are we still on Group No. 5?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
No, we are now discussing Group No. 6. 
This actually replicates what we saw on an ongoing basis.  
There is a definition in the United States Environmental Protection Act. 
To use the words of the environment officials, it is indeed a very workable definition.  
The environment officials consider it to be very workable.  
This is a good initiative for the well-being of children.  
Children grow at a faster rate than adults do. 
The nervous system in particular can be greatly affected by exposure to some toxins. 
The metabolic pathways of newborns are not as sophisticated as those found in adults. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
The environment should be of utmost priority.  
The motions in Group No. 6 deal specifically with children. 
Let us put aside our federal and provincial differences. 
Let us look at our own homes, our children and grandchildren. 
We assume it is their natural growing and development curve.  
Children cannot speak for themselves. 
They may be adjacent to major industries and manufacturing companies. 
We must not overlook it. 
That is why I call for time to reflect at this time. 
A lot of this could be driven on the needs of the children. 
That is what the provisions in Group No. 6 highlight.  
We did not have an opportunity to speak on Group No. 5. 
Be careful on some of the amendments. 
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
It is still a matter of intense study and research. 
Hormones are produced and released into the blood stream by a variety of glands. 
Hormones are essential for regulating many of our biological processes. 
Our hormones and our glands together make up our endocrine system. 
Mr. Reginald Belair (Timmins-James Bay, Lib.):
The public must know the government takes their observations into account. 
We will now proceed to Statements by Members.

The hon. member for Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik.  
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
Keep up the good work serving the people of Canada.  
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
It is a tragic and senseless crime.  
Maybe they should do that.  
WORLD NO TOBACCO DAY 
Mrs. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, today is World No Tobacco Day.  
I rise today to speak on the occasion of World No Tobacco Day. 
This is not just a Liberal issue, a government issue or even a Canadian issue. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Kuwait is marking the new millennium in a special way. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
If one is a labour leader or an activist, one's life is in peril. 
If one does not agree with the establishment, one may disappear. 
WORLD NO TOBACCO DAY 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, today is World No Tobacco Day.  
At home, as in the rest of Canada, the job is not easy. 
They will be fruitless.  
ANNAPOLIS COUNTY SENIORS SAFETY PROGRAM 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
We need more education on the bad effects of illicit drugs. 
We need much improved rehabilitation initiatives. 
We need to consider addiction as a serious health concern. 
We need to seriously penalize non-addicted drug pushers. 
We need to clean up our prison drug problem. 
We need to co-ordinate federal, provincial and municipal programs. 
Most importantly, in the House we need to work together on this program now. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
People have wells that run dry in the summertime. 
It comes down to a matter of priorities. 
I have been pursuing this issue on the federal level. 
Where does the government put its priorities?  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
This institute becomes the 15th centre of excellence to receive funding from the federal government. 
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale, Lib.):
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Statistics Canada must put this right. 
Its reputation as a scientific agency hangs in the balance. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have been discussing that in the House. 
Every day the opposition has the opportunity to ask questions to the government. 
When we eventually adjourn, nothing will be different.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We know that very well.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Britain is talking about increasing its commitment to 50,000 troops. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is no plan to send invasion troops. 
That is why some 800 Canadians are moving there.  
We have not received any requests at this time for more troops. 
At this moment there is no plan for the invasion of Kosovo by anybody.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Once it was provided that proposal was accepted.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
The Prime Minister only won his riding by 1,600 votes. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
He should ask his own members about it.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, this is a rather obscure reply.

Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Will the Prime Minister be the villain or the hero in this story today? 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
I plead with the Prime Minister. 
Will he do that?  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
The principle of pollution prevention is a very important key to this legislation. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
My question is for the Minister of Environment. 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my supplementary is for the Prime Minister.  
What is missing is real leadership and real management. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is what we are doing. 
There will be no more talking. 
It contains 240 amendments.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The member should withdraw that because it is not true.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
That is a small point the Prime Minister forgot to mention.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):

Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
We must not impute motive in any way. 
I see the Prime Minister is on his feet. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, they still use the words that are not reality. 
It was bought for cash. 
The lease was for $1 and he found the money to pay for it.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the facts speak for themselves. 
The Prime Minister has sullied his office through this dirty deal. 
There is a huge difference between- 
I want the hon. member to go directly to his question.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is a great success. 
I will keep fighting and working for them.

I asked her a question about money, tax money.  
I ask her again. 
How much will the magazine deal cost taxpayers of the country?  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member talks about blowing money. 
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
This is very important.  
This government is taking significant steps to- 
The hon. member for Churchill River.  
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
When it comes to the environment, this Liberal government is all talk and no action. 
Bill C-32 is for pollution prevention. 
This does not stop pollution. 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
It is legislation based on a pollution prevention principle. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
In addition to that, they support gun registration.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, some of these people are voters. 
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
We have revoked 191 other licences for public safety reasons. 
That is more than 1,300 potentially dangerous gun sales blocked to date.  
That is what developing a culture of safety and responsibility is about. 
I remind hon. members not to use papers as props. 
The hon. member for Lanark-Carleton.  
Mr. Ian Murray (Lanark-Carleton, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry.  
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Hopefully the review will lead to Canadian contracts. 
The accusations were totally false.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Carmen Provenzano (Sault Ste. Marie, Lib.):
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
I want to thank the hon. member for his support on this issue.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Will he make that commitment now? 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
I respect Saskatchewan farmers.  
We will continue to work with them. 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
I hope this time the answer will be more intelligent.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.  
The Liberal government has perverted the Canadian justice system. 
It has no case against pay equity. 
It is using the appeal process as a stalling tactic. 
The only people who win are the lawyers.  
Mr. Speaker, unfortunately I think that the opposition has not yet listened correctly.  
Why would the government not give equity to both our employees and the taxpayers?  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
Mr. Raymond Bonin (Nickel Belt, Lib.):
PROCEEDS OF CRIME (MONEY LAUNDERING) ACT 
Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay-Boundary-Okanagan, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions to present today. 
The first petition concerns the Firearms Act. 
Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay-Boundary-Okanagan, Ref.):
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
They find the housing conditions in Nunavik extremely troubling. 
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE 
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
The petitioners are from Edmonton, Alberta and Kapuskasing, Ontario. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have before me this afternoon two petitions.  
They believe that, once regulated, they will become cost prohibitive. 
They also believe that their freedom of choice will be impeded. 
Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the second petition deals with firearms control.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
They are asking that this be rescinded.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Question No. 193- Mr. Jim Jones: 
In some cases external industry specialist assistance is obtained.  
The bank emphasizes requirements for audited financial data. 
This is similar to processes conducted by other commercial lending institutions in North America.  
(ii) BDC does not provide grants or subsidies. 
Branches may service more than one riding. 
(v) (a) The Techno-net loan was recently launched. 
Question No. 232- Mr. John Duncan: 
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Ahousat-Gambier Island-Piers Island-Southbank, Francois Lake, 
Eastbourne-Masset-Sicamous-Victoria and Esquimalt 
Mr. Speaker, I would ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
CANADIAN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ACT, 1999 
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
It came up with a half-baked position at the very last minute. 
We should also consider what happened after the Rio de Janeiro summit. 
And the federal government wants us to trust it. 
It wants us to believe it will pass definitive legislation on the environment.  
Otherwise, as we have said, we are going to have to vote against it.  
The NDP is trying to do the same to certain regulatory powers. 
This is unnecessary in our view.  
Over 360 Canadian researchers will be participating in the various research studies. 
All provinces were covered in the announcement.  
The following are some of the projects:
We have learned the lessons from the past. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
The bill is a very significant piece of legislation. 
More than 560 amendments were drafted for consideration. 
A child's environment is affected even before birth.  
Environment is very important for children.  
Environment is a very important issue. 
This is very important.  
Sometimes children are forgotten members of society. 
We do not consider them when we are making decisions. 
It is very important that we consider children. 
This should be acceptable to members of the House. 
It is important to recognize this is a precautionary measure. 
This is a principle we must look at.  
We must recognize environment is an issue that should be of concern to us worldwide.  
We are dropping bombs that are polluting water resources. 
I will tell the House a bit about depleted uranium. 
Upon impact depleted uranium bursts into flames. 
Mr. Ian Murray (Lanark-Carleton, Lib.):
(4) the most dangerous toxic substances will be virtually eliminated.  
These are 20 good reasons why I support Bill C-32. 
They are 20 reasons why all members should support the bill. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Furthermore economic growth was directly linked to technological development all over the world.  
In this context, it is unavoidable that we will face many environmental crises. 
It cannot be avoided, it is part of reality. 
That is why we have to protect ourselves.  
It is important to look carefully at the net results of the government's commitment.  
I think it is important to deal with the issue of climate change. 
Its record speaks for itself.  
At that time the message from Berlin was loud and clear. 
The Kyoto conference is another important event. 
That conference could have allowed Canada to influence the future.  
That is not enough. 
Quebec said so over and over again. 
On the issue of climate changes, Quebec has met its commitments. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
The French and English came afterward. 
We are here to talk about something equally important. 
It is virtual elimination, not a total phase-out.  
We are not talking about children yet which this particular clause is about. 
The question is what is being done with that information? 
The environmental commissioner said it is being ignored completely. 
The government whitewashes it, gets rid of it. 
The government talks and talks and nothing happens.  
I have not seen any changes on that.  
A lot of people outside of the House are watching this debate today. 
It is not surprising that the government does not understand what is going on. 
At least these three people listen. 
At least these three Liberals understand environmental concerns. 
Members of the Reform Party of Canada support things like virtual elimination. 
That shows exactly who is buttering their bread, and that is industry. 
It does not care about the environment. 
It has been decided to put $62 million in to move some families. 
We have not heard them say that. 
We have been talking about the tar ponds for years and years. 
People are getting very sick. 
The sad thing is people are now saying- 
You just voted against time allocation.  
It was watered down went it left committee.  
Why was that done? 
It is quite simple. 
I know the parliamentary secretary will not get an opportunity to respond. 
Perhaps she can do that afterward over coffee.  
I could go on for days on this subject. 
I wish we still had those days.  
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
Right off, I would point out that our party is very aware of environmental issues. 
To those watching us, you heard correctly, 580 amendments. 
First of all, there is the whole question of harmonization with the provinces. 
We all know the legal implication of such words as ``endeavour'', ``attempt'' or ``try''. 
We will continue our work in our riding offices, we will keep on meeting people. 
In the end, who pays for such overlap and duplication? 
It is the same person. 
Taxpayers are tired of paying. 
They want us to avoid overlap and duplication.  
We Bloc Quebecois members cannot accept that. 
We believe that the people whom we represent are paying enough taxes. 
They are fed up with their level of taxation.  
In one of its amendments, the Bloc Quebecois proposes that the word ``endeavour'' be deleted. 
I will try to hurry to say all that I have to say. 
Clause 9 of the bill reads as follows: 
I respectfully beg to differ. 
All this government is looking for is confrontation with the provinces, not just with Quebec. 
The federal government is lord and master. 
The provinces are valets and branch plants. 
We and our constituents cannot accept this.  
We feel that the federal government does not have exclusive jurisdiction over the environment. 
This paragraph is therefore unacceptable to us.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
There are numerous indications of problems which result while children are in utero. 
We do not let pedophiles hang around schoolyards. 
However, toxins are knocking children off left, right and centre. 
They cannot do this because it is federal. 
They cannot do this because it is provincial. 
We do not do that in Canada.  
They increase the amount of nicotine to make it addictive. 
The health minister said there was not enough proof. 
The lives of Canadian children were put at risk for another year. 
It did not want to upset industry by saying that a product was bad. 
Maybe I can send them as a gift to the health minister.  
We knew that in some countries other things were being done. 
Why take the chance? 
It just went ahead and did whatever. 
No one would be put at risk. 
We would be ensuring that one extra step toward protection.  
We must not allow this skirting around of the issue. 
I encourage everyone to support our amendments. 
Let us put a piece of environmental legislation through that will protect Canadians.  
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
The first white men came to our country. 
They took everything the Indians had. 
Now, they want this country, this land. 
I have 64 grandchildren in the Yukon. 
I worry about them. 
Where are the grandparents of the white kids? 
The native people should have their own land''. 
I think this excerpt helps put things in perspective. 
Of course, there is something symbolic in all this. 
Maybe some facts are not absolutely exact. 
They always had the greatest respect for the environment. 
What happened after white people came to this country? 
Well things began to deteriorate.  
Instead, they are getting worse. 
A while ago I mentioned the Yukon. 
Traces of mercury have even been found in breast milk. 
That is something we often hear, and the situation is far from improving.  
We have nothing to be proud of. 
This is utterly deplorable.  
This strategy is rather crooked. 
I saw that with the Nisga'a. 
They are going to find they have very little left.  
This is very important in today's context.  
The aboriginal peoples' environmental expertise must be acknowledged. 
The oral nature of their traditions must be addressed. 
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP):
Who wants to open up shop on contaminated land?  
Children are at special risk from the effects of pollution. 
Independent sources confirm that the true picture is much worse.  
That means clean streets, clean soil and clean water.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
Non-living and living elements must be respected.  
Following the 1997 election, we were given a third Minister of the Environment. 
Clearly there is a lack of responsibility.  
He was, with Lucien Bouchard, one of the best Ministers of the Environment. 
I would like to salute him in this House. 
A total of 580 amendments have been introduced. 
Finally, the committee managed to pass some 160 amendments.  
The government, with its 156 members, does not enjoy a huge majority. 
I would like to quote a short paragraph about the dissident members: 
Liberal members have also targeted a number of bills. 
The ministers that are more responsive- 
As a result, 233 amendments of all kinds have been introduced.  
They have twisted the arm of the hon. member for Davenport, a former environment minister.  
Our environment has four non-living elements: air, water, soil, and light. 
The soil is under provincial jurisdiction. 
Quebec is a leader on environmental matters.  
We look after our environment.  
We also know water flows downhill, not uphill.  
We doubt the government is very serious about the environment. 
It was outside its jurisdiction, but it got in through its spending power. 
We told Jean Monty ``Look after your employees instead''. 
Look after you company, Bell Canada. 
As members know, this is a provincial jurisdiction.  
Now, the government is duplicating structures in the environmental sector. 
An agreement was reached over the years.  
The situation is similar here.  
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
Those are just different sides of the same coin. 
Over the last years the Liberal government has withdrawn funding from study in the Arctic.  
At present no universities have cold rooms. 
The University of Alberta is actually reactivating its cold room. 
We need that research. 
The north is disproportionately affected by them. 
They do not have the capacity to deal with them. 
It is kind of tenuous to think of their connection with life in the north.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
I am well placed to speak about this. 
Meeting goals is not the main problem these people have. 
They are faced with two kinds of problems. 
They often have two sets of goals to meet. 
All this does not seem to bother the federal government too much. 
The federal government no longer cares about respecting jurisdictions. 
It has not acted as a leader in that area. 
The same holds true for human rights.  
We see here what we have seen on several other issues. 
It is also true for the environment, as we can see. 
In Quebec, we have a completely different view.  
It is the one closest to them. 
It is a framework that stakeholders know better. 
This trend will bring the federal government to play a greater role. 
And this is only the beginning. 
The federal government has one great quality, it is very patient. 
These will not necessarily be passed by the members, but rather by cabinet.  
Otherwise, we will have to vote against this bill.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Is it because we are constantly concerned by the constitutional issue? 
There is a whole social context involved.  
Important changes have been made.  
I have never seen anything like it anywhere else in Canada.  
Did we hear loud protests because of the dangers of such cuts? 
I am proud of what the Government of Quebec has done in many fields. 
There is a vigilance that could not be ensured otherwise.  
-the federal minister, of course- 
We can see what a lovely thing we have here. 
The minister goes into a company and finds the levels too high. 
The environment is an extremely serious matter. 
Canada is far from being a leader in this area, as we know. 
We saw that in Kyoto, where it backtracked instead of advancing. 
No one is sure that the new objectives set will be attained. 
This bill is not a guarantee in any way whatsoever. 
This is a Quebec matter, unfortunately, but that is how it is. 
I will close with a general remark. 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
I would just like to pay tribute to these people who have shown great tenacity. 
This goes to show how persevering they have been.  
Personally, I had to get involved. 
It is the activities taking place outside that pose a problem. 
They literally shell Lake Saint-Pierre. 
A large number of these shells are live. 
The shelling takes place in winter and summer. 
In the summer, shells fall directly into the water and sink to the bottom. 
In the winter, they stay on the ice. 
A tragedy occurred in 1982. 
Other similar incidents could occur. 
It is urgent that the government take action.  
We personally would have preferred it be put in effect immediately. 
Lake Saint-Pierre is in fact an extraordinary ecosystem. 
This is what the future holds for the Canadian provinces. 
It has no choice.  
This is what Canada must do. 
The federal minister, of course.  
The federal government is free to interfere in provincial matters. 
The other provinces may feel this is a good thing. 
But this is quite upsetting to Quebec as a nation.  
This is not the first time that such an attempt is made. 
We have to realize that. 
This is where the government machinery is really efficient.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Have the various measures been properly harmonized?  
I will first talk about this issue regarding the quality of the bill. 
At the end of these three hours, nothing had been accomplished. 
I realize these issues are complex. 
The bill touches on a great many areas. 
It touches on land, water and air. 
It deals with all kinds of pollutants, gaseous, liquid, solid, radioactive, living or inert pollutants. 
It touches on energy issues. 
It touches on shipping, road transportation. 
It touches on everything.  
This is not where the problem lies. 
The problem is that they are being badly addressed. 
It would be too risky.  
This bill addresses areas that must be of great concern to us, without resolving them. 
It would not be so bad if we could get off.  
Bill C-32 could have the same effect as a steamroller.  
The bill does not respect that principle. 
In short, the bill must be rejected for two reasons. 
First, it is bad legislation. 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
This organization has a budget of $40 million. 
This has to last three years. 
It was high time. 
There is an increase in breast cancer. 
I know that there is private research into these questions going on in certain laboratories. 
Finally, with much ceremony, the government announces that grants will be handed out. 
That is why we are saying it was high time.  
We have such people among our colleagues. 
What effect will this have on a child's health? 
Where does this mercury come from? 
That is why we are saying it is high time. 
This bill is inconsistent. 
Why not start again from scratch? 
There is nothing wrong with that.  
We on this side of the House are nobody's fools. 
Let me provide a little background on Bill C-32. 
This tactic by the Liberal government is another move towards excessive centralization.  
This is unacceptable when the health of people is at stake. 
It is our children who must grow up in that environment.  
Is the House ready for the question?  
The House will now proceed to the debate on the motions in Group No. 7. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP) moved: 
That Bill C-32, in Clause 118, be amended 
( a ) by replacing line 1 on page 88 with the following: 
(1) The Governor in Council may, on the'' 
( b ) by adding after line 32 on page 88 the following: 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.) moved: 
That Bill C-32, in Clause 118, be amended 
( a ) by replacing line 1 on page 88 with the following: 
(1) The Governor in Council may, on the'' 
``of a process of degrading or altering, an'' 
( c ) by adding after line 32 on page 88 the following: 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC) moved: 
``laws or does not do so, the Minister shall recommend regulations to the Governor'' 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC) moved: 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.) moved: 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ) moved: 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC) moved: 
``phasing out the export of hazardous waste for final'' 
``disposal to a destination other than the United States, the Minister may require an export-'' 
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Why then does industry lobby for a further obstacle and delay? 
Why does industry lobby for imposing a further delay on this rather important step?  
Who raised this concern? 
It is clearly the role of the Minister of the Environment to take preventive actions. 
For all of these reasons, regretfully, I will have to vote against these two motions.  
It is brand new. 
Yet it has appeared in the name of the Minister of the Environment. 
The Minister of the Environment would no longer have a role to play. 
On whose side will the minister be?  
I hope it is not proceeded with at report stage tonight.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
Group No. 7 contains 15 motions.  
I will summarize the position of the Bloc Quebecois with respect to these motions. 
I am surprised to see the Reform Party doing this. 
What is going on? 
Are people going to be allowed to do as they please with hazardous waste? 
It will be anarchy. 
Is that what the Reform Party member wants? 
Why have redundancy within the bill? 
They are along the same lines as the motions moved by the Reform Party member. 
My goodness, this motion is more than just nebulous, it is unacceptable.  
Let us also look at Motion No. 186 with respect to clause 166. 
It puts the responsibility of the Minister of the Environment onto the governor in council.  
Then there is Motion No. 192 to amend clause 176. 
This amendment would have the minister report to governor in council. 
It being along the same lines, we also object to it.  
We have plenty of duplication already. 
Enough, now some very positive action must be taken.  
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
That position was created by the government.  
Twenty three thousand substances must be examined. 
There are strict time lines in the CEPA legislation. 
Pollution prevention is enshrined in the legislation. 
Let us talk about some other motions before us at the present time. 
There are 24 regulations under the existing CEPA. 
These regulations cover a wide variety of toxic substances and pollutants. 
They have eliminated the use of lead in gasoline. 
These are good things.  
Bill C-32 removes this requirement for concurrence. 
We will have to do better. 
This bill will allow us to do better.  
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
The vote should be split on the two motions. 
It is purely a technical change.  
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on the same point of order. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
All this could be left to the other place. 
I will take the matter under advisement. 
The voting will begin shortly. 
I thank hon. members for their intervention. 
The hon. member for Churchill River has the floor.  
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak in the remaining moments of the debate. 
As we all know, debate is limited. 
This is environment week. 
Ontario is number one at importing toxic waste. 
We can take that as a fact. 
All these industries have found a safe haven in Ontario. 
It is the fault of the Ontario government and the federal government. 
There are great gaps as opposed to overlaps, as the minister has addressed.  
I want to highlight in retrospect all these amendments that come into play. 
Phase-out is a major component of pollution prevention.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC) moved: 
That Bill C-32, in Clause 210, be amended 
( b ) by replacing line 23 on page 152 with the following: 
``the Ministers and that other minister may make an order'' 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.) moved: 
``prepare and cause to be laid before each House of Parliament'' 
And the bells having rung: 
The question is on Motion No. 1. 
(The House divided on Motion No. 1, which was negatived on the following division:)
