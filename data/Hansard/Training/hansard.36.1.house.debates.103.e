EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 103 
Monday, May 11, 1998 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
(b) Motion No. 7 will be voted on separately.  
``Special Crops Board referred'' 
``Crops Board may be entitled'' 
``49.02 (1) The Minister shall establish a'' 
``(2) The Special Crops Board'' 
``Special Crops Board shall be'' 
I speak primarily about the issue of the negative option billing.  
I do not see that in the way the amendment is written. 
Fortunately the government saw the wisdom of clarifying that and actually excluded them. 
What does Bill C-26 do? 
The present enforcement mechanisms in the act are much too limited in scope. 
Most of the mechanisms are too harsh and costly to impose. 
What do our motions in Group No. 1 actually do? 
We have put forward a group of amendments. 
We have seen that with the Canadian Wheat Board. 
They are only in an advisory capacity. 
Certainly we have seen that with the Canadian Wheat Board. 
It is the farmers' money. 
That is basically the thrust of Reform's motions contained in Group No. 1. 
I certainly urge all members to seriously consider these amendments.  
They are amendments not just put forward by the official opposition. 
We heard from a lot of producer groups concern on the part of farmers. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
The committee in fact looked into the issues of concern. 
The government actually provided some good, sound amendments in this piece of legislation.  
The majority of the stakeholders who appeared wanted this system to be voluntary.  
I will speak to this later.  
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
It follows years of consultation but some improvements are needed. 
Special crops are of growing importance in western Canada. 
There are several reasons why both these recommendations make good sense. 
I congratulate the member for bringing them forward.  
Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
I wish to start on a positive basis. 
We think those changes are taking us in the right direction. 
Certainly we will support that motion.  
I will take the next three or four minutes to explain why.  
We support the so-called mandatory refundable approach. 
This is why we are doing it.  
There was reference made that somehow a fund would be created by the bill. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. 
This is an insurance plan; nothing more and nothing less. 
If they are talking about a fund that is factually incorrect.  
This is not analogous. 
A number of spokespersons for the industry have told us that.  
This would be an unnecessary cost. 
To some extent it would be very difficult.  
Is it not interesting. 
The advisory committee will work very well. 
It will have a majority of producers. 
It will speak for producers and it will speak for the industry.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
It is astounding how the listening apparatus of a human ear is so different. 
When the witnesses were before us we never heard anything about an advisory board. 
Who is it in this bill that is going to give advice? 
It is the minister again.  
It did not need an advisory board.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:
We elected them but who shut their mouths? 
It is really astounding. 
What a difference in farmers from Ontario and from western Canada. 
The special crops industry is a tremendous boon to the western agricultural industry. 
If it were not for the special crops industry, farmers would be starving today. 
It will become a special crops industry. 
It has become so non-profitable that farmers have refused to grow it.  
They want a voluntary insurance and licensing agency. 
What do they mean by voluntary? 
However, they have not been given that opportunity or will not be given that opportunity. 
They will not have the opportunity to run their business as they see fit.  
What did this government do? 
It sent the RCMP after these poor farmers because they were being successful. 
That is illegal in this country according to this democratic Liberal government. 
Now the government wants to over-regulate it again.  
That is what farmers object to. 
What have farmers done all their lives? 
They have worked as a unit. 
Farmers will try these new products. 
I urge government members to finally sit up and listen to western Canada. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Why are there so many special crops now being grown on the prairies? 
That is why they want special crops.  
We are not talking about elections. 
The motions which my hon. friend put forth are not about elections. 
That is what the industry opposes. 
That is what the canola seed people oppose. 
They do not want to be regulated by this government. 
The message is clear and simple. 
The Canadian Canola Growers Association will submit two lists to the minister of agriculture. 
It will do the election for each special crop group. 
The sunflower growers will do the same thing. 
The people who produce the peas will do the same. 
But we have a problem here. 
It is not a problem for the producers. 
It is not a problem for them at all. 
The problem lies on the opposite side. 
It is what if they are not Liberals. 
That is the problem. 
That is what this and all these motions are all about.  
That is the bottom line. 
Even a kid in grade four could understand it.  
I see the parliamentary secretary does not understand. 
He wants to talk about elections. 
We are not talking about expensive elections. 
Now there is no more wheat in most of the crops there. 
That is exactly what we are talking about. 
That is exactly what they are saying.  
Do they have the courage to support this resolution? 
Madam Speaker, I am not sure I can follow that rousing debate. 
I might be a little shorter on history than some of the members opposite.  
We want to address the amendments to Bill C-26 today. 
There is the problem. 
That is why we brought forward these amendments to the act. 
That makes perfect sense. 
That is what western Canadian farmers would understand. 
They could trust a system like that. 
I think that is all western producers are asking. 
They want things like this and they need them. 
If we give this to them, they will be pleased and they will work hard.  
My riding of Lethbridge in southern Alberta has a wide range of agricultural components. 
It starts in the Rocky Mountains and goes out on to the plains. 
Specialty crops are an order of the day. 
Most specialty crops are grown in the area I come from.  
Even the sunflower producers on Bow Island grow them. 
This started out as a small business and now it is huge. 
We have to stop government interference. 
This makes a lot of sense. 
I am sure the government, when it reconsiders this, will support it. 
This is what we are asking for.  
They need special treatment. 
The weather is critical. 
Some are more fragile than others. 
It is important that people on the board know all the conditions.  
The motions in Group 1 that we have put forth are good motions. 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Farmers now have a tremendous amount of money being expended every year. 
It has been a closed shop. 
I do not know that it has done a very good job.  
It is not very much different from what we are talking about today. 
They will pay all the costs involved in this board. 
Why should they not have a direct incentive and direct say in how it works?  
I want to point out another reason I think that is important. 
My friend, Dexter Smith of Peace River, has done just that. 
He has to find his own markets. 
The Canadian Wheat Board does not do his marketing for him. 
The government is standing in their way in many cases.  
The Canadian Wheat Board does not offer any elevators to take the specialty crop. 
There are no elevators in Alberta to take it. 
He has to find his own markets. 
He has to arrange for the transportation. 
Yet what do we have? 
The Canadian Wheat Board standing in his way, inhibiting his ability.  
That will get in the way of the people in the industry. 
It seems to me that is a reasonable request which has to be considered.  
That is not the case any more. 
I would maintain not that much. 
That is the exact approach we do not want.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
It is not true, and the parliamentary secretary knows it. 
I am very disappointed he would go to those lengths to try to frighten people. 
It certainly does not do him or his government any credit.  
Does that matter to the government? 
It does not need the advice of producers. 
Heavens no, that would be terrible. 
We know how the government feels about advice. 
When will the government get that through its head?  
The freshwater fish association.  
Mr. Speaker, my friend mentions the freshwater fish association. 
It is not true.  
Maybe the minister will choose one of them. 
I do not think that is radical. 
That is exactly what the witnesses are asking. 
That is exactly what the government has done many times in the past.  
They are the ones who know how. 
They have a stake in it. 
It just does not make any sense.  
They will do exactly what they want. 
I encourage members across the way to support the motions.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The question is on Motion No. 1. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The recorded division on Motion No. 1 stands deferred. 
The recorded division will also apply to Motions Nos. 5, 8, 9, 10 and 11. 
The next question is on Motion No. 7. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
( Motion No. 7 agreed to) 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there consent for the hon. member to move the motions?  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC) moved: 
Subject to subsection (2.2), 
This resolution aptly describes what Bill C-26 fails to do. 
I have studied it. 
We could be talking about hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
This is not a fund. 
Under the insurance scheme, I think we have 11 recognized special crops. 
What would be done then?  
This way there will have to be a conscious decision. 
I will begin with something he said a minute ago. 
They make hundreds of thousands, even millions of dollars of decisions every year. 
I have with me Bill C-26 which would amend the Canada Grain Act. 
That is just common sense.  
Consumer sovereignty, what a novel idea. 
That is what it should be doing.  
That is what people want. 
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
The government says this insurance program is voluntary.  
As we have heard and as is clear, that is not quite true. 
As I have said, this is what producers through their commodity organizations have requested.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
I think that spells disaster.  
The parliamentary secretary indicated that the government would listen and act in good faith. 
We should accommodate their wishes and pass these amendments.  
That is the traditional Liberal approach in both social and economic matters. 
I still have the possibility of raising a product and selling it. 
The auctioneer says sold, I get all my money and that is it, finished. 
Actually we have had to fight this fight on several occasions. 
It will be contaminated with the product already in the system. 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
This is absolutely appalling.  
This is an opportunity to have a very strong set of regulations in this area. 
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
Donations can be made at any TD bank in Canada.  
They are fighting the difficult battle against ignorance with respect to mental illness.  
No fear Mr. Minister. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
They say they are being hushed up.  
Why is the government trying to silence the victims of hepatitis C? 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Canada is graced by a diversity, tolerance- 
We are going to try to sort that out.  
The hon. Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.  
It is now at the lowest rate in eight years.  
Now we are waiting for the position of all our partners to be determined.  
This person should be independent minded and should not be a hand picked Liberal appointee.  
The hon. members across ask what the job description is. 
Clearly Canadians are not happy with an unelected, unaccountable upper chamber.  
As Prime Minister, I can make it happen''.  
Since then, however, it has slashed funding to education, social assistance and health. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will certainly take account of what the member says. 
We put forward that money to help the fishermen through a difficult time.  
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are well aware of the situation. 
We intend to address the post-TAGS environment very well. 
It is regarding the way government may regulate herbs and teas in the future.  
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
It specifically shows in the comments to the groupings of the amendments before us.  
I heard a comment the other day that seemed to fit my point. 
The answer I overheard was telling.  
His pronouncements in the House about it betray him. 
It is obvious attention is not given to the independence of this House. 
After that Mr. Bell waited another month for more diagnostic services. 
It is quite simply unacceptable. 
This is not what Canadians want.  
This is also unacceptable. 
This is not the Canadian way.  
The Liberal government is doing nothing about it. 
What answer does he have for Mr. Bell?  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
A motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.54 p.m.)
