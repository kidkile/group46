Tuesday, September 29, 1998 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have several petitions to present today. 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions to present this morning. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the second petition comes primarily from residents of Mount Albert, Ontario.  
Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):
They total approximately 450 signatures.  
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):

Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Mr. Gar Knutson (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
BILL C-3-TIME ALLOCATION MOTION 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I move: 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
I am sure there are hon. members who wish to debate this bill.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
I remind hon. members that there are lobbies where these discussions can take place. 
The hon. member for Waterloo-Wellington has the floor.  
However some members continue to discount this fact. 
I quote the hon. Martin Taylor when he said: 
The hon. Claude Bisson said the following in his legal opinion: 
Bill C-3 strikes this proper balance.  
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
Such means of rebuttal are generally not available to the defence. 
That is the danger presented by this kind of legislation.  
That is my only concern. 
As for the rest, the principles, I am in favour.  
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Protecting Canadians is and always has been a priority for this government. 
It will help them to protect Canadians while upholding the law.  
Extensive consultation went into the creation of this bill. 
The bill has been drafted to reflect their contributions and their concerns.  
I have felt this way too. 
However, in responding to this argument there are a few things to keep in mind.  
Finally, Bill C-3 is an important first step. 
This is ground breaking legislation that requires a cautious approach. 
Bill C-3 is a good start. 
However, I also believe that a person is innocent until proven guilty. 
That is something I could not support.  
It will do the same for all communities right across this great land of ours.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Today what do they do? 
The same thing, they put closure. 
No wonder Canadians find respect for politicians at the bottom of professions.  
The parliamentary secretary did mention certain things as being the first step. 
The Young Offenders Act is watered down. 
Bill C-68 is watered down. 
On that this government has a terrible record.  
This can be achieved only by strengthening our law enforcement agencies. 
That is extremely important to recognize. 
Bill C-3 has offences that are split into two groups. 
The first group automatically leads to DNA testing. 
Does Bill C-3 under the current act fulfil this needed desire?  
A fingerprint is from our body. 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour, Lib.):
That makes me very sad. 
I understand this has been a very big plank in the Reform Party's platform. 
As a government we cannot behave like that. 
We must be respectful of Canadian citizens whom we represent.  
However he said it with such disdain and negativity. 
That is unfortunate because we cannot continue to do that. 
We have to move ahead. 
We have to do things that are right for Canadians and that will help them.  
Reform says that this is a false sense of security. 
We said yes, we believe in this concept. 
We agree that we need tools to fight crime. 
We support this concept. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
That statement is unfounded and untrue.  
If this legislation is made really tough, then the government will get our support.  
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
It really reflects Canadians' viewpoints.  
We must therefore act with the utmost care.  
I would first like to raise the issue of keeping the samples. 
Bill C-3 provides therefore that samples will be kept. 
I repeat, personal information will be protected under this law. 
Clearly, the bill has been drafted with extreme care. 
In addition, Canadian forensic laboratories are in the process of drawing up accreditation standards. 
In fact, crime scenes do not always yield DNA evidence. 
They unanimously upheld the government's position. 
We want to take the approach most favourable to all Canadians.  
Mrs. Judi Longfield (Whitby-Ajax, Lib.):
The warrant system is working well. 
With reasonable and probable grounds warrants will be issued.  
I know that all members of this House support the maintenance of a DNA bank.  
I am supporting this legislation because it is preventive in nature. 
This makes Bill C-3 very special.  
This deterrent is pure prevention.  
I agree with Chief Ford. 
Our police forces need this bill. 
I have felt this also. 
I think that is something we need to work out.  
I think they have valid concerns. 
However, I think we have to do it one step at a time. 
A fingerprint is one form of identification and it is very narrow in its scope. 
This also raises other concerns. 
This has been going on for a long period of time. 
Madam Speaker, how much time do I have left?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Madam Speaker, I will not be using all of the 11 minutes remaining.  
The results of DNA testing could bring some very difficult questions forward. 
This raises some questions that need to be dealt with.  
There have been some very critical issues raised. 
We have to remember that.  
This is something that we need to continue to monitor. 
I think it is worthy of continued debate as we go along. 
I would like to congratulate the members of the committee. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there unanimous consent to proceed as such?  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
They are not perfect. 
The data bank is there to help the police in their investigative process.  
Upon conviction is a totally different story.  
That would be the other point. 
Should it simply be done upon an individual being detained? 
What do we do concerning people coming into this country? 
The potential for abuse is serious. 
It is not a step we need to take.  
That's a red herring.  
That is one of the differences in this country. 
We do not knee jerk. 
We do not have an over reaction or a simplistic solution.  
In this case there is a definite comparison. 
Clearly, the sample can be taken if police obtain a warrant to do so. 
What is involved in the process? 
We are going to be tough.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, does the member understand what is in the bill? 
That is why I said his comments were a red herring.  
How can the member square the round peg he has created?  
That is the critical distinction the member so easily overlooked.  
They will know who they are looking for. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
The speakers this morning have been waxing rather eloquent. 
They have said that taking these samples would ``undermine human dignity''. 
The public at large assumes that means 25 years. 
The Canadian Police Association knows what it is talking about. 
The signatory, Neal Jessop, the president of the Canadian Police Association, wrote: 
The CPA has lobbied for the creation of a DNA data bank for many years. 
Consider the following scenario. 
Any woman this individual encounters will be at risk. 
This is unacceptable because it is entirely preventable. 
This issue is paramount to Canadian police officers, and by virtue the CPA. 
Do not underestimate the importance of this issue to the CPA. 
We will do that again regarding Bill C-3. 
Despite contradictory rhetoric from the Department of Justice, it is an achievable goal. 
He has said that this bill will pass as it presently is. 
It is going to cost $5,000 each.  
I find this number to be somewhat suspicious. 
The Liberals got everyone on side with the $85 million. 
They got a fair number of people on side with that lowball number.  
As a matter of fact I choose to call it Canada's legal system. 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
I would like the hon. member to make a comment. 
I wonder if the hon. member would comment on that.  
Madam Speaker, I really respect the intervention by the member. 
I know she feels very strongly that way. 
The vast majority of Canadians highly value that document, as they should.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
This ongoing government position really astounds me. 
That is absolutely asinine. 
Why would we not go all the way with DNA? 
I lay that completely at the feet of the former justice minister. 
I have absolutely no idea.  
Let me state our position very clearly. 
Madam Speaker, I think that is an outstanding idea, absolutely. 
That is an effective and intelligent use of Canadian taxpayer money.  
Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time. 
DNA sampling is an important and powerful investigative tool. 
As such, Bill C-3 must reflect the state of our constitutional law. 
The taking of samples would occur only following conviction.  
However, that did not end the matter. 
Not only was this wrong, it seemed to miss the point. 
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the member's speech. 
Paul Bernardo did not have a criminal conviction. 
He would not have been in the DNA databank.  
I challenge the Liberals on this. 
They are afraid of a constitutional challenge in the supreme court. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
It was joined by the hon. member for Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough in a similar practice.  
I am a lawyer.  
That gives you a prerogative.  
That is not the point. 
Those are the rights of all Canadian citizens whom we are trying to protect.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am glad to have the opportunity to speak in this debate. 
I sympathize with what they are saying, but I cannot support it. 
And this is me speaking, not the government. 
Actually, there had been a problem. 
The problem with DNA sampling is that it is the ultimate fingerprint.  
One can see where this could be an enormous crime fighting tool.  
But a DNA sample is like a tattoo that we all carry. 
This is where the difficulty comes about. 
It was only 55 years ago that a similar tattooing procedure existed in Europe. 
These undesirables were Jews, gypsies and the mentally infirm.  
We know where that led in the end. 
It was a systematic genocide. 
It was conducted with the agreement of the state, using police forces.  
It is an ethical issue that disturbs me. 
I would think the Jewish community might have something to say about this whole question.  
The billboards occurred during the election campaign. 
They were propaganda and they lied.  
During an election we accept a bit of stretching the truth. 
This is an issue of great concern to parliamentarians. 
I cannot interfere in a police investigation or with the courts. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
My question specifically relates to this legislation. 
We know that DNA evidence is inculpatory as well as exculpatory. 
It is evidence that can be used to free individuals, not only to convict them.  
Intrusiveness for an individual charged and arrested? 
This hypothesis was brought forward by the police community.  
This scenario is a real one. 
It is something that will happen without a doubt.  
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
I think it is totally irrational.  
I think that is a principle we can all agree with.  
I question whether seizing DNA is really an invasion of a person's privacy. 
It is very similar to fingerprinting, for instance. 
It is probably one of the best tools we have.  
It is a sample of hair or saliva. 
The hon. member for Wentworth-Burlington can have a brief reply.  
I would not support it.  
We are into 10 minute speeches without questions or comments.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
I think I have heard it all in here today. 
I want to talk a little about some of the comments in a minute. 
I will tell members the effects that will have on our country. 
Keep those three categories in mind here.  
I have long talked to the government about increasing security there. 
There was not one DNA sample taken from this person.  
Perhaps they do not have enough prisons in their ridings. 
Perhaps it has not affected them like it has many of us. 
However, this DNA sample is important. 
What is wrong over there with the mentality? 
``This could lead to the atrocities of Nazi Germany''. 
I cannot believe Liberal members actually believe that. 
In my community we have people who are victims every single week.  
That is out of the blue. 
When is the time to make a decision? 
How many people in my riding have to suffer as a result of indecision? 
Are all these opposition parties here crazy? 
At that time in March there were approximately 43 unlawfully at large prisoners. 
DNA would be a good idea. 
Nothing happened with that.  
Some are sex offenders. 
We had not taken DNA samples of them. 
They were not multiple sex offenders. 
Two qualify and one does not. 
There is a brilliant concoction of reasoning to me.  
He did not have two victims. 
But now he does.  
How do you argue with that kind of reasoning? 
It is absolute nonsense.  
Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):
The perspectives of the opposition are useful here today. 
What does the bill do? 
What are the charter concerns? 
Whether the person is a convicted person or not, we still have a privacy issue. 
It is not privacy that is our hurdle. 
Let us talk about what the future may bring. 
We have not got that yet.  
I will leave the subject matter there. 
The 10 minutes has run by rather quickly. 
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
At a later date we could do that. 
I add as well that I have listened to many of the speakers today. 
We heard many times from witnesses as well as from members of the committee. 
It simply does not exist.  
I go back to my opening comments. 
What is constitutional today must be constitutional tomorrow. 
How can what is constitutional today be unconstitutional tomorrow?  
I do not understand or comprehend that argument. 
What is the difference in going beyond that? 
I do not understand. 
The government is to move this bill forward and it will pass. 
Perhaps in time all our requirements will be met. 
Mr. Jerry Pickard (Chatham-Kent Essex, Lib.):
This is another concrete step toward protecting Canadians from violent criminals. 
The government also went to Canadians to hear what they wanted to say. 
The goal has always been to protect Canadians from violent criminals.  
Some other issues were discussed as well. 
Sharing information is the key to successful arrests of offenders. 
I think members would agree with that statement.  
There is no question that this law is very appropriate at this time. 
SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT OF THE AUDITOR GENERAL OF CANADA 
Mr. Jerry Pickard (Chatham-Kent Essex, Lib.):
The orphanage was called ``The Place that God Forgot''. 
Thanks to Crystal, it is now the place that God remembers.  
I thank Heather and Crystal for their great work. 
All the citizens of this country are very supportive of their efforts. 
I add a thanks to Air Canada, British Airways and the Department of National- 
The hon. member for Calgary East.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
How has the Prime Minister responded to these overtures? 
This is Liberal co-operative federalism in action.  
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, September is arthritis month in Canada.  
More than 600,000 Canadians are disabled by it. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
This problem is aggravated by unacceptable housing conditions in many first nations. 
It is reprehensible for the government to allow these third world conditions to persist. 
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Billy Hancox was not a man the world would call a hero. 
His son Sean, born after his death, will tragically never know him.  
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
This can be a win-win-win situation for all.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Ontario seems to be in constant conflict with the federal government. 
What was the Prime Minister's response? 
Outright refusal to consider this agreement.  
Mr. John O'Reilly (Haliburton-Victoria-Brock, Lib.):
THE LATE PRIVATE GILLES DESMARAIS 
Mr. Benoit Serre (Timiskaming-Cochrane, Lib.):
Private Desmarais was 23 years old. 
He was scheduled to return to Canada at the end of January 1999. 
My thoughts and prayers are with them as they go through this difficult time.  
The hon. member for Lotbiniere.  
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, 11,000 sheep have been arbitrarily destroyed since January 1997. 
Information is either diluted or non-available.  
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
Our son had similar dreams. 
More than 300 boisterous young boys. 
His goalie gloves were cremated with him. 
Pain only a mother can know. 
Our considerations belong with them, the silent ones.  
SOCIETE SAINT-JEAN-BAPTISTE 
Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):
INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF THE OCEAN 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
For seven years the Mills family has waited for justice to be served. 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the law on employment insurance is clear. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
There is a debate. 
It is part of the debate.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, why is the government even contemplating breaking the law? 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We have the problem that the government has probably been too good to the satisfaction-- 
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we are talking about to whom do these surpluses belong. 
We are talking about obeying the law. 
We are talking about funds that were contributed in trust. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
The EI fund is not his money to spend. 
That is what the law says.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
There is no slush fund. 
It is just the money available to the government for the operation of the government. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, if the government cannot- 
I would ask the hon. member to go to his question, please.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
So, enough of the Bloc's demagoguery.  
We are fully aware that we must take- 
The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development has the floor.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
All workers in this country pay employment insurance premiums. 
Despite their contributions, however, three out of five unemployed persons do not receive any benefits. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister,Lib.): 
There are all kinds of ideas on this. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are having a debate at this time. 
We want to carry on helping those who need it most. 
That has been the policy of this government. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
He is not being asked to give up something that belongs to him. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
She is very keen that we give the money to the employers. 
If that is the position of the Conservative Party, fine. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
The hon. leader of the Conservative Party.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Colleagues, I appeal to you. 
We are having a tough time hearing the questions and the answers.  
The hon. member for Skeena. 
We would like to know from the Minister of Health:
The hon. Minister of Health.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Sending on that letter was not in keeping with protocol. 
That official has written to Leona Freed to express regret. 
We have re-circulated the protocol to remind all officials- 
The hon. member for Skeena. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is good to see the minister acknowledging wrongdoing.  
What is the government going to do to ensure this does not happen again? 
We do not want to be back here in six months with the same problem.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
It was about a leaking sewage pipe. 
In the meantime, the problem has been fixed. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
The employment insurance reform is a catastrophe.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We have invested more than any other government in training. 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
My question is for the Minister of National Revenue. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We need to improve the integrity of the social insurance number. 
We intend to continue to have good collaboration with him.  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
When is the government going to be accountable for that type of inaction?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have already begun work on the integrity of the system. 
It is very important that we actually improve it. 
We are following up on the recommendations of the auditor general.  
Along with the provincial governments we are improving the situation. 
Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):
The question, as it stands, is not acceptable. 
I would ask the hon. member to please move to his supplementary.  
Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
He was talking about Malaysia.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
This government provided substantial support to ensure that a people's summit was held. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have to admit that at heart I really am still a hippie.  
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
They are losing money and hope. 
Each day's delay brings a pile of worries.  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Carmen Provenzano (Sault Ste. Marie, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Trade.  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, a purely riveting statement from another Liberal. 
Even hippies at heart should have the right to protest peacefully.  
The hon. member for Edmonton North.  
Why is it that he cannot practice at home what he preaches abroad?  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Perhaps we could leave our outside activities out of the House of Commons.  
Yes, Mr. Speaker, I would be more than happy to. 
Second, we supported a people's summit.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, frankly the premise of the hon. member's question is absurd.  
We raised issues that Canadians asked us to raise.  
To use a comment of a previous speaker, her question was a lot of- 
The hon. member for Acadie-Bathurst.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Instead of getting at the root of the problem, it targets the unemployed''.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what we have done. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
My colleague, I must ask you to put your remarks through the Chair.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
He admitted as much yesterday in his statement.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
The hon. member for Bourassa has the floor.  
Mr. Speaker, on this side of the House we are serious.  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we all know that this is a difficult situation. 
I have asked for a review of the compensation levels. 
That is taking place.  
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
We have dramatically increased the quota for east coast fishermen this year. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Will she have a heart?  
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
I believe that Canada is honouring its humanitarian traditions. 
It has accepted applications from all these individuals. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
I would ask the first speaker to be the leader of the Bloc Quebecois.  
THE LATE GILLES ROCHELEAU 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I met Gilles Rocheleau in 1990. 
One thing never changed. 
Gilles Rocheleau was a forthright man who always said what he thought. 
So it was that he joined the Bloc Quebecois in 1990.  
Gilles Rocheleau was therefore also, if not primarily, a fighter. 
The militant federalist Gilles Rocheleau became a staunch sovereignist.  
On their behalf, I thank him.  
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
He was a Liberal member in Ottawa from 1988 to 1990. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
He was widely known. 
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
His involvement was marked by the effectiveness of his interventions. 
I think we could learn something from it for future use.  
Tributes to him will now follow.  
THE LATE PAUL TARDIF 
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
He went on from there to become a citizenship court judge.  
Mr. Tardif had a charming, colourful and gregarious personality. 
He was a master of grassroots politics and a master communicator. 
The media loved him. 
His constituents adored him. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
He retired undefeated in 1968. 
Mr. Tardif was known for his lively wit, charm and public-spiritedness. 
He clearly understood the saying that all politics are local politics. 
He was a true man of the people.  
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
He sat in this place from 1959 to 1968. 
He was re-elected in the general elections of 1962, 1963 and 1965. 
He therefore served in the government of the Right Hon. Lester B. Pearson.  
He was deeply attached to his community.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
If I am not mistaken, he was deputy speaker of this House for a time.  
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
He followed that up with three successive election wins, each with an overwhelming majority. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, we can hear the jackboots marching. 
There was absolutely no good reason for it. 
The government is shutting down honest debate.  
I know that his concerns are absolutely legitimate. 
He talked about honest, legitimate concerns that he has.  
What do people across the way talk about? 
They talk about what the bar associations and the lawyers want.  
It is a step in the right direction but it needs to be better. 
What fruit will it bear? 
What type of fruit does it bear when they try to restrict debate? 
They bring forward closure. 
It likes to restrict freedom of speech. 
Who wants some of these things with regard to time allocation? 
Who does it serve? 
Nobody but the government. 
They do not want it. 
The Canadian taxpayers do not want it.  
Who will slip through the cracks as a result of some of these things? 
That is another fundamental question. 
Those are the types of people who are going to suffer. 
By improving the legislation we would be able to address those things.  
The government does not want to hear that. 
It wants to close its ears and stifle the debate. 
The victims slip through the cracks. 
The police officers who want the tools to do the job slip through the cracks. 
Nobody benefits but the government.  
Will it solve the problem it intends to address? 
That is our job. 
Indeed it brushes it over and tries to rush it through.  
The government always tosses in a strawman. 
It says that the opposition, for example, is not addressing real concerns. 
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale, Lib.):
Criminals who might otherwise have gone undetected and unpunished have been brought to justice.  
It continues to urge changes to the bill which would clearly be unconstitutional. 
It ignores the clear signs which exist for all to see. 
The government cannot act dangerously. 
The views of the police in this matter are self-evident. 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Bill C-3 establishes a DNA data bank. 
I do not think Canadians have any problem with establishing a DNA data bank. 
I suggest to the government that DNA is no different from fingerprinting. 
I also suggest that it is now a matter of course, a matter of fact. 
We are overreacting to the business of DNA being intrusive. 
It is not intrusive to prick a finger to get a drop of blood. 
That is not what we are talking about. 
It is very simple and easy to get the required sample.  
I would suggest that the day will come. 
Why are we wasting time? 
Why are we reluctant to take that step? 
Is it because it may be challenged in the supreme court? 
We are remiss if we do not take advantage of them.  
It is a little bit late to wait for that.  
I hope the government will consider the arguments. 
It would be unusual for the Liberals to do so. 
They have made up their minds. 
It has never happened before to my knowledge. 
This is a good idea but it needs to be broadened and expanded. 
It is bad legislation. 
Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam, Lib.):
Public safety is a priority of this government. 
The government has welcomed this debate. 
In my view, this is exactly what has been achieved.  
The committee examined this bill thoroughly. 
This government listened to those views and we acted on them.  
We have heard those same concerns time and time again. 
It has also withstood constitutional challenges.  
This means better public safety for all Canadians.  
We have considered all views represented in our country. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
They have come up with Bill C-3, respecting DNA. 
We all agree that DNA sampling is good. 
It has to come into play. 
There is no argument. 
To me this bill shows it.  
This is somebody who has been picked up with regard to a crime. 
Never mind the rights of the victims, it infringes upon this individual's rights.  
In fact they can take fingerprints today. 
Is that not an infringement? 
Is that not an infringement? 
They take blood samples today. 
Is that not an infringement?  
I have to shake my head at the stupidity of what is going on here. 
The Liberals does not seem to understand. 
They can sit and smile over there, but they know it is true. 
They do not want to wait 12 months for the results. 
That is what this bill does not allow. 
This is the sharing, caring government of this country? 
It is a joke. 
We live in a democracy, a great democracy. 
The Liberals like to tell us about this great wondrous democracy called Canada. 
That is some way to look after the law-abiding taxpaying citizens of this country. 
They want us to accept this. 
I absolutely refuse to do that. 
It is a shame that they play politics this way. 
Maybe it is time it changed. 
They can laugh all they want over there, but the time is coming. 
Even some of them have not agreed with this. 
They will go along with it because they are whipped into shape to do it. 
We have a multitude of unsolved crimes in this country. 
It would clear up our courts. 
It would clear up a multitude of sins that have been committed in this country. 
But not for this government. 
It would not like to see that.  
They do not leave too much doubt over here. 
You have not listened one little bit though, have you?  
I read more than you do.  
There is absolutely no concern at all. 
Although we never know over there, do we?  
I just have to say that this is a disgrace.  
Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. 
We have struck this balance before. 
This balance is seen in Bill C-3. 
It is time to bring this debate to close. 
It is time that we move to make this bill law. 
However, in addition to that, the bill was drafted in accordance with Canada's Constitution. 
Even for those, police must first get a warrant to search.  
The supreme court has made that clear. 
DNA warrants are well used by police. 
They have been helping investigations tremendously. 
They have been used to eliminate suspects and secure convictions. 
They have been cost effective because they have helped to reduce overall court costs.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Let us look at the larger public good. 
This does not help the police. 
It does not help the victims groups.  
We suggest that DNA samples be taken beforehand. 
Number one is very important in that it helps to exonerate the innocent. 
We have not heard much about this from the other side. 
It is a double edged sword. 
One would argue from the other side that this is restricting people's personal freedoms. 
We would argue that there is a larger public good here.  
It does little to protect the innocent. 
That is what we are trying to do here.  
We in this party are trying to put faith back into the justice system. 
When we speak to Canadians, they have lost a lot of faith. 
Bill C-3 could be a strong bill. 
The data bank that exists today is far too limited. 
That does not exist in Bill C-3.  
The government somehow fails to see this. 
The government needs to pursue the issue of crime prevention. 
This is a head start program. 
It is the national head start program. 
It should be done before that.  
Unfortunately many run afoul of the law.  
On balance these programs save about $30,000 per child. 
They have lowered teen pregnancy rates. 
They can have a dramatic effect at lowering child abuse. 
The government could do what was done in Hawaii. 
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, in the last 10 days I think I have heard it all.  
This is from one end of the spectrum to the other. 
I am absolutely amazed. 
This is not the United States. 
We do things differently here.  
This is a good bill. 
Taking samples automatically when a suspect is charged would be constitutionally indefensible.  
The bill has seen introduction and reintroduction. 
If they have something positive to add, why do they not add it?  
Public safety is one of the government's top priorities. 
We will stand behind that commitment 100%, unlike our Reform colleagues.  
The question is how do we get there?  
I urge the members of the House to support Bill C-3.  
It is a good bill. 
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
DNA identification is certainly this type of tool. 
At best Bill C-3 is a half measure aimed to placate Canadians.  
No one is sure. 
Unlike Bill C-68 costs can be recouped. 
We take blood samples for purposes of determining impairment. 
There is no difference.  
The invasion of privacy has already taken place. 
The Criminal Code looks after that. 
Is there a difference here? 
We have a tremendous backlog in our courts. 
Canadians deserve better from their elected officials.  
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
I thought at that time it was an outrageous comparison. 
I think that would be a more apt comparison as a reference.  
The fact is that offenders like Clifford Olson commit both types of offences. 
DNA can also exonerate a person suspected of a crime. 
It can clear them quickly and clear the air forever. 
DNA is a tool that is useful. 
It is a tool police departments want. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The vote will be deferred until 5.15 today.  
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
(The sitting of the House was suspended at 4.48 p.m.) 
The House resumed at 5.15 p.m. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
(The House divided on the amendment, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the amendment defeated.  
The next question is on the main motion.  
Is there agreement to proceed in such a fashion?  
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
(Bill read the third time and passed) 
CANADA SMALL BUSINESS FINANCING ACT 
Is there agreement to proceed in such a fashion?  
Mr. Speaker, Reform Party members present will vote yes. 
Mr. Speaker, Bloc Quebecois members are opposed to the motion.  
Mr. Speaker, members of the NDP vote no on this motion.  
Mr. Speaker, members of our party will vote against this motion.  
(The House divided on the amendment, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the amendment negatived.  
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
Many Canadians have expressed the desire to see more done on the side of prevention. 
It is a fact of life.  
That is not what Bill C-284 is all about. 
These victims are our children and our families.  
I urge everyone in this House to support the bill.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
This is a level of intervention we must all take seriously. 
What problem has my colleague identified and what solutions does he propose? 
We must proceed very cautiously in this regard.  
Should these more or less related convictions also come to light? 
Many people have advocated more substantial reform during the past decade. 
I thank the hon. member for bringing that to our attention.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
People find such acts both shocking and incomprehensible. 
The member for Calgary Centre is legitimately attacking this scourge. 
We have already examined this in the past. 
The phrase ``provided this offence has no relation to the job'' is extremely important.  
Under the Criminal Records Act, rehabilitation and pardon are synonymous. 
However, this is not always the case, even where rehabilitation has occurred. 
Certain illnesses, as I shall mention, are hard to treat.  
If this were true, all penal corrective measures would be ineffective. 
It puts the onus on the offender to declare certain things. 
Non-discrimination is not, however, an absolute concept. 
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
This is especially true for the most innocent in society, our children.  
We must not betray the trust that children put in us. 
Better still, we must earn that trust. 
Who is targeted by this initiative? 
That is the only purpose of this bill. 
Children must remain our absolute priority. 
I congratulate it on this, although I maintain that the benefit should be indexed.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Many in society are concerned about the safety of our children. 
These are the concerns which Bill C-284 intends to address.  
I also support this bill for other reasons. 
Why is Bill C-284 necessary? 
Essentially it sends a message that the protection of our children is of paramount importance. 
I remember this particular case because of its gruesomeness. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
I also appreciate the comments.  
It is an important bill to support. 
Things go on hold and we live with the status quo. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
So much for goodwill. 
Well why wait for MacKay but not Estey? 
That is what I want to know and so do the farmers in Saskatchewan. 
Here is what the Liberals did instead:
It is a great trick. 
Houdini ties his own hands. 
Canada is the only OECD country without one. 
This proposal was endorsed by the premiers. 
As yet we do not know what happened to it from the federal government. 
A number of new developments have occurred. 
I wonder, did they tell the transport minister? 
Did they tell Justice Estey?  
That is why we should wait for the report. 
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
For every line discontinued six lines have been transferred. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Who can live on $165 a week? 
Not the Minister of Finance, I can guarantee that. 
Today, in fact, I asked the Prime Minister a question. 
They are making find-sounding promises that they cannot keep.  
The EI fund belongs to workers. 
It is not there to reduce taxes. 
It belongs to workers and businesses. 
Is it not their fund? 
Morally, the government has no right to touch the money.  
It has balanced the budget and reduced the deficit to zero. 
How has it done this? 
On the backs of workers.  
It is no different from an insurance company. 
This is an insurance policy that belongs to workers. 
Today the Prime Minister told me I did not know what I was talking about. 
I would encourage the Prime Minister to pay a visit to my riding. 
The government should assume its responsibilities and quick.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The transitional jobs fund has already created over 31,000 jobs. 
These arrangements are aimed at providing real solutions for unemployed Canadians.  
In addition, many social assistance recipients will have access to these programs.  
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Such steps could lead to a substantial reduction in smog formation.  
(The House adjourned at 6.57 p.m.)
