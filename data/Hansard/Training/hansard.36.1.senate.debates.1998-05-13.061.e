National Palliative Care Week 
Hon. Therese Lavoie-Roux :
Its goal is to care and not to cure.  
All the witnesses who dealt with the issue expressed their support for palliative care.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable senator, I am sorry but I must tell you that your time is up. 
You may carry on with the unanimous consent of the Senate. 
Does the honourable senator have leave to continue?  
Honourable senators should also consider the demographic dimension. 
It is well known that the Canadian population is ageing. 
Even the elderly population is aging. 
The group of people aged 85 and over will actually double in number.  
Report of Social Affairs, Science and Technology Committee Tabled 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Report of Committee Presented and Printed as Appendix 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Hon. Jean B. Forest :
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the Honourable Senator Nolin makes a very interesting point. 
Hon. Orville H. Phillips :
Was it from Spain or Portugal?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, let me state categorically that the cod tongues came from Newfoundland.  
The whole of the country was represented.  
Hon. James F. Kelleher :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, that is a very good question.  
That was a couple of years ago, but relates directly to internal trade.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
The Prime Minister's response was rather telling. 
Referring to both premiers, Prime Minister Chretien's response was: 
Would Senator Graham explain his colleague's comments in greater detail? 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I do not believe that that is the case at all. 
A meeting will be held tomorrow, as all honourable senators know. 
Obviously, Quebec and Ontario are among those.  
I would urge all honourable senators to fully debate this question.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the Government of Canada has always been open. 
Is the file still closed, "yes" or "no"?  
The provinces have changed their position several times. 
We need to find out categorically where the provinces stand.  
You just quoted them.  
Listen to the people!  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, my question is supplementary to this matter. 
Would you not agree with that, Mr. Leader?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Let us speak tonight, then.  
Surely the leader would agree with that.  
The debate in this place should evolve as it always does.  
This is not a Johnny-come-lately situation. 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
I would like the reply to be worded differently.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
That was his position before. 
This is the unanimous decision to which I am referring. 
Minister Rock, however, confirmed: 
...there is no question that there were tests available before 1986. 
Some American states had them, some parts of Europe as well.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
These fees will be paid out on the backs of the taxpayers. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The Government of Canada is doing the best it can under the circumstances. 
I would urge my honourable friends to await the outcome of tomorrow's deliberations.  
Atomic Energy of Canada Limited 
How is Canada enforcing its agreement with China?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, with all due respect - 
Business of the Senate 
Extension of Question Period 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Would there would be agreement to continue with Question Period?  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Leave is not granted.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is that agreed, honourable senators?  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, I also want to ask a question.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Delayed Answers to Oral Questions 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
(Response to question raised by Hon. Janis Johnson on April 28, 1998) 
Concerns should be directed to Dr. Shirley L. Thomson, Director of the Council.  
other provincial/municipal resources available, 
the projected impact of any reduction on the ability of the applicant to function, 
the projected impact of any reductions on the type of activity, 
Answer to Order Paper Question Tabled 
Conduct of Committee Business in Chamber-Point of Order 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
I do not want that point to be lost. 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Senator Johnson did in fact enter the chamber in time to make the notice. 
Hon. Jean B. Forrest :

In clause 1, on page 1: 
( a ) by adding the following after line 17:

( a ) any accident or incident associated with the operation of a truck, and 
This Act applies in respect of highway occurrences 
(a) in Canada, if the occurrence relates to extraprovincial truck transport; and 
Subsection 4(2) of the Act is replaced by the following: 
Subsection 10(1) of the Act is replaced by the following: 
6. In clause 13: 
(i) by adding the following after line 4: 
(ii) by adding the following after line 18: 
Paragraph 19(14)(a) of the Act is replaced by the following: 
Hon. Pierre De Bane :
Furthermore, this amendment would create duplication of effort with current provincial activities. 
The federal government has jurisdiction over the safety of extra-provincial commercial vehicle undertakings. 
The amendment proposed will also create duplication of effort with current federal activities. 
Otherwise, how could this government commission have devised such major recommendations and expansion?  
Those are two areas upon which I would like some explanation.  
However, we cannot entertain it at this stage.  
On motion of Senator Carstairs, debate adjourned.  
Canada Lands Surveyors Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
This move is both efficient and appropriate. 
On motion of Senator Lynch-Staunton, debate adjourned.  
Cape Breton Development Corporation 
Consideration of Final Report of Special Committee-Order Stands 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
On motion of Senator Carstairs, for Senator Graham, debate adjourned.  
Honourable Senator Joyal , P.C.).  
The recommendation in question is in chapter 40 of Justice Krever's report.  
The provinces and territories of Canada - 
I add, he does not refer to the Government of Canada.  
Many provincial health ministers refused that recommendation. 
A scheme was agreed to, and that is what is being debated today. 
This first element, I think, should be very clearly stated.  
Victims in these countries must go before the courts. 
The Canadian government is firmly resolved to move these negotiations along quickly. 
We are all hoping for a fair and equitable solution to this difficult situation. 
Speed, however, does not necessarily guarantee a better solution for victims. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
There is no mention of the federal government, and we know what happened next.  
The last budget contained a number of measures regarding research, for instance.  
The Canadian government started by showing its good faith. 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
The honourable senator can continue with unanimous consent. 
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
It is signed by Michael D. Harris, Premier of Ontario.  
The entire Liberal caucus applauded and lined up behind him to vote their support.  
The issue here is not about culpability but about fairness and justice. 
Il se debattait comme un diable dans l'eau benite.  
This is such a time. 
Many of them will die. 
The government has agreed to the idea of compensation and good for them. 
It should fully live up to that agreement. 
It should stop splitting hairs. 
Canadians deserve nothing less.  
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
I cannot speak for Premier Harris. 
His letter does not address that. 
I have no authority to speak on his behalf.  
Frankly, Senator Grafstein, what does it matter? 
May I answer the question? 
Then why did you quote Premier Harris?  
He told me that the Canadian Medical Association is divided on some of the recommendations. 
The College of Physicians and Surgeons in Ontario is also divided on those recommendations.  
Second, we are really talking about two fundamental issues. 
That is an issue which is a slam-dunk in my opinion. 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Senator Di Nino's time has expired.  
I move that the debate be adjourned.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Senator Bacon has moved adjournment of the debate. 
Is it your pleasure to adopt the motion?  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Would all those in favour of the motion please say yea?  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Would all those opposed please say nay?  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
In my opinion, the yeas have it. 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
The bells will ring for 15 minutes.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Motion agreed to and debate adjourned on the following division: 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable senators, I declare the motion carried.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
