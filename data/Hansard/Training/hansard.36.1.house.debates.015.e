Consideration resumed of motion 
EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 15 
Friday, October 10, 1997 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.) moved: 
Fast, reliable, low cost transportation is critical to Canada's economy. 
There were many recommendations which flowed from this report to improve the marine system.  
Not a dot, a comma or a change has been made. 
If changes are to be made the committee will deal with them.  
We consider this an important bill. 
That is why we have introduced it as is. 
It is important to the competitiveness of our marine sector.  
Overall, it will make our maritime sector competitive.  
The bill will meet seven broad objectives. 
Fourth, it will provide a high level of safety and environmental protection. 
Sixth, it will manage the marine infrastructure according to good business practices. 
Seventh, it will provide for the transfer of certain ports and facilities.  
There are four main components to this bill. 
It will deal with the seaway and it will deal with the ports themselves.  
The port system has to be modernized. 
There is no question about that.  
To be accepted it has to meet four criteria. 
They will not receive federal funding. 
The era of federal subsidies is over.  
CPAs will be agents of the crown. 
Agent status will be limited to core port activities.  
CPAs will have to seek financing from the private sector. 
The federal government will no longer be around to be responsible for their debts.  
The process of divesting these ports is already well under way. 
The Government of Canada will continue to ensure operation of remote ports. 
This policy will be applied equitably and consistently across the country.  
This is Canada's original maritime area. 
I and my colleagues in cabinet will be sensitive to those concerns. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
I found them to be very forthcoming and helpful. 
Again, the legislation is inconsistent with the expressed objective of commercialization. 
Again, we are looking at partial pregnancy.  
The Liberals should remember that governments come and governments go. 
They will not be forever in power. 
It is unfortunate that there is no provision for labour representation on each board. 
The elimination of ports police is problematical. 
I do not believe that was well thought out and it should be reconsidered. 
When mobsters get the upper hand in a port they are extremely hard to dislodge.  
Why should they be treated differently?  
I cannot read the minister's mind. 
Therefore we do not support the procedure. 
We will vote against it. 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
The consultations took place in capitals, communities and among the people. 
We in the Bloc proposed a number of amendments to the bill. 
So where does that leave us today? 
This is cause for concern. 
I will get to the substance of the bill in a moment. 
This puts an end to what I might call my preliminary remarks. 
I now come to the bill before us.  
Unfortunately, the legislation is silent as regards that proposal.  
Ports Canada people slept there.  
I told the parliamentary secretary, ``You are giving me arguments to use against you. 
You are giving me ammunition. 
Do not do it, it makes no sense''.  
Unfortunately, this was the recommendation the government made in its majority report. 
There is one last point that we disagree with completely. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
The added stress this creates is often reflected in increasing numbers of industrial accidents. 
Will the federal government be able to protect the national interest in the future?  
There is no guarantee under the proposed legislation that this will be the case.  
Let us look at the case of Vancouver, for example. 
Of course Vancouver will not be the only port affected. 
We need to have commitments that will ensure that all Canadians are safe. 
There are estimated to be approximately 500 public ports and harbours in Canada. 
Should these ports be privatized? 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on Bill C-9. 
I really appreciated that our people had the opportunity to have their say.  
It later died in the Senate. 
Nothing has changed with the reintroduction of this bill. 
The section is still there. 
But there is a question that I have for the minister.  
It will have a major negative impact on all Canadian citizens and port users. 
I cannot imagine this has taken place. 
What happened to democracy? 
Where did it go?  
Those men, like the men in Saint John, have worked for 24 years. 
The minister has to step in and take a look.  
This of course included my own city, Saint John.  
The National Harbours Board adopted the Cassidy report in 1968. 
The minister announced that it would be disbanded, yet we are debating it today.  
Here we are debating it today. 
I have never heard tell of that before. 
We saw what happened in Vancouver. 
The municipal police force in Vancouver took it over. 
It got a $1 million cheque from the government. 
I do not know how that happened when it has not been agreed to. 
In Saint John 30 police officers have been cut already. 
We should also be making sure they are being funded to allow that to happen.  
In Toronto, port policing was absorbed by the municipal force. 
The same thing happened in the port of Miami. 
This is happening everywhere. 
They try it but it does not work.  
It is very evident from the report that a dedicated port police function should remain. 
Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
It has still to respond.  
The government has reintroduced the legislation in exactly the same form. 
It is vitally important to Canada's transportation system. 
We heard from industry that it wants to see the bill adopted.  
Let us have a look at the history. 
We went across the country. 
You will have five minutes remaining after question period.  
NATIONAL MENOPAUSE AWARENESS MONTH 
Mrs. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Menopause is a major health concern of Canadian women. 
The hon. member for Dauphin-Swan River.  
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
I commend both the Government of Canada and the senator for this important initiative. 
Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):
They are being asked to illustrate how they see the family. 
This week and throughout the year let us celebrate our families.  
NATIONAL CO-OPERATIVE WEEK 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
It also reminds us of how long co-operatives have been with us.  
This year has also marked the 75th anniversary of the Cooperative federee de Quebec.  
May I wish everyone a happy Co-operative Week.  
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there are tens of thousands of public servants affected by pay equity. 
I call on our government to continue its work toward a resolution. 
My constituents are demanding action. 
I encourage them, commend them and support them.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
THE LATE GILLES BOULET 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):

Member spoke in Cree ] 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Employment is up by nearly 300,000 jobs since February. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
The situation for beef farmers is particular severe. 
Nova Scotia farmers face an extremely grim winter.  
The hon. member for Sault Ste. Marie.  
Mr. Carmen Provenzano (Sault Ste. Marie, Lib.):
In my opinion there is no such thing as a non-violent rape. 
There is no such thing as torture without pain. 
The hon. member for Cumberland-Colchester.  
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Both have shown an interest. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
He gave four different answers in four minutes. 
Surely that is a new Canadian record.  
Mr. Speaker, let me ask the minister this question. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is pretty hard to even read from a prepared script.  
I want to ask the question one more time. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the answer is very clear. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we are coming up with the facts. 
The minister said yesterday ``we were well organized.'' 
Just how well organized is this Shawinigan shakedown?  
Those are the facts. 
That is how I knew.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is ludicrous. 
That is absolutely clear.  
Seven of them did not give a cent to the Liberal Party.  
The hon. member for Fraser Valley.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
It is based on merit.  
Also I can give an example which pleased the official opposition. 
I could tell them- 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the President of the Treasury Board.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I already answered the question. 
The real question is:
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
My question is very clear. 
Mr. Speaker, I have already given a very clear answer to this question. 
That is how it happened. 
It is quite simple.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
That is the question.  
That is the real question.  
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
And we have heard a lot of squealing on this- 
Go directly to your question, please.  
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the relationship continues as it was in the past. 
The arm's length relationship is still there as it should be.  
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
Why did the Liberal government call in the RCMP on this investigation? 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
The hon. member for Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
He then said that he knew of a warrant that may have been executed. 
Can the minister at least clear up one thing for us today? 
Mr. Speaker, the real question is how did the member know. 
I learned about it from him in the House. 
The member also mentioned the number of the search warrant which I do not know.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Will the minister come clean and tell us- 
Can he tell us that, please?  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
It was to lower the tax burden on those who were creating jobs. 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
I wonder if the minister across the way can actually say the same. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
More important, the vast majority of those jobs have been permanent full time jobs. 
This government is creating jobs. 
The hon. member for Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok.  
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
These are programs that will come forward in due course. 
I should point out however- 
The hon. member Bonaventure-Gaspe-iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok.  
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the minister's irresponsibility is affecting 22,000 people.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
This will affect fishers in Atlantic Canada, including the area of Gaspe.  
We will await of course decisions in due course.  
EDMONTON INSTITUTION FOR WOMEN 
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am shocked. 
I am wondering who is really on the witch hunt here. 
Let the investigation take its course. 
Let the RCMP do their job.  
SEARCH AND RESCUE HELICOPTERS 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence.  
The government is planning to buy 15 search and rescue helicopters. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
There are four finalists in the bidding process.  
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
It was far too much money, far too much equipment that was not necessary. 
But we have not, I reiterate, decided on which helicopters to purchase.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
And I might add that the guard is a tad bit nervous. 
I talked to him personally.  
Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
The guards have a number of problems that are happening. 
Will he do it now? 
Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
We will take a look at each incident.  
We have advisory committees that work with the inmate committees. 
We look at the individual situations and we take the necessary measures.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Today I would like to have a clear answer. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
It is already published with the federal budget. 
The information, therefore, seems to me to be crystal clear, and transparent. 
The hon. member ought to note also that the Auditor General had praise for- 
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. minister. 
The hon. member for Brampton Centre.  
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I welcome that question very much.  
The numbers that we saw yesterday are quite interesting. 
We have created a number of jobs. 
We are on the right track but more needs to be done.  
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
Would you go directly to the question.  
Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
It is true this problem has been known for 10 years. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We have embarked on a very steady process of job creation. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
That is simply not right.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
He said, and I quote- 
The hon. member on his supplementary question.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
What is the job policy of the government?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
When his government was in power, 370,000 full-time jobs were lost. 
Since we have taken office 900,000 jobs have been created.  
When his government was in office net worth per household was stagnant. 
Since we have taken office it has gone up by 6.8%.  
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Canadians have a grave concern over- 
Is the hon. member in her seat?  
The hon. member will go directly to her question.  
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Canadians have grave concern over the recent incident in Jordan. 
The hon. member for Dartmouth.  
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
Mr. Speaker, the government deeply cares about people with disabilities. 
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the government welcomes the auditor general's report on this issue. 
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
I would like a sensible answer directly from the Minister of Industry. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the Environment.  
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the minister has been working with the people in the area. 
She has had consultations.

Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.) moved: 
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
Mr. Raymond Bonin (Nickel Belt, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have several petitions to present to the House. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
I support the petition.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
RIGHTS OF THE CHILD 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
I am happy to table these petitions on behalf of my constituents.  
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to present a petition regarding Canadian unity.  
The petitioners call for the indivisibility of Canada. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
The first petition deals with a concern of constituents regarding our present tax system. 
GOODS AND SERVICE TAX 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have another petition which I wish to present.  
They simply agree with Mr. Tobin on that point.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
The third petition concerns the increase in gas prices. 
CANADA STUDENT LOAN PROGRAM 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Finally, Mr. Speaker, petitioners are concerned about the debt load faced by students. 
Mr. Jerry Pickard (Kent-Essex, Lib.):
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
The petitioners believe the current law is unfair.  
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
In this case there are approximately 150 signatures.  
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
They would also like to see an elected Senate.  
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I apologize but I was not informed by my leadership. 
Will the whip give me assurance that consent has been reached?  
Mr. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
That consultation did take place and we do have an agreement.  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
This system is a crucial waterway but it is also a business. 
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
I am afraid it is some 50 or 60 years too late.  
I am here to talk about history. 
I want to give members of the House a history lesson. 
Unfortunately from 1930 to 1997 not a lot has been done with that port. 
It has been neglected, misused or underutilized.  
I differ from the member for Churchill. 
It is a gateway to the big north of Canada. 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
It was Canada's main shipyard before the Liberals arrived. 
It still has the potential to be the greatest one.  
Unfortunately, it often just passes by. 
The bill is flawed in terms of what it does not cover. 
But let us give the government a chance.  
There is absolutely nothing in this bill about shipbuilding. 
That was a fine promise, another broken promise. 
But even then, they never saw a penny.  
There was, in the background, another condition the government did not dare state publicly. 
The shipyard was the property of the Societe de developpement industriel, a Quebec crown corporation. 
And no contracts either.  
Then, the shipyard in Levis underwent a slight change in orientation. 
Nothing has moved in a little over a year. 
Time is running out. 
This contract could create 400 jobs. 
So it is important.  
I woke him up at one point and told him: ``Be careful. 
You should look after their interests.'' 
I urge the member for Beauce to do the same.  
Now we know why: the Liberals were afraid of allegations and investigations. 
He called the election and he did the right thing. 
I think he now has a majority of four members. 
It could have been different.  
The Liberal government is not to be congratulated as far as maritime issues are concerned. 
And Canadian shipowners agree with us.  
It is high time that the government did something in this area.  
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
The list of Nova Scotia port facilities reaches over 150. 
So far Transport Canada has managed to unload three ports. 
How many other buyers are there for these little ports? 
I would say precious few.  
Transport Canada is holding public hearings in the affected communities. 
I can imagine why.  
These communities will go to ruin. 
These ports will go to ruin without the infrastructure that the government provides.  
But is profitability the only criterion by which we judge things now? 
To save a few dollars.  
This is privatization ideology run rampant.  
This is the primary negative feature of the bill. 
Users often do not come until the facilities are in place. 
Ships float and boats are floating assets. 
Labour needs a place at the new port authorities. 
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Madam Speaker, congratulations on your appointment to the Chair.  
Right now we have national policies which are inconsistent. 
Provincial policies change very rapidly. 
They are much slower to change. 
Just give us a chance to get our bearings. 
It seems that the cutbacks are promoting cutbacks. 
That is what this is doing. 
This is coming back at the smaller communities and the smaller ports. 
The port police in Canada are highly specialized and highly trained police. 
It is not even clear who is going to take this over. 
The government is disbanding the ports police and there is no plan.  
We are going to have every port with its own police application and approach. 
That is another big impact from downloading.  
He said yesterday, ``Nova Scotians have been devastated by what Ottawa did. 
We just cannot do that. 
It is not the way to treat people''. 
That is what is happening.  
Let us move on to a few other aspects of C-9. 
Probably the most important issue is the classification of ports. 
Those wharves are all being divested or becoming port authorities. 
It is going to have a tremendous impact on the communities.  
These ports have not had the opportunity to be heard. 
They do not even have any idea what is going to happen to them. 
They do not even have any idea that this is happening. 
We want to make sure that the regional ports do know what is happening. 
Often the port, the wharf, is the lifeblood of the community. 
I do not think we can stand by and let that happen.  
Sell it to whom? 
What about the community? 
It wanted to take control over the entire port. 
It wanted to open a gravel pit or a quarry. 
What happened to the people in Bayside? 
What about their concerns?  
There has not been enough consultation with the regional ports. 
They do not even know what is happening to them. 
We may propose that we split the bill. 
There are hundreds of communities on the list that have been presented. 
We will be bringing that to their attention.  
The privatization aspect of this bill is really frightening. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Whelan):
The hon. member for Portage-Lisgar.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
I congratulate you and wish you well.  
I will take a different slant on this issue. 
They really tell the story of what has happened to many of the ports. 
The dates for all of these ports range from 1987 to 1996.  
That is quite a decrease. 
The ports along the St. Lawrence have had an even bigger decrease. 
In 1987 they handled 11.8 million tonnes of grain. 
Today they are only handling about 4.4 million tonnes. 
In 1996 they were down to 227,000 tonnes. 
Their yearly earnings were fairly well looked after.  
This brought to light other things. 
I am looking at some of my notes. 
We can see the additional costs.  
However it has been deleted and that really bothers me.  
The sooner we recognize that, the better off we will be.  
It is about the same for west coast ports. 
In 1996 it was 1.889 million tonnes. 
It was quite successful. 
Those things are happening. 
That was half a million dollars for four ships. 
Why is the Government of Canada allowing these things to happen? 
It is so far out of whack compared to the U.S. system.  
These are items that we have to address.  
I have a little story to finish up the whole debate. 
The station master sent him a bill. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
These amendments are still not to be found in the new bill.  
Yet it has to be recognized that this is an important bill. 
Let me give you an example.  
A port development corporation has been created. 
It has already twinned with the French port of La Rochelle. 
The community has taken its fate into its own hands. 
There are also ferry ports. 
There is the whole issue of the maritime pilots on the St. Lawrence. 
That is why we would like to get a few additional amendments from the government.  
This resulted in an improved piece of legislation.  
I am thinking in particular of a clause that seems quite obsolete. 
All this to say we are prepared to go to committee. 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Boats took the place of trucks and trains. 
But on the whole these ports continue to serve the public and certain businesses.  
Will local disparities be taken into account? 
Will these ports, as in our case, still be owned by Quebeckers? 
My colleague from Levis also spoke about shipbuilding. 
Shipyards are also involved in ship refit. 
The mood of the people in our region depends largely on the employment situation. 
There is nothing in bill C-9 on this.  
We would not want these things to go on. 
What a nice model of centralization that does not reflect the realities of the industry.  
In concluding my remarks, I want to say a few words on the Pilotage Act. 
(Division deemed demanded and deferred) 
Is it agreed that we call it 2.30?  
(The House adjourned at 1.27 p.m.)
