EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 82 
Friday, March 27, 1998 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
This industry is growing at an impressive rate. 
Our exports continue to expand, as does the domestic market for our products.  
We endeavour to be responsive to the changing needs of the industry. 
Together we are working to develop strategies for achieving this goal.  
Therefore, it is with great pleasure that I talk to this bill today.  
The grain industry categorizes crops either as standard crops or as special crops. 
The first round of consultations was undertaken by a panel of producers. 
A consensus on licensing and security emerged from those consultations.  
In March 1995 the commission released a report reflecting that consensus. 
The bulk of the country's special crops production comes from the three prairie provinces.  
In 1984-85 production was approximately one million tonnes. 
In 1997-98 this figure has climbed to approximately three million tonnes. 
The special crops market continues to expand. 
Both large and small players are contributing to its impressive growth.  
The special crops industry exports a considerable amount of product. 
Moreover the entry of new players will stimulate innovation and the development of new markets.  
I emphasize that the plan is voluntary. 
Producers can choose whether or not to participate.  
The initial levy will be a small percentage of the value of grain delivered. 
For the industry this keeps paperwork to a minimum.  
After deducting an administration fee, the commission will forward the premiums to an insurer. 
I will talk about this committee in more detail shortly.  
It is expected that most producers will participate. 
The insurance plan will be self funded after initial startup.  
About 800 seed cleaning plants operate on the prairies. 
Only a few operators of seed cleaning plants are currently licensed.  
Because they cannot, they are constrained in expanding their operations. 
Both large and small dealers will operate on a level playing field.  
Each prairie province and sector of the industry will be represented on the committee. 
The majority of the members will be producers.  
The Administrative Monetary Penalties Act is legislation that was enacted in 1995. 
However, those sanctions have the impact of stopping business operations either temporarily or perhaps permanently. 
In this way AMPA emphasizes compliance, not punishment.  
The legislation is expected to be proclaimed very soon.  
Several strong messages were received as a result of the consultation process. 
The act provides for only the regulation of grain futures contracts. 
Preliminary discussions have already been held. 
I recommend that members of the House support Bill C-26.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
On behalf of farmers I encourage the government to seize that opportunity.  
After all, that is what MPs are supposed to be doing here. 
We consult, listen and then we consult again. 
It is high time Liberal MPs gave this process a try. 
I describe that support as tentative because it is in the early days yet. 
The debate and analysis of the legislation has only just begun.  
It is members of these groups who are the experts. 
This consultative process must be given the opportunity to achieve results. 
Unfortunately this is not something we simply expect to happen. 
They thought they were a waste of time. 
Consultation was certainly not to get in the way of the government's tight schedule.  
I am understandably sceptical. 
I am concerned for farmers. 
If the majority of farmers oppose the bill we will also know that.  
Farmers' interests need to be protected.  
For example, the insurance levy requires limitations. 
Bureaucracy and farming do not mix. 
The first is that the Canadian Grain Commission will run the insurance plan. 
The insurance plan runs the risk of becoming bogged down in the infamous government bureaucracy.  
Why not allow a private insurance company to act as the insurer? 
It is an option that must be investigated. 
We need less government interference in agriculture. 
We need to support an increase in private enterprise.  
Further concerns will no doubt arise over the levy. 
I refer to some of the feedback that has come. 
This legislation is quite new to this place. 
We have some feedback coming to us about Bill C-26. 
The letter goes on: 
What the author is referring to is competition. 
There should be open competition. 
It is also about this particular legislation. 
Our primary concern with the program is with the insurance plan. 
It goes on in that light. 
I have some other stories I would like to relate concerning this legislation.  
The farmer is then left on the hook. 
Unfortunately we have seen that happen a few times.  
Their immediate concern was for the grain the company had in storage.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sorry but I must interrupt the member for Prince George-Peace River. 
However, the member will have almost 16 minutes remaining after question period.  
MPS VERSUS PAGES HOCKEY GAME 
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
The event was the annual MPs versus the pages hockey game. 
Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):
Investments to date are over $57 million. 
Together we are working to support innovation and promote economic growth.  
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
They are not asking for subsidies, just for the freedom to compete. 
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Our greatest resources are our human resources. 
The hon. member for Lambton-Kent-Middlesex.  
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
This is despite clear evidence to the contrary.  
The Liberals are an odd lot 
Always hoping to change the plot 
Campaigning for the byelection 
They are hoping for a resurrection 
But after Monday this fact they will dread 
In B.C. the red heads are dead 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
Mr. Guy St-Julien:
The man from Sherbrooke can do it. 
He can bring people together. 
He is brave, honest and a diplomat.  
We are proud of his decision. 
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
This shows British Columbians just how ignorant the Liberals really are about British Columbia.  
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the theatre world is celebrating these days. 
Today is World Theatre Day. 
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood-Assiniboine, Lib.):
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
It sounds like something out of the Reform Party platform. 
I wonder when the tail will stop wagging the dog. 
Is that as good as it gets?  
COMMISSION ON FUTURE OF MIRABEL AIRPORT 
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
JUDICIAL SYSTEM IN RESTIGOUCHE REGION 
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
What are the Liberal politicians doing about it? 
They are passing the buck from one level of government to the other.  
I urge the Minister of Justice to show leadership on this issue.  
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Eglinton-Lawrence, Lib.):
An estimated 20,000 Canadians suffer from kidney failure. 
Millions of others suffer from kidney related disorders. 
For many Canadians a kidney transplant is their only option. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
The package that is now before Canadians represents just such an approach. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, compassion and fairness are to be seen in the package itself. 
The hon. member for Macleod.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
It is true this represents a combined negotiated approach. 
We all agreed including stakeholders that- 
The hon. member for Elk Island.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
My uncle died just two months ago. 
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I feel sorry for all those who have suffered from this terrible tragedy. 
Should they wish not- 
The hon. member for Elk Island.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Those who prefer to go a different route still have that option.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, it is easy to make fun of taxpayers.  
It is the only difference between the two reports.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.  
We have a mystery. 
This letter is undated and fewer than three lines long.  
What is behind this new mess?  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have here a letter. 
Unfortunately, it is a letter that was written in Quebec City on November 28, 1996. 
As things stand, they have been refusing for two years- 
They are the troublemakers.  
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the deeper one looks, the murkier it gets.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, once again, all this party wants to do is stir up trouble.  
Give us an answer.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
It was very clear. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The committee is studying all that. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Subsequently I asked the minister to address this issue during question period. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Is the minister of fisheries seriously considering the creation of a post-TAGS program? 
If so, in what timeframe can we expect a response?  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
The minister talks about responding to the royal commission's report. 
There is not one shred of evidence that conditions on reserves in Canada are improving. 
There is plenty of evidence to suggest that conditions are getting worse.  
What are they trying to hide? 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
COMMISSION ON FUTURE OF MIRABEL AIRPORT 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Transport. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, they are passing the buck here.  
I remind the minister that the federal government's responsibility in this mess is obvious.  
That is all we are asking, not charity, just fair treatment.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
He called it an insurance policy against oil spills.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
He should recognize that and get up in the House an apologize for his- 
The hon. member for Prince George-Peace River.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
It is entirely private sector response organizations that we are talking about. 
There is no question of taxation.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the Environment.  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
We will be looking at all the mechanisms available to the federal government. 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
The problem in Ontario was related to the management of Ontario Hydro. 
It had absolutely nothing to do with the technology of the Candu. 
The hon. member for South Surrey-White Rock-Langley.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
I am also pleased to say that nobody was injured. 
There is a full investigation now going on.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is simply not true. 
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
British Columbia especially benefits from visitors from countries in Asia.  
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
That commission produced 400 recommendations but the report has been on the shelf gathering dust.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
More money for the chief.  
The member yells out ``more money for the chief''. 
The Reform Party did not support the recommendations.  
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
My question is for the Minister of Indian Affairs. 
Will she act before the next tragedy occurs?  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
The results of that report were in evidence in the 1997 budget. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not agree with the preamble to the question. 
That is what this is about. 
We have less resources now in national defence. 
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
I know the minister is involved in drawing up a new national highways policy.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
As the hon. member knows, Canadian highways are a provincial responsibility. 
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Benoit Serre (Timiskaming-Cochrane, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Natural Resources.  
British Columbia's forest industry is in trouble. 
B.C. mills and workers are idle.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):

Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
We also did an extensive analysis of the technology involved. 
In this instance there is no loss of jobs.

Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
The layoff freeze lifted on Wednesday. 
The sale of AECL has been delayed. 
The hon. member for St. John's West.  
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
Will the minister of fisheries immediately accept this recommendation? 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
They are the same international agreements that allow us- 
The hon. member for Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle.  
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
The government is listening.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's imagination is running away with itself.  
The government does not have a fixed agenda.  
If the hon. member has any ideas, he should present them at the committee. 
I know there are lots of companies that would be interested in this change.  
Mrs. Claudette Bradshaw (Moncton, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
He has been excellent to us and to the staff. 
I thought, since it is Friday, we might want to wish him all the best.  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
JUSTICE AND HUMAN RIGHTS 
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
GOODS AND SERVICES TAX 
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, today we will be answering Question No. 5. 
I suggest that the other questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have some answers which are long overdue. 
That answer is still outstanding.  
Mr. Speaker, there is a deadline for responding to questions.  
Mr. Speaker, I have noted Questions Nos. 31, 56 and 51. 
I will do my best to see what is happening to them.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it agreed that the remaining questions be allowed to stand?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
They have a problem with it.  
I would like to explain the process for deferred payments. 
Then they have up to 30 days to cash the cheque. 
They basically have 120 days in which to get paid. 
That was changed and shortened to 120 days.  
It brings to light the whole issue of the buyer beware type of scenario. 
They are also concerned about the fact that it is a levy. 
He has to wait until the end of the year to opt out. 
He has to maintain his records to see exactly how much levy he has paid. 
We are not sure whether to support it right now. 
There are some good things in it. 
I hope this government does not make that effort a futile one.  
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
What, however, is at the heart of this bill? 
The summary of the text reads as follows, and I quote: 
-to insure producers of special crops who are holders of cash purchase tickets- 
Is this not a way of making political appointments?  
This could easily become a conflict of interest.  
In other words, they cannot be traders. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
This legislation makes amendments to two acts and repeals a third. 
It is really a rather detailed and complex piece of legislation. 
The exchange is now regulated by the Canadian Grain Commission.  
We believe that farmers responded very creatively to this situation. 
The questions that have to be asked are these. 
If there are benefits, what will they ultimately cost? 
The answers to these questions give us great cause for concern.  
Bill C-26 proposes a licensing system for these smaller companies. 
In return for their being licensed they would not have to post large security bonds. 
Farmers have to pay this levy. 
They have no choice about this.  
This type of negative option billing is simply unacceptable to farmers.  
The proposed fund is extremely unpopular with farmers. 
They cannot afford the check-off. 
This time it is for special crops.  
These are some of the problems we see with these measures.  
This is seriously alarming to our caucus.  
The budget speech was entirely silent on agriculture. 
I find that very revealing. 
They have forgotten rural Canadians.  
The answer would appear to be not very much. 
It is much more than that. 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
This is happening all over Saskatchewan. 
They are trying their best. 
They are doing everything to make a penny out of it. 
Now the government has come up with Bill C-26. 
Farmers in the west are disillusioned. 
Farmers feel betrayed by the government. 
They could not care less right now about Bill C-26.  
What they do care about is some way to pay their bills. 
There is no hope. 
The government has provided no hope.  
The four curling rinks which surround the town have been closed. 
The worst is yet to come.  
Fifty-two towns had hospitals. 
I hope the people in my province are listening.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
This is a question and comment period. 
The hon. member for Winnipeg Centre may comment if he wishes.  
It is significant to note that the budget did not talk about agriculture. 
Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
The hon. member for Souris-Moose Mountain- 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Prince George-Peace River is correct. 
I felt it was very much in order for the parliamentary secretary to address that. 
The hon. parliamentary secretary can have 30 seconds to sum up. 
Then we will give the hon. member for Winnipeg Centre a minute in response.  
All of us are concerned about the rural economy.  
It needs an opportunity to enter into innovation. 
That is exactly what Bill C-26 is designed to do. 
Let us get the facts straight.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
The bill is composed of three parts.  
First it would repeal the Grain Futures Act. 
This is a positive change for the agricultural industry. 
The PC Party will support this aspect of the bill.  
The Canadian Export Development Corporation, CEDC, would be the insurer.  
I will comment on the insurance program later.  
I will comment on some of the thoughts expressed by the farming organizations out west.  
The motion reads as follows: 
Whereas the scheme has questionable support at the farm level; and 
Whereas the special crops industry has flourished without such a program; 
This resolution aptly describes what Bill C-26 fails to do. 
That would make sense. 
I hope the government considers giving farmers this choice.  
In principle the PC Party supports this legislation. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to make a couple of comments.  
It is the same case in C-26. 
I have a question for the hon. member from the Progressive Conservative Party. 
Mr. Speaker, those are some excellent questions from the member for Prince George-Peace River.  
There have been a number of sticky points in this piece of legislation. 
This has tentative support. 
The bill has merit. 
Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to make two very short comments. 
We have made a very good start today, an excellent start. 
We have tentative support from the official opposition. 
We have support in principle from the Progressive Conservative Party. 
That is a pretty good start. 
This would be a very good juncture to move the bill to committee.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
What we are doing is allowing the House to adjourn at its normal time. 
Do we have unanimous consent to see the clock as reading 2.30 p.m.?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House adjourned at 1.02 p.m.)
