Tuesday, May 11, 1999 
The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Let me provide honourable senators with two examples of direct access. 
The nurse would then check in by phone with the mother a few hours later. 
In this case, an unnecessary emergency room visit is averted.  
Annual nursing statistics released yesterday by the Canadian Institute of Health Information exemplify this situation. 
Their data show that an increasing number of nurses are leaving the profession. 
Hon. Therese Lavoie-Roux :
Palliative care is aimed at the relief of suffering. 
Central to its philosophy is the holistic focus on the family. 
In regard to palliative care, comforting goes well beyond the traditional curative model of practice.  
Honourable senators, will it be possible to meet the nation's health demands? 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is permission granted for her to continue?  
Thank you, honourable senators.  
How can we ensure that it will be given top priority? 
Let us celebrate the contributions being made today toward enhancing the well-being of Canadians.  
They are the force and heart of health care in Canada today. 
The contributions made by these individuals should be recognized every day. 
However, it is this week that the public officially recognizes their contributions.  
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
It puts into question our representation of all Canadians.  
Wednesday, May 5 was the date agreed upon for the meeting. 
Therefore, we postponed travelling to Ottawa in order to attend this meeting. 
The record will show that.  
Hon. Edward M. Lawson :
Honourable senators, I wish to add a brief comment. 
First, I endorse Senator St. Germain's remarks. 
Child Custody and Access 
Government Response to Special Joint Committee Report 
On the whole, my reaction is positive. 
That is to say, one size does not fit all.  
Grandparents have echoed this feeling. 
Luckily, that is what most parents want to be. 
The government's response is a step in the right direction. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
They met a number of senators. 
I thank honourable senators for their presentation. 
We are delighted to have you here in the Senate today.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government):
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Bill to Amend-First Reading 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Budget Implementation Bill, 1999 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Income Tax Amendments Bill, 1998 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Leave having been given to revert to Government Notices of Motions: 
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Wednesday, May 12, 1999, I will move: 
Child Custody and Access 
Government Response to Special Joint Committee Report-Notice of Inquiry 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, my question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I am not aware that Canada participated in the mission. 
This was, indeed, a tragic mistake. 
NATO does not deliberately target embassies or civilians.  
To what extent does Canada participate in intelligence gathering? 
Continuing diplomatic efforts are being made by Canada and other countries. 
He recently discussed the situation with President Chirac of France. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The displacement is a result of the despicable actions taken by Mr. Milosevic.  
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
As the honourable senator will know, we have our own security and intelligence agency. 
It is active on a day-to-day basis. 
Conflict in Yugoslavia-Embargo in the Adriatic Sea-Request for Update 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, all is safe now. 
Can he shed any light on where the question stands?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Who will take the decision once the situation has been reviewed?  
It is being reviewed by NATO. 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Several of them were dangerous and violent offenders travelling on civilian buses without an escort. 
Today's Ottawa Citizen contains a very disturbing story on a related topic. 
The headline reads, "Automatic parole comes under fire. 
Rash of escapes prompts calls for review."  
The author of the article, Tim Naumetz, notes: 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I anticipate that legislation will be introduced in the fall.  
What is the problem?  
If the Honourable Senator Oliver has been reading the newspapers, he will know the problem. 
There are inherent dangers to releasing anyone onto the streets. 
However, this government believes in rehabilitation. 
I know that the government is looking at many measures. 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
However, as is often said, the devil is in the detail. 
Most Canadians are well aware of the study. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
My honourable friend may have answered her own question. 
The devil is in the detail. 
In the meantime, there will be ongoing discussions.  
Most Canadians agree on the principles.  
Why do we not negotiate the legislation with the provinces? 
The Minister of Justice is active on a number of files. 
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
We know the government has to move quicker. 
Today, in the National Post , an article on the subject stated, in part: 
This matter is serious, Mr. Minister.  
I have been part of them.  
The outside consultation has been done.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, my question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I hope the government leader's computer arrives at the same sums as ours did.  
In 1999-2000, there will be more tax relief in the order of $6 billion. 
For three years, the total is $16.5 billion. 
This government has promised two more balanced budgets. 
Thank God for free trade.  
Senator Stratton is again correct. 
Canadians did it together, under a Liberal government. 
It required $41 billion of extra revenue.  
Inadequacies of Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Bill-Government Position 
Hon. Jean-Claude Rivest :
The bill has not yet been received in the Senate. 
I wish to alert the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Indeed, the commissioner only has a recommending power.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Pages Exchange Program with House of Commons 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Her major is journalism.  
I wish you welcome on behalf of all of the honourable senators.  
( a ) by replacing lines 28 and 29 on page 17 with the following: 
( c ) the request for extradition is made for"; and 
2. in Clause 2 and new Part 3: 
( a ) by substituting the term "general extradition agreement" for "extradition agreement" wherever it appears; 
( b ) by substituting the term "specific extradition agreement" for "specific agreement" wherever it appears; 
( c ) in clause 2, on page 2 
(i) by adding after line 5 the following: 
(ii) by deleting lines 6 to 10; 
(iii) by replacing line 11 with the following: 
" "extradition partner" means a State"; 
(iv) by adding after line 15 the following:

( d ) on page 32, by adding after line 6 the following: 
SURRENDER TO AN INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL 
( a ) as if the word "extradition" read "surrender to an international tribunal"; 
( b ) as if the term "general extradition agreement" read "general surrender agreement"; 
( c ) as if the term "extradition partner" read "surrender partner"; 
( d ) as if the term "specific extradition agreement" read "specific surrender agreement"; 
( e ) as if the term "State or entity" read "international tribunal";

( g ) with such other modifications as the circumstances require.  
"( b ) describe the offence in respect of which the surrender is requested;" and 
( f ) by renumbering all cross-references accordingly."  
The Hon. the Speaker :
At the time, the text of these amendments was only in English. 
Despite this, Senator Bolduc asked for a ruling from the Chair. 
Such an occurrence is not without precedent. 
It seems to me that this is the proper way of proceeding.  
The independence of both is essential to the proper operation of our form of government. 
How this is actually done in practice is a responsibility we all share.  
Third Reading-Motions in Amendment-Vote Deferred 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
I can state categorically that this was simply not the case. 
Our contribution, while significant, has been mainly complementary to theirs.  
By extension, this includes the Senate. 
This impression is very strong. 
Let me reiterate the facts:
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, the question is on the motion in amendment of the Honourable Senator Kinsella. 
Is it your pleasure to adopt the motion?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those opposed to the motion in amendment please say "nay."  
The Hon. the Speaker :
In my opinion, the "nays" have it.  
And two honourable senators having risen.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it agreed that the vote will be tomorrow at 3 p.m.?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Bill to Amend-Second Reading 
However, some people need additional help to meet their housing needs. 
CMHC mortgage loan insurance encourages a large number of options. 
It lowers the lost of financing housing and makes it easier to obtain loans. 
The housing industry is essential to our economy. 
The CMHC will also help Canadians sell their know-how to other countries. 
Canada is known worldwide for the high quality of its housing. 
The number of homeless people is constantly increasing. 
Canada is presently confronted with a major housing crisis. 
Honourable senators, I am quoting from a report entitled, "Finding Room:
Motion agreed to and bill read the second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall the bill be read the third time?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I refer you to rule 86(2) at page 97 which says: 
I refer you to rule 62(1)( i ), which says: 
Is leave granted to hear Honourable Senator Carstairs?  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
I do not know to whom the senator made informal representations. 
That is why I chose a member of that committee to sponsor the bill.  
Committee Authorized to Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau , pursuant to notice of May 6, 1999 moved: 
Budget Implementation Bill, 1999 
Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
Let me begin with health care. 
However, the story does not end there. 
The CCTB has two key components:
Bill C-71 proposes changes to both components. 
Bill C-71 acts on those consultations.  
I now wish to turn to an area that involves the administration of taxation. 
Let me highlight a few: 
The government has followed this practice for many years. 
These changes do not give the government more authority to borrow.  
Another amendment clarifies auctions of Government of Canada securities. 
The new rules set out the minister's authorities in more detail. 
The broad-based income tax cuts, for example, are part of Bill C-72. 
I urge honourable senators to support this bill.  
On motion of Senator Kinsella, for Senator Bolduc, debate adjourned.  
Income Tax Amendments Bill, 1998 
Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
Two measures in the legislation provide general tax relief. 
Low-income Canadians will benefit most. 
Now that the deficit is gone, it is time to remove the tax. 
I turn now to some of the targeted measures in this bill. 
Accordingly, several tax measures to assist students are included in this legislation.  
Bill C-72 makes several changes to the RESPs. 
There are also other targeted measures in this legislation. 
I urge all honourable senators to support this legislation. 
There is nothing controversial in the bill. 
On motion of Senator Kinsella, for Senator Tkachuk, debate adjourned.  
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration 
Thirty-third Report of Committee Adopted 
Honourable senators, I move the adoption of the report.  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Social Affairs, Science and Technology 
Dimensions of Social Cohesion in Canada- Budget Report of Committee on Study Adopted 
Honourable senators, I move the adoption of this report.  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Privileges, Standing Rules and Orders 
Tenth Report of Committee Adopted 
In French, the advertisement read as follows: 
Therefore, the notices have expired.  
Honourable senators, pursuant to Senate rule 108: 
Your committee considered Senator Taylor's request at its last meeting. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
I also appreciated the words of our colleague Senator Callbeck. 
In some countries, FGM has maintained endemic proportions. 
Unfortunately, this is not an isolated example. 
Others have explained that religion mandates the procedure. 
It is perhaps here that the real tragedy of the practice can be perceived. 
Many international organizations participate in this movement. 
These groups are committed to the eradication of excision.  
At the heart of the strategy is education. 
I find the suggestion no less repulsive. 
Our purpose should not be to criticize and condemn. 
As legislators, we have a moral responsibility to ensure that this heinous practice is eradicated. 
However, it must not stop there. 
Much remains to be done. 
I thank her for her excellent work.  
International Women's Week 
Participation of Women in Legislative Institutions-Inquiry-Debate Adjourned 
This is indeed very gradual progress.  
Honourable senators, this is not an issue of supply. 
This means that women have more difficulty finding the necessary funds among their peers. 
Many of the most successful female politicians in Canada have no children.  
The current situation is unacceptable. 
After every election, the results paint a different picture. 
The evidence is there. 
The analysis has been done. 
We know what we must do. 
What is stopping us?  
On motion of Senator Carstairs, debate adjourned.  
In recent years, palliative care among patients and their families has rapidly increased. 
Palliative care is a unique medical experience. 
He received chemotherapy and radiation. 
He came back to school where we provided him with special tutoring. 
He graduated with his class. 
In his first year of university, the tumour returned. 
He made the decision that, this time, it was right for him to go. 
At the funeral service, we sang those songs together. 
This issue was not originally included in the committee's mandate. 
The special Senate committee made five specific recommendations with respect to palliative care. 
We filed that report four years ago. 
Since 1995, there has been little action on this recommendation. 
This is clearly unacceptable. 
Canada needs to reclaim its position as a world leader in palliative care treatment. 
However, the need for quality palliative care has never been greater. 
Honourable senators, palliative care is, of course, a national issue. 
This year has been quite positive for the palliative care community in my province. 
These measures are long overdue. 
Palliative care is an essential component of our Canadian health care system. 
On motion of Senator Carstairs, for Senator Wilson, debate adjourned.  
The Senate adjourned until Wednesday, May 12, 1999 at 1:30 p.m.
