EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 40 
Friday, November 28, 1997 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
INCOME TAX CONVENTIONS IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1997 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
When shall the bill be read a third time? 
The effects of this tax apply basically to about 60,000 Canadians. 
It has gone to both committees where they have sent it back unamended. 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
Much of Bill C-10 concerns simple- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I just wanted to make you aware of that.  
Can I seek the unanimous consent of the House?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Does the hon. member have unanimous consent to split his time?  
For low income seniors, this meant 25% of their income disappeared. 
That is a 70% increase on the inclusion rate.  
Every senior who pays taxes will now pay more under this legislation. 
This is not exclusively the very rich. 
They are being taxed twice. 
I want to stress some key points before I conclude. 
First, this legislation was rushed through the industry committee. 
This makes me pretty suspicious that this legislation contains merely house cleaning matters.  
This is not true. 
Our supporters are not very rich. 
They are average Canadians who are hurt by the heavy burden of taxation. 
I am here to speak on behalf of Canadians.  
I fear that they do not have this voice with the government. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
There are no questions and comments at this time.  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
The fact of the matter is we do. 
This party is not made up of lemmings. 
Quite frankly, I think the hon. member for Edmonton-Strathcona knows that.  
The hon. member for Edmonton-Strathcona is here as a newly elected member of Parliament. 
I celebrate his being here. 
He is a creative, intelligent and thoughtful individual. 
All they do is criticize. 
They do not talk about comprehensive tax reform any more. 
They do not talk about the single tax system.  
The time is right. 
We should not avoid taking advantage of this opportunity. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I am not sure I understood right. 
Do I have ten, or twenty, minutes for my speech?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
That the Bloc has done. 
A sin confessed is half forgiven. 
At least the government acted and introduced a bill. 
You know how the Liberals across the way are. 
With them, nothing is ever simple. 
You know how the many Liberals listening to my remarks today are. 
They had to cloud the issue.  
We are all here.  
You are all here. 
Fine, they are all here listening carefully to what I am saying. 
But the Liberals crammed everything into a single bill. 
The purpose of these conventions is to avoid double taxation and prevent fiscal evasion. 
It is not a case of reinventing the wheel. 
There is a tax convention signed with these countries. 
Let us compare Canada's taxation system with the taxation systems of these countries. 
In Sweden these percentages are similar. 
There are rather significant differences at various levels. 
Of course, I am referring to the scandal of the family trusts. 
Everyone knows what that company is. 
This is not normal, especially considering who owns these ships. 
It is not normal that in Canada people should do such things.  
Is the Bloc's criticism negative? 
No, this is positive criticism. 
We want as much as possible- 
We want to remedy those flaws. 
These two examples, I think, are striking. 
What is involved here is not to have huge quantities of international tax conventions. 
They are saying that the same ones always end up paying, and I understand that.  
We think the tax system is too generous in this case.  
There are certain conditions, but they are easily met. 
That did not come about, but you know how determined the Bloc is. 
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
As the member for the Bloc said, it has been going on too long. 
These were issues the Bloc Quebecois and the Liberal government looked at very closely. 
We therefore knew where we were headed. 
There were also treaties with the OECD.  
What it all boils down to is that we have this bill. 
This does not mean, however, that there is no need for vigilance. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We will now proceed to Statements by Members.  
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
This is simply not true. 
Canada remains committed to human rights. 
This commitment was demonstrated in the government's support for the people's summit.  
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
Thank you, Mr. Beelen, and congratulations on your involvement in this important project.  
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
A two year old girl now cries out alone.  
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
In spite of the rhetoric, the Liberal government's attitude remains the same. 
It is more centralizing and domineering than ever. 
When the federal government takes a step forward, provincial governments take a step backward. 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Children in every part of our country are Canada's promise for the future. 
Keep up the excellent work.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
It is time for the government to get the message. 
No more chips at the convict snack shack while taxpayers take the dip.  
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
CATCSH alleges that Canadians are subsidizing an industry that kills baby seals. 
That is absolutely false.  
CATCSH alleges that the seal harvest provides few economic benefits. 
That is also false.  
That is absolutely false.  
REFORM PARTY OF CANADA 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
The New Democratic Party supports the process which began in Calgary. 
Shame on the official opposition.  
THE LATE JOHN SOPINKA 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Justice Sopinka had the ability to build coalition without watering down principles. 
His family and Canada mourn his departure for a higher court. 
Our sincere condolences to Mrs. Sopinka and the Sopinka family.  
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
For months this minister has said that she is taking the matter very seriously. 
Canadians do not believe her any more. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Canada's position will be known well before that time. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this gets more and more curious.  
It had already used up all the little excuses along the way. 
What excuse did it tell us all?  
What could that detail be? 
What went wrong on the way to Kyoto?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, what has gone wrong with the Reform Party? 
So what details are holding up the Reform Party in stating their position?  
They are the Official Opposition. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, obviously there is a hot air problem within cabinet at least.  
We are sick of waiting.  
The government promised again to release its position. 
It does not have a position. 
Will the Minister of the Environment- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. Deputy Prime Minister.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
My friend is totally wrong. 
They do not count. 
They do not care. 
Where is the Reform Party? 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we just have to keep going. 
This Liberal saga on Kyoto just continues. 
The Liberals have painted themselves into a corner. 
Now they have fallen victim to those rash promises. 
How can this minister board the plane for Kyoto? 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, guess what, this government does have a position. 
We have been articulating it for months. 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, delay after delay.  
Why has the government reneged on this deal with the provinces? 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Good environmentalists have a 3R background: reduce, recycle, reuse. 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the Environment.  
My question is a very simple one. 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
How can her world partners take her seriously?  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
We are trying to find a consensual opinion.  
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the Environment.  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this government does have a position. 
We have had a position. 
I have explained what our negotiating position is. 
Our targets and time lines will be made public on Monday.  
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Canada will be there. 
We will play our full role.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. 
What is going on- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. Deputy Prime Minister.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
I understand the concerns of Canadians about whether appropriate procedures were followed.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
We are getting more like them instead of them getting more like us.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
The RCMP is reviewing the appropriateness of the matter of signing these undertakings. 
I am sure more will have to be said. 
I understand the concerns this practice has created. 
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
This is a major breakthrough. 
How can he say that this is negligible?  
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the minister must be out to lunch. 
It is fine with this Liberal government. 
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
We realize this is not enough and we want to see it go even further. 
We have the lowest 30-year rate on our debt. 
These are sound accomplishments on behalf of all Canadians.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
This conference starts Monday. 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I certainly would not want to contradict my colleague, the Minister of Finance. 
Of course, I support his position.  
What I can tell you is that, as minister- 
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
Yes, yes, you had no choice. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
What I can tell you- 
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
It is other people's fault.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew: -were unheard of. 
Our government has surpluses, while the Conservatives had deficits. 
We manage the employment insurance fund in a responsible way.  
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
That is responsible fiscal management.  
Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay-Okanagan, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, there is a tired old cliche that the cheque is in the mail. 
However it was not delivered. 
It is lost somewhere in post office limbo. 
Judy Gillespie and thousands of others like her are listening to his answer right now. 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay-Okanagan, Ref.):
This is an overwhelming hardship on Canadians most in need.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
This is the best system that we could provide during this difficult time.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
I would like to have an agreement with Quebec, but it does not want to- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Temiscamingue.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this evaluation should have been done months ago. 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, quite simply we call it the system. 
Then if there are any decisions to be made, they will be made.  
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I share the hon. member's concern about the serious situation in Algeria. 
We have held several discussions with Algeria's Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
I am happy to learn that European parliamentarians will be going to Algeria next week. 
Canada is certainly prepared to undertake- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Sault Ste. Marie.  
Mr. Carmen Provenzano (Sault Ste. Marie, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
The United States administration is very sympathetic to the need. 
We are working very closely with those congressmen and senators. 
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
I ask the solicitor general- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Parliamentary Secretary to the Solicitor General of Canada.  
Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
What does he have to say to them?  
Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
English is my second language, but now I understand the meaning of ignorance.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
I want to help. 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for the question. 
He raises some very important elements of our negotiations in Kyoto. 
In fact, those are part of our negotiation position.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
In other words, name me your country and I will name you my principles.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
That is a sign of how engagement can work.  
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the President of Treasury Board.  
In Canada, we are free to practice the religion of our choice. 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
We are well aware that the tax burden is considerable. 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Minister of International Trade.  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
There was agreement around the entire table.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Winnipeg Centre.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the idea is by no means postponed.  
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
My question is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. 
This program has been a major success story. 
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is addressed to the minister responsible for the Ministry of Transport.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Transport Canada's top priority is public safety. 
How dare he answer this.  
As a preventive measure some 100 households were evacuated. 
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
But tomorrow is here.  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
We will let those members know on Monday what our targets and time lines are.  
This is a real and serious issue. 
The hon. member's constituents are concerned about it. 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Minister of International Trade.  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is a very important question. 
We have spoken with industry representatives in Quebec and in Canada. 
We are willing to review this matter and we are working very hard on this. 
I hope to be able to provide more information in the near future.  
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, as you are aware, we have implemented a major employment insurance reform. 
We feel that the reserve is absolutely necessary. 
I believe it is important that there be such a reserve.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The member for West Nova.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the government has a loans program which is very effective. 
It is very effective.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Hon. members, this would bring us to the end of Question Period.  
BOARD OF INTERNAL ECONOMY

The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
INCOME TAX CONVENTIONS IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1997 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
For the most part, we support the direction of the bill.  
However, we have major concern with part VII of the bill. 
What is happening to them is unfair because it is done retroactively. 
Bill C-9 was layered with different taxation items.  
The benefits however were not subject to any U.S. income tax.  
The protest continued for a fair amount of time. 
Last April the government made the announcement that there would be change. 
Indeed, that change has been made in the bill which is before the House today.  
This is very unfair. 
This was done without properly consulting the people who were affected.  
These citizens were not properly consulted. 
They certainly did not approve the change. 
For these people, the change is not good. 
They did their planning based on the rules and then the rules change.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Initially, the reaction by the affected groups to the announcement was extremely positive. 
First, let us take a look at how the Liberals came to this point. 
Although they are trying, unfortunately they have unsatisfactorily succeeded here.  
Those are American dollars not Canadian. 
For this I congratulate the government. 
However, it is unfortunate that a consistent policy cannot be followed. 
However in my opinion the same standards should have been used for military service personnel.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, Bill C-10 makes me angry for several reasons. 
They tried to hide the fact that it was a tax grab. 
I will now talk about Mr. Farrel Mok. 
He has recently undergone a liver transplant and his medication costs are very high. 
They are arrogant and out of touch. 
They are elitist because they think they know better. 
The taxman had the whole arm of seniors. 
Liberal tax increases have been out there since Confederation. 
I wish people would finally realize what is going on.  
The first question is who wants it. 
Let us look at some of the other stakeholders. 
That is a total of 100,000 people who do not want it.  
They are the only people who want it.  
Then we have to ask who will pay for it. 
It will be on the backs of seniors.  
Once again the Liberals have brought in 37 tax increases. 
The Canada pension plan increase is the 38th. 
This time it is particularly insidious because it is not hitting all taxpayers. 
They are the ones who will pay the bill. 
Shame on the Liberals for calling it a mere technical change.  
Who will slip through the cracks? 
The Liberal said they would give a tiggly-wiggly rebate to some people. 
Those are the ones who will slip through the cracks.  
The government does not need more money. 
It spends it unwisely.  
I raise it now because it is relevant to the debate.  
Who slips through the cracks? 
The 50,000 seniors are the ones who will get nailed by this measure. 
Does it solve the problem it was intended to address? 
What was the problem? 
There was a complication. 
Does it solve the problem of the complexity? 
Yes, it makes sure Canada has sole jurisdiction. 
It no longer goes to the United States.  
The list gets worse. 
Now it comes to how much it will cost. 
It could be much more for many of them. 
They did not have the courage to raise this issue before the election. 
No, they dillied and they dallied. 
Why did they bring it in right after they secured their mandate in an election? 
It is because they know these things are unpopular. 
They did not have the courage to do it. 
They knew it would impact on votes, the bottom line for Liberals. 
They left the decision until after the election. 
They brought it in on the heels of their mandate. 
Shame on the Liberals.  
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I want to correct the record. 
The hon. member obviously does not have his facts correct. 
The majority will be better off.  
I think Reform Party members should get their facts straight.  
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
I have knocked on doors and talked about the issue. 
They live in Canada and they use our health care system. 
They do not want special treatment. 
Madam Speaker, I have just heard the admission I need. 
She made it right here in the House. 
Once again I just want to drive it home for the seniors in Windsor. 
Madam Speaker, I believe the hon. member has confused the record once again. 
We sat down with them and worked out the numbers.  
We have to move forward.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
CANADA CO-OPERATIVES ACT 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Motion No. 1 will be debated and voted on separately.  
Motion No. 2 will be debated and voted on separately.  
I will now propose Motion No. 1 to the House.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (for the Minister of Industry) moved: 
``(b) subject to subsection (8), appoint a director to fill the vacancy.''  
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
We would like to put forward these amendments now. 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I regret having to interrupt my colleague. 
There is one more grouping. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there unanimous consent?  
We would like to put forward these amendments now. 
The first relates to section 85 of the bill. 
The bill has three main objectives. 
The first consists in revitalizing the rules for managing co-operatives. 
The new legislation will enable Canadian co-operatives to operate effectively. 
The co-operatives have been anxiously awaiting this reform. 
The industry committee heard from several witnesses. 
One substantive issue was raised at committee. 
This amendment was passed in committee.  
Five other amendments were passed in committee. 
These were all technical in nature and did not raise any debate.  
I will be pleased to address the second amendment in a few minutes.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
It pointed out, in particular, certain concerns raised by the bill. 
The amendment is not insignificant. 
I will try to make this a bit clearer. 
The first amendment eliminates the ``until the next annual meeting''.  
This is an important sector of our economy. 
One of these principles is the power of the annual general meeting.  
We therefore oppose this first amendment.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
I think the co-op sets a good example for all of us. 
The whole co-op structure is based on accountability to the members. 
That is part of the reason why the whole process works so well.  
We pay $45 billion a year in interest. 
These are all realities Canadians have to face. 
The co-operatives have demonstrated this in the management of their own operations. 
We do not seem to be able to do it in this House. 
What is equally tragic about this whole thing is that we are not listening. 
We are going to hike up payroll taxes. 
The hope of our youth is being crushed with high payroll taxes.  
It is more of a concern than a consolation.  
They want the ability to manage their own affairs. 
They could do it successfully. 
They are planning for their future in a very competitive marketplace.  
That seems to be very wise in this day and age. 
Twenty-nine new spending initiatives were announced, even in the face of that. 
These are not the answers.  
There is some hope. 
That tells me that there is a ray of hope here. 
The co-operatives are allowed to plan for their future.  
Let us take this simple bill and use it as an example- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Resuming debate, the hon. member for Churchill River.  
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
That shows great respect for the co-operative movement. 
These amendments seem to be all but technical issues. 
There is one key phrase among these items, ``Truly Canadian''. 
That is probably the most powerful message of the co-operative movement. 
That is a unity message for us. 
We have seen the Arctic co-ops shine. 
All of a sudden the fur trade began to wither away. 
STANDING COMMITTEE ON FINANCE 
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation 877 states: 
The first two paragraphs state: 
They view Parliament as a nuisance. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is on the same point of order raised by the hon. member.  
First, we are not talking about legislation.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In the opinion of the Chair, we are now getting into debate. 
However, we will not get into debate on the merits at this time.  
The Speaker will rule on the potential point of privilege.  
CANADA CO-OPERATIVES ACT 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
The co-operatives have taken on challenges. 
We cannot blame them for that because the effort was worth it. 
It is a major success. 
Look at the crown corporations. 
We have been selling off our railroads to American interests. 
All of a sudden Omnitrax owns major tracks of railroads in western Canada. 
I encourage all Canadians to support their co-operatives in their regions. 
The parties have united in supporting the co-operatives bill. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
This was the birth of co-operatives in Canada.  
The PC Party is pleased to support this legislation. 
Let me highlight some of the main characteristics of Bill C-5.  
Bill C-5 redefines and widens the definition of co-operative basis. 
The new definition includes the principle of open membership. 
Finally, the principle of education is included.  
Bill C-5 makes changes to the rules governing incorporation. 
It permits co-operatives to incorporate provided they operate on a co-operative basis.  
This memorandum is submitted to the minister. 
The proposed system is simpler and would streamline the administrative practices. 
As a result, they are awarded the same rights and privileges of a natural person. 
Record keeping under Bill C-5 is simplified and streamlined. 
Currently they are governed under general rules in the existing act. 
Bill C-5 attempts to resolve this problem.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
As all Quebeckers know, Levis is the cradle of the Mouvement Desjardins. 
The first Caisse populaire Desjardins was founded on December 6, in 1900 I think. 
The centenary is coming up. 
Over four million Quebeckers belong to the Mouvement Desjardins.  
Levis is the site of the Conseil de cooperation du Quebec. 
There are two large groups of co-operatives in Canada. 
There is also an equivalent organization for the anglophone community across Canada.  
They came to testify and to submit their briefs while pursuing the same objectives. 
We have always insisted on that.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(Motion No. 1 agreed to) 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. government House leader, on a point of order.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
I understood there were two of them.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the suggestion of the government House leader. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.) moved:

The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
CANADA PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
BILL C-2-NOTICE OF TIME ALLOCATION 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
GOODS AND SERVICES TAX 
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP) moved: 
In fact all reading material.  
The GST is the first federal tax on reading in Canada's history. 
Provinces have never taxed books. 
Literacy learners who mostly buy their own materials must pay tax. 
Parents who buy their children books must pay tax.  
It was a very special event to be involved in a public reading. 
We all know reading is something quiet and restorative. 
It is a healthy, nurturing and calming pastime.  
Reading is educational, sustainable, non-polluting and non-violent, an A1 activity. 
One can be enjoying a favourite column in the newspaper or the weekend funnies.  
Canada has a very high illiteracy rate. 
The GST makes reading material more expensive. 
The GST prices reading materials out of reach of low income Canadians. 
It is truly regressive for that reason. 
The government's own data say so. 
After all, it is the age of the Internet and computers. 
Why do we want to be literate? 
Because it is good for business. 
Strong literacy skills are even more essential in this technologically driven era. 
Bear in mind, one has to be able to read to use the Internet. 
Today's new jobs require highly literate workers. 
The percentage of unemployment decreases as the literacy level decreases. 
Let us consider the astounding economics of book publishing. 
Many consumers simply would not remit the GST on their subscription renewals. 
It is about a mythical town of fools. 
What we need to do is empower the consumer. 
Books are for learning and improving. 
They are not cash cows. 
The prime minister said so himself.  
What about the individual consumer?  
Taxing books deals a crippling blow to our fight against illiteracy. 
On the road to Lunenburg 
A village by the sea 
I met some politicians 
Here's what they said to me; 
This is the road to Lunenburg 
We're committed to literacy 
about reading and the GST?  
On the road to Heart's Content 
In the middle of Newfoundland 
I met a group of children 
Here's what they said, off hand; 
We really like your books miss, 
We really like them a lot 
Where do we go to get them?  
In the middle of the galaxy, 
I met a child who always smiled 
Here's what she said to me; 
Yesterday I saw the moon 
It wasn't in the sky 
It was in a book-it sounded round 
The gold got in my eye.  
You see-I learned to read, miss.  
Isn't it grand?  
I never knew it possible 
To hold the moon in my hands 
I never knew it possible 
To hold the moon in my hands.  
It is time we took the tax off our country's imagination.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Does the hon. member have unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the government is firmly committed to supporting literacy. 
In addition, it is an efficient and responsible investment. 
It is a priority which is reflected when we speak with Canadians.  
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
I applaud the member for Dartmouth for presenting this motion. 
As the cost of books and reading materials goes up, the demand goes down. 
That is the irrefutable law of supply and demand.  
It will be a great day for Canada.  
However, when the cost of labour goes up, demand for that labour goes down. 
When the cost of books goes up, the demand goes down. 
Let me provide the House with another example. 
When we save our money we are taxed at 54%.  
This is another example of the perverse incentives which taxes can create. 
The incentive in this case is not to save. 
There is also the question of capital gains tax. 
This is a tax on productivity. 
For every tax and government regulation created there is an unseen and unintended consequence. 
Big government is a disease masquerading as its own cure. 
I wish the NDP could come to appreciate this fact.  
We subsidize Canadian book publishers to the tune of almost $20 million. 
A GST tax exemption would add to this preferential treatment.  
Canadian businesses are overtaxed. 
Canadian consumers are overtaxed. 
I am very sympathetic to this claim. 
But this is not a threat to literacy in the country.  
I can understand the frustration which the hon. member feels for this issue. 
The Liberals broke their promise to scrap the GST as it applies to books. 
Campaigning promises should be kept.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
The motion reads as follows: 
Illiterate persons are those who do not know this code. 
That having been said, it is inappropriate to translate literacy by ``alphabetisme''. 
According to the government, illiteracy is not a problem in Canada. 
This document is based on the International Adult Literacy Survey.  
Twenty-six per cent are at the second level. 
Thirty-five per cent are at the third level of reading. 
In Canada, the tax is imposed only by the federal government. 
This tax has had a very negative impact. 
Anyone in the country who wants to buy reading material must pay a tax. 
Students who want to buy books must pay taxes. 
Functionally illiterate people who want to learn to read must pay a tax. 
Parents who want to buy books for their children must pay a tax. 
I have something to tell members opposite. 
But that is not enough. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
We see this as a continuing process. 
However, the government must act with prudence. 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of literacy in our society. 
I thank my colleague for putting her motion before the House of Commons. 
I will be focusing on the problem of literacy.  
According to Statistics Canada, many graduating university students are considered to be functionally literate.  
We have a problem here that is of a big magnitude. 
The funding for that agency was due to end in 1993-94. 
Many positive things are taking place in society. 
A council of ministers is looking at the issue of education across the country. 
We spend per capita more than almost any other country in the world. 
Next to Sweden we spend over $50 billion a year on education. 
We would have democracy through the regional government. 
That would be the first step.  
The second step would a revamp of the way we do things. 
We need a national strategy for education and literacy. 
We need national literacy and education standards. 
Unfortunately we do not have that now. 
There are many complications in the system. 
I am delighted by that.  
Who is setting the priority? 
It will not help everyone if every student wants to be enrolled in history. 
There is no national strategy by the provinces to address this issue.  
We are a nation of different provinces. 
We all live under one Confederation. 
To that extent education is a provincial responsibility. 
That is fine, fair and square. 
Look at what happened in the province of Ontario, for example, with Bill 160. 
That is what is necessary. 
There is no doubt in my mind.  
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I will try to be brief.  
That is what my colleague pointed out. 
He indicated that we do not need school boards. 
That is a major debate.  
If the student survives, great. 
In reality, the majority of these graduates are 17 and 18. 
We are short-circuiting our investment on our children.  
Why not take this huge tax grab that we call GST and invest it correctly?  
We won that war. 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
I, frankly, prefer the latter.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to just add my two bits worth to this debate.  
I have seen and heard them myself. 
That is using taxpayers' money.  
Perhaps we should strike a deal. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The time for Private Members' Business has expired. 
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, that is about as much time as I am going to need.  
I thought this was something we might be able to come together on.  
That was really the only issue we had to be discussing today. 
A lot of red herrings were hauled out on to the floor this afternoon. 
I am very disappointed at that. 
I want to close with a request to the Liberals. 
Please, do what you said you were going to do. 
This is from the heritage minister. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House adjourned at 2.34 p.m.)
