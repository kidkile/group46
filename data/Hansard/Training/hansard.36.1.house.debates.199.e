EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 199 
Thursday, March 18, 1999 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary):
CANADIAN TOURISM COMMISSION ACT 
CARRIAGE BY AIR ACT 
(Motion agreed to and bill read the first time) 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
The petitioners support research into the bioartificial kidney. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, Question No. 135 will be answered today. 
Question No. 135- Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien: 
I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
I would like these questions answered. 
I do not know why it has been taking so long.  
Is it agreed that the remaining questions stand?  
REQUEST FOR EMERGENCY DEBATE 
I understand that a similar motion was brought up the other day. 
I would ask him to be very succinct in his explanation.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, precisely what is happening is nothing. 
I believe that would be very beneficial in moving this strike along. 
Why there could not have been something in place I do not know.  
I believe this is an emergency.  
I will return to the House.  
INCOME TAX AMENDMENTS ACT, 1998 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
It is really that simple.  
The legislation before us contains two measures providing general tax relief. 
This helps to make Canada's tax system fair.  
The facts speak for themselves. 
The financial burden on students must and will be reduced. 
This measure will benefit about one million Canadians.  
Educational assistance payments are for students enrolled in full time education. 
Specifically, the amount will be increased to $50,000 from $40,000.  
Among them is the proposed new caregiver credit. 
I am sure hon. members would also want to support this initiative. 
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Madam Speaker, I thank the members of the House for that consideration.  
This government should be ashamed of itself.  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member has just started his speech. 
I am sure he is just about to make his comments relevant.  
Madam Speaker, I am just getting warmed up here. 
That is not so. 
Some of these funds are quite active and really serve a need.  
We are always in favour of allowing Canadians to keep their own money. 
That is a great idea. 
There is something like $126 billion in unused contribution room outstanding. 
I presume that helps young single mothers in particular. 
There is a lot of merit in doing that.  
What on earth is this government up to? 
Are we on a fast track again? 
We cannot afford it. 
Yet this goes on year after year. 
We could add hockey players to that list too. 
It is not like they cannot see it coming. 
It has been rewarded as being a have not province by the government in Ottawa. 
They have the same tax philosophy. 
It has been proven that lower taxation leads to higher revenues. 
Alberta and Ontario are certain proof of that. 
Ireland has just reduced its tax regime and it is booming. 
Why can we not catch on to that ideology?  
The government is hungry for any positive PR spin. 
The unfortunate part is that it is an insult. 
One very seldom qualifies for NISA. 
It is a net income thing. 
He goes ahead and subtracts that amount from the nation's books. 
He takes it right out of the taxpayers' pockets.  
But this practice is pretty easy to follow.  
The minister makes an announcement of, say, $2.5 billion. 
Then, without parliamentary approval, he charges that to the expenditure side. 
We need to stand alone. 
We have a low dollar, very high taxes and low productivity. 
The polls show us that no one really identifies with this concept of productivity. 
That correlates into about $28,000 for a family of four. 
It is because of high taxes and the low dollar. 
We are paying more and getting less. 
It is very unfortunate.  
I would like to present an amendment at this time. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the amendment is receivable.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
That has really been a concern for me. 
If we ask most Canadians they probably will not understand in detail what productivity means. 
Their standard of living has been dropping.  
I think it is important to note whose fault it is. 
It is very difficult. 
They are cautious in their businesses. 
Look at the statistics. 
That happened again this year. 
This is a trend that has been taking place for some time. 
For that reason I cannot possibly support this piece of legislation.  
I believe the level of tax now is completely out of line. 
That is so true. 
They have given a small part back and have said ``Aren't we grand?'' 
That is nothing to brag about. 
We could start leaving more dollars in the pockets of the people who earn it. 
They did not earn much because there is a real mess in the industry. 
They are overtaxed, no doubt.  
That is a very reasonable expectation.  
The finance minister had his chance. 
Probably he was not allowed to do so by others in cabinet. 
Do I fault the finance minister for that? 
He has to make that happen and he did not. 
I do not want to impute motive. 
The government is talking about next year's budget already. 
It is trying to forget this one. 
We have noticed that in question period. 
I just have to ask why. 
The Prime Minister will be stepping down within the next year or two. 
I think all Canadians expect that. 
Maybe some people would say next year is good enough. 
There are a couple of things wrong with that. 
They need that relief now. 
There are families struggling just to make ends meet. 
I am talking about food and basic clothing. 
What will happen next year? 
Will cabinet allow that? 
That is another issue and I will not get into it.  
There are several other ministers like her. 
They think elections are bought and won. 
They do not really care, I guess. 
I should not really say that because I do not know. 
I know they care about the country. 
They would not be here if they did not. 
It should not be taken from them and given back. 
It should be left in their pockets as much as possible. 
They did not do that this year. 
That is not good enough. 
Our plan does that. 
The room is there. 
He may think it will help him win the leadership race. 
It just will not happen with that kind of budget.  
Canadians are starting to understand what is going on. 
Now they are starting to see why. 
That is of real concern to me.  
The guilt should be on the shoulders of government members for not acting. 
They are the ones who had the opportunity to act very quickly on this issue. 
That is what that would mean. 
It is a failure and I believe I am saying what they would say.  
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
Incidentally, it is difficult to understand how this government plans its budgets. 
But then, what does the Minister of Finance do with his officials? 
He fiddles with the figures. 
But this year, in 1999, surpluses will reach $26 billion.  
The EI fund belongs to unemployed workers and employers. 
This government has not put one red cent into it. 
What is it doing with the money in the EI fund? 
The examples are numerous. 
Because they are going to negotiate internationally. 
International law will play a role.  
They need a chance to catch their breath. 
The concerns of our unemployed are increasing. 
Bill C-72 is silent on the millennium scholarships. 
Who, at the federal level, will administer the foundation? 
We do not know how much it will cost. 
We saw what happened with the last budget.  
What is the government doing to eliminate its deficit? 
It pumps off the surpluses in employment insurance. 
Today the government has stopped providing services free of charge. 
However, in a society such as ours, the government has its share. 
I will not get back to Bill C-72. 
The current Minister of Finance is a creative bookkeeping artist. 
How can we believe such a Minister of Finance? 
An entire country does not know what to think.  
The most important minister after the Prime Minister is the Minister of Finance. 
The Bloc Quebecois now has 46% of voting intentions in Quebec. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Ms. Annik Chenier is a young woman who attends Saint Paul University here in Ottawa. 
I bring this up because this really portrays what students are facing.  
I will go through them. 
She described her situation to me. 
She works in a fast food outlet, making minimum wage. 
She is raising two children and pays more than 50% of her income toward rent. 
Would she have more money substantially to pay for her rent? 
Would she have more money to put food on the table? 
I think we have a really serious problem in this country. 
We have now had a succession of budgets. 
We had the education budget. 
We had the budget this year that was a so-called health budget. 
There is talk about the children's budget next year. 
I think that is a real sad day for Canada. 
It failed to address those issues. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I listened to my hon. colleague's comments with interest. 
Unfortunately that is not the case. 
Too many people read from prepared texts and so on that someone else has written.  
Today we are talking about income tax. 
It is a painful experience.  
The other day I ran into some young people who are self-employed. 
They are in the consulting business. 
It is almost a form of self-mutilation.  
They read through the explanations and that is complicated, step by step. 
There are computer programs now. 
She was thinking this was a little book, something like a little handout.  
Nobody can understand it. 
We have some very intelligent people here. 
It goes like this. 
Makes sense to me.  
It is perfectly clear. 
It cannot be revoked after all of that.  
Let it be perfectly clear, this is what this is all about. 
There is more gobbledegook in this piece of legislation. 
It is like I am reading from some sort of tragicomedy.  
I know nobody here is able to. 
The ones who are not here today, maybe they are the intelligent ones.  
Hire a tax lawyer.  
Come on, it is simple stuff.  
Mr. Speaker, my Liberal friend says this is simple stuff. 
It takes a special kind of personality to handle that kind of stuff. 
There are no white pages, they are all grey. 
That is what it is all about.  
That is what we are doing today. 
They are mainly designed to show how to avoid paying taxes. 
They are today's best-sellers. 
This is a depressing debate today. 
These provisions by and large are probably fairly decent. 
Canadians are demanding real tax reform. 
They want to change the system. 
The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance is here. 
I value his judgment. 
I hope he asks me a question.  
Are you asking him a question?  
I am asking him a question. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is always a pleasure- 
I do have a lot of respect for the member. 
That is certainly why I am here.  
There are a number of issues. 
I grant him that. 
Mr. Speaker, I had a vision as my friend was speaking. 
Somebody said it is like a drunken sailor taking taxes. 
These changes are a mere a pittance.  
There are minute improvements to our tax system. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
We never know quite what we will hear about.  
Today he was talking about multi-armed Hindu goddesses. 
There is another kind of Hindu goddess, a multi-breasted Hindu goddess. 
Tax issues are fundamentally important.  
My colleague from the New Democratic Party was speaking of the complicated tax code. 
One of the Liberal members suggested that he hire a tax lawyer. 
This is an area that I would argue is tied in directly with productivity. 
Currently the tax code is a barrier.  
We have a negative savings rate. 
Canadians are in fact going behind a bit every year. 
They are not saving but falling behind. 
They are paying too much taxes.  
This had risen to $150 billion by last year. 
That is currently the case. 
We have the highest rate ever of personal bankruptcies. 
We have the highest rates of personal debt ever. 
Wealth is a relative concept. 
It is not really a singular criterion. 
One's wealth or a country's wealth is a comparative figure. 
Canadians in a relative sense have become poorer. 
This is perversely wrong. 
With economic growth come economic cost increases and upward pressures. 
They are willing to make that choice. 
We cannot devalue our way to prosperity. 
The government did not address some of those fundamental issues I described. 
It is looking at different fundamentals than the ones I see. 
Productivity is not bad. 
Canadians are not concerned about their standard of living. 
Canadians are increasingly concerned about productivity. 
Canadians are increasingly concerned about their standard of living. 
The dollar is linked very closely to productivity. 
There has be a secular decline in the dollar over the past 30 years. 
The best way to approach that is through productivity. 
The hon. member for Cumberland-Colchester has raised this point in the House. 
His interventions have taken a toll on this government. 
There are issues of regulation. 
The government has no core industrial strategy. 
This government is on cruise control. 
It is a caretaker government. 
I think in fact that is the case. 
It is a perilous time for Canada to suffer from this leadership deficit.  
At this time we need governments to make strong decisions. 
Unfortunately these types of policies are not forthcoming.  
There are serious problems. 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
My colleague talked about productivity. 
There is not enough food to feed every one of those birds. 
Government does not create jobs. 
Government creates the proper environment for job creation. 
The private sector creates jobs. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his insightful and erudite intervention.  
Once they were elected they recognized those were the right policies.  
Oil was 18 cents a gallon.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
The member has made a serious error. 
He should acknowledge it and explain to the House that he was in error. 
The member should correct the error or the impression he has left with the House. 
Mr. Speaker, I made some notes during the hon. member's question. 
I am glad the member mentioned the unemployment rate. 
He is quite right that recently the unemployment rate has decreased. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member talked about costing things out. 
Let me help the hon. member. 
He referred to a whole bunch of tax initiatives. 
What did they cost? 
They cost the treasury $17 billion. 
The hon. member is using Liberal math in this regard. 
I hope his party starts sharing that value.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
I will temper my remarks with the realization that that occurred.  
Let us realize something. 
Let us be clear. 
A deficit is an overdraft. 
It was every year. 
Municipalities put their houses in order. 
Municipalities paid down their debt. 
My own city of Mississauga is debt free. 
We hear about the cuts which this government has made. 
What choice was there? 
Do we continue to spend into oblivion? 
Do we continue to run up the overdraft and increase the debt?  
Then it takes that deficit and piles it on top of the debt. 
That, in essence, is how we have arrived at such a large debt.  
This government has made commitments. 
We have reduced the debt by $20 billion. 
In two successive budgets we have reduced taxes. 
I believe they will. 
That is a commitment that our finance minister has made.  
We should tell them the facts. 
Is our tax system complicated? 
You bet it is. 
Should we review it to see if we can smooth it out? 
I think we should. 
This government would not be afraid to admit that the tax system is complicated. 
I want to congratulate the institute. 
I want to return to the issue of harmonization. 
We have done that in some parts of the country. 
They do not want to give up their fiefdoms. 
I think they are pretty good and Canadians should know about them.  
This bill does that.  
This measure I think is very important. 
There is a tax credit for interest on student loans. 
We hear about the debt burden of students. 
We have heard Reform members say they would bring in user fees. 
We know that the Reform Party believes in two tier health care. 
There is a tax credit for caregivers. 
There are all kinds of serious benefits for the taxpayer in this bill. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Yet his government has done nothing to simplify the tax system.  
Do they think the Canadian people are stupid? 
They know the cuts the Reform Party has proposed in its campaign documentation. 
Our facts are very clear. 
The Reform is just blowing smoke.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
To leave it like that is not correct. 
It adds to the personal tax revenue of the Government of Canada.  
It comes to an issue of credibility.  
I wrote some notes from his comments about the level of taxation. 
There is a ripple effect in terms of jobs creation, et cetera.  
He was not subject to questions and comments. 
I used no general deductions such as RRSPs or any other. 
I went even further. 
I looked at somebody making $20,000 a year. 
We go from 27% to 20%.  
When I looked at these things I understood the actual burden of taxes. 
Here is the point. 
That represents about 10% of all income tax payers. 
They have provided very little factual information. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
I was very interested in his presentation of the facts. 
It was not effective to give it more income.  
Both people are working because they cannot live on one income. 
Many of them are forced into that. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, it is interesting to debate this issue today. 
Traditionally budget measures are kept secret. 
There are some valid reasons for that. 
It has been a tradition that budget matters have been confidential.  
They selectively and incorrectly leak information to the press.  
I suppose there is nothing wrong with that. 
My colleague from Crowfoot and I like to look good. 
It was a comedy act. 
It was an endless stream of incomprehensible gibberish. 
I did not even look at the Income Tax Act. 
I did the same as the member. 
Let me read from page 104: 
That is only one of the sections. 
It goes on and on. 
It is totally convoluted.  
It should not involve the question of having another election. 
There is no mechanism to improve anything.  
I suppose one could say it is a classic. 
He observed how democracy works. 
There are a lot of areas to improve. 
I believe that is what is happening here. 
I ask a fundamental question. 
That is a wrong basis on which to govern.  
It is time that we got some economic freedom. 
We always talk about freedom. 
We are economic slaves to the government. 
People are crunched into the corner. 
Who looks after the children while both parents are working? 
Half of what they earn goes to taxes.  
I mentioned the example before. 
We have municipal taxes. 
We have provincial taxes. 
We have income taxes. 
We have excise taxes. 
We have import taxes. 
We have sin taxes. 
It goes on and on and on. 
The same thing is true for my property tax. 
I can if I am in business. 
Then there is a different rule, another minute rule that controls our lives.  
There is not a thing I can do about it.  
What does this government and the government before it do? 
Bill C-72 says ``We are going to make it nicer for these students. 
That sounds wonderful, but it is a crock. 
It is a crime that they have that debt load in the first place. 
It does not address the big problem at all.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
We looked into Mr. Unger's case to see if we could help him out.  
It was one of the saddest things. 
This man had been married to his wife for over 30 years. 
My hon. colleague has referred to some of these rules and regulations. 
The Ungers are not the only ones to have come into my office. 
Madam Speaker, it is really sad. 
If we stop to think about it, this is incredibly sad. 
I used the quotation from Alexis de Tocqueville. 
One of the words is ``tyranny''. 
We can use these tax rules to tyrannize our population, our citizens.  
I would like to see the government resign over this and call an election. 
I came out shaking my head. 
We made that choice. 
She does not directly earn my income. 
The tax code ought to stay out of my life.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, it is always interesting to hear the Reform Party. 
The Reform Party did provide a prebudget submission. 
The CHST goes to support provincial governments in their pursuit of funding post-secondary education. 
That is what you used to do.  
Canadians expect something more than that kind of heckling from the member opposite. 
We have balanced the budget. 
It is a significant financial accomplishment''. 
Yes, there are some things in this bill which are good and which are commendable. 
I know it is taxation and it is legitimate. 
In terms of financial positions, our overall philosophy is very clear. 
That is the overriding philosophy. 
I believe in that very strongly.  
That is what is happening here.  
The taxation levels are way too high. 
That is why families are in financial distress. 
I think it is time that this government woke up to it. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
That basic criticism still applies. 
What we had against the 1998 budget still holds true today.  
Let us render unto Caesar what is Caesar's. 
The Bloc Quebecois had proposed these measures as a step in the right direction. 
This makes no sense.  
Would we be helping single income or other families?  
There are also other inequities in the tax system. 
But we cannot approve of the Reform Party amendment. 
The minister has hidden the true face of public finances. 
He could have done far more for students, for the disabled. 
The problem is that the leeway he refers to is false. 
He does not give us all the possibilities.  
We gave him the right figures. 
He could have done so. 
Let us take, for example, the basic personal exemption in federal income tax.  
The total figure for all taxpayers represents a significant shortfall for Quebec and Canadian families.  
That money would be helpful.  
But there is worse. 
There is a terrible imbalance here. 
This general measure would have beneficial results. 
Bill C-72 does not resolve this issue. 
They will total over $25 billion at the end of this fiscal year.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
His name is Bob McPherson. 
Lo and behold he did not. 
It turns out the government said that he owed money.  
It was about $47. 
It was really sad. 
The hon. member and his party pointed out some of them, and so have we. 
In fact, I intend to soon ask a question on this issue. 
We are still waiting. 
So, there is a lot to do. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
The member raised two issues I wanted to deal with. 
The last point he made was with regard to RESPs. 
This is absolutely incorrect. 
It happens to be outside the tax system. 
The member is absolutely wrong.  
I know this member. 
He is a member of the finance committee. 
The member is absolutely right. 
That was the example I gave, and it is quite a striking one.  
We will take up the debate after question period.  
REQUEST FOR EMERGENCY DEBATE 
This was submitted by the member for Selkirk-Interlake. 
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
CANADIAN WOMEN IN COMMUNICATIONS 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Canada's entire communications industry continues to benefit from their efforts.  
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
Long live the francophone community in Canada.  
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
They will make recommendations for consideration by the Nunavut legislative assembly. 
I am pleased to be a participant in this important event.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
This is a major contradiction. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this government has failed farmers one more time.  
It refuses to listen. 
Now the grain trains have been stopped one more time.  
Farmers are innocent third parties of this labour dispute. 
Many are wondering if the government even cares.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Not so says Reform. 
Canada is horrible it says.  
We are all Canadian members of parliament. 
The hon. member for Beausejour-Petitcodiac.  
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
It is a value fundamental to Canadian unity. 
1999 is the Year of the Francophonie in Canada. 
How are we to take this government seriously?  
Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne-Blainville, BQ):
But that is obviously a pipe dream. 
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
That is what the member for Yellowhead said. 
YEAR OF THE FRANCOPHONIE 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
If he believes that Ottawa has been frenchified, let him stand and be heard.  
That is also why the Reform Party will never form government. 
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
The laws have changed, but the battle has not yet been won. 
Just think of the aboriginals and other visible minorities.  
I call upon the members of this House to reaffirm- 
We will now move on to oral question period. 
The hon. leader of the official opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, Canada's standard of living is falling. 
The government gets richer but Canadians get poorer. 
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
These are all elements which impact heavily on Canada's productivity.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
I wish he would read the speech. 
I wish he would quote a few other parts of it. 
Our inflation rate has been the lowest in more than a generation. 
In 1998, 453,000 jobs were created. 
Canada experienced a bounce back in productivity in 1997. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
I do not need to quote from the industry minister's speech. 
I can quote from the government's own Standing Committee on Finance.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
These are the components of productivity. 
That is where success lies for Canada.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Does the Prime Minister also think he was?  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, of course I was telling the truth in the speech I gave. 
They vote against it. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, now we have seen productivity challenged in the flesh. 
The date of that speech was February 18 and it was using recent statistics. 
The place was the Empire Club in Toronto. 
The topic was Canada's falling standard of living. 
He said that we were poorer than states like Mississippi. 
That is a chunk of change. 
The hon. Minister of Industry.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
That is where we measure the quality of life in this country.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
He is still keeping his eyes shut, however. 
He had the figures before the budget was brought down.  
Why did he not stand up to the Minister of Finance? 
Why did he let him dip into the employment insurance fund? 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
We believe that women and young people will benefit from this system. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
That is what we are trying to do on this side of the House.  
That is what young people expect from good government. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
In the new economy more and more young people are working part time. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We should first look at the reality. 
They were not covered before.  
It is very important. 
I am concerned and we will look into it.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
The government knew that its reform would hit women and young people harder.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we definitely did not implement such measures.  
I say that, on the contrary, young people want help to continue their education. 
We have to ask ourselves that question.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
Is he denying that he actually said that?  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
In fact that is exactly what I said. 
Output per capita would be higher if we produced more. 
That is not complicated.  
That is what I was talking about.  
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
In the end, despise us.  
I find this very regrettable. 
They are our friends only when it suits them.  
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the file holder is bilingual, but the content is in English.  
Behind a nice bilingual facade to impress people, things are done in English.  
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member was there this morning. 
She cannot say that it was conducted in English. 
It was essentially conducted in French.  
Again, they are our friends when it suits them.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
The bureaucrats certainly got the message. 
They came across with $164,000 in grant money for this guy.  
Again, I ask member to be very judicious in their questions. 
The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The project continues to meet its contractual obligations and has created the 19 jobs forecasted.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Who is this guy that government members went to bat for? 
His name is Yvon Duhaime. 
He is a three time convicted criminal. 
It gets worse than that. 
That sounds awfully close to influence peddling.  
The hon. member for Beauharnois-Salaberry.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The transitional jobs fund is a very good program.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We create jobs in regions- 
The hon. member of Roberval.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
That is all he said.  
And we would certainly not go stirring up separatism in Guadeloupe.  
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his very relevant question.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien: -to put more money into certain programs. 
It has enabled the government to balance its budget for the first time.  
Unfortunately, it is the fault of the federal government. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Ms. Beth Phinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, isn't that lovely. 
How will it act? 
We regret it as much as the opposition does. 
The union has the right to strike. 
We have done everything we could to prevent it. 
We have come back to the negotiating table. 
We have enriched our offer.  
At present we are looking at all possible options to deal with this problem.  
CONFLICT OF INTEREST CODE 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister, 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The very strength of that program is the consultation that is very wisely done.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister is no ordinary MP. 
The Prime Minister also sold his hotel to this gentleman.  
I want to know why the Prime Minister's assistant was there. 
Why was the Prime Minister's aide there?  
The Prime Minister has to answer this question. 
He deserves to answer it for the sake of the Canadian people. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Mr. Speaker, Yvon Duhaime is not just a constituent. 
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
Instead they got job losses and uncertainty. 
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the preamble to the gentleman's question is wrong.  
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia, Lib.):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
I had that raised with me by some major purchasers last week.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
What does he have to say now? 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member misunderstands.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health. 
We all know conditions are deplorable in first nation communities.  
Conditions have reached a critical point. 
The community has called on the World Health Organization to intervene. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Speaker, there is a major split within cabinet.  
However, the Minister of Finance stated that it is not a problem.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is no split. 
This is why we eliminated the deficit. 
This is why we lowered taxes. 
This is why we invested in research and development. 
This is why we cleaned up the mess inherited from the Conservative government. 
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
A Reformer accuses francophones of being whiners and of getting preferential treatment.  
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
However, I see that it is reported in Hansard at page 13014. 
Beauchesne's sixth edition, citation 481 states in part: 
-it has been sanctioned by usage that a Member, while speaking, must not: 
(f) make a personal charge against a Member.  
Citation 486(1) reads: 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Yesterday I heard when the word ``disloyal'' was used in the House. 
Members will recall that I immediately intervened.  
No word in itself is unparliamentary. 
It depends on how it is used. 
It depends on the tone. 
I appeal to hon. members. 
All it does is incite us as we go along.  
I ask you time and again to be very judicious in your choice of words. 
I hope this will be the case from here on in. 
I know that things get heated in here. 
I understand this place, as you do. 
There are times when these words go back and forth. 
In this particular case it was regrettable. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
I do not know about the word ``intolerant'' in and of itself. 
However, the member is here. 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not retract my statement.  
God knows, we have enough to be excited about without that.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
All we are dealing with here is a motion from one hon. member. 
It might end earlier. 
That is why I am saying ``earlier''.  
I want to understand that everyone else understands.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
In reply to his question, we are indeed prepared to do this.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
I believe it is Bill S-20.  
Let us see what we have here. 
That is what the motion is.  
That is my understanding.  
Perhaps that is the best way.  
INCOME TAX AMENDMENTS ACT, 1998 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
The official opposition will be opposing this bill on several grounds. 
The power to tax is the power to destroy. 
The bill before us today would complete that increase to $500.  
That is a sensible policy. 
Let me explain what the child care tax deduction- 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Let me apologize first to the hon. member for interrupting his discourse.  
The motion reads as follows: 
Could I ask for clarification from the government House leader. 
You can understand the Chair's reluctance to leave the matter quite so open. 
The understanding is that the motion means that.  
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
The request for consent, quorum calls or dilatory motions.  
We will be on automatic pilot.  
No request for consent will be authorized during the emergency debate. 
Is that what we are to understand?  
That is how a debate under Standing Order 52 works.  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
INCOME TAX AMENDMENTS ACT, 1998 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Let me explain what it is. 
This deduction is absolutely, fundamentally unfair. 
The problem with the bill is that it raises the inequity. 
It increases the unfairness. 
The government's own budget documents demonstrate this quite clearly. 
This is simply inexcusable. 
What does this mean? 
That is very disappointing indeed.  
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
Yes, it simplify things. 
It simplifies things very much, but it means that the tax is not progressive. 
That is called a progressive tax system.  
How fair is it when we move to a tax system like that?  
I thank the member from Etobicoke for his thoughtful questions.  
That was the Liberal solution, not ours.  
They will not pay a dime in provincial income taxes.  
It has the advantage of being both progressive and simple. 
It has the advantage of being family friendly. 
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for that difficult question. 
She said she did not regret it.  
That is something we ought to keep in mind. 
Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau, Lib.):
What is interesting is what happened when the Carter report was released. 
This truly was a revolutionary document on taxation. 
Canadians were not informed of the recommendations made by these economists. 
But this was completely ignored, until now. 
The reform must be done in detail.  
I am giving just a few points. 
We are aware that there are many more. 
That shows that the richest enjoy the greatest benefits. 
Without going into detail, I wanted just to point out a few things. 
We must consider all the components of our national tax system. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
The time for studying is over. 
Those solutions are eminently doable.  
If we had a royal commission we know what would happen. 
The royal commission would drag on for a month of Sundays. 
That is what we tend to do in this place. 
Rather than act we study.  
I know my hon. colleague has a very big interest in this. 
Study after study has shown that Canada is lacking in productivity. 
Canada's competitiveness has been dropping for many years. 
What we need to do is drop our tax rate fairly. 
We need to decrease the rules and regulations that choke the private sector. 
The erosion of our economy does more than hurt the rich. 
The rich can go anywhere they want. 
They do not have the choice. 
The rich have a choice, the poor do not.  
That is what we have to look at and it requires a lot.  
We have had some very qualified people. 
I have come to know individuals like Pierre Fortin from Montreal. 
I do not consider myself an expert, far from it.  
The overall tax system has to be reformed. 
That is what we have to realize. 
Everybody would like to have lower taxes. 
That will not be easy. 
The richest 1% would rather it not be touched.  
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau-Mirabel, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for my hon. colleague and neighbor.  
In 1962, the Carter Commission was set up. 
So the commission was created by the Progressive Conservatives.  
Is what I am now saying correct?  
It is true that the government changed during that time.  
This is a rather interesting story. 
The minutes of this tour are a real mixed bag. 
Everyone came to complain, to say what suited them best. 
There were pressures from everywhere. 
The building industry even threatened to stop working. 
It feared the government might impose recommendations made by the Carter commission.  
In 1980, he made several recommendations. 
There was a very heated debate in the House. 
That is unfortunately how it went.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Once again we have missed the boat. 
Among all G-8 nations we are the bottom of the barrel. 
The government is telling the Canadian public, patting us on the head, ``Smile, be happy. 
Don't worry, we have social programs that will take care of you''. 
That is totally unacceptable. 
Are they happy with the economy? 
Are they happy with their job opportunities? 
Are they happy with the opportunities their children have? 
Most of them are not. 
This is not something that has been happening over the last few weeks. 
This has been happening for years and it is not getting better. 
It is getting worse.  
We are not lacking in solutions. 
He mentioned the problems. 
Members from the Reform Party and other parties have articulated solutions. 
This whole place grinds to a halt. 
Should we be happy with unemployment? 
It is much higher than many of the G-8 countries.  
Our productivity is sliding. 
It is the lowest in the G-8.  
They are in jeopardy because we do not have a healthy economy. 
We cannot have strong social programs unless we have a healthy economy.  
Government members like to talk about research and development. 
They want to provide money for it and we applaud that. 
The brain drain is a complex situation and is linked to many factors. 
The U.S. actually enables that to happen. 
That is something which we in Canada need to take a cold hard look at.  
How can we be competitive?  
They have had to downgrade to paper that is pathetic. 
In British Columbia students are sharing textbooks. 
What kind of message are we sending the youth of today? 
That is what is happening now. 
It is a waste to our economy and the potential of our country. 
It cannot be allowed to happen.  
What do we do? 
Let us talk about how to fix this system. 
There is much we can do. 
One thing we talked about is productivity. 
I have spoken about tax cuts. 
Let us increase the minimum personal exemption. 
There are also innovative ways of looking at tax credits to do that.  
It would be a lot simpler and easier to employ. 
It would save the individual and indeed the economy a lot of money. 
There was an economic collapse within England. 
The jobs had left.  
They saw the collapse of their health institutions. 
Many people suffered needlessly as a result of the high taxes.  
The Nordic countries got smart; a lot smarter then we are. 
They lowered their tax rates and simplified their tax system.  
In the Nordic countries we have seen something similar happening. 
People are now beginning to provide for themselves.  
Cabinet just says ``We are going to do this'' and it is done. 
It does not come to the House.  
Why do we not have equity in the tax system? 
There is no reason that cannot happen.  
There have been medical studies and analyses done around the world. 
The last point is on pensions. 
We do not need more studies, we need action. 
I challenge the government to take up that challenge today and to act now. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will try to be as brief as possible. 
The Reform plan does not include any economic prudence. 
We would go back into deficit. 
What would they cut? 
If we built budgets the way the Reform Party did we would have- 
The hon. member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca.  
Mr. Speaker, the proof in the pudding is looking at the real world. 
We see a province that is the worst place to do business in North America. 
That is not success, that is failure. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I take that to mean Calgary West. 
Calgary is a grand city. 
My seatmate, the hon. member for Crowfoot, had a question. 
Mr. Speaker, that is called robbing the poor to pay the government. 
That is what that is all about. 
How can I and my wife survive on this?''  
That is not a question for me to answer. 
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
It may be good to see where this is all coming from. 
Middle class Canadians do pay a great amount of tax.  
I am sorry to interrupt the member, but his time is up.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question.  
The hon. member mentioned something that is extremely important. 
He is talking about studies. 
We need to study something when we do not know what the answer is. 
We spend millions and millions of dollars on studies. 
As the hon. member mentioned, we do not use them. 
They get tossed on a shelf to collect dust.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
I want to ask a very straightforward question. 
Where is the fairness? 
Mr. Speaker, that is simply not true. 
They would not pay a penny of tax.  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
Prior to becoming a politician the member was a family physician. 
Therefore he most definitely knows what he is talking about. 
That is a pretty nice comment. 
I would say thank you and then go to the next person.  
Mr. Speaker, these are words of wisdom. 
He is absolutely right. 
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
I think they have a very simple answer to a complex question.  
The hon. member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca.  
The best person to provide that is a competent parent. 
It is important to focus the debate somewhat. 
We are now at $2.55 for every $100 earned.  
Who would have believed that this day would come? 
We can once again look to the future with optimism.  
The principal concern of Canadians and Ontarians across the country is health care. 
We are making the largest single investment of the government in health care. 
My riding of Kitchener-Waterloo is well known for innovation and research. 
Our universities are very pleased with the budget. 
Bob Rosehart, president of Wilfrid Laurier University, stated: 
The comments from the University of Waterloo were much the same. 
This year it continues.  
Canadians are working hard to better themselves and improve their prospects. 
This new funding is in addition to the funding granted for health research.  
The government contributes to RESPs.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
They are not happy about that situation. 
In fact, they have hard questions for the member.  
The minister counteracted that today.  
I would like to ask the member a very specific question. 
First, fewer people are unemployed. 
We have one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country. 
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
My hon. colleague just told us that his riding was heaven on earth. 
I would like to ask him a question. 
What would he say to my constituents?  
Yes, Mr. Speaker, too many Canadians are poor. 
Certainly nobody in the House takes any joy in that.  
Child poverty is very much an important concern of the government. 
We will continue to do more.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Students have a problem finding jobs when they get out. 
They face high taxes. 
They have student debt loads. 
He talked about nurses leaving the country. 
I am sure the member opposite would like to applaud that. 
When criticizing things, sometimes we hear mention of a glass of water. 
This glass of water happens to be 75% full. 
The hon. member for St. Albert. 
Is the hon. member going to split his time?  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
I am looking at the budget plan 1999, page 55. 
As soon as the budget is balanced, let the money flow.  
Public debt is paramount in people's minds. 
Canadians know we are in debt. 
It is time the debt was brought down. 
Not one penny change is being proposed. 
These are the things we need to bring out. 
Canadians through extra taxes balanced the budget.  
For 2001 it is projected to rise to $76.2 billion. 
That is almost a $6 billion increase in personal income taxes.  
What is going to happen with the hated GST? 
It is not much wonder the Minister of Finance is awash with cash.  
What else is there? 
Of course there are the public debt charges. 
Or we could double the amount of Canada pension plan payments. 
Or we could cut income taxes by more than $1,000 per Canadian.  
That $40 billion is hanging around our necks. 
What is the Minister of Finance doing? 
He has the money sitting in bank accounts. 
It will be after the millennium before Canadians see the benefit of this. 
We can only speculate what his agenda may be. 
The point is Canadians are paying. 
People need to know that.  
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened to the critique of the member for St. Albert. 
The members opposite seem to be challenged with this very simple concept. 
I do not think the government is looking for reductions in unemployment.  
The Canadian government made a commitment in 1989 to get into accrual accounting. 
It is going to be 2004 before we get there. 
It will have been 15 years before it gets there.  
That is what I learned.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, he is perfectly correct. 
The Minister of Finance is hiding surpluses and could provide more tax relief now. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
It just seems to keep on doing that.  
Of course it will be long gone by then. 
The point is that every day we waste is money wasted too. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Right there there has to be a problem. 
It is about to get lighter. 
First it was life insurance premiums the government went after. 
It lightened our wallets to the tune of $210 million last year. 
That is a lot of lightening. 
That is a lot of lightening.  
Then it went after lifetime capital gains exemptions. 
It did a lot lightening there. 
Just this last year it lightened our wallets again by $340 million. 
That was another $300 million. 
Then there were the deductions with regard to meals. 
It got rid of that. 
It has lightened our wallets by $275 million. 
It took $160 million and killed some jobs in the meantime. 
Then there was the tax on tobacco. 
It cannot forget that one. 
That was another $65 million.  
What about the pensions? 
That was just on foreign pensions. 
It is a tax. 
In this last year it has been $1 billion.  
When we look at these numbers it is ludicrous. 
Add all these things up cumulatively. 
Then look at the bracket creep. 
The Liberals have raised taxes by billions upon billions of dollars. 
I will go on to a few other things these Liberals have been up to. 
They are increasing taxes. 
Liberals know how to do that better than anybody. 
I do not doubt that. 
We ask ourselves what they do with all this money. 
What do they spend it on? 
They discriminate against single income families. 
That is what they do. 
They give money out in corporate welfare, profitable businesses. 
They give out subsidies. 
Then there is the waste. 
All the Liberals across the way got glum. 
If the minister said this was okay, we will not challenge the minister. 
The minister is all intelligent. 
The minister must know what is going on''.  
Shame on the Liberals.  
This is above and beyond. 
I see a couple of blonde heads across the aisle. 
I wonder how they feel about that. 
I see a couple of female MPs opposite. 
I look at the subsidies they give to bad governments. 
What do they do? 
Liberals love giving money overseas. 
What are we doing? 
Shame on the Liberals.  
I look at section 745. 
That is where the money is going.  
That is a crying shame.  
It would be better to burn that money than give it to the Liberals. 
They use it against taxpayers. 
They fund the competition. 
They put in worse legislation that works against people. 
That is what they are doing. 
It would be better if it were buried. 
That is the type of thing we have going on here.  
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I think you would find unanimous consent for the following motion. 
These limitations were no doubt at the time sensible and appropriate. 
There is also a proposed technical amendment to the French name of the corporation. 
Is the House ready for the question?  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, on February 3, 1999, I asked a question to the House. 
It is important that the minister be aware of that. 
That is the way people feel all around the country.  
Surely we do not want the government to treat Canadians that way. 
That is why I raised the question at that time.  
What will the government do about this? 
I asked a question. 
But what answers we do get. 
This is what the minister answered: 
This is not so. 
That is not true. 
Canadians are not pleased to get such answers. 
We must face up to reality. 
I have said so on numerous occasions here in this House.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Sometimes when people are told no, they take it very personally. 
No one is trying to treat anyone like a criminal. 
It is unfortunate if some people are feeling very sensitive and taking it personally.  
In fact it is not women who do not qualify. 
That this House do now adjourn.  
Before being elected to parliament I was a member of the RCMP. 
I had the same wage freeze these union members are currently undergoing. 
I currently own and operate a cattle ranch. 
Grain movement has been halted for the past three days. 
As we know, this did not happen.  
I would like to mention a few of the dollar figures surrounding this strike. 
This is the capability of the port and that represents actual losses.  
What are these sales? 
As of March 18 there were 21 vessels at the Vancouver port. 
One of our customers was quoted in this recent dispute. 
Eleven per cent of Canadian agriculture exports go to Japan.  
The other portion of the grain transportation system that needs some mention is the railways.  
Let me describe that. 
There is grain sitting in the elevators and there is grain sitting on the farms.  
This all has to move in a very time sensitive situation.  
What happens when they arrive? 
Built into these premium contracts are severe penalties for unreliability.  
The government is responsible for the solutions. 
The government is responsible for the negotiations with the labour union. 
It is about public discussion of the facts and public discussion of the solutions. 
It began with the Conservative government. 
That is what we have done in the past two years.  
Again, we reached agreements with 26 of the 29 groups. 
We hope to be able to continue to do that.  
In fact, we did reach an agreement with the union leaders. 
We arrived at an agreement with those who negotiate on behalf of correctional services employees.  
When the government negotiates, it has a basic goal in mind. 
Throughout this process, we have had to compromise. 
Fairness demands regional rates. 
We want to bargain in good faith and sign agreements with our blue collar workers. 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
These people work in the elevators that handle grain exports.  
Therefore, the message was rather clear.  
This is not the position of the Bloc Quebecois. 
We find this excessive. 
It must be a measure of last resort.  
It is not fun for those who are on the picket lines. 
We are talking about economic impacts, which are very difficult to assess. 
We should be careful not to go too far in that regard.  
A strike always causes inconvenience. 
The fate of farmers is of great concern to us. 
Institutions and individuals are paying the price. 
We are not ready to go along with it.  
Contrary to rumour, the federal government is a tough employer. 
We know that it recently rejected a court decision on pay equity. 
Really now, a judgment is a judgment. 
I know some postal workers personally and I know that their conditions are truly precarious.  
The use of replacement workers during a strike is forbidden. 
The Canada Labour Code does not contain any such provision for Canada.  
The federal government will not allow it. 
You are stretching that a little bit.  
I like the remark by my colleague. 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau: -the right to bargain, to have a union. 
It is a company union we regularly get information from. 
Arbitrariness reigns in management. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, it is a good thing that we are having this debate tonight. 
We know what that means. 
It is a code for back to work legislation. 
I listened carefully to what the President of the Treasury Board said. 
I think this is very strong language. 
He may want to disapprove of what the striking workers are doing. 
They are not reprimanded.  
Perhaps we should hear that kind of talk but we do not.  
I do not hear that.  
That idea is completely out of fashion. 
It is a very serious concern. 
I am not trying to downplay that at all.  
It is just regarded as the way things are.  
I do not think we can have it both ways. 
They do not like being without a regular pay cheque. 
They do not enjoy being on the picket line. 
Whatever excitement there is fades very quickly. 
Over here, President of the Treasury Board; earth to the President of the Treasury Board. 
He knows what he has to do to arrive at a settlement. 
I am sure he could apply himself. 
He is no dummy. 
He is no slouch. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
As always, his comments are enlightening and intelligent.  
That blame lies solely on the shoulders of the government.  
Almost one million income tax returns are stuck in the system. 
Another issue is indirect costs to farmers. 
The government has dragged its feet on this issue for over two years. 
I question what the government has done over the past two years. 
He has yet to hear a reply. 
Where can we look to for an example of real leadership? 
The government has a double responsibility here. 
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part in this debate. 
I really believe this is an item that is emergent.  
Nothing could be further from the truth.  
Back to work legislation does not do anything. 
All it does is get the parties back on the job. 
It still does not do anything to settle the labour dispute. 
The labour dispute will still be there. 
It needs a pretty good reason. 
There is a loss of pay. 
My friend from Trois-Rivieres' allegations are absolutely false. 
We do not advocate back to work legislation.  
Why is that so important?  
It is important certainly for farm families. 
It is also important to the Canadian economy. 
They would like to see the unemployment rate near zero.  
This is no way to go about it. 
This is no way to attain those goals. 
Then the other unions will respect their picket lines and not cross them. 
There are granaries full of grain on the farm. 
There are elevators full of grain in the towns. 
This is certainly not a good picture. 
He talked a lot about the history. 
What was missing was talk about the solution. 
We have pretty well covered the problem. 
We know the farmers have the grain in the bins. 
We know they cannot move this grain after breakup starts. 
It is very important that this grain gets to port. 
The people at the ports and the unions know this. 
The government knows this.  
What kind of scale are we talking about here? 
That represents an awful lot of grain. 
It represents a lot of jobs and a lot of transfer payments for this country.  
Stable labour relations are absolutely vital to the country. 
That is very important. 
This is not from the more or less narrow viewpoint of strictly the farm community. 
It is an incentive for them to come to an agreement.  
Labour presents its position and management presents its position. 
The arbitrator takes all of one position or all of the other position. 
It is not a negotiated in between settlement at all. 
It is all of one or all of the other. 
We support the right to strike and the right to organize. 
What is the point? 
It is testament to the fact that this is an emergency situation.  
I certainly do hope that clarifies the situation. 
I really hope my friend from Trois-Rivieres is listening. 
I am sure he is.  
We want a fair and permanent resolution process. 
I do not know why they would do that. 
It is a painful exercise for everybody.  
This is also about individual farmers, about their towns and their families. 
They are already suffering from low commodity prices. 
Indeed it is getting more and more difficult to stay in the farming business.  
I still live in a farming community. 
That is no solution at all.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
I will be splitting my time with my colleague.  
I will use the word ``hostage''. 
I will quote what the minister of agriculture had to say today. 
They knew it before they took these actions.  
This indeed is a serious matter.  
How do we balance this with the collective bargaining process? 
Were there other options available to the Public Service Alliance of Canada? 
There certainly were options.  
I question the leadership. 
I am saying that the actions that were taken by PSAC in Vancouver were unnecessary. 
Those kinds of actions are taking place in my own riding. 
However, that is a slowdown in which income will eventually come. 
It is not a delay in terms of income.  
There have been rotating strikes affecting the movement of grain since January 18. 
The first in the port of Vancouver occurred on January 25. 
The pressure was on by the Public Service Alliance of Canada. 
The grain was moving. 
Livelihoods were not seriously jeopardized. 
They brought their concerns forward.  
One of their big concerns is regional rates of pay. 
I can understand that. 
I speak to the President of the Treasury Board when I say this. 
The issue indeed has to be solved. 
There were other options available. 
Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, Lib.):
Our country is a trading nation. 
This is particularly true of the grain sector. 
We do not want to jeopardize the gains that we have made. 
We recognize the financial implications of lost sales both now and in the long term. 
The impact of this strike will be felt from sea to sea to sea.  
The industry is keen to see this figure grow year after year. 
Our minister also met with several grain and oilseed buyers. 
What we are discussing here tonight is the shipment of food. 
It is food and there is nothing more important.  
However, this is not a local situation. 
Our government is proud to support our producers. 
We are proud to have the support of the other parties here this evening. 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
But we cannot be insensitive to the situation.  
Could it be that his Treasury Board colleague is less sensitive?  
In this regard, the Estey report states, and I quote: 
Back to work legislation should only be a last recourse. 
Have all the other options been exhausted? 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we are back on your favourite topic again, agriculture. 
It is very important to me as well. 
We as Reformers are raising this issue in this emergency debate. 
Farmers on the prairies are hurting already. 
Now they are being hurt terribly by this. 
The government must accept responsibility for allowing this situation to develop time after time. 
We have done this before, deja vu.  
This situation must not continue. 
We have proposed solutions for several years such as final offer arbitration. 
We cannot blame any one party or person for all the problems. 
It did not do this. 
We have done this over and over. 
There is a solution and we are not solving the problem. 
I could hardly believe my ears. 
They have been feeling the impact for a month. 
I made some phone calls in my constituency today. 
My staff in Yorkton contacted various people.  
Here is what is happening today. 
Their elevator is full. 
They cannot move it. 
That is happening already.  
They move most of their grain out of the elevator by truck now. 
However, with the road restrictions coming up very shortly they will not have this option. 
The big trucks will not be able to haul grain on the grid roads. 
This, however, has more than just the implication of a lost work week. 
This grain strike is not just affecting farmers. 
It is affecting transportation and many other people. 
I hope the government is listening and will act immediately. 
There are no ministers here right now- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The government is perfectly aware. 
The strike action is affecting Canada's reputation as a reliable supplier. 
That is a lot of grain, just for the wheat board.  
These things cannot be recovered easily. 
This affects all Canadians and they may not even be aware of it.  
I have some confidential sources. 
I will reveal some of the things they have said regarding this matter. 
The first withdrawal of services commenced at 11 p.m. on Sunday, January 24. 
I remind members that today is March 18. 
On January 24 there was already a withdrawal of services. 
The government had lots of notice about this a month and a half ago. 
These are just some facts. 
There are five vessels at berth and eleven are waiting. 
The 16 vessels represent some 370,000 tonnes of grain that could be shipped. 
It has cancelled all car allocations for the next week. 
CN has 19 trains built and staged in Vancouver that cannot be moved forward. 
Neither railway is lifting cars for Vancouver. 
To date 2,935 rail car unloads have been lost at Vancouver. 
Each week after that 2,750 cars per week will be lost.  
The accumulated lost tonnes at this time equal some 642,150.  
What are the ramifications? 
That is very serious. 
It is not just us or this source saying so. 
Some 50% of productivity was lost during rotating strikes. 
I said I would drop a bombshell and here it is. 
They were given in a letter clear indications of this problem, and they did nothing.  
That was told to the ministers. 
This is all from a letter that was sent on January 27.  
The minister was told this. 
Sixty dollars a tonne is big bucks.  
We may see a couple of million dollars loss on just one vessel. 
One ship means several hundred million dollars. 
The customer would be happy to break the contract that he had made.  
There is obviously something wrong with our negotiating system. 
``We are not part of that system but we pay the price. 
Those are the words of a farmer from Manitoba. 
He goes on to say: ``The shutdown definitely affects our reliability as suppliers. 
We could lose customers forever''.  
We will be losing grain sales and it will affect us greatly.  
We would like to ensure that there is a continuous flow of grain to market. 
This is one of the problems which illustrates that something must be done.  
I am speaking on behalf of the farmers in my area. 
I urge the government to do that immediately.  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
This is very unfortunate. 
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I am delighted to join the debate. 
I will share my time with my colleague, the hon. member for Wentworth-Burlington.  
I wish to discuss the impact of the strike on grain shipment. 
This caused some delays but allowed the loading of ships.  
An increasing number of ships are anchored in Vancouver. 
Farmers are not getting paid for grain that cannot be delivered. 
The cost keeps mounting for every day the system is shut down.  
They have turned down all the offers made to them by the government. 
I urge the PSAC members to reach a settlement soon.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Indeed, we saw in those days some very high wages in the industrial sector.  
This caused a lot of damage in the economy. 
We know some of the examples.  
Ontario Hydro Nuclear is a classic example. 
What should have been a wonderful idea was impractical.  
The previous Tory government ran up a deficit of $42 billion. 
It was ultimately settled. 
The situation was very simple. 
I am entirely in agreement with the President of the Treasury Board. 
We have a responsibility to the taxpayer.  
It was given royal assent just two months ago. 
I spoke, though, in November 1996. 
That is what I said. 
Seventy public service alliance union members.  
Times have very much changed. 
The taxpayer is their employer. 
But we need to take it one step further. 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
I am not happy at all. 
I am very disturbed. 
I am very frustrated because we have seen this cycle over and over again.  
My background is agriculture. 
We have a farm in Alberta. 
I have been farming for over 30 years. 
It has hurt us very severely in the past. 
I first started farming in 1968. 
That was back in the early 1970s. 
It was a co-op. 
There was a strike.  
It is the exact same situation we have today. 
Guess who was on strike? 
It was the official weighers and samplers. 
There were only five at the Alberta Wheat Pool terminal. 
They shut that terminal down.  
It was raining, as it often does in Vancouver in the winter. 
Other unions would not cross that picket line.  
This goes on and on. 
What government was in power at the time? 
Yet it has had a lot of opportunities to do that. 
I have to think not.  
In my riding agriculture is the biggest industry. 
We have oil and gas industries. 
We have a very strong forestry sector. 
The bottom line is that agriculture is there day in and day out. 
It pays the bills. 
There was over $60 million last year in demurrage charges. 
Ye, it is beyond their control to do anything about it.  
We are simply not getting it. 
It is a problem I am very concerned about.  
My role is the critic for the Reform Party for international trade. 
It is frustrating beyond belief. 
We had this problem before us last year. 
The same weighers and samplers were on strike at that time. 
The grain handlers have a union of their own.  
He said: ``I am not so sure. 
We have a two year contract. 
It is not just them. 
We simply have to move to a better system. 
What is the use of trying to get market access? 
The Asian flu was just the last part of that. 
We know commodity prices are off very badly. 
Western Canadian farmers are hurting. 
It gets even worse. 
What does it do with that overproduction? 
It dumps it on the world market at fire sale prices. 
What is this government doing about it? 
What are its priorities? 
The so-called manage position is where the Liberals are. 
They want to ride the fence on everything.  
Where are the Liberals' priorities? 
Where are their priorities these days on solving this strike? 
I do not see them. 
Twenty years from now what will we have from gun registration? 
People will say what a useless exercise.  
What are their other priorities? 
Bill C-55 is on protecting magazine publishers. 
That is a real top priority for the Liberal government, protecting the subsidized protected industries.  
We cannot do anything there. 
I see some movement coming. 
Part of the reason was in what he said. 
There were some real difficulties at the Dorval airport the other day. 
PSAC workers blocked the Dorval airport. 
Some people had to walk a whole kilometre. 
I think we see the writing on the wall. 
We will see back to work legislation but what has that solved? 
We have to move beyond this. 
We cannot afford it.  
However, this has not been for lack of effort on the government's part. 
We have done all the above and yet we are still without a settlement.  
The picket lines are evident to all. 
It is in fact about regional rates of pay. 
This in a nutshell is why we have regional rates of pay.  
For more than 30 years the principle has been clear. 
That is what we do and we are not alone.  
Is there an alternative to regional rates of pay? 
The union argues that there is. 
I believe we have been more than tolerant for the past nine weeks. 
We must look at every possibility to resolve this issue in an expedient manner. 
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
These people have been in a legal strike position for 90 days. 
The crisis is on that side. 
The emergency is in Vancouver. 
Something has to happen.  
This is what the member asked of the international trade minister: 
These are just the short term costs. 
My question is for the Minister for International Trade. 
What plan does this minister have to address these long term costs?  
Speaker, I am not sure I understood the question''.  
It astounds me that these things can continue. 
That is why we have a 65 cent dollar.  
In 1976 it started falling. 
It had climbed to a height of 110 cents to the U.S. dollar. 
How can a country remain stable? 
How can a country be productive? 
We were supposed to become more competitive and more productive. 
We were supposed to keep on surviving. 
It has reached the point today that it is impossible.  
How can we can have a golf game when we only have tees? 
That is the attitude the government takes toward agriculture. 
That is the fact. 
How can we deal and maintain an industry with that type of attitude?  
What else could it be doing? 
Is there nobody here? 
The House should be full, should it not? 
I think the spirits are there. 
We awoke one from the dead. 
Isn't that a friendly disposition.  
Who will pay those wages? 
Businesses have to keep these people on staff because they are under contract. 
It all comes finally out of the farmers' pockets. 
They are killing the industry completely.  
Young farmers today cannot survive. 
Farmers are waiting for the aid promised by the Liberal government. 
For almost a year we warned this government there was a crisis. 
Maybe in June they will get some money. 
He said ``We have worked hard. 
We have been entrepreneurs. 
We have a trucking company that my daughter manages''. 
They run 17 Peterbilt trucks on the highway. 
They have two private fertilizer companies. 
This is a multimillion dollar operation. 
That is a disaster. 
That is not just an emergency. 
That has to change.  
We will probably have a Mexican peso. 
I do not want to see that.  
I do not know how many people remember that combine.  
For some reason I see that semi-truck sitting there and it is not moving. 
It is not doing what it was built for.  
What has gone wrong with that truck? 
It ran out of gas. 
I have seen it sitting for five years. 
It cannot even be dragged out of there.  
I see grass over the wheels. 
There are tires on that big semi but they are all rotten. 
There is no rubber at the bottom. 
It could not roll even if it were pulled. 
I look a little further. 
The rats and the mice are in it. 
They have been using the cushion seat for housing. 
How will we handle it? 
Will we have enough gas masks? 
Will we have enough equipment to remove it? 
The job will have to be done. 
It cannot continue like this. 
It may be comical but there is a lot of truth to it.  
We have one of the greatest countries in the world. 
They let the future generations of this country down. 
Someday they will have to pay for it. 
They will have to give account of what has happened. 
The pay day is coming.  
We will try to bury it and start all over again. 
It has come in every other country where this type of situation has developed. 
I know we will not like it when it comes. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
It is a short term, knee-jerk response to a short term problem. 
When they do this, what happens? 
This means delays of days and probably weeks. 
If this carries on, who knows how long the delays will be?  
They depend on those cheques not as discretionary income but as essential income. 
They depend on those cheques to pay the rent and to buy groceries. 
We cannot allow this to continue unanswered. 
It is not good enough for the grain farmers who are hurting today. 
We stand here as parliamentarians in a position of enormous responsibility and authority. 
It simply is not good enough to let these things happen over and over again. 
I think we are well beyond the stage of farce. 
It is time to stop prevaricating on the part of the government. 
What they need is not looking. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
He had sense enough to recognize that this was an important issue. 
I congratulate him for allowing the emergency debate to take place tonight.  
It is an example. 
Where is the vision in terms of reviewing the issue today? 
We should have smooth and co-operative labour-management relations. 
Do we have them? 
We had a post office strike two years ago. 
It still has not been resolved. 
The Minister of Labour has extended the deadlines for the arbitrator again and again. 
March 31 is the deadline for the arbitrator. 
Will it be extended once more?  
We have had decisions made by the Prime Minister. 
We have had a canoe museum built. 
Have we seen that? 
Let us examine how crises have been resolved? 
Has it resolved the crisis? 
The people are back at work, but what has the result been? 
It has brought about the situation that is existing in Vancouver right now. 
It is affecting all other negotiations. 
These are all little crises. 
That is the word. 
I was going to leave that word until later but it is true. 
I am happy the hon. member is so accurate in his perception. 
He recognizes that all this is leading to incompetent management.  
There is a fourth area in which we have no leadership. 
A good leader anticipates problems. 
It was no secret. 
The hon. member for Yorkton-Melville referred to a letter. 
The problem was laid out in black and white. 
What did they do? 
That is not the only thing. 
Did they know that the contract was coming up with grain weighers? 
Of course they knew. 
Notice had been given a long time ago. 
Of course they knew. 
Did they anticipate what would happen if a strike took place? 
Is that handling the problem? 
Did they anticipate the problem? 
If they did, they certainly did not do anything about it.  
Leadership is lacking on at least those four dimensions. 
Let us look at management. 
Let us look at the way in which the government has managed its scarce resources. 
We have a balanced budget. 
We have managed the expenditures of the government. 
It is the increase in revenue that made the difference.  
Who balanced the budget? 
The Canadian taxpayer balanced the budget. 
That is who balanced the budget. 
The government is spending more money today than it did before. 
That is where the good management is. 
There is a direct intervention into the marketplace, in direct competition with other businesses. 
This is how the government intrudes. 
I will never forget the day. 
It was done at a very low cost to the utilities company. 
All of a sudden this big dictum came down that this was illegal. 
The government had it worked out beautifully. 
What kind of management is this? 
We could get into all kinds of other examples.  
A good manager has good labour-management relations. 
It is a system that is not working very well.  
We have a beautiful example of it right now. 
When it breaks down it hurts everybody. 
Those workers are not going to recover what they are losing right now. 
It is to their own detriment that they get into these situations.  
I wonder sometimes where the logic is. 
I want to ask a couple of questions of the Liberal backbenchers. 
They know what leadership is. 
They know what good management is. 
They know what good labour-management relations are.  
What in the world happened? 
What did they do to their business sense? 
Did they dump it at the door when they walked in here? 
Did they leave it somewhere? 
How can it be?  
We have leaders in this country. 
How can that possibly be? 
How can that be? 
What kind of a leader could not foresee the situation in Vancouver? 
I do not believe he did not foresee it. 
I do not believe the parliamentary secretary did not foresee it. 
They chose not to do anything. 
Is it possible to solve it? 
It can be done in a number of ways. 
That is not a solution. 
Does the government want to do that all again? 
Why can we not do that? 
I am sure we can.  
It is a delusion of grandeur.  
It can be done. 
He did a wonderful job. 
He knew how to work with the people. 
What are we going to do? 
This is no great big, heavy duty secret. 
It does not take a rocket scientist to figure out what the mathematical formula is. 
Why can we not do that? 
All we have to is want to.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am satisfied that the debate has now been concluded. 
I therefore declare the motion carried.  
(The House adjourned at 9.26 p.m.)
