Congratulations to Senate Fund-Raising Team 
The Hon. the Speaker :

The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
It also happens that I know his brother, Orville Barker. 
Be that as it may, I am pleased to recognize the author, Mr. Wayne Ralph.  
State of the Arts in Canada 
Canadians writers are in the news these days. 
In other words, federal support for the arts is paying off. 
We are well on our way to becoming exporters rather than importers of culture. 
Private industry is also getting involved in the promotion of Canadian writing. 
You cannot witness one of these events without being touched.  
About 40 Villeneuve supporters gathered at Verdun city hall. 
You won't get an inch of our country.  
Honourable senators, it is intolerable that such a situation is allowed to persist. 
The Gazette reported that Villeneuve is blaming unity supporters for his actions. 
We have to defend the Quebec people against the militarization of the federal movement. 
I've said, "If you want war, you'll get it."  
Everyone within the province of Quebec should be free to think as they choose. 
However, their method of expression should be controlled. 
I urge the Quebec authorities to act.  
Commission of Inquiry on the Blood System in Canada 
On Tabling of Documents: 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Jacques Hebert , Chairman of the Committee of Selection, presented the following report: 
THURSDAY, November 27, 1997 
The Committee on Selection has the honour to present its 
The Honourable Senators Bosa, Cohen, Cools, DeWare, Ferretti Barth, Jessiman and Pearson 
The Hon. the Speaker :
When shall this report be taken into consideration?

The Standing Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs has the honour to present its 
JOHN B. STEWART Chairman 
The Hon. the Speaker :

Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Herbert O. Sparrow :
The Hon. the Speaker :

Senate Delegation to People's Republic of China 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Legal and Constitutional Affairs 
Notice of Motion to Authorize Committee to Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Tuesday next, December 2, 1997, I will move: 
Notice of Motion to Authorize Committee to Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Tuesday next, December 2, 1997, I will move: 
Hon. Michael A. Meighen :
Bill C-11 has not been without its critics, however. 
It's a scary exercise. 
There is very little time to do the programming we need.  
I seek the advice of all honourable senators on that matter.  
Honourable senators, might I ask a question of Senator Meighen?  
As the honourable senator said, Senator Stewart is a member of our committee. 
Honourable senators, Senator Kirby puts forward an ingenious suggestion. 
I believe that will work. 
Therefore, they cannot deal with the issue next week. 
Senator Stewart is indicating that he will do that.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
CRIMINAL CODE Interpretation Act 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
There are, however, some observations I would like to make.  
The appellant argued that the police violated ss. 
In my view, the police indeed violated ss. 
Justice Sopinka concludes in paragraph 37, and I quote: 
In paragraph 44 of his decision, he wrote: 
Justice Sopinka continues in paragraph 49: 
In my view, then, warrantless arrests in dwelling houses are in general prohibited. 
I would like to discuss certain elements of the bill as such. 
It was often described as an inviolable castle.  
Until now, it has merely been a construct of jurisprudence. 
Fourth, entry into a dwelling-house must be preceded by a judicial authorization. 
Justice Sopinka declared the right to this in a fundamental and significant way. 
The preamble even cites the example of domestic violence. 
Have we had this power since the May 22 judgment? 
This facet of the bill needs to be examined.  
The first one reads as follows: 
It is an important measure. 
This legislation became necessary following the majority - but not unanimous - ruling of the Court. 
I agree in principle with the bill, which deserves an in-depth review. 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, I rise to speak to the second reading debate. 
The motion is granted. 
Bill C-16 is indisputably, incontrovertibly named in the court order. 
It is a part of the court order of the Supreme Court of Canada. 
Honourable senators, I move now to judicial activism. 
This activism is a terrible politicization of Canada's judiciary. 
He has ruled that his role is judicial and not legislative. 
In February 1996, he ruled in the case of Vriend v. Alberta . 
Justice McClung identified judicial activism: 
Justice McClung's judgment addressed varied species of judicial activism. 
About courts ordering legislatures to perform as per the courts' vision, he wrote: 
Justice McClung described crusading judicial activists: 
He wrote that judges must follow the statute: 
Mr. Justice McClung added: 
There should be, in other words a presumption of constitutionality. 
The authority was Her Majesty's command as the fount of justice. 
A state of repose and security and of public order and decorum. 
Public tranquillity and obedience to law.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted to continue?  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Therefore, honourable senators, I move, seconded by the Honourable Senator Sparrow: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
It is, I suppose, what might be called a reasoned amendment. 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Honourable senators, I am not suggesting that at all. 
We can take knowledge, information, counsel, research, whatever from anyone we see fit. 
By the way, the Charter is here to stay. 
Honourable senators, with your indulgence, I agree. 
I do not question the Charter. 
Judicial review is not new to Canada. 
We have known it for a long time. 
That is the issue I quarrel with. 
As far as I am concerned, that was good enough for me. 
There is an intense debate going on in this country. 
The evidence in the Feeney case is objectionable and repugnant to the average Canadian. 
The police were not approaching a private dwelling. 
He was sleeping in an equipment trailer. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I rise on a point of order. 
Rule 18(1) states, in part: 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, obviously we wish to put questions to His Honour. 
I am not sure how we should resolve this matter.  
I wish to augment what Senator Kinsella has said. 
I am not sure how that determination is made.  
It would have been quite satisfactory for the debate to proceed. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
A point of order has been raised. 
Do other honourable senators wish to speak to the point of order?  
I read from the middle of rule 18(1), which states: 
I questioned whether it was within the Rules of the Senate . 
I am not sure whether it is within the Rules of the Senate . 
Under rule 18(1), I am authorized to review the matter. 
I was operating under the instructions in the rule book, rule 18(1).  
There is no need to adjourn the debate. 
I repeat that the Senate is the master of its own rules. 
My suggestion is that we follow the Rules of the Senate .  
Debate adjourned to await Speaker's ruling.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Anti-Personnel Mines Convention Implementation Bill 
I thank you, honourable senators.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.  
The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate that the following communication had been received: 
I have the honour to inform you that The Honourable Peter deC. 
Judith A. LaRocque Secretary to the Governor General 
In addition, the committee did not advertise. 
I found this to be particularly hard to accept. 
Everyone knows that the committee is hearing witnesses, we were told. 
Did everyone know to whom they should be submitting their requests to testify? 
Did everyone know by which date those requests should be submitted? 
The answers to these questions are No, no, and no.  
Everything was done in a rush. 
The administration thought that English-speaking children might contaminate the French school environment. 
Let us first consider the meaning of "we." 
This "we" is a complex one. 
If the vote were unanimous, surely there is a consensus in Quebec. 
That petition was never tabled, and I will tell you why.  
On February 20, they wrote to Pauline Marois's office, asking for a meeting. 
He did not say why he would not meet with them. 
He simply referred them to education critic Francois Ouimet. 
Discouraged and unheard, the coalition then abandoned their battle at the provincial level. 
Many witnesses were refused a spot.  
There was no steering committee.  
It appears that I did not fully succeed in my task.  
I also spoke to two members of the Catholic School Board. 
It was too late, it was law. 
She was to get back to me also but didn't.  
She received intimidating responses and got nowhere. 
I quote from her brief, where she states: 
Many school board associations appeared before the committee. 
They said that they had the support of the parents. 
I honestly do not think they represent the views of parents.  
All of these people are opposed.  
I will leave honourable senators to ponder on the identity of "we." 
I would say that all those who testified are supportive of linguistic school boards. 
These schools would have been in violation of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  
They walked away with nothing. 
They are gently being "discussed" out of their rights.  
...our assembly has never argued in favour of repealing section 93. 
They have expressed their support on many occasions. 
They are getting no such guarantees. 
I want to make that clear.  
If we proceed with the analysis of our sentence, the next section is "it." 
They clarified the situation beautifully. 
Honourable senators, I have before me a crucial document that I am willing to table. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Debate on the Order was suspended, and the Senate adjourned during pleasure.  
The Honourable Peter deC. 
The House of Commons withdrew.  
The Honourable the Deputy Governor General was pleased to retire.  
The sitting of the Senate was resumed.  
Hon. Jean B. Forest :
In Alberta, these guarantees remain intact. 
They are even talking about Mandarin these days.  
Charter schools have also been established in response to the wishes of other parents. 
I recognize that the situation in Quebec is quite different from that in Alberta. 
This would be my hope for all people of Quebec. 
My convictions make it impossible for me to support this amendment.  
On motion of Senator DeWare, for Senator Bolduc, debate adjourned.  
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration 
Fifth Report of Committee Adopted 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Leave having been given to revert to Government Notices of Motions: 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, December 2, 1997, at 2 p.m.
