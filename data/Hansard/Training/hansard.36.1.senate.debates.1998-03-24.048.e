Tuesday, March 24, 1998 
The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
On behalf of the Senate of Canada, I wish you welcome to our Senate.  
Welcome to New Page 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Welcome to the Senate.  
Page Exchange Program with House of Commons 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Eric comes from Edmunston, New Brunswick.  
Hon. Jean-Maurice Simard :
That is where the true enemies of Canadian francophonie are found, nowhere else.  
The Estimates, 1997-98 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
What is the reasonable expectation for the time of adjournment? 
Honourable senators, Senator Kinsella and I have had discussions. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
That study has been repeatedly postponed. 
They think that I will bark but not bite. 
I am now in the mood to become more active on this endeavour.  
Do not allow me to get upset. 
Tell me that something is happening. 
The next item is the structure of committees and the membership of committees.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Canada-Europe Parliamentary Association 
Position of British Columbia on Quebec's Status-Notice of Inquiry 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Prospect of Funding for Clean-Up of Halifax Harbour-Government Position 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
However, I am not aware of any specific action contemplated at the present time.  
I know representations have been made to him. 
Could we have the minister's views on whether he would support that effort?  
It is a problem of which all Nova Scotians are cognizant.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
What is the status of our domestic negotiations with the provinces? 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Mackenzie Valley Resource Management Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
Guarantees to this effect are included in the legislation. 
Finally, I want to commend the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development. 
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Senator Cochrane raised the issue of lack of consultation in the spring of last year. 
We still have had no consultation.  
That seems rather strange. 
Honourable senators, I hope the situation will be somewhat different in the Senate. 
This matter is too important to be dealt with quickly. 
Organized crime grows more sophisticated every day. 
The committee wishes to review this whole question. 
We wish to call witnesses. 
Another main thrust of the bill is to classify our ports. 
Clause 28(1) of Bill C-9 states: 
However, the powers of the ports themselves have been limited. 
Again, by virtue of clause 39: 
Clause 37(5) provides that financial statements are to include: 
Indeed, these are restrictions that cannot be placed upon a natural person. 
Again, we want to look closely at these areas.  
Honourable senators, these restrictions might be viewed as more palatable. 
However, both these avenues for financing are expressly prohibited by the bill. 
Therefore, we argue that these clauses are restrictive.  
Much must be done to make that possible.  
We all know the story of the wharfinger in Lunenburg and Lloyd Crouse. 
Senator Moore has heard the story. 
That was the last century, the last millennium. 
These are things that we should be studying.  
That brings us, of course, to the argument of a level playing field. 
The bill also deals with pilotage. 
Finally, honourable senators, I return to the issue of port police. 
This bill seeks to disband them and, at the same time, proposes no alternative. 
We should tread carefully with any changes in this area at the present time.  
Hon. John G. Bryden :
They are much more than a body of water and one or more wharves. 
Our region is called the Maritimes and Atlantic Canada for good reason:
This is a radical change for my region of the country, honourable senators. 
I recognize that change is not always bad. 
I will highlight a few of my concerns.  
Paragraph ( d ) of that declaration states: 
This was not a new provision. 
Nothing in Bill C-9 would repeal or amend that section. 
Quite simply, we do not know what will happen. 
Honourable senators, I hope I am wrong. 
However, as far as I can determine, no such studies have been produced to date.  
There are other concerns as well. 
Clause 78 states another objective of the bill to be to: 
The article noted that: 
They are too big. 
In that case, however, I believe we must be fair and even-handed. 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is leave granted to allow the Honourable Senator Bryden to continue?  
They always say that.  
They went on to say: 
The overwhelming majority of tanker accidents are caused by human error. 
Honourable senators, with this new marine policy, the competitive pressures will only increase. 
What constraint will there be on shipping companies? 
This is not a question of sentiment or nostalgia. 
Our ports are still a critical part of our economic infrastructure. 
To date, I have seen no positive answers to this question.  
I should like to close by quoting section 5( d ) again: 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Would the honourable senator respond to a couple of questions?  
That port is expected to stand on its own. 
The honourable senator has referred to the ferry service that runs back and forth. 
I do not know the answer to that situation. 
I do not believe they are at the present time.  
I do not know how you would support the Port of Digby. 
Presumably it must be supported by something. 
That may be what is causing the major problem. 
There just is not enough information.  
Honourable senators, Senator Bryden has raised very important concerns. 
It has significant implications.  
The worst example is Prince Edward Island. 
Prince Edward Island will have no port. 
For goodness sake, surely one or two make some degree of sense.  
You pay one shot and you are done. 
On motion of Senator Kinsella, for Senator Angus, debate adjourned.  
Consideration of Final Report of Special Committee-Debate Concluded 
Hon. Jean B. Forest :
The budget clearly addresses many of the issues in the report. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
If no other honourable senator wishes to speak, this order is considered debated.  
Consideration of Second Report of Standing Joint Committee-Order Withdrawn 
Hon. Celine Hervieux-Payette :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Concerns of Albertans-Inquiry-Debate Continued 
We even managed to have a public meeting in Whitehorse. 
The first line of the report reads as follows: 
I am honoured to be in your presence.  
Senator Manning was a true gentleman and statesman. 
Many of us spent years as elected politicians. 
They are guarding their power base.  
Politics is how we do things in the real world. 
Politics is how we do things.  
It is not a new concept, honourable senators. 
Municipal governments have been doing it for years. 
Will an elected Senate cure all our political and constitutional problems? 
Ontario has 124 members of Parliament, including 24 senators. 
The Yukon has two, including one senator. 
I am honoured to be the first senator to represent the Yukon. 
I am pleased that, in 1975, we doubled Yukon's representation in Ottawa.  
Honourable senators, I want to make a point here:
I was fortunate to have an opportunity to serve the Yukon as its first senator. 
I served as Whitehorse councillor and mayor for eight years. 
This whole debate was sparked by the issue of Senator Thompson's attendance. 
I have seen senators at work. 
I know that my colleagues work hard, and we do our work well.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted for the Honourable Senator Lucier to continue?  
We are not always noticed, but we are useful and effective. 
We are a chamber of sober second thought. 
We do improve the legislation sent to us from the other place. 
We are able to provide another method of representing the people in our regions. 
Senator Thompson deserved to be criticized. 
I am glad that he did the right thing and resigned. 
However, we do not all deserve to be tarred with the same brush. 
I am proud to be a senator in this assembly with such distinguished colleagues. 
Some take pride in finding a problem for every solution. 
In that way, true Senate reform will become a reality.  
On motion of Senator Di Nino, debate adjourned.  
Hon. Philippe Deane Gigantes :
We are enriched by it and by the francophones who live in this country.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
If no other senator wishes to speak, this inquiry is considered debated.  
On motion of Senator Murray, debate adjourned.  
Establishment of Special Committee-Motion Modified-Debate Continued 
Hon. William M. Kelly :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Thank you, honourable senators. 
The modifications are relatively minor. 
I move that the motion be amended to read as follows: 
That the Committee present its final report no later than September 29, 1998. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
On motion of Senator Kelly, debate adjourned.  
Motion Proposing an Amendment-Debate Continued 
Hon. Philippe Deane Gigantes :
Honourable senators, there were some terms in what Senator Oliver said which gave me pause. 
It was Latin America to start with.  
They lost their shirts - excuse me, they lost our shirts. 
These are the sophisticated, knowledgeable investors to whom we should entrust such operations.  
What is the state of Africa? 
Africa is crumbling under a burden of foreign debts. 
Many of our banks have problems with these debts. 
Having completed that splendid achievement, they moved to Asia. 
What did they do in Asia? 
Are these sophisticated and knowledgeable investors evil? 
No, but they are dealing with something that we do not understand. 
On motion of Senator Carstairs, debate adjourned.  
Reports on Social and Economic Development 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
However, I will speak more about that on another occasion.  
It is the federal government's responsibility to present the reports. 
Honourable senators, it is to this latter issue that I will speak.  
Take, for example, the International Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
They inform that public consultation is involved in the functioning of the Canadian government. 
The silencing of Joe Public's voice, as we know, is always a concern. 
The reports provide a forum for the government in which to contextualize its decisions. 
I am sure you will agree with many of its findings.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
( a ) the natural resources of Canada are the property of all Canadians; 
Hon. Jean-Maurice Simard :
Honourable senators, may I ask a question of Senator Carstairs? 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Human Rights in Asia 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino rose pursuant to notice of December 10, 1997: 
That was a few years ago. 
Today, the situation is no better. 
Unfortunately, Tibet is not alone. 
However, hope is not enough to bring about change. 
There must be action, backed by consensus. 
Here we run into difficulty. 
This is particularly so in the case of Canada.  
We were in danger of straying from the path we had followed for so long. 
Today, sadly, this has come to pass. 
The promotion of human rights was an integral part of our foreign policy. 
It set us apart from other nations. 
Following the 1993 election, this policy began to change. 
Naturally, and with good reason, the government was criticized for these actions. 
However, the public was not appeased. 
The answer was not long in coming. 
Canada, he said, was far too small and unimportant a nation. 
I need not remind honourable senators that neither of these promises have been kept. 
That should not surprise anyone. 
This government and kept promises are hardly synonymous.  
The present government's foreign policy can be summarized in one word: profit. 
This is not to say that the Prime Minister has been silent. 
If we criticize people, we isolate them. 
There is no middle ground. 
The weaknesses of this argument are easily seen. 
We are not impotent. 
We are not eunuchs. 
We are among the world's most advanced economies. 
We belong to the World Bank, the IMF and the WTO. 
A few years ago, my colleague Senator Ghitter outlined a few of them. 
They bear repeating today. 
We must move beyond the rhetoric and dialogue. 
The present government's foreign policy is based on customers. 
People must be brought back into the equation. 
We cannot turn our backs on this heritage. 
We must not abandon this for profit. 
My hope - and I am not alone - is that they do.  
The key is international pressure. 
We must act with others in a concerted and coordinated fashion. 
This does not mean isolating countries. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I regret to interrupt the honourable senator, but your 15-minute speaking period has expired. 
Are you requesting leave to continue?  
I request leave, yes.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
This does not appear to bother him a wit; however, it should.  
Today, the G-7 rules the roost. 
This will not always be the case. 
This government is thinking tactically, when it should be thinking strategically.  
The present government, to its shame, has abandoned this obligation.  
Somehow China was not included in this list. 
He failed to mention human rights.  
The next day, the United States Senate as a whole approved a similar motion. 
In Canada, nary a word was heard from the government. 
We used to be known as a country that stood for something. 
I am not sure this is true today. 
Commitment has been replaced by dithering and policy by platitudes. 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
However, some of his facts bother me.  
However, on three occasions I have had private audiences with him. 
I know his concerns from a face-to-face meeting with him.  
I cannot comment on the article. 
I have not seen it. 
I do not know if it is correct. 
I certainly hope so. 
Perhaps we can go back and read the article. 
The Senator might be able to then provide clarification.  
Would the honourable senator enlighten the Senate about that situation? 
No reference was made to that at all. 
Is this not happening?  
That has been recently documented.  
Who do I believe? 
In my opinion, the Chinese leadership has made absolutely no attempt in this regard. 
Another example is the rule of law. 
We see the same thing happening in China. 
Senator Di Nino made no reference to that.  
I believe that you are correct in saying that there is a movement toward change. 
We were the first in the world to open the China door. 
The United States followed us. 
They were not the leaders. 
Hon. Philippe Deane Gigantes :
Honourable senators, I wish to ask a question of Senator Di Nino. 
He said that the Canadian government seems to be acting only for profit. 
The simple answer is yes, and I have.  
On motion of Senator Gigantes, debate adjourned.  
Civil Code of Quebec 
Difficulties and Problems Arising from Section 35-Inquiry-Debate Adjourned 
Hon. Jacques Hebert rose pursuant to notice of Tuesday, March 17, 1998: 
I quote section 35: 
Every person has a right to the respect of his reputation and privacy. 
I will not get into the details of this civil case. 
Some senators even knew him personally. 
P.H. mingled with the political elite and prospered. 
Freedom of expression is very much at stake. 
What is to be remembered?  
All the evidence here points to a true act of censorship.  
Mr. Martin, a Maclean's journalist, stated: 
How far can this thing go? 
Can you be charged with an offence for simply asking questions? 
In terms of free speech it is very threatening and quite absurd.  
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
I want to ask Senator Hebert one or two questions. 
Has he looked at the application of the Charter in this matter? 
No, Senator Grafstein, I did not. 
I was counting on you or a jurist of your calibre to do that.  
That is not a responsive answer but I welcome the opportunity to do that. 
I will look into the question.  
On motion of Senator Prud'homme, debate adjourned.  
Vacant Ontario Seat-Inquiry-Debate Adjourned 
Hon. Lowell Murray rose pursuant to notice of March 18, 1998: 
His name was Charles Bishop. 
He had been born in Nova Scotia and graduated from Acadia University. 
Needless to say, he was a Liberal.  
Senator Davies was President of the Kingston Whig Standard . 
Needless to say, he too was a Liberal. 
Prime Minister Diefenbaker finally relented in 1962. 
As if they were in the Senate already. 
It is really rather pathetic.  
It is, rather, because we senators respect tradition. 
Which brings us to the present editor-in-chief of The Globe and Mail . 
Who knows what Mr. Thorsell might have achieved had he stayed at the general store. 
The name of Susan Delacourt springs to mind. 
Fortunately, others come to mind. 
What about other centres of journalistic thought? 
There are, of course, the Sun papers in Toronto, Ottawa and Edmonton. 
Recently he has taken to advocating a freeze on salaries of honourable senators. 
The Senate is no place for people who are pompous and opinionated.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, the honourable senator's time has expired. 
Is leave granted to continue?  
I do not wish to impose on honourable senators, but this is an important subject.  
Finally, there is The Toronto Star. 
Well, they are missing something.  
First, they are missing Richard Gwyn. 
Also a columnist with the Star is Dalton Camp. 
Like Mr. Fisher, he has passed the age of eligibility. 
In other words, he is too old. 
Mr. Honderich has everything going for him. 
Or is it a plank? 
I can never remember. 
He is a liberal whip's dream and he is ready for the Senate.  
Speaking of "thinning out," there is the case of Mr. Mike Duffy to be considered. 
This, however, remains to be confirmed.  
Hon. Philippe Deane Gigantes :
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, I wish to speak on this subject, but not today. 
However, I have a quick question for my honourable colleague.  
The honourable senator has forgotten to mention two people from Toronto. 
First, I wish to know his view on Ms Carol Goar. 
I will speak about her in my speech tomorrow. 
Second, has he forgotten about Barbara Amiel? 
As for Ms Goar, I must confess that I overlooked her. 
If Mr. Honderich is willing to stand down, Ms Goar might be available. 
I encourage my friend to place her qualifications before the Senate at the first opportunity.  
I am confused as to Mr. Black's future. 
Would the honourable senator enlighten me?  
Naturally, I thought about that a great deal. 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Honourable senators, the honourable senator has made reference to his research. 
Has the honourable senator come across that piece of research?  
On motion of Senator Prud'homme, debate adjourned.  
The Senate adjourned until Wednesday, March 25, 1998, at 1:30 p.m.
