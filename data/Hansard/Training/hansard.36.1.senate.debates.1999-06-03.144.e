Thursday, June 3, 1999 
The Senate met at 2 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
They are here at the invitation of Senator Ferretti Barth. 
We welcome them to the Senate.  
North American Free Trade Agreement 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
The numbers speak for themselves. 
Yet there is still more work to be done. 
Fifty-fifth Anniversary of D-day 
Hon. R. James Balfour :
Canada was a full partner in this great enterprise. 
In 1944, the Canadian army overseas was over 270,000 men strong. 
Hon. Rose-Marie Losier-Cool :
The world's population is now up to 5.9 billion. 
On October 12, 1999, the world's population will reach the six billion mark. 
The population is increasing proportionately every year. 
We are also faced with constant aging of the world's population. 
Development of Offshore Resources and the Environment 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Human Rights-Canada's Foreign Policy 
We do not compromise our values. 
However, we seek the progress of the Chinese people in their individual lives. 
Visiting Ottawa today is a team of experts from the National Peoples Congress. 
I met with them this morning. 
They are studying Canada's social policy system. 
Can we detect in that goal a regard for the individual? 
Should we support it? 
Do we do that with other nations?  
Tell us about their spies!  
Fifty-fifth Anniversary of D-day 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
All I wanted to do was to get my feet on dry land."  
the Allies as well as Germany, it will be the longest day."  
Hon. Michael A. Meighen :
I bow to their eloquence and their knowledge of military history.  
I know that this situation is being rectified. 
Sixth Report of the Standing Joint Committee Tabled 
Hon. Celine Hervieux-Payette :
Budget Implementation Bill, 1999 
Thursday, June 3, 1999 
The Standing Senate Committee on National Finance has the honour to present its 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Legal and Constitutional Affairs 
Hon. Wilfred P. Moore :
Abusive and Illegal Tax Collection Tactics- Notice of Inquiry 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
We, the undersigned citizens of Canada, draw the attention of the Senate to the following: 
THAT this action is morally flawed because: 
The pension funds are the deferred income of the employees; 
The morale of public service workers is, again, assaulted and undermined; 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I am not aware of any such move. 
I would be very happy to participate in such an engagement.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
My question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
What are these options? 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I presume he means the Balkans.  
A further request has been made by NATO, as he would understand. 
We have 200 naval personnel aboard the Athabaska . 
We have agreed to deploy 800 more troops to that area. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Awarding of Contract for Replacement of Sea King Helicopters-Request For Information 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Why, for example, has there been no announcement to this effect? 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, such procurement has not been officially approved by the government. 
You have to be kidding. 
There is nothing more important.  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
My question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I can only say that negotiations are continuing. 
Demonstration in Support of Abolition-Government Position 
Honourable senators, my question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
What is the position of the Government of Canada on this rally?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, Senator Roche has quite eloquently responded to his own question. 
Honourable senators, my question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Last month we received yet another warning about taxes. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Everyone in the country recognizes that we have a problem.  
The question still boils down to taxes. 
These two chairmen talk about taxes, full stop.  
He realizes that our current tax regime is driving Canadians out of the country. 
Over three years, that is $15 billion. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The people of Canada created that surplus. 
I could not agree with my honourable friend more. 
Foreign Publisher Advertising Services Agreement-Request for Copy 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
No, honourable senators, I have not.  
Honourable senators, I understand that the signing is just a matter of days. 
As a matter of fact, perhaps it is being signed as we speak.  
Income Tax Amendments Bill, 1998 
Third Reading-Debate Continued 
I do not think so. 
You would take your business elsewhere.  
They are now a major source of revenue for the government. 
If the government were a business, this program would be called a profit centre.  
These premiums come out of the pockets of working Canadians. 
Then, honourable senators, there are the payroll taxes paid by employers. 
Business taxes can only be paid in one of three ways.  
First, they can be reflected in lower profits. 
The days are long gone when only the wealthiest Canadians were shareholders. 
Business taxes are increasingly becoming taxes on retirement savings.  
The Kitchener-Waterloo Record noted in an editorial last December 3 that: 
They thought they were going to run an insurance plan.  
The Toronto Sun noted in an editorial on the same day that: 
He'll have nickel-and-dimed us all to death by then.  
Last December 3, The Toronto Star stated in an editorial: 
The Chretien government made a mistake when it changed the name of Unemployment Insurance.  
Better than nothing, he'll say with a LAFF.  
Honourable senators, a few paragraphs later, the editorial concludes by stating: 
This bill is simply not good enough.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
We must face up to that indebtedness. 
A number of the measures in the budget address problems of accessibility. 
There remains grave concern in the university and college community across Canada. 
We must find creative solutions to this problem. 
That is but one idea that might attract the interest of the government. 
We need creative solutions to deal with the problem of indebtedness.  
Increases in tuition fees have been mammoth. 
These loans are not risk-free. 
That does not make sense. 
That does not make much sense. 
There has been very little creativity, and that is the challenge. 
It is a programmatic right.  
Hon. P. Derek Lewis (Acting Speaker) :
No, I will stop.  
On motion of Senator Kinsella, for Senator Meighen, debate adjourned.  
Public Sector Pension Investment Board Bill 
No direct extra contributions were ever made, we are told.  
Indeed, it could create a surplus any time it wants by reducing benefits.  
Economic conditions are always varying. 
Interest rates are up, and then they are down. 
Inflation is up, and then it is down. 
The stock market is up, and then it is down. 
There is a double standard.  
This action is morally flawed because: 
The pension funds are the deferred income of employees; 
The morale of public sector workers is, again, assaulted and undermined.  
Many of these issues stem from the process leading up to this bill.  
We didn't walk from that table to avoid the heat. 
This bill is unprecedented. 
Now how does that look to the members of the RCMP? 
This is not a rant against anything. 
This bill will not help. 
It will just extend the present problems and create further and greater ones.  
I hope this is the last time.  
Senator Stratton and I are sharing the obligations on this bill. 
There is nothing good in it?  
I could not find anything good in this bill. 
The unions and the retirees want to be represented on the board. 
We have heard this before concerning the CPP plan.  
What kind of an attitude is that on the part of the government? 
Is it any wonder that morale is so low?  
What of the RCMP and the military? 
What rules should apply to a board that is not jointly managed? 
What should be the qualifications of its directors? 
What is an appropriate level of transparency? 
Have we not heard all these questions before?  
I do not think so. 
Honourable senators, we all qualify.  
That is in another part of the bill. 
The headquarters must be in Ottawa. 
They will have a tremendous impact on the financial markets in this country.  
Provincial bonds usually have greater returns.  
We are told that the board is to maximize returns without undue risk. 
Can someone opposite tell us what constitutes "undue risk"?  
Derivatives are fairly complicated. 
Should that not be the subject of parliamentary scrutiny?  
The RCMP has tremendous investment concerns in this bill. 
He ought to be, but the government has decided that he will not be. 
We must remember how we select the board of directors. 
"Hello, Mabel; Hello, Terry." 
Why are you naming people from our side?  
In a public company, the shareholders appoint the auditor. 
That is not so here and not under the CPP plan.  
The minister representing the Crown could appoint the auditor. 
At least the minister is representing the shareholders. 
Therefore, the users of the money have no responsibility whatsoever.  
The shareholders seem to have no responsibility. 
If they do not like what he says, they can fire him.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable senator, I regret to inform you that your time has expired. 
Are you requesting leave to continue?  
I would request leave to continue, honourable senators.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable senators, is it agreed that Senator Tkachuk be granted leave to continue?  
It is also irresponsible. 
As parliamentarians, we should not let that happen.  
This bill is cloaked in secrecy. 
There is no access to information. 
They hire their own board, they hire their own auditor. 
There is no responsibility to anyone. 
The organization does not even have responsibility to Parliament.  
There is no way to examine administrative fees. 
The government used to pick up the cost of administration.  
At present, the pension plan has $130 billion in it. 
The government is just taking the surplus. 
That is a great deal of cash. 
The government will bill that amount back. 
There is no control on the administrative fees charged. 
There is no control of the auditor. 
I know that will not happen.  
Honourable senators, I have outlined several matters that should be reviewed by the committee. 
These are important matters. 
People should be on strike over these matters.  
While they talk about us, the government is abolishing the powers of the other place.  
Therefore, I ask senators to examine this bill carefully. 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Canada Travelling Exhibition Indemnification Bill 
Hon. Jean-Claude Rivest :
This bill is a small example among many. 
Today, what are our good Liberal friends doing? 
Once again, we must be patient and continue to push our Liberal friends. 
Canadians, however, are not fools. 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to, and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Order Stands 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I move that this order stand in the name of Senator LeBreton.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Bank Act Winding-up and Restructuring Act 
Bill to Amend-Second Reading 
Hon. Celine Hervieux-Payette :
This is an important change; I would even call it necessary. 
Furthermore, the loan branch will not be able to borrow from other financial institutions.  
Another amendment has to do with the borrowing options of lending branches. 
The mechanisms of the agreement will be negotiated to the satisfaction of both parties. 
I therefore encourage honourable senators to support this bill.  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
That is the principle of the bill before us, and I accept that principle.  
Competition is the goal of the deregulation process. 
The committee, after studying the issue, came forward with a recommendation dealing with foreign banks. 
The Senate Banking Committee held comprehensive hearings across Canada. 
Paragraph 86 of the committee report bears repeating here. 
However, even then, the government could not get it right. 
These tax changes are helpful. 
Why did we not have those changes in bill form before today?  
The bill provides for two types of branches. 
Full-service branches will be able to join the Canadian Payments Association.  
These will be in the business of making loans in Canada. 
They will not be able to join the Canadian Payments Association. 
Why discourage a foreign bank from doing both? 
Why put these restrictions on the corporate structure of foreign banks within Canada?  
We will study this bill in committee. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Foreign Publishers Advertising Services Bill 
The Hon. the Speaker :
However, it was impossible for me to make my ruling yesterday. 
I am prepared to proceed now. 
For his part, Senator Murray was not persuaded. 
He asserted flatly that, and I quote: 
I shall deal with the second aspect of the point of order first. 
Senator Kinsella indicated that he regarded these two elements as interlocking, as a package. 
In his judgment, there is none to be found. 
This is certainly a critical point.  
That is the responsibility of the other place.  
The amendments are not out of order based on this second objection.  
It is his position that the amendments go against the principle of the bill. 
The committee, in making its recommendations to amend the bill, was operating properly.  
In Canada, however, the long title of bills is rarely as descriptive. 
More often, the title simply suggests its subject-matter. 
That appears to be the case with Bill C-55. 
The real question is whether they are destructive of its principle. 
Do they have the effect of reversing this principle? 
Indeed, the principle of the bill can be difficult to identify precisely. 
Whether these are desirable objectives is not for me to decide. 
It does not appear to me that they do this.  
It is my ruling that the amendments are in order. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
The motion was moved by Senator Carstairs. 
Therefore, I assume that Senator Carstairs will lead off the debate. 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I defer to the Honourable Senator Poulin.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
That was my recollection of the event.  
Honourable senators, I said that I did not wish to get into an argument. 
We are not proceeding to second reading now, we are proceeding to the report.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I think we should have clarification on that point, for the record. 
It was also on the Order Paper. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I will be very pleased to do so. 
I will go back and check again. 
However, I shall be happy to check that again.  
Honourable senators, are we prepared to hear now from the Honourable Senator Poulin?  
To finish that, His Honour the Speaker said yesterday: 
Honourable senators, I have not received the ruling as yet....  
There is, however, a bit of business that we might complete. 
The motion was not moved yesterday.  
His Honour thus indicated that he preferred to have a motion before the chamber. 
The committee made four amendments to Bill C-55. 
The second change is a new clause in the bill. 
This third amendment incorporates a de minimis exemption clause in the bill. 
Only those offering a clear advantage to Canada will be accepted. 
These amendments make the bill more acceptable. 
I thank the honourable senator for his generous courteousness.  
The reality here is plain enough.  
First, new technology is transforming our world into the "global village."  
Second, we have no cultural exemptions before the World Trade Organization. 
We ought to be proud of this accomplishment.  
This is not political rhetoric, honourable senators. 
The Washington Post had this to say: 
That, honourable senators, is not a symbolic recognition. 
Would the honourable senator take a couple of questions for clarification?  
I thank the honourable senator for his question.  
I must rely on my memory. 
I would not wish to comment on the agreement itself. 
I believe that was the responsibility of the minister herself.  
There are certain lacunae in the testimony. 
I return to the same answer that I gave earlier. 
We fully accepted the testimony of the two ministers on these matters. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I must point out that the 15-minute period for speech and questions has expired.  
Honourable senators, it is not for me to request an extension. 
On motion of Senator Kinsella, debate adjourned.  
Notice of Motion for Time Allocation 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I give notice that tomorrow, Friday, June 4, 1999, I will move: 
At that time, I neglected to mention an important part of that notice.  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
Of course, consideration of the issue comes in a multitude of degrees, shades, and colour.  
This debate over life and death is not new. 
In addition, they asked that physicians not be permitted to violate this right.  
We are allowing our prejudices to come into play. 
We have been stalled at the crossroads. 
I only ask for an opportunity to exercise my legislative duties.  
I do trust, however, that she will not lose patience with the process. 
There are no quick fixes to these important fundamental issues. 
That goes to the very heart of what this institution is all about.  
We will not be distracted by jokers.  
On motion of Senator Carstairs, debate adjourned.  
Privileges, Standing Rules and Orders 
Consideration of Ninth Report of Committee-Order Stands 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
We would like to know what is going on. 
The ninth report was accepted in committee. 
It has been amended, to our chagrin and regret. 
I would like to know if there will ever be a debate. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I thank the senator for his inquiry. 
It is not my intention to speak on this item today. 
May I ask for direction from the Chair?  
Do I understand the process correctly?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
State of Financial System 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I shall be brief on this item. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, this matter will remain standing in the name of the Honourable Senator Meighen.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
We must clarify that it will revert to No. 1 .  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
This allows those who do not wish to consume caffeine to avoid it.  
To date, the extension of the use of caffeine has not been approved. 
Honourable senators, the public health of Canadians must be a first priority. 
I urge honourable senators to support this motion.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Vivienne Poy rose pursuant to notice of May 31, 1999: 
That she will call the attention of the Senate to the Dragon Boat Festival.  
The boats were decorated with dragon heads at the bows.  
This year, the Dragon Boat Festival falls on June 18 in the Gregorian calendar. 
In Toronto, the dragon boat races are now in their eleventh year. 
Last year, the races drew over 100,000 people. 
On motion of Senator Prud'homme, debate adjourned.  
Leave having been given to revert to Government Notices of Motions: 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
We will not push further. 
I do not wish to speak for the other independent senators.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
The Senate adjourned until Monday, June 7, 1999 at 4 p.m.
