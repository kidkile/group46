Wednesday, March 17, 1999 
The Senate met at 1:30 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Crisis in Horn of Africa 
I was told 40,000 people have died there in the last two weeks.  
This is a human tragedy on a scale that is almost impossible to imagine. 
He was a pioneer.  
He acted in plays and in English in Canada and abroad. 
He published a number of plays. 
His reputation had long extended beyond Canada's borders.  
I listened yesterday to Radio-Canada's tribute to him. 
We have lost a remarkable artist.  
Reminiscence of the Irish in Canada 
Honourable senators may well wonder what I am talking about. 
Meagher, speaking for all, said: 
My lord, this is our first offence, but not our last. 
You see, even great Irishmen contributed to agriculture at that time. 
I think Senator Kelleher would even agree to that.  
Life is too short for long faces. 
When you are happy, sing. 
When you are sad, sing louder. 
Expect magic to happen, and it will. 
If you cannot find a rainbow, paint your own. 
The word "impossible" is not an Irish word. 
Never walk so tall that you cannot see the wee people. 
If you are feeling blue, wear lots of green and think hopeful thoughts. 
Quit trying to catch a leprechaun and just be one.  
I am happy-go-lucky, and a Saint Patrick's Irishman. 
I forget what I was going to say.  
I wanted to mention, honourable senators, why I wear this chapeau vert. 
I asked what it stood for. 
I added "Irish and money."  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Only history will prove whether I am right. 
My opinion today is still unchanged. 
It seemed reasonable to me to believe that the common language of Quebec was French. 
I added that this did not mean there was only French.  
Today I see in the press that I was mentioned. 
It was said that I was a Liberal senator in attendance at the funeral. 
Nuclear Weapons and Year 2000 Problems 
The computer bugs could set off nuclear system test patterns that are difficult to halt. 
At that point, erroneous information could lead to an extremely dangerous situation. 
A false signal could set off a retaliatory nuclear missile launch.  
The scale of the task is enormous. 
Russia's situation is more difficult to assess. 
These recommendations are consistent with public opinion.  
Canada has a strong position as a peace-loving nation. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Bill to Amend-Report of Committee 
Wednesday, March 17, 1999 
The Standing Senate Committee on Transport and Communications has the honour to present its 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Appropriation Bill No.1, 1999-2000 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Thursday, March 18, 1999, I will move: 
Hon. Raymond J. Perrault :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the government's position remains unchanged. 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
On that basis, Canada has entered into a constructive dialogue. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government in the Senate) :
The Government of Canada will continue the dialogue that is necessary with China. 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
I wish, in particular, to discuss one of these items. 
That is called "constructive engagement."  
I feel that this is very important. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable Senator Di Nino, the question please?  
Is the answer yes or no?  
Do you wish to give me the answer?  
You had better be pretty quick on this one.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
We will deal with that at some other time.  
One at a time.  
I am surprised Honourable Senator Di Nino was not more specific. 
Honourable senators, of course they are, because they are selling China to us. 
I should like to congratulate the honourable senator for skating so well on thin ice.  
Let me go further. 
What is the figure for the Philippines?  
Those are the facts. 
I say this is fair. 
We want to create jobs in the Philippines. 
The minister should admit that.  
This is not being done with the taxpayers' money. 
These countries are investing in Canada. 
That is very important for the world.  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Hon. John B. Stewart :
Honourable senators, I did not hear the date for the projected visit. 
I must follow the honourable senator in being discreet. 
I am sure there would be significant interest from members of both houses.  
I agree that such a meeting would have support from members on both sides. 
Since then, many Catholic bishops have come out strongly against this ruling. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I have also raised the honourable senator's question with my cabinet colleagues. 
Application of Allocation for Air Forces in Budget-Government Position 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
What is it ear-marked for? 
Why is it not allocated to a specific program? 
Will it be used to upgrade the F-18s? 
What will happen to that $337 million?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The Sea King in question was repaired within a few hours. 
The air force follows a very strict maintenance and inspection regime. 
Honourable senators, I will not comment on that statement at all, because it is absurd. 
It is not minor. 
I cannot permit that.  
With respect, honourable senators, I do not believe I used the word "common."  
I withdraw the word "common." 
If we subtract one number from the other, the actual difference is $337 million. 
What will that money be used for?  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Less than 100 out of 3,200 people in the senior levels are visible minorities.  
This does not inspire confidence throughout Canada.  
Can the leader tell us what the government is doing to correct this injustice?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, the government leader spoke of the situation in the Senate. 
Does the government leader think this is adequate? 
Does he think it is fair and just? 
If his answer is "no," what will he do about it? 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I would not be satisfied, nor should any of us be satisfied.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Or about my speech.  
What is the policy of that ministry?  
I shall take that question to Revenue Canada officials.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I will do that. 
It was the one they wrote.  
Honourable senators, that is possible. 
I will need to ask that question also.  
Hon. P. Derek Lewis :
Honourable senators, my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
In Newfoundland, we have a tremendous problem with seals. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
However, there is a proposed regulation with regard to snow geese. 
The story is factual in that sense. 
Delayed Answer to Oral Question 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Estimates, 1998-99 
Report of National Finance Committee on Supplementary Estimates (C) Adopted 
The Y2K work is about 84 per cent complete. 
Salaries had been frozen for six years, which necessitated adjustments thereto. 
That was of concern in this current fiscal year. 
That is a figure of which we should all be aware. 
Hopefully, we can tighten things up in the next fiscal year.  
That was very considerate.  
I look forward eagerly to his answer.  
Honourable senators, I was a member of the public service from 1970 to 1974. 
These are all issues of incredible importance to the well-being of this country. 
Today, it is certainly well behind those pay scales.  
The degree of those efforts can bedebated, but not their objective 
The reward must be compensable.  
However, their words are few, and the direction of their views requires explanation. 
Honourable senators, that was a very eloquent speech, in the form of a question. 
I agree completely with the honourable senator's statements. 
Almost everything mentioned by the honourable senator is in our report. 
Some 90 per cent of senior level executives are eligible for retirement in 2005. 
When we see numbers such as those, it is rather disturbing.  
There are magic formulas which govern retirement. 
As a result, the youngsters come to the civil service and they work.  
Unfortunately, once they gain experience, they tend to leave, and they leave for two reasons:
We have no one to blame but ourselves. 
As a result of very little hiring, the civil service is quite mature. 
The average age now is, I believe, 46. 
That is a significant problem. 
We cannot just ignore the problem. 
We must rebuild faith.  
Honourable senators, I have gone on too long.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Yes, the honourable senator's time has expired.  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
The Estimates 1998-99 
Report of National Finance Committee on Main Estimates Adopted 
I am from the Red River Valley in Manitoba. 
We react superbly, as a matter of fact, but we do not prepare well.  
had to be early buyouts. 
However, that program cost the government $4 billion. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Statement of Minister of Finance-Inquiry-Debate Continued 
The story was entitled "Future Shock:
He manufactures laser cartridges. 
How many jobs will be created? 
We argue about these issues.  
Savings are at an all-time low. 
We see today an exodus of these people. 
They are the ones who will produce the future wealth of the country.  
I am sure that today the number is much higher. 
More and more Canadians are questioning the value they receive. 
We as parliamentarians must listen to these people.  
This report brags that the government will hire 1,000 more auditors. 
In Canada we tax people, organizations and commodities. 
This is not a very complicated supposition.  
The proof is in progressive taxation. 
In other words, we confiscate it. 
However, that is not what we do. 
This attack on our pocketbooks is an attack on our freedoms. 
At least, we call ourselves a mature country. 
Individuals do not pay; governments pay.  
Our democracy, it seems, only gives people a right to vote. 
It does not guarantee our freedoms. 
According to Statistics Canada, the average Canadian family earns $57,665 a year. 
It pays $28,773 in various taxes. 
These are middle class Canadians, not wealthy Canadians. 
That is the truth. 
How did this happen? 
We are always hearing that. 
Let us look at the only two federal examples. 
Today, we are decrying the fact that soon those funds will run out. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Are you requesting leave?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. John B. Stewart :
I will adjourn the debate, then, and take it up tomorrow.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
It is perfectly proper for you to adjourn the debate if you wish, Senator Tkachuk.  
If that is the case, then I will do that.  
On motion of Senator Tkachuk, debate adjourned.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
We will then be required to go through the Order Paper.  
Security Incident at Vancouver APEC Conference 
Motion to Establish Special Committee-Debate Adjourned 
That the committee have the power to sit during sittings and adjournments of the Senate; 
On motion of Senator Kinsella, debate adjourned.  
Review of Nuclear Weapons Policies 
Notice of Motion-Debate Adjourned 
Hon. Douglas Roche , pursuant to notice of March 16, 1999, moved: 
I said very clearly that I wished to debate this matter today. 
I was not informed that the Senate would be adjourning at this hour.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Senate always adjourns at this hour on Wednesdays.  
It happens very often.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
That being the case, I will adjourn the debate.  
That has been the tradition for some years.  
On motion of Senator Roche, debate adjourned.  
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
