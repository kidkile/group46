The House met at 11 a.m. 
REFORM OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Before 1945, we had World War II. 
However, we confuse peacemaking with conflict prevention. 
Slobodan Milosevic came to power and fomented violence against people. 
The international community's response has appropriately been to engage in diplomacy.  
These conflicts did not appear overnight. 
Bosnia has been around for a long time. 
Kosovo has been around for 10 years. 
Many situations have been brewing for a long time. 
There are things we can do. 
We need to look at the precursors to conflict. 
We can see a polarization taking place before anything else happens. 
One group of leaders will start to remove the human rights of others. 
It will start abusing and ostracizing groups. 
It will polarize groups and try to get its own people onside.  
We can see that happening. 
It is very obvious.  
The security council needs to be reformed. 
The UN needs to be overhauled in terms of its diplomatic initiatives. 
It needs to focus on what it needs to do. 
It cannot do everything and be everything to all people. 
Right now dozens of organizations are doing the same thing. 
The actions which the UN can take are many. 
We need to do this. 
We need to use diplomacy to bring groups together. 
I would submit that is what we are engaging in today in Kosovo.  
I would like to consider international financial institutions. 
The World Bank and the IMF are two parts of a triumvirate. 
They have existed and operated in isolation. 
They need to co-ordinate their actions.  
Where does the money come from? 
We cannot tolerate that. 
These people cannot be allowed to do that. 
We need to hold their feet to the fire. 
There are things we could do. 
He is a multibillionaire. 
That should never be allowed to happen.  
Money can be channelled through non-governmental organizations. 
These countries are developing nations, generally speaking. 
Rather than the situation getting better, it is getting worse. 
I firmly believe we can do this. 
We can take this common plan of action to these international organizations. 
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
World finances have a great bearing on conflicts which erupt in various countries. 
It is not the only reason, and we certainly acknowledge that. 
However, the monetary system in our world is very important. 
I want to zero in on that one very important area.  
Canada is committed to strengthening the international financial system and the world economy. 
We started this at the G-7 summit in Halifax in 1995.  
Much has already been accomplished in these areas.  
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
The motion reads as follows: 
Let us have a closer look together at the motion.  
First it says, and I quote: 
This is clearly undemocratic and paternalistic. 
Therefore, why exclude poor countries from this reform? 
They are the primary beneficiaries of the assistance provided by these organizations. 
This only makes sense.  
We have a lot to learn from them. 
But the Reform Party is advocating unilateral action by industrialized countries. 
The Bloc Quebecois is opposed to this way of doing things.  
Believe me, there are lots of weeds in that back yard.  
Every day, 34,000 children die from malnutrition and disease.  
It has now dropped from fifth to eleventh.  
Yet all this does is to just barely allow it to keep up. 
At page 14 of the executive summary, it states: 
The Reform Party supported this statement, because it supported this report. 
So, what is behind this sudden change in direction? 
Could we say improvisation?  
That said, nothing is perfect. 
The world balance is precarious enough at the moment. 
Globalization is not only economic, but social and human as well.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
It is a timely debate. 
Finally I will say a word on the United Nations. 
A lot of things need to be looked at.  
I will repeat what I said the other night. 
It does not pay its dues. 
There is a lot to be further debated. 
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
I agree and I think the member would too. 
My Reform Party colleague gave the example of land mines. 
This example can cut both ways. 
The debate must therefore be extended to take in all countries belonging to an organization. 
This debate should perhaps first be held here in Canada.  
Here again we do not know exactly what this is all about. 
What efforts has the Government of Canada made? 
We still do not know.  
The UN has been replaced by the flag of war, a war under NATO. 
International organizations are changing, and NATO is the prime example. 
Is this grounds for criticism? 
There is a shift going on within the international bodies. 
That is very important. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
ALLOTTED DAY-THE BALKANS 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ) moved: 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent to proceed in this fashion?  
We are not the only ones asking that members of parliament vote on this issue. 
Many editorials in the country's major dailies are asking for the same thing.  
There is something strange and disquieting about this whole business. 
From the beginning, the government seems to have been swept along by events. 
It seems to be making it up as it goes along. 
This seems rather inappropriate in a democratic society and a parliamentary democracy.  
The problem we all face is why the Prime Minister- 
He was referring to Prime Minister Mulroney.  
Should Canadian troops participate in a war- 
This House must hold a debate on this issue. 
Members, the elected representatives of the people, must have their say. 
We do not take polls, we were elected to represent the people.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
These two things go hand in hand.  
A vote will also be held by the two houses of the Czech republic. 
They too are consistent. 
This is what must be done. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Today's newspapers are reporting that Kosovo is becoming empty. 
We must say publicly that we have an obligation to prevent a genocide. 
This is an important precedent. 
The government should follow the lead of other parliaments. 
Hungarian and Czech parliamentarians also had an opportunity to vote on this issue. 
There are now hundreds of thousands of them. 
The government must act in a more transparent way. 
It must share information. 
They must not escape punishment.  
I conclude by putting forward an amendment. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The amendment to the motion is in order.  
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
I would now like to ask the member a question. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question. 
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Our preference has always been for a diplomatic solution to the problem of Kosovo. 
Diplomacy was given every chance to succeed. 
Numerous diplomatic missions were sent to Belgrade. 
The OSCE created a major verification mission. 
Finally the Rambouillet conference ultimately failed because of the consistent intransigence displayed by President Milosevic.  
Over one-third of the population of Kosovo has left the country. 
This all happened before NATO began its military intervention. 
Milosevic knows perfectly well what the conditions are for this to happen. 
I am not able to support the motion. 
Therefore the question remains hypothetical. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
That is the only argument I heard.  
Madam Speaker, I also listened very carefully to my hon. friend's argument.  
Historically, Canada has not voted on issues of this gravity. 
The debate did not occur at the outset of the hostilities. 
Certainly that flexibility has to be maintained all the way across the broad base.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
What is really wrong with that?  
I appreciate the hon. member's position. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, the motion before the House today is relatively straightforward. 
There is really nothing odd about such a request. 
It is consistent with the best democratic traditions this country can lay claim to.  
The decision was made in London. 
They are calling this war.  
Should we have Canadians involved in war, yes or no?''  
The foreign affairs minister is no more consistent. 
I will not try to offer any answers to those questions. 
It is, after all, what this country expects. 
This chamber is the House of Commons. 
Here the laws are made. 
It is the only right thing we can possibly do. 
This government does not seem to want to understand these simple facts. 
The Prime Minister and foreign affairs minister understood this in 1991. 
I am at a loss to explain why they have forgotten that fact in 1999. 
The motion before us is several weeks overdue. 
There is a saying that there is a time and a place for everything. 
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I heard the hon. member say that he strongly endorses this motion.  
The minister appeared before the committee in March. 
I thought that parliament had a strong attack of me-tooism in the entire debate. 
There was very little dissent from the position the government had taken.  
Madam Speaker, it is certainly not a matter of confidence. 
I think that would be the case.  
But put it to a vote. 
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
They then condemned the government for putting it to a vote so late.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
When this happens, a great many of the victims are found among the civilian population. 
But do we understand the cost of failing to intervene?  
Algeria, Sierra Leone, Rwanda. 
While our attention is turned elsewhere, some of these crises continue to rage. 
The motion cuts to the heart of why I entered politics.  
They were very cynical about the political process. 
The right to vote is a very important. 
Today, in this particular situation, we need information. 
In order to assess this situation, it is important to have the proper information. 
We know that information is one of the first casualties of war. 
This creates difficulties in assessing the situation and making decisions. 
We need to become as fully informed as possible.  
It is a very serious situation. 
We recognize cabinet government is important. 
Flexibility to act was mentioned earlier. 
We should know what is involved. 
Another concern I have is with reservists. 
What would they be facing when they returned home? 
As members can see, I strongly support the motion that has been put forward. 
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Are we voting on whether we have the right to vote? 
Are we voting on a hypothetical situation? 
I would be interested in the hon. member's interpretation of what this motion means? 
I would have encouraged the drafters to be far more precise in their motion.  
Madam Speaker, I understand the hon. member's concern. 
People obviously do not want to deal with hypothetical situations. 
We are simply saying that as parliamentarians we want to be able to decide. 
That is the essence of the motion. 
Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):
That is very important.  
Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Quebec East, BQ):
I would like to ask him a question regarding the vote.  
Madam Speaker, there is barbaric behaviour on all sides of this conflict. 
There is barbarism on all sides.  
I would have to know what the details would be with respect to ground forces. 
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
We are, of course, going to support the Bloc motion, but not the amendment. 
Yet this must be discussed, debated and indeed voted on. 
There has been reference in recent weeks to the gulf war. 
But first I have two comments to make.  
That was not, however, what we had asked for. 
Perhaps it was a bit better than nothing, but we did not get any information. 
We have been promised one this week. 
In the meantime, we have tripled our military presence, maybe even more than that. 
This is what we are being told here. 
On the same day, the UN security council passed its first resolution. 
It is there to serve the international community. 
The first resolution urged Iraq to get out of Kuwait.  
I am doing my best to make a brief summary of the sequence of events. 
At that time, we were mostly talking about ships. 
The first ship left Halifax on August 24.  
On September 14, the cabinet agreed to send CF-18s if necessary. 
The first debate took place on September 24. 
Nobody had died because of the allied forces. 
The first debate was held, a 14 hour debate.  
In September, we debated this, and a vote was held.  
What was going on? 
We had a debate before anyone started shooting. 
We had a second debate, with a vote, to support resolution 660. 
A Liberal amendment, which we have talked about, was rejected by the House.  
No missiles had yet been launched.  
We have been waiting a month for such a briefing. 
``War in the gulf is useless and dangerous''.  
I am not sure that he does not regret his words today.  
We debated for 46 hours. 
On January 16, Operation Desert Storm started.  
There were three debates and three votes on hypothetical questions. 
It is a parliamentary privilege to vote. 
We need to have accurate information. 
We know what is going on in Kosovo. 
We know that major crimes are taking place. 
What is the exact nature of these crimes? 
We have our suspicions. 
There is increasing talk of mass graves. 
Trouble is brewing over there.  
Unfortunately, we have much to learn from wars. 
Nothing is ever perfect. 
The last time, parliamentary committees were put to work. 
I hope the government will understand that parliament is a tool. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Today we see the opposite occurring. 
According to the Liberal government we are not to have a vote. 
The whole process gets a little confusing.  
I certainly agree with the motion. 
We should have a vote on the issue. 
That is not the idea.  
There is lots of time for partisanship. 
The member is perfectly right. 
It is time, and perhaps even a bit too late. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
The government is not forthcoming. 
They obviously have something to hide. 
Our colleague said that his party will be supporting our motion, and we appreciate it. 
However, he also mentioned that he will not be voting for the amendment. 
Why will he not support the amendment?  
Madam Speaker, I will be very brief. 
The logistics of it all become a bit difficult.  
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
So far, more than 130 members have taken advantage of this opportunity.  
In a speech, we can always qualify our statements.  
We can always make sure there is a way out. 
This is very clear.  
But this is not voting. 
You cannot vote conditionally. 
You either vote for or against a proposition. 
Why are taxpayers entitled to that type of respect? 
First of all, because it is the very essence of our democratic system. 
Taxpayers are entitled to know what we came here to say on their behalf. 
Secondly, because this Kosovo crisis is far from being over. 
But what we do know is that it will be long.  
Canadian taxpayers will therefore certainly be involved again.  
Cabinet is ready to commit astronomical amounts. 
They were talking about $100 million just to take in 5,000 refugees. 
That was simply for bringing 5,000 Kosovars here. 
We figure that several million dollars have been committed to date. 
So far, we have not hassled the government too much. 
So far, we have supported its positions. 
These people are sick, they do not have a home or anything to eat.  
It was therefore essential that we give our support.  
Why would it deny us this right? 
The readiness argument does not hold.  
Armed conflicts do not break out every six months. 
This is what we want to vote on.  
We are not committing ourselves for other times to come. 
We are saying: ``We have this situation. 
That is the least the government should commit to.  
Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Middlesex, Lib.):
It breaks with Canadian parliamentary practice. 
It deals with a hypothetical question which is clearly stated in hypothetical terms. 
In the Canadian parliamentary system the responsibility for deploying Canadian forces lies with the government. 
Since 1950 there have been over 50 peacekeeping support operations of varying sizes. 
It should have the courage to introduce a motion of non-confidence in the government. 
Our government has delivered on its- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am afraid I must interrupt the hon. member. 
I trust the hon. member is aware of that and can ask his question.  
Does the hon. member have a question of the member who spoke?  
Madam Speaker, I will comment on my Liberal colleague's comment.  
We made comments because it was our turn to do so. 
We have not taken anybody's turn. 
My comments were of normal duration.  
It is deemed important for the House to vote on this matter.  
We are told that a cabinet decision will be sufficient. 
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I followed with great interest the hon. member's presentation.  
This year we have had a debate. 
Everybody is free to express their opinions.  
Madam Speaker, I would ask my colleague to check his information. 
They are not on top of the situation.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am sorry but the hon. member's time has expired. 
The hon. member for Mercier.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
It wants this issue to be debated by the representatives of the people.  
We hear a lot in the news about what is going on in Kosovo. 
We had evidence of that on several occasions.  
These debates were between parliamentarians from all European countries.  
Those were disturbing and harrowing debates. 
Europe has experience in this matter. 
This was on April 22, last year.  
The Barsony report is a good report- 
This report dealt with what was going on.  
Nothing should be excluded from the talks. 
He was referring to the Kosovars.  
-they are entitled to express it. 
This international principle is recognized in the Charter of the United Nations. 
They do not have the right to impose anything on anyone.  
Mr. Sole Tura, who spent many years in prison under Franco, said: 
And I could go on and on. 
This was a year ago.  
I took part in the other debate held in September. 
A lot was learned from that debate. 
Many argued that NATO had to get involved. 
What did Milosevic do regarding Rambouillet? 
We are now 26 days into the air campaign. 
Yesterday, we learned that 150,000 soldiers were fighting under Milosevic.  
Only 19 countries are NATO members.  
We do not know who would be ready to get involved. 
We know that Russia is in a very precarious situation.  
We certainly would not know ahead of time how long this operation would take. 
And there definitely would be some danger.  
We will continue with questions and comments after Oral Question Period.  
It being almost 2 p.m., the House will now proceed to Statements by Members.  
Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Middlesex, Lib.):
He was a good Manitoban.  
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
This government must not back down. 
It must fight to protect our forest sector jobs.

Mr. Speaker, I would like to introduce Mr. Rashpal Dhillon to the House.  
He has a wife, Surinder, three children and three grandchildren.  
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):
The hon. member for Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
His Canada Cup achievements produced some thrilling moments. 
Good luck Wayne, and thank you for the memories.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, in December last year, Manitoba lost a great person. 
Judy Cook died while awaiting a heart transplant. 
It will not happen by focusing only on public education and improved hospital systems. 
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
Fine-vive le Canada.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
The hon. member for Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Our parents had heroes like Joe DiMaggio. 
We had Wayne Gretzky.  
In a complicated world he allowed us to escape for many precious moments.  
The hall of fame and new challenges await you. 
We wish you and your family a lifetime of happiness. 
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
Congratulations and a vote of thanks to the volunteers.  
I refer of course to Mr. Gretzky.  
All hon. members rose and applauded] 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
NATO says we should be ready for the ground offensive. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
That is what we are here for.  
We stand against the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo. 
We stand with our forces that are already involved in the NATO campaign. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
There have been more than two debates a year. 
The hon. member for Red Deer.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
I have a question for the Prime Minister. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
It is a demonstration of the continuing allegiance that Nortel shows to the country.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, that is a ridiculous answer. 
Nortel has 56,000 people who work outside Canada.  
Why is he continuing to make lame excuses for his government? 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, unlike what Johnny one note seems to sing, the fact is- 
I prefer that we refer to one another as hon. members.  
My point is simple. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, obviously, the conflict could go on for a very long time. 
But there are people trying to come up with a solution.>

Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
At this point in time, no decision has been made.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is surprised. 
We are not going there to talk about the weather.  
He should not be surprised that we will discuss these issues on Friday. 
The hon. member should do his homework before rising in the House.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Why are we risking Canada's environment? 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Any decision will be made on the basis of all environmental safety standards.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
How does this work? 
Clinton pulls the chain and buddy responds. 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I believe I can respond to the question about PCBs.  
My department has had no request to authorize such a shipment into this country. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
We do not have troops. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I was not talking about the surrounding areas.

Again and again we invest in innovation. 
We invest in research and development. 
We support university granting councils. 
We support R and D tax credits. 
We hear nothing from the Reform Party except more and more criticism.

Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, Canada's problem is taxes. 
Is that its one-note song?  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let us be clear. 
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
The government just does not get it. 
The need is pretty clear. 
Why will he not act? 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member talks about delay. 
Let us talk about what we have done.  
The last two budgets have provided $16.5 billion in tax reduction. 
That is not all we have done. 
We have invested $11.5 billion in health care.  
The hon. member talks about investment. 
Let us talk about the increase in health research budgets.  
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, we will have 18 planes taking part in the air strikes in Yugoslavia.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I could not tell the hon. member at this point. 
If such a need arises, then we will consider the request.  
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
What part of no does the minister not understand?  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
I go back to what I said in the House many times before. 
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the fact remains that they will be burning this stuff in Canada. 
The committee has listened to expert witnesses and concerned Canadians. 
This is the start of a small test of a large problem. 
Will Canada become the nuclear waste dump of the world?  
Mr. Speaker, the hon. gentleman may be confusing two things.

Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, RCMP officers are being turned into bureaucrats. 
The RCMP do not need another study, they need adequate funding.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
There is a resource review in place. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, of course we are concerned. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to answer the question. 
Ministers of the government represent all Canadians from all provinces.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
The hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
There has to be a withdrawal of Serbian government troops. 
There has to be a stop of the exploitation and violence against the refugees. 
There has to be a peace agreement. 
It is on that basis the negotiations are going ahead.  
The hon. member for Winnipeg-Transcona.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the minister has talked about the essentials. 
That was obviously one of the stumbling blocks at Rambouillet. 
It is in the five point plan. 
The hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the minister did not answer my question.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
People have come from across the country for take note hearings at the committee. 
MINISTER FOR INTERNATIONAL TRADE 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the trade minister is out looking for a new job. 
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Perhaps the member might have a serious question.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Industry. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
It is clear, Mr. Speaker, that the issue of productivity is an important one. 
It is vital to the Canadian economy.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
This a noble but partisan effort.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Standing Order 108(2) is very clear. 
The committee makes its own decisions and reviews the issues that it chooses.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
I did not hear the answer of the hon. Minister of National Defence. 
Could he repeat what he said?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:
Mr. Speaker, no they are not.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
He will find that what he is purporting is absolutely not true at all.  
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
This week is National Volunteer Week. 
The volunteer sector in this country is an indispensable part of Canadian life. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member for his very interesting question.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the answer is quite simple: it is no.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we do inform Canadians. 
We do inform parliament.  
PRESENCE IN THE GALLERY 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Reducing the Political Value of Nuclear Weapons for the Twenty-First Century''.  
I commend them and thank them.

PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAM ACT 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
Mr. Speaker, if the House gives its consent, I move: 
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Maybe, if you ask the question again, they could clarify their positions.  
The Chair is reluctant to continue putting the question. 
Mr. Speaker, I believe consent was unanimous.  
I will then put the question again to the House.  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my second petition is also from citizens of Prince George-Bulkley Valley.  
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
SUMAS COMMUNITY CORRECTIONAL CENTRE 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the following question will be answered today: question No 221. 
Question No. 221- Mr. Rick Borotsik: 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I suggest the other questions stand.  
ALLOTTED DAY-THE BALKANS 
The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the amendment.  
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to the hon. member's speech. 
Mr. Speaker, I listened intently to the hon. member. 
I do not understand why the government is saying our motion is vague. 
A vote must absolutely be taken in this House.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
There is a poem in it which talks about the day the war started. 
pushed through the thick carpets of leaves 
into mid-afternoon sun.  
The day the war started 
a Norfolk and Southern diesel 
The day the war started 
couples were married at city hall, 
school children learned the beauty of prairies, 
the beauty of snow on faraway mountains.  
And on that day, too far away to notice, 
other children learned the beauty of flames, 
the beauty of the planes so high in their white sky 
that no one aboard could notice 
-that no one could even hear- 
The international situation is serious. 
The situation will never be the same again. 
It is the first time NATO does such a thing.  
Important changes will have to be made to international institutions. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
I want to assure the House that NATO's resolve remains unshakeable. 
NATO's steadily intensifying military operations are destroying, step by step, Yugoslavia's military capabilities. 
I am pleased to report that their morale is high. 
The air campaign is now in its 27th day. 
His military forces are being hit around the clock and their losses are mounting.  
NATO is again intensifying its air operations by adding more aircraft. 
This new contribution shows our government's firm commitment to this operation. 
We will continue to exercise the necessary leadership to ensure its success.  
Good government requires many things. 
Strong leadership is one of them. 
Parliament has held three debates in recent times on the very important issue of Kosovo.  
Debating this again would be a step backward. 
This government's record of consulting parliament speaks for itself. 
We are determined to exercise the kind of decisive leadership in crisis that Canadians expect. 
Kosovo illustrates the falsehood of that argument perfectly.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
The question that we are asking today is very simple. 
The Canadian people elected members of parliament to this place. 
Why are the Liberals scared to put the same question to the House of Commons?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:
Members opposite have not moved a motion of no confidence. 
I do not hear people disagreeing with what we are doing. 
What is the problem? 
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the minister two questions.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:
I believe that to be the case.  
We are taking this decision in a responsible fashion. 
There are no ground troops being deployed to the region. 
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, today is a very important day in the life of Jewish people. 
Last week was Yom Ha Shoah at which time the survivors told their stories. 
It is very unfortunate that the never again has not been realized.  
I have heard criticism here of the United Nations. 
It was turned down each time. 
Our Minister of Foreign Affairs has raised the issue on at least three occasions. 
I have just returned from a week in Brussels. 
The major concern and attention was on Kosovo. 
Over 130 nations expressed their concerns. 
Yes, there were a few that supported the Yugoslav position, Mr. Milosevic's position. 
For the most part there was unanimous agreement that this war must stop. 
Not once was there a call for ground troops at this time.  
This is such an evolving situation and it is a very difficult one. 
When I listened to the discussions, there were many expressions of serious concern. 
Are they fleeing from the NATO bombs? 
Some of us have just seen that they are digging graves. 
That is quite disturbing. 
We know what happened when similar events occurred in Srebrenica. 
All the men were massacred. 
This question demands an immediate answer from the Yugoslav authorities.  
But President Milosevic has frustrated every attempt to find a solution.  
There are no quick fixes in Yugoslavia and in Kosovo. 
That is what happened in 1933. 
The world did not react then. 
We are in a position to see change. 
For that we should all be grateful.  
NATO was able to save at least most of that population. 
That country was challenged by a misguided leader. 
NATO's role was a vital one. 
I am most pleased we have supported it to date. 
Let us hope for a peaceful solution.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's speech. 
It was very well put. 
I certainly agree with the contents of what she said. 
A drastic thing is going on. 
Let us all hope it comes to an end soon.  
I am concerned when it comes to the debates that take place in the House. 
I have expressed this before and I will express it again. 
Does she agree that sometimes these decisions are made without the debate? 
Does she agree with doing that?  
Mr. Speaker, that is a very interesting question and it presents a dilemma. 
That is a very heavy responsibility cabinet must look at, evaluate and weigh.  
That is a big improvement over what we had in the past.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to what the hon. member had to say. 
People from our ridings could be involved in this war. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague for his question. 
That is why I believe we know what we are doing. 
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
The war in Kosovo is now in its 26th day. 
Who would have believed that the conflict would have gone on this long? 
Unfortunately, we underestimated Milosevic and the Serbian government. 
The latest figures on the massive exodus of the Kosovar population are terrifying. 
NATO also believes it has found 43 mass graves. 
No need to point out that the needs are urgent in the various refugee camps.  
That is where the problem lies. 
Let us remember the Gulf war in 1991. 
At that time, Liberals were in the opposition. 
It is time the government stopped acting that way. 
Why such lack of transparency compared to other governments? 
Germany has voted twice on the advisability of air strikes in Kosovo.  
What is the Canadian government waiting for to show the same openness?  
This is not right.  
Why does peace elude mankind?  
Why not put our hate behind?  
Peace has retreated for all it is worth 
And though I seek it near and far 
What is so hard to comprehend?  
Love one another, and wars will all end.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
What would be her opinion?  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question.  
I think that in any parliament democracy must rule. 
This is disappointing because we are here to represent the people. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
However, I think it would be ill-advised. 
It would be undemocratic to send in troops without informing us. 
This kind of decision should be discussed and made in the House. 
Members have views they want to express. 
Otherwise, what is the use of electing members of parliament? 
To act like a bunch of yes-men and women just supporting the government? 
That is not what we are here for. 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
Why do we have to debate this issue again today? 
But I will not talk about bad faith, but rather about clumsiness. 
I can only hope that there is no such improvisation in reality. 
If there had been oil in Bosnia, they would have intervened''. 
I think the situation must be put in perspective.  
This government seems to be governing by polls. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
However, it goes, I would say, a little beyond the legal principle.  
There are moral principles. 
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Milosevic must understand that our position is unwavering. 
This is no time for playing political games. 
These committees held unprecedented and comprehensive public hearings. 
We have listened to Canadians and we have consulted parliament.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
The accusation coming from the parliamentary secretary is accusing the opposition of political jockeying. 
I mentioned that I appreciate that. 
However, what they also seem to be saying is that we are closing off debate.  
I know it has been mentioned before, but I am going to mention it again. 
This is the fourth debate we have had on Kosovo. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
He asked a question and he is getting an answer. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Your arguments are not convincing, sir- 
The hon member for Beauharnois-Salaberry must address his remarks to the Chair.  
There are examples when the House voted. 
There is an awful lot of information out there. 
People only have to go and get it.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, hon. members know I do not believe in fighting.  
It is an astounding thing to think about in 1999. 
Mr. Speaker, clearly we are. 
It was not undertaken when we declared war on Korea. 
We know with a majority government we could carry it. 
I just do not believe it.  
I will read a quote and then say who said it. 
We would have to say that is a responsible position to take. 
Once again it is not often I throw accolades to the official opposition. 
This is another quote which was made in this place. 
Frankly it is dangerous. 
We are not going into a war by committee. 
There are 301 people in our parliament who need to vote on this''. 
We would be tying the hands of the military leaders. 
I recall it rather well. 
My colleague, the member from Owen Sound, made a very interesting remark to me. 
This was their opportunity to say `` Zivjela Hrvatska ''. 
This was their opportunity to vote for independence, to vote for a strong Croatia. 
We are in the same region.  
It is absolutely true. 
That conflict is there in such a personal fashion it is hard to conceive.  
In no circumstances could I support putting our soldiers at risk in that theatre. 
We should be supporting our personnel. 
I support them as I hope all members will.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to my colleague's speech.  
The member knows that what they are doing is absolutely appropriate. 
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
The House has not been given the full opportunity to debate it. 
No opportunity for a vote was given. 
I quoted the New Democratic member for Halifax West. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
I believe the debate is certainly well timed. 
It could be carried a bit further, but so be it. 
I will read the motion again for anyone who may be viewing or listening: 
It is not an emergency. 
As well there would be a substantial show of support throughout. 
What on earth does that mean? 
That is the conclusion of the opposition leader's statement.  
I cannot understand that.  
How would we be jeopardizing their safety by having a vote on this issue? 
I believe they deserve our support.  
What are we jockeying for? 
Where is the political jockeying?  
There is no political jockeying involved. 
All these matters have been raised in the last few minutes. 
How would it even know that? 
Since when has the government side been speaking for every member in the House? 
It is not speaking for every member in the House. 
Why would the government side continually want to shut down the issue of a vote? 
It does not want the democratic process to actually- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The member has one minute to go.  
My apologies, Mr. Speaker, for not letting you know earlier.  
It does not want to vote on it.  
That is the history. 
We could talk about the banning of kiddie porn. 
The list goes on and on. 
Today we are debating a motion by the Bloc which has to do with Kosovo.  
We just listened to the third speech made by a Reform member. 
By the way, this is our fourth debate on Kosovo. 
The Reform Party picked a Mickey Mouse motion. 
It was a tragic-comic, partisan motion about alienation.  
That is not a party which normally supports the Bloc. 
However, the issue of the vote is clear. 
The Liberal side said no. 
The next day it was the same thing; the Liberal side said no. 
We asked for that vote and they would not agree to it.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
That seems to be constantly shoved aside by the government. 
I would ask the hon. member what his views are with respect to that suggestion.  
Diplomatically it is incumbent upon our government to pursue it at great length. 
I applaud the member for taking that initiative. 
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
It would be more than just the largest party in this House- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The member for Calgary Northeast has 15 seconds to wind up.  
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for that question. 
I agree with him and I thank him for the question.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
A very important motion has been brought forward by the Bloc Quebecois today. 
I was on the foreign affairs committee at the time. 
I think it would be unanimous. 
I think it would be a unanimous vote.  
Parliament should be the instrument. 
That is not the way to do it. 
Third, a vote would strengthen the ministers' hand. 
The House brought its decision down and we had better listen''. 
They would be saying ``I supported the decision. 
We sent our men and women overseas and I am behind them all the way''.  
This brings me to my fourth point. 
A vote sends a message to the troops like nothing else can. 
We bring forward motions. 
It was tried last Friday to bring a motion forward regarding Wayne Gretzky. 
There was a member today who talked about Wayne Gretzky. 
It was a very sad moment in my community. 
We are standing here, and by standing here we are standing with you. 
However, we cannot do that in the same way unless we vote.  
I am happy to support the motion. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
This process will not end in a vote as it should. 
Maybe it too will be cancelled. 
We sent six fighter bombers, then twelve and now eighteen. 
We all know the moral objective is to stop the ethnic cleansing. 
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I know the hon. member has been following the debate in the House. 
Has the hon. member read the resolution? 
I am curious as to what it is he is actually voting on. 
Is he voting on whether we have a vote? 
Is he voting on whether we are hypothetically sending troops? 
Is he sanctioning a military operation, in which case is he prepared to- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sorry, I need to interrupt. 
The member for Fraser Valley has 60 seconds for a response.  
Mr. Speaker, I do have the motion in front of me as amended. 
It is a step forward for democracy.  
Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Middlesex, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to join in the debate today.  
The proposition before the House today is very interesting. 
The House of Commons works on the concept of precedence.  
We are looking at a precedence. 
We have given this subject many hours of debate. 
As a consequence, we keep hearing ``Why do you not do this?'' 
We work on real situations.  
In looking at the situation as presented, it would and could be unworkable. 
I do not want to get into a debate on it. 
We should make that commitment and we will make that commitment.  
I should mention at this time that I will be splitting my time.  
That does not eliminate the possibility of this happening. 
Very few of our NATO allies have put the Kosovo incident to a vote. 
The United Kingdom has not voted nor debated this issue. 
France has not voted. 
We are not off centre with our allies.  
Mr. Milosevic's unacceptable conduct predates the current crisis in Kosovo. 
Our commitment to peace and stability in the region is well established. 
All interested members were invited.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, first of all the proposition put before us is not in line. 
It is a hypothetical situation which the hon. member should know well.  
This is nothing new. 
A hypothetical question is something we should not vote on. 
Also the American analogy does not work. 
We have heard the Reform Party vigorously support this motion. 
I would just say that I cannot answer that question with qualified authority.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Can he explain that?  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
I would be working in the dark on that one.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Over 100 members have participated. 
There has been 20 to 25 hours of work in committees. 
I was here during the time of the gulf war. 
There was not any parliamentary involvement whatsoever. 
That was the vote, pure and simple. 
I always pay great deference to my predecessors. 
I notice that he took occasion this morning to talk about parliamentary responsibility. 
Over 100 members of parliament have expressed themselves very clearly on the most unmistakable commitments.  
I acknowledge that that is a change. 
We say innocent people should not be killed by those weapons. 
That is what Canadians are interested in.  
We want a government to make a decision and bring it to the House. 
Changes have to be made. 
There has to be a flexibility of response. 
Canada is not acting as a sole agent. 
We are not in this by ourselves. 
We are members of a broad alliance of a wide range of countries. 
We are engaged on a number of fronts. 
There is active diplomacy going on. 
President Clinton does not show up in Congress every day. 
The British Prime Minister goes once every two weeks. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
This is unheard of.  
I would really hope for something better in the Parliament of Canada. 
The hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs, if he wishes to respond.  
He asked what people in other democracies would think. 
We had these briefings. 
I think Canadians can stand proud.  
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
This is a quote from the current foreign affairs minister.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
We would certainly welcome that. 
Then we might have something to vote on by way of endorsing that resolution.  
He has been working assiduously to try to develop a resolution of the security council. 
That is what we are backing right now. 
That is why we are working so hard along with the secretary general.  
Let us give the best shot we have right now to help the secretary general.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I think the hon. minister might like- 
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
I know that he came straight from his office specially to listen to me. 
I quoted one a few minutes ago but I will repeat it for him.  
He was talking about the gulf war.  
And most importantly, this last comment: 
That is what the present minister stated.  
The present minister of Foreign Affairs introduced that motion on January 15 1991.  
Further, speaking of Canadians, he said: 
The distinguished author of this quote is the current foreign affairs minister.  
I will go on as the members opposite had some good ones. 
On January 15, 1991, they said, still concerning the Persian gulf war: 
My last quote concerns a Liberal amendment to the government motion.  
How can we explain this about-face in the Liberals' position?  
We heard a lot of nonsense. 
I will quote a few of those comments. 
We asked how many planes have been kept in reserve. 
At present, we have 18 planes over there. 
How many do we have left, if NATO calls for more? 
We were given the following answer ``We do not know''.  
We do not know. 
How many more planes can we send? 
We do not know. 
Are these state secrets? 
We ask these questions but we cannot get any answers.  
This is one of the constructive and positive things the Bloc Quebecois has undertaken. 
Yes, one of many. 
Just like the answers on the aircraft and the budget.  
The Liberal side turned a deaf ear.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
Moreover, a vote has been held on this in the House. 
I was not referring to the United States.  
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member.  
A parliamentarian expresses his or her point of view by using his or her vote. 
What the government is proposing is the opportunity to speak.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Joliette for his question.  
They often tell us ``Canada is a dictatorship elected every four years. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
However, any consent must first and foremost be an informed one. 
It must be quite explicit, and it will be only if we vote.  
I do not believe that constitutes explicit consent on the part of members of parliament. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
These statements were not made a week ago. 
It says, and I quote: 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Is there unanimous consent to permit extension of the debate?  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
But there will be no questions or comments.  
Moreover, without a vote, the position of the various parties carries no real weight. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen 
And the bells having rung: 
Is it agreed that we proceed with the adjournment proceedings?  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
The caption below refers to the latest efforts from veterans affairs.  
The minister had the gall to respond that these survivors were delighted. 
Our government has failed itself and failed these brave Canadians miserably.  
Over eight years later I should say that it is almost too late.  
Mr. Bob Wood (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):
Let us get the facts on the table right now. 
Canada had already chosen a different path in the mid-1970s.  
Those representations were made by the Prime Minister personally to the new chancellor of Germany. 
In short, everything has been done that there is to be done right here. 
I think the hon. member should acknowledge that.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
The minister told me it was $4.9 billion. 
He went on to add: 
I will briefly give an example. 
He had accumulated more than 850 hours. 
He appealed the decision, but he lost his appeal.  
The system no longer works.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Today we were reading about the latest evidence of Canada's weakening economy. 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
BLACK LAKE BC MINE 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
I condemn this double standard. 
The Thetford Mines region feels unfairly treated by the Liberal government of Canada. 
Quebec is not getting its fair share.  
That is the fairness of this Liberal government. 
Four million dollars for Quebec, and $259 million for Nova Scotia. 
Everyone in Canada must be fairly treated. 
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.46 p.m.)
