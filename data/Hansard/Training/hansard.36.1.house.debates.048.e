EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 48 
Wednesday, December 10, 1997 
The House met at 2 p.m. 
Leading the choral will be Mrs. Michelle Hundertmark.  
Whereupon the national anthem was sung ] 
Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton, Lib.):
I welcome all to come to see the tree. 
Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, Joyeux Noel.  
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
I appeal to the government's supposed social conscience. 
The interest on the federal debt is eating the heart out of social programs. 
INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS DAY 
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, today is International Human Rights Day. 
The respect for human rights is one of the cornerstones of a functional democratic nation. 
The world is rife with human rights abuses. 
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
If you do drink, don't drive.  
One of those students is Miss Kathleen Forder.  
We must work together to make our highways safer for all Canadians.  
Kathleen, keep up the good work.  
BAFFIN REGIONAL YOUTH COUNCIL 
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
These future leaders are great ambassadors for the north. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
They simply did not have the money.  
If the mine ever shut down they could move the trailer to a new location. 
Where is the risk for CMHC? 
This is discrimination at its worse. 
INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS DAY 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Despite these real advances, however, there is still much to be done. 
The hon. member for Beauce.  
CANADA FOUNDATION FOR INNOVATION 
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard said on October 3, 1995: 
Let us have protection of the public at heart.  
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
This attitude is called disdain. 
Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):
How dare she minimize the memories of such a murderous madman.  
Convicted killer Villeneuve and his guerrillas continue to threaten innocent people. 
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):
I congratulate my colleagues who have put forward such initiatives. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
A plane crashed killing the pilot and two others. 
A child also died later in the hospital. 
Only now are the injured being air-lifted to a hospital in Winnipeg.  
Residents travelled to the site by skidoo to assist the injured. 
MARCIA ADAMS AND MARLENE MCCUTCHEON 
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
The entire community has suffered a tremendous loss.  
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Canada is much more than francophone and anglophone. 
Bilingualism is costly, unfair and discriminatory.  
It is time to capture and foster a new national spirit.  
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
We will continue to support them in their efforts.  
DEPUTY CLERK MARY ANNE GRIFFITH 
She looks so well.  
And in 1983 she did it again. 
In 1987, she became the first person to be appointed Deputy Clerk. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Best wishes, Mary Anne, from the new members as well as the old members.  
Our hearts go out to the families of the four people who died.  
It was the Winnipeg Sun that had to come to the rescue. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
In the meantime, we still have search and rescue helicopters. 
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
At the same time he was asking us to cut expenditures. 
That is exactly what we have done. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:
They have finally been able to land.  
They are on their way to the hospital in Winnipeg with the survivors.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
The military circled around. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
However, it did so at considerable risk. 
A risk assessment is something our people have to take at the time. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
This is one of the government's largest areas of spending. 
Furthermore, it shows the benefit of putting our fiscal house in order.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
The Minister of Finance is such a generous fellow, Mr. Speaker. 
That is what we are asking ourselves.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We did exactly what Canadians from coast to coast to coast wanted us to do.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Finance should be a little more reasonable. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Here is my question for the minister. 
That is what they want.  
The Hon. Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, what federal program does the hon. member object to? 
Does he object to our helping the aeronautical industry in Montreal? 
Does he object to our helping children from broken families in Montreal? 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the prime minister.  
Now they want what is owed to them.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the answer is yes.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
These are the real guts of national unity.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, yes, this is exactly what we have done. 
That is why we have invested in innovation. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
There was no difficulty there.  
The hon. member for Brandon-Souris.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
What were used were fixed wing aircraft. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister just talked about flexibility. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the people of Canada know that Canada is always responsible. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, what we see here is a Prime Minister who is nervous. 
He will resort to anything. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I am too nervous, Mr. Speaker. 
GOODS AND SERVICES TAX 
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, quite simply because Quebec did not lose any money. 
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the minister's attempt to avoid the issue is not fooling anyone. 
If it is true, who is right? 
What exactly is he afraid of? 
What does the Minister of Finance have to lose?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member asked ``who is right?''. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
The minister likes to talk a lot about balance. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The deficit has not been eliminated. 
Therefore I suggest that the member himself might want to answer that question.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
That is the Reform Party platform. 
We do not know what the government wants to do.  
That is the government's version of compassion.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Will the minister admit that his reform has greatly increased poverty?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I absolutely do not believe that our reform has increased poverty. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
On the contrary, welfare in Quebec has been dropping for some time now. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Why does it now stand up and pretend otherwise?  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Government revenue has gone up by $26 billion. 
Give her tax relief and give it to her today.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That is how it would cut taxes.  
SABLE ISLAND GAS PIPELINE 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
The hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural Resources.  
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
The National Energy Board has provided advice. 
Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard-La Prairie, Lib.):
This closure will directly affect my riding in Monteregie.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, in 1990 the prime minister promised to fix the Senate. 
He said ``I want to work for a Senate that is elected''.  
On Monday we asked the government what it was going to do about the Senate. 
Is the Deputy Prime Minister right? 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has misstated what I said in the House. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
So much for Liberal election promises, Mr. Speaker. 
The Senate is less accountable than ever. 
My question is very specific, so listen carefully. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the prime minister.  
Moreover, our Canadian ambassador in Washington defends this bad deal.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
I believe we will get it to deliver on this. 
We will get these sites cleaned up.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
There have been many uses of that site since then.  
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Since then we all know of two tragic accidents.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we all regret these occurrences when they happen. 
Obviously an investigation is required to determine the facts.  
Many airports are under visual flight rules. 
Obviously that means in certain types of weather accidents sometimes occur. 
The hon. member for Cumberland-Colchester.  
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Obviously the crash last night was weather related.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this very tragic accident occurred only last night.  
Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga Centre, Lib.):
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
CANADIAN LABOUR RELATIONS BOARD 
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is a very important question. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
What action is our government taking to respond to this humanitarian crisis? 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
I should remind him that one child out of every five lives in poverty.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Shefford for her question.  
I would say we are off to a good start- 
The hon. member for Thunder Bay-Atikokan.  
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
My colleagues, that would bring to a close our question period.  
Mr. Joe Comuzzi (Thunder Bay-Nipigon, Lib.):
Neither the co-chair nor I were informed or consulted until after the fact. 
Unfortunately, the arrangements arrived at have not been implemented to this date. 
You know that we have proposed a satisfactory resolution to this situation.  
I am trying to find how this is attached to privilege of the House. 
I view this as an administrative matter.  
I was under the impression that this had been resolved.  
I invite my hon. colleague to have further discussions with me. 
Mr. Speaker, I was just coming to that point. 
We feel those privileges have been denied and as a result- 
I thank the hon. member for his consent to further discussion on this. 
For the time being this would not be a question of privilege.

FY 1994-95-$3 billion or 34% non-competitive 
CY 1995-$2.5 billion or 35% non-competitive 
Mr. Speaker, I suggest that all the other questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
I would like to know when the government intends to answer them. 
I know the House will adjourn tomorrow. 
Shall the questions stand, as suggested by the parliamentary secretary?  
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
I am extremely interested in having those papers produced.  
Shall all Notices of Motions for the Production of Papers stand?  
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Vaughan-King-Aurora, Lib.):
Their message was quite clear. 
Indeed they are an expression of our values.  
This national conversation was both rewarding and enlightening. 
It is one that is filled with a great deal of optimism and hope. 
People told us that change is not something they feared. 
Change is something that we embrace.  
We are moving forward, replacing the excesses of the past with the successes of today. 
Interest rates are at their lowest levels in three decades. 
Inflation remains firmly under control. 
Consumer and business confidence are up and continue to rise. 
Clearly that sacrifice has paid off. 
The deficit four years ago stood at $42 billion. 
Now it is at $8.9 billion. 
Every target has been bettered. 
Today Canadians face a brighter future. 
In the Globe and Mail , October 1, 1993, ``Economic outlook dim''. 
In the Globe and Mail , July 1, 1997, ``Economy Rockets Ahead''. 
This must mean something. 
Gone is the burden of the $42 billion deficit. 
Gone are the crippling interest rates and rising inflation. 
Gone is double digit unemployment. 
I understand the pain the member for Markham is going through. 
I understand and I feel his pain.  
Canadians feel empowered in today's society. 
They have seen the impact they have on government policy. 
We also said that it should be done within the life of this mandate.  
Let me leave no doubt in the minds of my hon. friends across the way. 
Canadians recognize that across the board tax cuts are not affordable at this time. 
To implement them would be irresponsible and short sighted. 
I also want my friends in the House to know Canadians want targeted tax relief.  
These are all issues we heard about. 
The reality is that Canadians are against old fashioned spending sprees. 
They want continued fiscal responsibility. 
They want continued prudent budgeting and prudent assumptions. 
Let me quite blunt. 
RRSPs are one of the three pillars of our retirement income system. 
Their importance in our economy cannot be overstated. 
However, we went further than that. 
It also means continuing support for the youth employment strategy. 
If I can speak on this particular issue for a few minutes, Mr. Speaker. 
I had the privilege to chair the Ministerial Task Force on Youth. 
Today, as a result of those measures, hundreds of thousands of young Canadians have benefited.  
We live in changing times, more challenging times for our young people. 
Investment in these areas are means to making the new- 
Secretary to the Governor General 
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Vaughan-King-Aurora, Lib.):
I am proud of what we have accomplished together.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
In the government's Speech from the Throne, we saw this 50-50 promise. 
Not one word on either short-term or long-term debt management strategy. 
A recommendation opposing broad-based tax relief. 
A recommendation that certain payroll taxes not be increased. 
Now, there is a public relations device. 
The federal debt currently stands at over 60% of the gross domestic product. 
The total public debt in Canada is almost 100% of GDP. 
Canadians ask once we raise this subject to whom do we owe this money. 
Let me turn to the tax situation. 
They are now on track to increase to $70 billion in 1998-99. 
Need I say more or provide any more information?  
A message was delivered by the Usher of the Black Rod as follows: 
Accordingly the Speaker with the House went up to the Senate chamber.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Canadians are taxed to death.  
I am going to take another tack. 
The excessive federal debt, like private debt, limits freedom. 
It limits the freedom of governments to pursue social as well as economic goals. 
Let me look at the negative social impacts of excessive taxation. 
What did the federal government do for them? 
It taxed them to the tune of $2.3 billion. 
It taxed those people to the tune of $12.5 billion. 
Her name is Kim Hicks. 
I want to share it with the House. 
It is dated February 27, 1997: 
Hello, first of all my name is Kim Hicks. 
I am married and we have four children aged 2-8 years. 
My concern is this. 
It seems as though people like us are forgotten. 
I don't, I sometimes envy them. 
There are other families who need help. 
We have refinanced and refinanced and we just can't do it any more. 
Pay the needed payment and then borrow it over. 
We are sick of it. 
Promises and empty talk-we are sick of it. 
We don't buy big ticket items. 
We, again, are going to lose and so will our kids.  
I'm sorry for this long letter. 
I really don't know what I expect. 
I wrote to Mr. Axworthy when he was human resources minister. 
Thank you for your time. 
Are members moved by that letter? 
What do we say to Kim Hicks and others like her? 
What does the government have to say? 
What does the finance minister have to say? 
What does the finance committee report have to say? 
We know what kind of reaction it would get.  
When I first read this I was at a loss for words. 
That is quite an admission from a politician. 
I wondered whether anything I could say would help. 
My letter was almost apologetic.  
We were working on it at that time. 
I read it to public audiences in a number of places.  
Then I asked Kim to do two things. 
What would she do with it if she got it from Revenue Canada? 
Before I do, let me give members a little quiz. 
Do they think she would save a portion? 
What do they think she would spend it on? 
What would be the allocation? 
Do they think she would spend it wisely or foolishly? 
We will let the members be the judge.  
This is her first letter, dated July 23, 1997: 
She was willing to play the game.  
The $2,000 we spent as follows: 
Notice the commitment to debt reduction. 
She pays down her loans and her credit card balances.  
Note the spending on essentials, wood and groceries for the family. 
How did this tax relief make this family feel? 
However, I want members to be the judge. 
This is her last letter in response to my request: 
The first feeling my husband and I experienced was a sense of relief. 
And that means, to us, a brighter future.  
We feel that we have to have this tax relief. 
We really carry too much tax burden. 
Extra income in our pocket would give us a sense of security. 
We could actually see some light at the end of the tunnel, so to speak. 
I hope-that I have answered your question sufficiently. 
I wonder how many letters Revenue Canada gets like that. 
Scrooge had a humble clerk named Bob Hatchet. 
What was the response of finance minister Scrooge to this proposal? 
Then it was Christmas Eve. 
Scrooge had retired early. 
To induce sleep some people count sheep but not Scrooge. 
My name is Sir William Thomas White. 
I too was once finance minister of Canada. 
It was only 12 pages long. 
It was a tiny tax. 
``Is this my fate too'' he cried. 
``Not necessarily'' said the spirit. 
With that, the apparition disappeared.  
Finance minister Scrooge tried to pull himself together. 
``I am here to take you for a ride'' said the ghost of taxes present. 
``But I don't want to go for a ride'' said finance minister Scrooge. 
As soon as they were in, the doors locked shut. 
The meter began to run. 
But Tiny Tim would have none of it. 
What will happen to their lives and their dreams?'' 
``You will soon see'' said the ghost of taxes present.  
The taxi slowly came to a halt. 
The door was slowly opened by yet another ghostly figure. 
This apparition was faceless, dressed all in black. 
Here lie the jobs killed by high taxes. 
The list went on and on.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
With respect, is this a point of order?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Will you get to it immediately.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
This would be a stretch to be a point of order. 
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
As we all know, we are here solely to defend Quebec's interests. 
We no longer believe in Santa Claus or in the federal government's little helpers. 
The last major review of corporate tax dates back to the 1960s. 
The Minister of Finance, however, is content with it. 
The same goes for personal income tax. 
The minister is operating with measures that no longer meet the needs of individuals.  
The Reform Party is talking of decreasing income and other taxes. 
Trudeauism is personified in this House by the minister of provincial interference.  
It is obsessed with making its presence felt. 
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
I will tell one of his stories.  
This government wants to encourage people to get out and work. 
This is no kind of incentive.  
Does he know anything about how this mechanism? 
Can he tell us the Liberals' untold horror stories? 
I would like to hear what my hon. colleague has to say.  
His star is fading, like all the other federal stars across Canada.  
Everything else is the same. 
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
The NDP is the one.  
But we were not too familiar with the NDP in my neck of the woods. 
We were also told that the Conservatives were a bit more to the right.  
I will tell the House of my experience in recent days. 
People are afraid that TAGS will not be renewed. 
People are afraid that the government will not keep its word. 
The cod, the cod moratorium, the fisheries have not revived.  
It would seem that the machinery of government grinds very slowly.  
People who are on TAGS did not ask to be there. 
The people are really upset. 
Does that make any sense? 
What sort of a country is this? 
What sort of a government is this?  
I will summarize in three lines what I heard. 
We heard a lot of people. 
There was no other option. 
Take the example of the people of the Magdalen Islands. 
There used to be a redfish processing plant called Madelipeche. 
There is nothing else to do. 
They said they needed income support. 
That is the first point.  
Negotiate with the plants. 
But no one is saying anything. 
And they won't take that.  
If you want us to diversify, give us money, not peanuts. 
It is impossible to start up new industries without money''.  
I could go on at length. 
During this trip, I met people who were trying to catch new species of fish. 
They had earned a supplementary income. 
They had to give it back to Human Resources Development Canada. 
So he gets not one red cent.  
He will see that he will change his tune.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We will keep them short and sweet and the responses short and sweet. 
Then we will go to the hon. member for Acadie-Bathurst.  
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
I think we all know there is a serious problem. 
We also know there are problems with the fishery.  
We all know what the real problem is.  
That is the answer I can give the hon. member for the moment.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
That is what the Liberal government said.  
Today the government is changing direction and doing the same thing again. 
Is the government not being irresponsible? 
Is my colleague prepared to support me on this?  
That is one of my questions.  
I have another quick question. 
I would like him to be brief too in order to answer my two questions. 
He came to New Brunswick. 
What happened to the committee, which did not invite people- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am very sorry, but time has run out. 
To answer his question clearly and briefly, yes, he is right. 
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the request of the member for New Westminister-Coquitlam-Burnaby. 
It could have allowed another perpetrator to go free.  
There would be no time limits. 
It involves the death of individuals and the consequences thereof. 
Obviously that category does not apply here.  
It has a simple concept and is not defective in its drafting.  
This bill does not affect the government's legislative agenda at all. 
There is really nothing partisan about this bill whatsoever.  
This is not the case either.  
Steve Sullivan, Executive Director, wrote: 
Fougere was clearly responsible for Mr. Gall's death.  
They go on to say in writing: 
Please accept this letter of support for Bill 215. 
Victims of Violence also wrote to me, stating: 
We commend you for this effort.  
I think those are very clear sentiments. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member has three minutes remaining. 
However, if he has completed we will then go to debate.  
They too have been arguing for reform.  
The following criticisms can and have been made. 
Second, this is an arbitrary rule which prevents justice from being done in certain cases. 
In its working paper on homicide, the LRC took the following position: 
In other jurisdictions change has already taken place.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
There is mens rea, actus reus and causal link. 
The bill is very clear, it removes all time limits. 
I do not think that is what the legal system wants.  
We have a British tradition. 
What about certain of the Commonwealth countries? 
What is happening in Europe? 
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
There was one occasion here today where unanimous consent was sought. 
I think all members who have spoken today recognize that.  
In order to prove the guilt of the accused, the crown must establish two things. 
How can the crown determine mens rea? 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Do we really want to not have any time limit imposed? 
There is a further example of consequences to this amendment to section 227. 
We also believe there should be a reasonable cut off time in that limit.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
I was a little late getting here and I do apologize for that.  
However I am a little dismayed. 
Whether the bill is good or bad is beside the point. 
It should not surprise me. 
Surprise is the wrong word. 
That is old stuff.  
That description today does not fit in the minds of a big majority of Canadians. 
They are an unhappy lot with the justice system. 
That is what must begin to happen. 
Sooner or later it will have to start happening.  
This government for many years now has failed to address that. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We have 15 minutes to wait until the participants arrived. 
We have a choice. 
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or, NDP):
It is unlikely this House will see the report. 
Senator Murray said the board's actions were incredible.  
What are Devco and the minister afraid of? 
There is an absolute mess brewing under the minister's nose. 
Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
All of us want to see successes on the island. 
To repeat, Devco has not yet received the report of the special examination. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The parliamentary secretary's time has expired.  
The hon. member for Red Deer.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
The timing could not have been worse. 
Obviously they are now taking great advantage of their contacts within the government. 
We need to tighten up these arrangements dramatically. 
Maybe the UN will scuttle it. 
We get tired of this sort of double standard and double talk. 
Doug Young, Paul Zed and Summa Strategies or the foreign affairs minister.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
Please note the answer.  
Mr. Speaker, yes I will confirm that we will defend the Canadian dairy industry vigorously.  
``I defend vigorously'', he says. 
From 1995 to 1997, there has been more than a four-fold increase in imports. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Responding to the hon. member for Frontenac-Megantic, I do apologize. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien:
Mr. Speaker, I have a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I accept the challenge.  
They also state that we did not respect our quota on milk. 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
I wonder why the government would continue on that basis.  
There is need for change and greater accountability.  
Now a 289 square foot home is not a mansion.  
The rest of the qualifications were contained in there. 
How about the social services department? 
This is the department they run to help people. 
This is what we talked about in question period. 
Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
These results illustrate real progress within this first nation.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
They just fudge on the answer. 
There is something wrong when that happens.  
He is lobbying on behalf of the provincial government. 
We have the consummate insiders both federally and provincially. 
On that I rest my case. 
I look forward to the response from the parliamentary secretary.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Specifically, the hon. member has questioned the involvement of Summa Strategies. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.50 p.m.)
