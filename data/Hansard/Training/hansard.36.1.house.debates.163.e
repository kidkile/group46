COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
Mr. Speaker, Question No. 150 will be answered today. 
Question No. 150- Mr. Mark Muise: 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (parliamentary secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
ALLOTTED DAY-SOCIAL PROGRAMS 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I wish to congratulate Mr. Bouchard's government on its re-election. 
Yet another missed opportunity.  
Yet the sun still shines on Canada. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
I will respond in two ways. 
First, there is a reason for the deadline. 
That is the reason for the December 31 deadline.  
It would be the various options the federal government may pursue. 
In fact we would insist on that.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
The member doth protest too much.  
We never have and never will.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
I would like to take a moment to explain what the social union is. 
It was at Saskatoon that the premiers unanimously endorsed the social union. 
That does not mean that there was not some heated debate. 
There were concerns expressed by all the provinces. 
The federal Liberals stand alone in their opposition to the social union. 
One has to question why that is.  
The premiers' agreement was not outrageous. 
How can this be construed as an attack on the federation?  
How does this challenge federal powers?  
The premiers are being realistic with this position. 
The social union has the unanimous support of the provinces. 
However, I do wish to put forth the following amendment. 
That the motion be amended by inserting after the word ``House'' the word ``strongly''.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Would she care to share a bit of her knowledge and experience on that subject?  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.  
Often we find ourselves on the other side of a situation.  
The provinces are ready to assume responsibility. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Is that not what they are proposing on the other side?  
Mr. Speaker, absolutely not. 
There is no reason that the federal government would be less strong. 
This House is a good place to start the debate. 
The Government of Canada took a month, until July 16, to react. 
Both are under examination.  
This is no easy achievement, because it is an important issue. 
It is not a work in progress. 
Canada ranked 5th of 150 governments. 
It is not so bad. 
We have to improve something that already is good. 
Governments have been able to put their fiscal houses in order. 
Now together we have to choose good policies. 
It may take time but it is necessary in order to succeed.  
The Leader of the Opposition has said the same thing.  
Why invent difficulties where there are none? 
The Prime Minister wants to do it. 
His ministers want to do it. 
The premiers want to do it. 
Premier Bouchard signed on in Saskatoon in August.  
It is a bargaining position. 
It is a give and take. 
There is compromise, flexibility and no artificial deadlines. 
I could not agree more. 
I have other quotes from premiers saying the same thing.  
Do we not want to also improve our social programs?  
Therefore I would move: 
I seek the unanimous consent of the House to move this amendment.  
There is no unanimous consent. 
The amendment is therefore not in order.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I cannot express strongly enough my disappointment in the minister's speech.  
It was just a litany of reasons for delay. 
I would like to ask the minister a practical question. 
Is it the opt out clause, is it the dispute settling mechanism? 
Mr. Speaker, I find the comparison irresponsible. 
It does not make sense. 
We will forget it.  
We are speaking about something very important. 
It is not time to suggest bad purposes to others. 
We are looking at it very responsibly. 
The provinces ask us to do the same. 
No one speaks now about the deadline of December 31. 
We will go ahead to have a good federation. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
There was no forethought, there was no organization in that. 
The minister knows how serious this issue is. 
We have a separatist government again in Quebec. 
We do not need a lecture on unity this morning. 
I will tell the House what we need for that. 
We need imagination and faith in this country.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
I should point out that the government Quebeckers elected yesterday is a good government. 
This was not a referendum. 
We sovereignists never said it would be. 
The federalists in Quebec were the ones who held it would be a referendum election. 
They will have to live with that now. 
We never made any such assertion. 
It concerns social union. 
This has been a traditional demand of Quebec's for over 50 years. 
That was before the election. 
Why all the fuss?''  
The issue goes back a long time. 
Daniel Johnson senior added the following in 1966: 
In 1978, Rene Levesque added: 
This is what Quebec has been saying clearly for 50 years. 
We are acting in defence of Quebeckers' rights.  
Today, they are trying to convince us that it was the sovereignists who did so. 
We must get back a bit closer to the truth.  
The sovereignists have never applied this policy. 
We are here to defend our interests.  
For months, we heard quite the opposite. 
Now they tell us no action is necessary. 
We say something has to be done and done fast. 
Why is this urgent? 
Because there is a budget in the offing. 
We have had it. 
We are fed up. 
That is the long and the short of it. 
And that was the message sent by Quebeckers yesterday. 
And it is the message being sent by the 10 premiers. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
I presume it fits perfectly into the sovereignist agenda of the Bloc Quebecois. 
Is that not so?  
It is sovereignty and it is separation that the Reform Party is supporting here. 
We can see this clearly.  
Mr. Speaker, I support the motion for one main reason. 
All provinces are supporting the motion. 
That is why they are not supporting us. 
That is why they are acting like father knows best, like Ottawa knows best. 
That is the problem we have been facing for many years with the Liberals.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
We have a convergence of a number of things. 
It does not make any sense to demonize the provinces. 
Provinces are saying they need some other way of dealing with this matter. 
The minister thrives on this kind of conflict. 
I do not think he is particularly helpful in the way he deals with it. 
The social union, as I understand it, comes out of two things. 
The anxiety about lack of federal leadership continues to this day.  
We have some concerns about the social union and about the motion. 
They are not insurmountable things. 
I hope they would.  
There is nothing new about new. 
That is why that continues to be such an unrealistic proposal.  
He knows what we will answer to his critiques. 
We would have a huge deficit, no economic growth and so on. 
But I do not think this is the matter of debate today.  
This needs imagination and faith. 
We must stop unilateral action and we must work together as much as possible. 
Mr. Speaker, maybe the minister was speaking to his parliamentary secretary while I was speaking. 
The first dumb question of the day. 
I just explained why we would not sign the Saskatoon agreement.  
The Tories said that they would never do such a thing. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member for his talk. 
I would ask the member to reconsider that.  
The premiers added a modifying clause to the opt out clause. 
The member is aware of that proviso. 
Did that help him at all in his objection?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sorry, but the time for questions and comments has expired.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
It is very difficult to advance this issue federally.  
This morning, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs alluded to a federal government proposal. 
I would like to know the status of the federal government's proposal.  
He should table it.  
There is no substance; this is an empty proposal. 
It is a two-way street. 
Our NDP colleague who just spoke was quite reticent. 
He does not really understand what a social union is either.  
He quoted only one or two paragraphs of the agreement.  
The Saskatoon agreement does not say that, however. 
There is no automatic, universal and unquestioned right to opt out. 
A system of national standards is set up, in the end. 
Could we have a bit of information?  
That is in the document as well, and it requires consent. 
After the veto comes the right to compensation. 
But what is that? 
Could we hear from the government on that? 
Could we make progress on the matter of the social union?  
Could we not involve the parliamentarians in this House? 
We could quickly set up an all party committee. 
People in every riding ask us ``What is this social union?'' 
Does such a document actually exist? 
Again, we have been discussing this issue for a long time. 
We would like things to move forward a little. 
They do at the provincial level and they should at the federal level.  
The Reform Party's motion stems from yesterday's election in Quebec. 
Yesterday, the Reform Party was preparing for action. 
Social union is so important. 
Credibility and seriousness are required.  
It is December now. 
A government has just been elected in Quebec . 
Some outcomes will be contested, which will not change much, but still. 
Before a new cabinet is sworn in at Quebec City, weeks will go by. 
But I understand the idea. 
I feel this is important.  
December 31 is all very fine. 
Even without getting all caught up in dates, it is still important. 
A date is a date.  
Is the general store open or closed? 
Can customers enter or not? 
What is going on?  
But we cannot get any details on it. 
I feel we could have pushed a bit harder on this.  
Will Mr. Facal still be Quebec's minister of intergovernmental affairs? 
I think he will. 
Mr. Facal himself said he had had a good meeting in Edmonton. 
Could the government not demonstrate a bit more credibility?  
I seek the unanimous consent of the House to move an amendment. 
I think the Reform Party is prepared to accept this amendment. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
The provinces came up with their own proposals in mid-June. 
The federal government replied in mid-July. 
Without the leadership of the Premier of Quebec, things are much more complicated. 
Since then, an election was called in Quebec, and that also slowed things down.  
We are negotiating rather intensely. 
We are already in the post-Meech era.  
Right now, negotiations are taking place between governments. 
Again, this is simply a matter of going step by step.  
Finally, I have a question for the hon. member. 
It is very clear. 
In our opinion, the proposal on social union must go much further. 
We are also thinking about the economic union. 
Matters go even further. 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
This is the time of year when the federal budget is being prepared. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his question.  
We are indeed going further. 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
I will read the motion, to make sure it is well understood: 
It is a simple request on behalf of the official opposition. 
I believe that all members of the House see the value of this simple request.  
We in the official opposition have said that we believe this is a positive start. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Would he not agree with that?  
We have outlined that in our new Canada act. 
The premiers have outlined how to do that in their deliberations. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
They have cut billions of dollars out of the transfers in health care. 
We want to strengthen that. 
It might mean that we have to allow some flexibility under the current system.  
Obviously there is a problem. 
Our commitment is to a national health care system. 
There is no doubt about it. 
Is that truly the position it is putting forward?  
We feel it should be entertained in this House.  
The government has known about this agreement for a number of months now. 
We cannot continue to wait. 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
All Canadians must work together to ensure that there is not another referendum.  
We must show them that Canada can work. 
This is a wake-up call for the Government of Canada. 
It is time for it to be proactive. 
Today in Canada there are options and ideas on the table. 
Canadians from coast to coast share the same view. 
We have a rare opportunity for co-operation between provinces. 
The time for rhetoric and feel good statements is over. 
It is time for this government to act.  
Let us consider what we are discussing today. 
When we talk of social union, what exactly are we referring to? 
They need to be developed jointly with the provinces.  
Many people find themselves on the outside looking in. 
This is not acceptable. 
Hence we see the desire of the provinces to create programs for their specific needs.  
Again, the federal government is taking its usual slow time to respond. 
Therefore our motion is calling for a deadline. 
The Leader of the Opposition has asked the government what is the hold up. 
The government is not answering.  
Ladies and gentlemen, it is high time we took this responsibility seriously.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
We are given an opportunity for debating today a concept-social union. 
It is not a new concept. 
It sets an artificial deadline of December 31, 1998. Why? 
It urges the conclusion of an agreement with provinces, to legislate in other words. 
What we are seeing in action is executive diplomacy being exercised between heads of government. 
They are being worked out. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the points of debate raised by my colleague opposite.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for a very thoughtful question. 
On this issue we could say we will adopt the Pepin-Robarts report. 
We will apply this sort of formula.  
We would like, however, the provinces to help us on this issue. 
If it is not, why not? 
Is it something that some would accept and not others?  
As federal players we are not seeking to impose our will. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that answer but it does puzzle me. 
What has the federal government been doing? 
What has it been doing to play in the game? 
The member says that the provincial players keep changing. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the supplementary question. 
Such an important issue takes time to address. 
Imposing arbitrary time lines serves no one's best interest.  
The government is committed to a few simple principles. 
We want to continue to build a stronger, more compassionate and prosperous Canada. 
There is no magic formula to accomplish this. 
There are no simple solutions. 
We need to focus on what we can accomplish together. 
That is the kind of attitude the government brings to policy making. 
We have a vibrant democracy and robust institutions. 
It is only natural that they would grow and develop over time.  
Negotiations are still under way. 
I relish the opportunity to discuss this issue.  
There is a multitude of reasons why the Canadian federation works. 
Substantial progress has been made on a number of issues. 
And work will continue as part of the national children's agenda.  
Therefore, I cannot support this motion. 
I will spend some time talking about that reaction. 
There is a great deal we take for granted in the country. 
We sometimes forget just what we have accomplished together. 
That is not despite our differences but rather because of our differences. 
They have forced us to become creative and conciliatory. 
I should like to talk a little about the government's agenda. 
We hear about the need for change. 
There has been change, something that the opposition neglects, and a lot of it. 
Perhaps it is time Canadians knew about it.  
My colleagues have already addressed the economic successes we have seen recently. 
I will not delve too deeply into that area. 
I will now turn to the social policy side of the government's accomplishments. 
Our social safety net is a source of great pride in Canada. 
It is the essence of the values we share. 
There have been several initiatives recently which illustrate what I am talking about. 
In a similar vein the government is funding a variety of research initiatives. 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
We have shown flexibility and openness.  
We will not put an artificial deadline on such important negotiations.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a couple of questions for the hon. member. 
The member said in her response that Canada was a great country. 
Does she not read all these things? 
What would be her response to that?  
We do not criticize; we look for solutions. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Unanimity is not easily achieved in a country like Canada. 
It is hard to find unanimity.  
In matters of health care, unanimity is necessary and possible.  
This would be a mechanism where they could do more than just talk.  
There is another thing that has made the provinces so unanimous on this issue. 
There was no dispute mechanism, no interchange of information. 
The federal fist was slammed down and that was the end of the discussion.  
It is hard to imagine how the provinces could be more unanimous. 
Who else is unanimous on these issues? 
Medical colleagues throughout the country are unanimous. 
You asked for it.  
I hear from across the way that is a provincial responsibility. 
It is selective vision.  
There is outdated equipment. 
There is outdated equipment due to those cutbacks.  
There has been a drop in the level of confidence in Canada. 
Why would the federal government care about that? 
Why would the Liberal members care about that? 
It is because they themselves will get ill. 
They themselves will find themselves on waiting lists. 
They themselves will have grandparents or children left in the cold.  
The provinces are asking for something that is fairly straightforward and fairly simple. 
The procedure needed to be done quickly. 
It is not for some political juggling match. 
All throughout the world people are grappling with these problems. 
The social union is moving positively toward that end. 
Does it have to happen in 30 days? 
I have listened to my colleagues say that is too quick. 
Then I say, set a Liberal date. 
Do not listen to a Reform date. 
Set a Liberal date. 
We will be happy to be able to say there is progress being made. 
But as of now the provinces are asking where the progress is. 
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a short question for the hon. member from the Reform Party.  
The member says the deadline is December 31. 
What happens if we do not meet the deadline? 
These deadlines are artificial. 
We do our best and they do their best to make sure the country works. 
Commitments should be made and we have to work together to improve the federation. 
We have seen very little progress on this issue.  
What a powerful tool. 
What a baseball bat to have driven separatist thoughts lower on the agenda. 
There may be good reasons for not meeting that deadline. 
I am perfectly willing to listen to a Liberal timetable. 
This is trying to drive the agenda toward completion. 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, we are relatively favourable to today's Reform Party motion. 
Reformers have rarely mentioned it. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
The Canadian federation is not only based on constitutional principles. 
These programs have been gutted from within. 
As we all know, health care and education are being destroyed.  
The Canada Health Act is being violated in four of its five principles. 
While they wait they suffer and their families suffer.  
We have to speak practically about this. 
Is there agreement on this? 
That is the essence of this motion.  
We also do it from the point of cost. 
Having the provinces and the federal government doing the same thing is patently idiotic. 
Let us look at Quebec the day after the election. 
That is what Canadians from coast to coast want.  
They live in a bubble into which the rhetoric of separatist politicians is continually introduced.  
We have a narrow window of opportunity. 
Why did the French-speaking separatist politicians hate that so much? 
Because it bypassed their power and their control. 
It got a strong federalist message directly to the people.  
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
I would like the member to explain that exclusion.  
Mr. Speaker, nothing could be further from the truth. 
Over 100 aboriginal people have attended each of these meetings.  
The grassroots aboriginal people have not been heard on this issue. 
Over $8 billion is put into aboriginal affairs. 
The minister came to my riding. 
The first nations should be given the tools they need to provide for themselves.  
The aboriginal people do not want separation. 
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is a doctor and a member of parliament. 
They can use that as a tax write-off. 
What we tend to focus on is dealing with the problems. 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
This relates very clearly to the social union negotiations that were going on.  
I do not think there is any harm in having some competition''.  
They told me what an incredibly moving experience that was. 
It ran a deficit in its own budget. 
It went over its own budget. 
I think it succeeded in doing that.  
This is someone who would purport to be a prime minister. 
I say that to my colleagues in the Bloc. 
It is a clear message. 
They do not want a referendum. 
I did not see anybody strutting around. 
I watched the news. 
What they really want is government to get on with the job. 
That is a pretty clear message.  
I want to share a couple of quotes. 
This year's chair, Premier Roy Romanow, said in talking about the election: 
The premiers want to do it. 
I underline those words, the bargaining position of the provinces and the territorial governments.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
It has been ongoing for a year. 
I would hope there is a commitment that our government is negotiating. 
I know the Prime Minister is interested in seeing a deal done. 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
In discussing social union, he referred to the Meech Lake Accord. 
He ought to look back at that.  
That is what they have been pushed to.  
Yes, we want to negotiate a social union contract. 
It is all about building a team, a team called Canada. 
I believe we can do it. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
This is a very important issue. 
They are trying to design the best approach for helping governments to help Canadians.  
Young people can count on first rate education. 
These programs and services are the social union.  
We are always willing to help.  
We have tried not to allow the process to become political. 
These negotiations are and must be focused on what is right for Canadians.  
We share risks and resources and we learn from one another. 
The first we must note is that the Constitution must be respected. 
The foundations of this social union must respect the Constitution.  
That should carry on.  
Third, the ability of governments to act must be preserved. 
We can strengthen our partnership without hindering our capacity to act. 
We can avoid what the Europeans call the joint decision trap. 
We are learning how to reconcile joint action with enhanced flexibility for the provinces. 
A new framework must ensure that flexibility.  
The fifth notion is that the federation must be fair. 
Canadians are worried about the adequacy of funding for core programs. 
We must keep each other informed. 
That too is important and fundamental to the framework. 
The test of our efforts is simple. 
Are Canadians better served? 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask a question of my colleague across the way. 
The first issue was that the Constitution must be respected in all cases. 
The second question deals with his fifth point. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite for the questions.  
It is very important that we on the government side continue to do that. 
We have traditionally and historically been a party and a government of nation building. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today to speak to the motion. 
We are urging the government to do exactly that.  
I have listened to some of the pabulum coming from across the way. 
What did the government do? 
That does not mean anything. 
That is not a commitment. 
It is just rhetoric from the government.  
We think it is extraordinarily important to do this. 
Every time we raise specific questions we get empty answers. 
The member for Mississauga West said that the government believes in the social union. 
Then why does the government not sign it? 
This has been before governments for a long time. 
It does not believe in national standards. 
It believes in federal standards. 
Unfortunately, the government often is not prepared to do that.  
There was an election in Quebec yesterday. 
We know that people in Quebec do want Canada to work. 
They made that very clear in the way they voted yesterday. 
We know that the premier of Quebec has signed onto this social union. 
He wants to make this work.  
It is the federal government that is standing in the way. 
Some of them can come from provincial governments or from the private sector.  
They do it on a co-operative basis. 
That is what they did. 
They got together and brought forward this social union.  
In other words, they established national standards without being bound by federal standards.  
That seems to be the whole problem here. 
The government has had months and months to do it. 
Unfortunately that is not the way the government operates.  
One thing strikes me when we talk about issues like health care. 
That is very laudable and those are nice words. 
Health care is an area of provincial jurisdiction. 
I do not think so. 
That is not co-operative.  
Here is an area of provincial jurisdiction and what did the government do? 
We do not buy it for a minute. 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour, Lib.):
The word co-operation came up an awful lot. 
The Reform Party would have been very happy to have had a crisis in Quebec. 
The vote last night was very solid. 
It does say that Quebecers indeed do want to be a part of Canada. 
Thank goodness that the people of Quebec have not listened to the Reform Party. 
It does represent the aspirations of all the provinces. 
That is why we are very supportive of it.  
The government's actions speak louder than its words. 
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to follow up on the question.  
Has the hon. member for Medicine Hat heard similar things?  
The government is committed to staying in power. 
The Reform Party is committed to making Canada work. 
The government will do anything it can.  
If the government were really and truly concerned about Canadians, it would reverse that process. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
The provinces and territories clearly agree. 
The government failed to act. 
We saw the results yesterday. 
They have led to the duplication of effort and expense. 
An example is the millennium scholarship fund. 
The federal government slashed support for post-secondary education. 
We will slash what you do. 
Another example is the Canadian foundation for innovation. 
Again, there was no consultation with the provinces. 
It actually talked to the provinces. 
It gave them notice. 
It consulted with them. 
It made some co-operative arrangements to help our families in this country. 
The program is working.  
The way to go is with consultation and co-operation''? 
That is the way to help people in this country. 
That is what we have to do in the federal parliament.  
We have a situation which the federal parliament needs to deal with. 
They formed a ministerial council on social policy and renewal.  
This was not a big secret. 
The premiers did not do this in a closet. 
It was very open and above board. 
Where was the federal government in all of this? 
There was nothing like that.  
In August 1995 the premiers go it alone. 
The very same year this council had results. 
Again, what did the federal government do? 
Did it say: ``Let us examine these principles. 
There are some things we could add. 
We could assist with this. 
This could work well because we will bring a national perspective to it''? 
Again the federal government was nowhere to be found in the process.  
In April 1997 the council presented its option paper.  
The premiers agreed to continue to work on the framework agreement.  
In August the premiers met again. 
What happened in September? 
The Prime Minister finally said something. 
That is an alternative too''.  
That is not what is called leadership.  
I would like to ask the member two questions. 
That is what the premiers said.  
Clearly, there have to be some goals set. 
We will never get anywhere.  
There is clearly a role for the federal government in this. 
Do something that will move this ball through the goal posts''. 
That is not the way to give us a strong, co-operative federation. 
We will have to do something differently.  
With your permission, in one minute we will move to Statements by Members.  
AUDITOR GENERAL'S REPORT 
THE LATE DULCE HUSCROFT 
Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, for Dulce Huscroft, giving was a way of reaching out to people.  
We will all miss her.  
Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay-Boundary-Okanagan, Ref.):
The justice minister claims that Bill C-68 will save lives. 
Merry Christmas from the Liberal Party of Canada.  
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
These people are our parents, our friends, our neighbours, our clients and our colleagues. 
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, today, December 1 marks World AIDS Day. 
Our young people are our future. 
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Where are the criminals this legislation is supposed to stop? 
Mr. Carmen Provenzano (Sault Ste. Marie, Lib.):
Let us all do our best to follow their example. 
Let us all do our best to put an end to violence against women.  
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
I hope to see them all in 2010.  
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
AIDS has been a part of our collective reality since the early 1980s. 
But make no mistake. 
When AIDS strikes, it strikes hard and indiscriminately.  
To all those who are involved in this fight, I say a big thank you- 
The hon. member for Brossard-La Prairie.  
Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard-La Prairie, Lib.):
Special congratulations to all those who ran under the Liberal banner.  
They see their future within Canada.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
Through this democratic decision, Quebec is keeping all its future options open. 
It is still free to make its own choices.  
Bravo to the Parti Quebecois for this second victory. 
Congratulations and best wishes to Mr. Bouchard on another term in office- 
The hon. member for Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington has the floor.  
Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, Lib.):
Urban Canadians share in the benefits the agriculture and agri-food sector provides.  
The industry is Canada's third largest employer. 
Our hearts go out to farmers who are suffering extraordinary losses. 
We must act now and respond to their need. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my questions for today are for the manager of the general store.  
Quebecers are not happy with the status quo, but they would rather not separate either.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
It was the suggestion of the Prime Minister.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
He implies that he wants a social union agreement. 
But he goes to sleep when he should be awake. 
He says the wrong things at the wrong time. 
He drags his feet.  
He objects to an artificial deadline. 
What is his deadline for concluding an agreement? 
Is it the end of the year? 
Is it next month? 
Is it some other time?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Thirty days after that the federal position was tabled. 
Since that time they have been working to find the proper solution. 
Obviously they stopped the negotiations during the election period in Quebec. 
The ministers are to meet in a couple of weeks or sooner. 
He cannot learn to be- 
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am in a hurry on this issue. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We want to have good programs for all Canadians in collaboration with the provinces.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Can the Prime Minister tell Canadians what the hang-up is? 
What is the government's problem with the social union?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We are here to make sure there will be justice for all Canadians.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not think the funding is part of this arrangement.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I can see the jealously of the opposition. 
It knows we are making progress. 
All the premiers are saying we are making progress. 
The Leader of the Opposition tried to score some political points. 
It was not me who replied to him this morning. 
It was Mr. Harris, Mr. Tobin, Mr. Romanow and Mr. Charest. 
I think I am in better company.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
But talk has been going on about this for 50 years.  
Is this his idea of collaboration? 
I would like to know.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Our position is in the 1996 Throne Speech. 
We ourselves were the ones to propose- 
The hon. member for Roberval 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
However, that is not what I want to talk to him about. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, here we go again. 
The poor martyrs are weeping again. 
The humiliated are back complaining again.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
They voted against the resolution to give Quebec special status. 
The hon. member for Roberval.  
Mr. Speaker, on the subject of hypocrisy- 
I ask hon. members to choose their words very carefully. 
I would ask the hon. member for Roberval to put his question now. 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
I ask the member for Roberval to please withdraw his words.  
I will return to this problem at the end of Oral Question Period.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
A government that cuts health care is not co-operating with the provinces. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I simply want to quote what was said. 
I apologize, but the text is in English.  
The premiers want to do it''. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
It is a formula for failure. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
It is not a question of trading. 
The question of the budget is another problem. 
I said that five months ago.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
What is the government afraid of? 
We will have nothing to do with the booty policy.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Mr. Speaker, there is a problem.  
Could the government inform the House of its plans? 
Will it take action? 
Its credibility is at stake. 
The government must act and act now. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Let me ask a question of the tax collector. 
He is going to put- 
I would ask the hon. member to please go directly to her question.  
Mr. Speaker, I will tell you what is overboard. 
I would like to ask- 
The question is, why will he not obey the law? 
Why is he overcharging?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am sure Canadians feel good. 
The hon. member for Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup- 
The hon. member for Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Oh, how that must warm the spot where the finance minister's heart should be.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a heart. 
Reform is the party without heart. 
What does not vary are the longer term trends.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the auditor general's observations are based on 1995 figures . 
And improve it we did. 
Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the problem is worse than that. 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
We have given it a three-year transition.  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is nothing but waste. 
But it does not end there. 
Who is looking after the taxpayer?  
Mr. Speaker, I have already answered that question.  
This was a problem. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, we are all aware of the plight of AIDS victims.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, today marks the 11th World AIDS Day. 
It is to that end that we have adopted a Canada-wide strategy against AIDS. 
This is in the public interest.  
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
What is the strategy to combat this terrible disease among young people?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We are targeting youth in particular, aiming toward prevention through education and instruction. 
We are investing in research. 
We are supporting community efforts. 
We are focusing this year on youth.  
I find this language to be unparliamentary. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
I will make honourable amends, if necessary.  
Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask you to check the blues first. 
Is it possible to ask you to do so? 
The Prime Minister provoked it.  
I ask him once again to withdraw the words he spoke.  
Unfortunately, I cannot comply with your request. 
It goes against my principles.  
I consider that I have been unfairly treated compared to the Prime Minister.  
It is not with great pleasure that I say the following: 
And Mr. Gauthier having withdrawn ] 
SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE STUDY OF SPORT IN CANADA 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
The article lists a number of items from the report.  
Today in the Ottawa Citizen the debate continues on the report. 
Whatever the case may be, there are leakers among us.  
We might as well openly leak reports.  
I am faced with this situation with my colleagues. 
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
I can say two things. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
We would at least know that as a first proposition.  
There are two things. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
It is a pattern that is destroying this place.  
It does not just have to do with committees. 
Then we can get back to being a parliament for a change.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of the House leader of the NDP. 
That is not the way to come to consensus. 
It is a problem here with parliament where we were elected to serve.  
I find that there is no prima facie case for a point of privilege.  
We have the Leader of the Opposition who is absolutely opposed. 
The spokesperson for the New Democratic Party is opposed. 
We all agree and yet these things still go on.  
I find that there is no prima facie case for a point of privilege.  
This is where they should be made.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my point of order has to do with question period.  
This is not a soccer game here for God's sake.  
I can be as partisan as the next person. 
I must confess a collective self-interest in the matter. 
Who gets pushed off at the end of question period? 
I do not think we can tolerate this situation any longer.  
Mr. Speaker, I plead with you to rethink your own tactics in this regard. 
There is a time and a place for this. 
Today was a perfect example of that. 
When people watch this on television they cannot tell who is yelling. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
There should be some consequence for the type of behaviour we have seen displayed.  
Perhaps today was an aberration, but I believe that there has been deterioration. 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
I concur with the comments of both of the last two members who spoke. 
We have seen this all fall.  
Look, for example, at what happened today. 
Something has to be done to bring decorum back to this House.  
We are collectively part of this institution and it is time we changed this situation.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
I do agree that this was not one of our better days. 
I do not want to say it was the worst one we have ever seen. 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
I have asked that no reference be made to the hon. member for Roberval. 
I do not want any further reference to the hon. member for Roberval.  
The hon. member for Edmonton North.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
There was nothing unparliamentary in what I said. 
I am not sure there is any wisdom in that.  
I am getting a pretty good picture of where we are going. 
This was a bad question period. 
You have come to the same conclusion today. 
I would like to convene before the question period tomorrow. 
I see that most of the House leaders are here now. 
We will address this problem together and we will solve this problem.  
The House leaders are here, except for of course my colleague who is not here. 
He will be informed and he will come to be with us also.  
If there is another point of order I will listen to it.  
Does the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve have another point of order?  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I would like another element to be added to the debate. 
We will leave the matter as it stands.  
REQUEST FOR TABLING OF DOCUMENT 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
As far as I know he did not quote directly from the document. 
ALLOTTED DAY-SOCIAL PROGRAMS 
The House resumed consideration of the motion; and of the amendment.  
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with a colleague.  
Members of the House deal with many different issues on a day to day basis. 
The government has always supported the initiative from the start. 
Nor should the House support it. 
Negotiations are still ongoing and we must resist the temptation to rush recklessly forward. 
We lose sight of how we all benefit from federalism.  
It is a work in progress. 
We have a solid foundation, but we must keep building.  
That is exactly what the government is doing. 
The answer is straightforward. 
We are negotiating with our partners. 
That is how the government operates. 
That is certainly the approach we are taking toward renewing the federation. 
The government has worked very hard over the past five years to improve our country. 
A number of our initiatives have been introduced on a variety of different fronts. 
I am proud to say that the world has taken notice. 
A good economy goes a long way in promoting a strong and unified Canada.  
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Humber-St. 
The opposition is giving us quite an accolade.  
Social programs are very important. 
That involves citizen engagement. 
That cannot be done in a 31 day period as the opposition is telling us.  
I do not think that those are the original intentions or wishes of the opposition. 
That is not what this is all about. 
We will still need a lot of flexibility over time. 
We have to engage our citizens in any such discussion.  
Canadians across the country have already thought about it. 
They do not want it. 
The provinces have spoken. 
I do not think there is much more to say. 
Canadians know what they need. 
They know what they want. 
They know what they deserve.  
I will conclude where I began. 
The Reform Party has given us quite an accolade. 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the member opposite. 
I cannot believe that the member rapped about 31 days. 
We are not talking about 31 days. 
The hon. member is quite right. 
This is a process that does take time and has taken time. 
Mr. Speaker, I just have a quick question for the member. 
Are they expressing concern about the speed of this? 
In his experience are they asking for a specific deadline?  
Mr. Speaker, that question actually focuses the debate and the discussion much better. 
I am pleased to answer it. 
That is not the substance of what we are trying to do. 
The Reform Party should learn that and understand it once and for all.  
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Polls indicate that the majority of Quebecers believe in Canada. 
However they have made it very clear that Confederation must be rejuvenated. 
This will not be an easy task.  
The federal government has avoided it for over 30 years. 
In 1980 Rene Levesque took Quebec to the polls in a bout on sovereignty. 
Still nothing was done to solve the problem. 
Accords were appended at Meech Lake and in Charlottetown. 
Worse still, neither of these agreements responded to the grassroots voices of Canadians.  
Canadians rightfully rejected the Meech Lake and Charlottetown accords. 
I am proud of our record in this regard.  
Inevitably in 1995 the Parti Quebecois launched a second vote on separation. 
Canadians were loath to sleep because of these assurances. 
Why the history lesson? 
They have never addressed the core problems of federal-provincial responsibility. 
It had no affect on the desire of sovereignists to separate.  
We have proposed substantive and workable change in the Canadian federation.  
More important, we provided 20 proposals for a new confederation. 
To date the government has taken no action on any of these recommendations. 
It is not specifically designed for Quebec, nor should it be. 
We must establish a framework for open discussion and equal footing.  
It has helped to drive British Columbia to the brink of financial ruin. 
They are critically understaffed. 
But the federal government is equally culpable. 
All provinces are not the same. 
The government is focused on the December 31 date. 
I hear it over and over again.  
This is the beginning. 
We are saying it has to get the framework in place. 
Obviously the details would be ironed out down the road. 
We have to make it happen and there has to be a target date. 
It is very achievable.  
Historically the federal government has guarded this right zealously. 
The motion today provides that opportunity.  
It would create a mechanism to constructively move this process forward. 
It would give Newfoundland fair and even footing with dealing with Ottawa. 
This motion does all these things from a position of equality and openness. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
It is a motion to set in place the next referendum in Quebec. 
It is impossible for the people to meet by December 31. 
It is an artificial date. 
It will not happen. 
Everyone is off over Christmas. 
It is totally fraudulent and ridiculous and cynical. 
How cynical can we be. 
There is no open discussion. 
There is no equal footing among the provinces at this time. 
That is what will happen.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his comments. 
People are focused on this very narrow part, the date. 
I am not stuck on the date. 
I am stuck on this country. 
They sent us a clear message. 
We still have status quo. 
It has not changed. 
That is what this is all about. 
I read the motion that we set the framework up. 
But if the date should be changed let us change it. 
We are not stuck on the date. 
Let us change it and make it happen.  
This is a negotiation or discussion with the provinces. 
How can this House commit the provinces to a date? 
Do we not have to consult our partners? 
This thing will be a negotiation among partners. 
If we are stuck on that date, change it. 
We have been sitting for years in the House with the status quo. 
It is not working.  
I have no problem with that at all. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
The motion reads as follows: 
It is very important for this House to consider the issue of social union.  
What does it come down to? 
It just is not on''.  
This is typical of the attitude of members opposite. 
Look at the Canada Health Act. 
That is the basis upon which the unilateral federal standards are imposed on the provinces. 
It is not a radical concept. 
This is very important for Quebec, as this is one of its traditional demands. 
I would ask that the members of this House support this Reform motion.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sorry, but this is not a point of order.  
Mr. Speaker, perhaps I can deal with both issues.  
That is what is going on.  
It has a role to play.  
We have listened to the concerns of various members opposite. 
We want to be co-operative in this.  
That is all we are saying.  
This does not come arbitrarily from the official opposition. 
It comes from the premiers themselves. 
That is where the idea came from, not from ourselves.  
We are not stuck. 
We do not want to split hairs here. 
We are prepared to be flexible. 
Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):
How do we translate all of this into action? 
It focuses on the goal of helping Canada's children. 
In all the world's large federations, the national government has this authority. 
This was how the government promoted equality of opportunity for all Canadians.  
In fact, we would not have the national social safety net.  
The key must be accountability to Canadians for results.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
That is my first question.  
Does he have a better idea? 
Does he have another deadline in mind, or no deadline at all? 
Did he just want this to go on indefinitely as it has for 30 years?  
The negotiations need to be permitted to continue without this kind of external imposition.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would invite the hon. member to consult Hansard . 
I think this is a very important topic. 
That is a statement made yesterday by the chairman.  
Let us take a Liberal premier of Atlantic Canada, Brian Tobin of Newfoundland. 
I think we are making good progress with the national government''.  
He is not demanding a December 31 deadline.  
I have two problems with this. 
Let the process go on. 
They are responsible people. 
I heard the member talking about the ability of the provinces to manage these programs. 
That is a position I endorse. 
We are the federal House of Commons. 
I do not share that view.  
Do they need to change? 
Economic circumstances have changed. 
People's mobility has changed. 
That is a given.  
I absolutely endorse that. 
I do not have any difficulty with those positions.  
I also want those things considered and respected.  
I think there are pan-Canadian issues here. 
He wanted to talk about services, as I heard from the Conservatives. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
We did not schedule this day. 
It appeared this way on the parliamentary calendar.  
This timing is a complete red herring. 
It is a target date. 
It is a very similar wording they use in their own declarations.  
He has been here for 35 years. 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
The provinces want more money invested in health. 
In the health field, the administrative infrastructures are a provincial jurisdiction. 
I will give an example, this time in post-secondary education. 
The federal government reduced its contribution considerably. 
At the present time, there is a crying need at the university level. 
It does not meet the real on-site priorities.  
But why reach an agreement before December 31? 
That seems laudable and very reasonable to me. 
However, the federal government is not co-operating. 
We hope it will wake up in time. 
We support the motion that was put forward today by the Reform Party.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House divided on the amendment, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the amendment defeated. 
The next question is on the main motion.  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the motion defeated.  
Hon. Marcel Masse (President of the Treasury Board, Lib.) moved: 
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed to the motion will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
(Motion deemed adopted and bill read the first time) 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The members of our party will vote yea to this motion.  
The answer is no, you will not count.  
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
Shall clause 2 carry?  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Hon. Marcel Masse (President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):
He answered a question from the hon. member of the Reform Party. 
In what way are these statements similar to those tabled in the two previous years? 
I would like him to elaborate on that.  
I think that about covers it.  
But do they reflect those of two years ago?  
Perhaps the President of the Treasury Board could answer the question.  
Shall clause 2 carry?  
All those in favour of clause 2 will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.
