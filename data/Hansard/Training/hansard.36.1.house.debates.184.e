Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):
Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, Questions Nos. 138 and 139 will be answered today. 
Question No. 138- Mr. John Cummins: 
I am informed by the departments of health and national defence as follows: 
Of these, two were potentially associated with alcohol use.  
There has been no revision to the product monograph relating specifically to suicide. 
In these cases the drug must be discontinued''. 
Question No. 139- Mr. Jim Pankiw: 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF MINISTER OF FINANCE 
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
That is what makes me proud.  
This budget has focused very clearly on something I know a great deal about.  
I do not speak only as a physician. 
I hear other members shouting. 
It has been given that acute care. 
Patients will become stronger and be able over time to extend their lives. 
This is the sustainability component of the budget that is key.  
Things have changed in Canada.  
We have an aging population and brand new technologies. 
These things need to be taken care of, and not just with money. 
We must find ways in which we can use technology appropriately and wisely. 
This evolution of the system is extremely important. 
This is something that Mr. Evans recently said very carefully. 
I am stressing the $1.4 billion. 
That will make the system work better. 
It will make a better system for us. 
It is about allowing people to monitor what we are doing.  
We have talked about acute care. 
We have talked about the rehabilitation of the system. 
We also need to know that health care is more than just hospitals.  
This will start to make those changes.  
We need to talk about prevention. 
The new money going into the prenatal nutrition program is very important money. 
We will look at how to fix the outcome of low birth weight babies. 
It will also inject some much needed morale into the system. 
That is why nobody wants to go into nursing any more. 
It will give them the skills and tools- 
Did the hon. member indicate that she was splitting her time?  
Then her time has expired, I am sorry to advise.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
It has gone from emergency down to urgency. 
What does she say to that?  
Mr. Speaker, I did not say that the system is in good shape. 
I said that the system was in need of urgent care.  
The medical association is saying that the system is in need of good acute care. 
We go to the emergency for good acute care. 
That is what the budget is doing. 
That will not resolve the problem. 
As a physician the hon. member should know that very well.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Were they asleep during cabinet meetings? 
Poverty is a very clear indicator of health. 
Productivity is one issue that we need to look at. 
Those are some of the built-in issues. 
A budget does not stand alone. 
The issues that we are talking about are not in isolation from everything else. 
Economic and social issues are interdependent on each other.  
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
This is the most substantial one-time investment ever made by the government.  
The budget is good news for Ontario. 
This will benefit provinces such as Ontario.  
Transfers to Ontario will grow significantly over the next five years. 
They have that flexibility.  
Mr. Speaker, I know that would be of great interest to yourself.  
However, we need not be obsessed with paying down the debt. 
The 1999 budget is based on a fact that applies the world over. 
Technology is changing at a phenomenal rate, before our very eyes. 
It is for this reason that I am proud and very pleased to support it.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
The elimination of the 3% surtax amounts to some considerable savings. 
By my calculations every millionaire in this country will save $8,000. 
That figure resonates with me and this is why.  
The best illustration I can give the member is my next door neighbour. 
He will be 47 when the mines close and will have spent 25 years underground. 
He will not get a pension. 
I know of the unfortunate circumstances with Devco in his riding. 
There were a number of measures announced.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, this budget is a disappointment. 
It raises ire and promises the worst.  
There is nothing for the unemployed in this budget. 
According to the forecasts, the government will be taking $4.9 billion from their pockets. 
There have been no tax cuts. 
This means that the tax burden of the middle class remains excessively heavy.  
But let us not forget that this benefit only applies to low income families. 
He is a technocrat.  
And then he sheds tears and laments the plight of children who live in poverty. 
Do members know what this sort of behaviour is called? 
We know this is not true.  
Now, the federal government is going to link up public health laboratories. 
So as to be better able to impose its own priorities. 
As soon as they have any money at all, they create another bureaucracy.  
It carries out new studies and collects more statistics.  
But the provinces know where the problems lie. 
They know that already. 
And now it expects us to thank it for giving $1 billion back. 
Ottawa gives us numbers, paper and bureaucrats. 
-in an environment of health care restructuring; identify approaches to retrain- 
-the existing workforce; and attract new members to the profession.  
I am thinking of the telehomecare, telehealth program. 
That is what the arrangement was, as we now know.  
His whole career has been marked by such actions.  
On the social union, consultations and a a one-year notice are provided for. 
The whole method of funding health care has been changed. 
We only need a few figures to illustrate this. 
That is billion, not million. 
This kind of attitude is disappointing, appalling and sad. 
I think he has achieved his goal this time. 
That is strong medicine. 
It is a short term solution. 
That is the sort of nonsensical reasoning of the government and the Minister of Finance.  
Let us have a look at regional development. 
They will agree to anything. 
This sort of attitude is shameful.  
That is the only word for it.  
We know that surpluses will magically materialize next spring. 
He knows how to count, we know that. 
He is a good counter, but we do not have the right accounting book. 
This is because, every year, the minister indulges in a game of cooking the books. 
Last year, the Bloc Quebecois said the surplus would be at least $2.5 billion. 
We were told ``No, no, no, this is wrong''. 
Well, in October, it turned out to be $3.5 billion. 
This is the reality. 
The minister uses the same trick every year.  
So, surpluses will appear once again and what will the government do? 
It will set up new trusts. 
Perhaps in municipal affairs, road infrastructures or whatever.  
Things are becoming more and more clear with this government. 
I have nothing against their wanting to build a Canada in their own image. 
I have known for a long time that Quebec has no place in there. 
The Prime Minister told us that the Constitution's general store was closed. 
They are telling us: ``You will comply. 
You will be pleased to get equalization payments. 
You have more employment insurance, more unemployment insurance''.  
Quebec's motto is ``I remember''. 
We called them ``the 74 nitwits''. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
The Bloc members complain about everything and anything. 
What the hon. member forgets to mention is the equalization.  
Sadly, Quebec is one of those less prosperous provinces. 
Why is it less prosperous? 
That is about half of all equalization. 
In fact it will allow the province of Quebec to balance its budget.  
The member conveniently forgets the equalization. 
The member would know this if he had listened.  
We do not want charity, we want productive investments.  
They said ``Let us be fair and have everyone contribute''. 
This is their idea of fairness. 
In the meantime, they make money.  
In any case, I do not believe you for one moment.  
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
He uses a lot of fine language. 
He used the word ``hypocritical''.  
Twenty-three per cent of the funding is for 23% of the population. 
That is not hypocritical. 
My colleague has talked about fair play. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
He did not refer to a specific person or individual but to a circumstance. 
It is important that that point be made.  
Why not in research and development? 
Why not in procurement of goods and services? 
Why not in regional development? 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour, Lib.):
The 1999 federal budget is good news for the people of Guelph-Wellington. 
I sent a copy of the responses to my colleague the Minister of Finance. 
This is a health care budget. 
There the federal government agreed to increase funding for health care. 
The federal government has upheld its end of the bargain. 
I am confident that the provinces will do the same.  
The era of federal-provincial struggles is over. 
It established a process of dispute avoidance and resolution. 
I believe that this atmosphere of co-operation will continue into the new millennium.  
How will this health care money benefit the residents of Guelph-Wellington? 
Finally, it will focus on prevention and ways to promote community health.  
Once again the federal government has delivered.  
Last year the federal government initiated a program of progressive tax cuts. 
However, we do not believe that we should throw caution to the wind. 
This money will benefit the University of Guelph in a very real way.  
Larry Milligan at the University of Guelph has been very involved in this field.  
Our method is working. 
I am happy to report this program has been twice as successful as projected. 
Canada leads the G-7 in job growth.  
This budget reflects the balanced approach for which the Liberal government is known. 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Ontario will receive nearly 50% of the new money. 
The member for Guelph-Wellington must be very happy with that. 
Quebec will receive less than 10% of this new money.  
So, I put my question to the member for Guelph-Wellington. 
Mr. Speaker, this troubles and saddens me. 
They do not care about the rest of Canadians. 
I have seen it on a consistent basis day after day in this Chamber. 
They truly should be ashamed of themselves.  
Because they care, they have compassion and they have humanity. 
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
How is the budget good for these children?  
We have increased that amount to poor families. 
There is no doubt that children in bad straits come from low income families. 
We have made a provision for that in this budget.  
Surely the people from Dartmouth will benefit from all these things in the budget. 
I know they will.  
Mr. Jerry Pickard (Chatham-Kent Essex, Lib.):
We have changed that process dramatically. 
Today we are very transparent. 
We are very open in consulting Canadians. 
The process was to eliminate the deficit and get our house in order. 
That is not frivolous. 
That has happened because of serious careful planning which has made a huge difference.  
That was not quite accurate. 
That was a quote from a former prime minister. 
Investing in the social economic side of things is another important issue. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
I will give the government a passing grade on getting the budget into the black. 
The government is certainly capable of doing much better. 
It has barely received a passing grade. 
The member for Guelph-Wellington talked of knowledge based industries. 
Those knowledge based industries will not hire people. 
What on earth did they do for knowledge based industries then? 
The public knows what they did. 
Today the public is not saying the same thing. 
The public has returned this government with two solid majorities. 
They should listen to the public.  
Mr. Maurice Godin (Chateauguay, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to talk to that point. 
We have different economic situations across the country. 
In general the wealthier help the other provinces. 
This has been the goal and the rule of the country. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
They thought it was a good budget; I thought it was a distasteful budget.  
Guess who it is? 
Now we know at least who the Saturday night guest speaker will be.  
No one is surprised.  
I thought Brian Mulroney was kind of a wild and woolly right winger. 
Compared to the Minister of Finance he sounds like some kind of economic piker. 
He tried to move the agenda to the right but he failed.  
I know my friends thought at the time this seemed a bit perplexing. 
The term was actually there. 
There was one reference to the fact that we have homeless people in the country. 
The finance minister did mention it. 
Here is what he had to say in 1990: 
Was it this finance minister?  
It was this finance minister.  
He didn't say that?  
He mentioned homelessness in his budget. 
What did he about it? 
There was not a red cent toward housing.  
They were disgusted and dismayed. 
I do not blame them. 
Most of them have already. 
They are not even here.  
There is something else that is strange about the budget. 
The Minister of Finance should be arrested and charged. 
I will tell you why, Mr. Speaker. 
He was a broadcaster in Ottawa. 
Every major issue has been out in the public domain for weeks and weeks. 
He should be charged by the RCMP for leaking his own budget. 
Why did he do that? 
Why did the Minister of Finance leak his own budget?  
I will tell the House. 
When the Conservatives were in office they had guts. 
They actually believed in certain things. 
I do not believe in them. 
Most Canadians do not believe in them, but the Tories believed in them. 
They said the GST was good for Canada. 
They did not leak it out.  
There was a standing ovation for that one.  
They announced it during the budget. 
If it does not fly then they will not say it. 
If it is popular then they will say it. 
That is not what leadership is. 
That is not what happened.  
What are you saying, do not consult Canadians?  
I was part of the consultation process. 
It is called prebudget consultations. 
That was their task. 
Not a single individual said that the priorities should be major tax cuts. 
We talked to hundreds of people. 
They did not say that. 
They said address these serious issues, including health care.  
None of them said they wanted this budget. 
They said they wanted a whole bunch of advances on important fronts. 
What did this Minister of Finance do? 
They did not get anything out of it. 
Their family did not get anything out of it. 
There is nothing in it for them. 
I know one guy who is really happy. 
Bob Cleghorn is a happy camper.  
I will tell the House who is not a happy camper. 
They did not get a single cent from this budget. 
What kind of a government is that? 
It is survival of the fittest. 
It is based on the key role of the individual in society.  
Were the homeless recognized in this budget? 
Were the people who today are looking for work recognized? 
No, they were ignored.  
Let us identify a single group of young people. 
It is very sad.  
He said this was a health care budget. 
Let us ask the president of the Canadian Medical Association. 
He said it had moved it from being an emergency situation to a urgent situation.  
He acknowledges that over the next number of years the government is to restore funding. 
We had a quality health care system. 
President Clinton tried to emulate it but he lost that battle. 
He said look at what Canadians have.  
It was the best of being Canadian. 
What did this government do? 
We cut too deeply. 
We have destroyed the system''. 
Thirty per cent of health care funding today is in the private sector. 
Nobody talks about this because they are embarrassed to talk about it. 
Let us take a look at what this will do. 
At the same time inflation is moving along and the population is increasing.  
This is almost unbelievable. 
Nothing else was recognized.  
I will bet most people thought that would happen.  
This is the only initiative taken by this government. 
That is not all. 
Good grief, I wish I had a longer speech today. 
We know that the issue of homelessness is a national tragedy. 
We have to work at this. 
We live in the second largest country in the world. 
There are trees from one end of this country to the other. 
We have land everywhere. 
To have a housing crisis you have to really work at this. 
Our government has somehow been able to do that, to create a housing crisis.  
He answered that it was obviously housing. 
It is not that it was not encouraged. 
Create jobs and confront a major social issue.  
The mayors of all the major cities got together and asked what they could do. 
We should put 1% of this year's budget into housing. 
That would provide leadership on this issue.  
But he did not. 
Let's not forget the provinces have an important responsibility.  
There is much to talk about in terms of this budget. 
One thing symbolizes this budget. 
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
Had the member taken the time to read the budget he would have known that. 
Does the hon. member not think we should have done all of those things?  
Therefore, it is not as though this were some kind of a flippant response.  
It is clawed back by the provincial government and the member should know that.  
I know what she is going to hear. 
Should I or they be thankful for this little tiny handout? 
Boy, there is Ms. Trickle Down herself. 
They want some trickle up economics, not trickle down economics.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
It means more people on welfare. 
There is nothing on social housing. 
That is the kind of measure we need.  
We thought we would now see some obvious recognition of this imbalance.  
The gap between those who have and those who have not was increasing. 
Was that playing field improved, or was it tilted even further? 
It was actually tilted even further. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend's question. 
His figures were accurate. 
I did some checking locally. 
My friend's suggestion is worth looking at and has considerable merit.  
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
We have every reason to be proud.  
The minister delivered and brilliantly so. 
This budget meets the concerns of my constituents in Laval West and of all Canadians. 
Let me mention a few figures to better show the scope of this phenomenon. 
In 1981, 9.6% of the population was 65 or older. 
This means that one in five Canadians will be at least 65 years old. 
Unfortunately, for instance, they lose their autonomy and their mobility. 
More gerontologists will therefore be needed.  
Long term care is more appropriate for this age group. 
Pensions, for instance, will represent an increasingly large component of federal budgets. 
This trend is well reflected in our 1999 budget. 
Specialized social services were provided.  
Programs must once again keep pace with changing demographics. 
Our government has realized how important this is. 
We have started taking steps and are even ahead.  
Regarding the health services, the minister has done well. 
In addition, $1.4 billion will be injected into medical research. 
Quebec will not get as much, they protest. 
He can transfer less under a given program in order to transfer more under another. 
That is not bad for a province with 24% of the Canadian population.  
The figures do not lie. 
Quebec, like the rest of Canada, comes out a winner with this budget. 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
I do not think the word ``nervy'' is unparliamentary.  
I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
The word ``nervy'' in French is an insult, and I reject this insult. 
I would ask the member to use more polite language with me.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Really it is more a question of debate than a point of order.  
There are many synonyms.  
In any case, the important thing is why I am saying this. 
We need to step back a little. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I ask the hon. member to put her question.  
In 1994, Quebec was getting 34% of the funds from that plan. 
How can the hon. member explain that this government, after shedding tears over- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The member for Laval West will have an equal amount of time for her response.  
Where the member talks about changes made in the transfers, I talk about fairness. 
Canada is a country where we talk about fairness.  
Fairness is as important between individuals as it is between provinces.  
With three wealthy provinces.  
Take Quebec for example, where the population- 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to be able to continue. 
I did not interrupt the hon. member when she spoke.  
That is what fairness is all about in Canada. 
That is what being a Liberal is all about.  
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia, Lib.):
Average Canadians support the measures in the budget. 
It is about balance. 
First, let us look at health care. 
This budget goes a long way to securing that access.  
Last year, however, we began the process of introducing broad based tax relief. 
This year, I am happy to say, we have built on that.  
It increases the basic personal exemption to $7,131 for every Canadian taxpayer. 
It also enriches and broadens the child tax benefit by a further $300 million. 
The best news is that this is only the beginning. 
What do these tax measures mean for the average Manitoban? 
Even the members of the Reform Party have to agree to that.  
It will be strengthened by an additional $50 million annually.  
We will not stray from this course. 
The national debt is falling and will continue to fall in the future. 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
I am looking for an answer to the following questions:
Once again, the federal Liberal ministers and members from Quebec were not there. 
I can assure the hon. member of that.  
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
This is their sixth budget.  
This is only the sixth year that we have been in power in Ottawa. 
Things are getting better.  
It is all gone. 
When we came here we did not have the luxury of surpluses. 
Now we have modest surpluses. 
That is better than what we had six years ago.  
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
We now have gangs roaming the streets of Winnipeg. 
We have one million poor children in this country. 
The members of the government ask us to look at the demographics. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question from the hon. member. 
The hon. member touched on a critical issue. 
They exist widely in my city of Winnipeg and in the province of Manitoba. 
We did not cut the budget of that department. 
But there are strategies laid out in this budget. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Trial balloons were being floated constantly by the finance minister. 
That is not my comment. 
I do not see where that is embracing the budget. 
Let us deal with a couple of very pertinent issues. 
The budget is heralded as the health care budget. 
Is that incredible, incroyable? 
Canadians are smarter than that. 
They do not think so, but I know Canadians will see through their shell game.  
There is a surplus today. 
What is the real number?  
We do not know what the surplus is for 1998-99. 
Let us get back to health care. 
The numbers do not add up.  
Why did the government not make it 10 years instead of 5 years? 
Why only five years? 
Why did it not deal with 10 years? 
Let us talk about some other areas of serious importance in my constituency. 
That area obviously is agriculture. 
Unfortunately it will come back to haunt the government.  
Short term gain for long term pain continues. 
That to me is a deficiency in the budget.  
I am in constant touch with that constituency.  
We sit in the House every day and talk about the Sea King helicopters. 
We talk about military equipment that is 30 and 35 years old. 
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened to some of the debate today. 
The member lists many other areas in which he would have wanted spending. 
I do not understand how the government can take the GST as its own policy.  
We would not like to see a deficit. 
What is the surplus? 
Is it $7 million or $14 billion? 
The government has hidden the surplus. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
They do not want to give credit where credit is due.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
The understanding in the federal government is somewhat lax or missing. 
It does not necessarily want to deal with the issues that should be dealt with.  
We talk about deficits and we talk about spending. 
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
Mr. Speaker, it is nice to respond to the budget. 
No one here knows what the real numbers are.  
No one knows and if they do know they are not going to tell us. 
We mentioned specifically the free trade agreement. 
We mention the GST from time to time on this side of the House. 
Is that not the Liberal way? 
Mr. Speaker, I see you nodding in agreement. 
You were there and you fought that election. 
You know on the basis of how you fought. 
This has been called the health budget. 
We have to be careful what the Liberals call it. 
Thousands are leaving this country to seek employment.  
The theme is health care. 
The Liberals are bragging about putting $11.5 billion in. 
But the timing is the thing, is it not?  
Mr. Speaker, have you ever heard of that type of fund before? 
It is a clever word game, a third party fund is being created. 
It will be next year and the year after.  
He is very clever. 
The timing will work out perfectly for the finance minister.  
That is exactly what the finance minister has done. 
He immediately extracted almost $6 billion out of health care. 
In Atlantic Canada we call that backward speaking. 
That is absolutely bizarre. 
Now the Liberals are standing up and bragging about it.  
There will be no change in waiting lines or in emergency wards. 
People are still going to be waiting. 
They still will not receive the care they should be receiving.  
An analogy would be a house with a leaking roof. 
We are talking about maintenance. 
Would it take a rocket scientist to figure this guy out? 
He is the Houdini of finance. 
I go back to the old Mark Twain expression ``lies, damned lies and statistics''. 
This minister fits into the very first category mentioned.  
Mr. Speaker, I apologize to Mark Twain.  
The hon. member will have to do more than apologize to Mark Twain. 
I would ask him to do so at once.  
In an article in yesterday's Financial Post she calls it ``fiscal fairy tales''. 
Is that better, Mr. Speaker? 
This is his sixth in a row, fiscal fairy tale.  
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will try to keep it concise.  
I listened to both of the members' speeches and found them quite humourous.  
The hon. member is quoting newspaper articles and I want to quote one. 
The New Brunswick finance minister was not quite that complimentary. 
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Get out of my sight''. 
No. They are going to placate this government. 
Sometimes in this business we have to eat our own words. 
I would love to see the finance minister do that. 
This is a man who controls the nation's finances, he and the Prime Minister. 
Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk-Brant, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member was talking about numbers earlier.  
Could he also tell us what the budget deficit is today?  
This budget is our attempt to try to deal with those dramatic numbers.  
Mr. Speaker, I have an institutional memory. 
I think that sometimes comes in handy in this place. 
What goes up comes down sometimes.  
Prior to that it was lower. 
But back in New Brunswick this very day it is very high. 
It is very high in Atlantic Canada. 
I wish that we were experiencing the prosperity of southern Ontario. 
Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am sharing my time with the member for Waterloo-Wellington.  
The financial position of the territories and the provinces has also improved. 
Economic and social priorities seem to concentrate on one entity, employment. 
Without a strong economy we do not have a strong society and vice versa. 
We must invest in both sides of this relationship. 
That is what our government has done. 
We have given our economy a boost as well as giving Canadians a boost.  
This money will be available this year and for the next three years. 
Jobs depend on research.  
This will make Canada the most connected country in the world.  
This budget supports the commercialization of knowledge and innovation. 
This is where investment in knowledge bears its fruit.  
Now to deal with health care. 
This is very important to Canadians and to this government. 
It is a win-win situation. 
Here is how we are doing it.  
This is where our government differs from past governments. 
We care about all these things and we are doing something about it. 
It does not get much better than this. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
We are from the same generation. 
We have to win these elections. 
Betty Crocker's Cook Book should be renamed Paul Cookers' Crock Book.  
That is what politics is all about.  
It always has and always will.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
I made the point before that we will give this budget barely a passing grade. 
It is nice to see the books in the black. 
It is not a problem.  
Let us draw it into perspective. 
Mr. Speaker, I am on the defence committee. 
I am the senior member of that committee. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
I begin by outlining the strong fiscal outlook contained in the budget. 
Employment growth remains strong. 
That is truly historic and worthy of note.  
Reducing our debt is an investment in our future. 
Our goal is to put the debt to GDP ratio on a steady downward track. 
Last year that was down to 27 cents. 
Again, it is truly remarkable. 
I turn to our health care system. 
This represents the largest single new investment our government has ever made. 
I take this opportunity to fully outline what this means. 
This is truly good news for Canadians wherever they live.  
Budget '99 sets aside $240 million over the next two years to support this proposal. 
That is truly important to note.  
For Canadians this means a better standard of living and a better quality of life.  
This positions Canada and all Canadians for the 21st century. 
This helps to secure the future for our children and our children's children. 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Why are we so stagnant here if things are so rosy?  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the question. 
That is very important to note.  
The hon. member spoke about the G-7. 
We are the envy of the G-7 in terms of what we are doing. 
I think that is very important to note.  
This we do in the interests of all Canadians.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Let me talk about that balance a bit. 
So I will ask the hon. member a serious question, not rhetoric. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the question.  
We have taken an approach that is balanced, equitable and fair. 
We have done a very good job at that.  
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
That is a realistic budget.  
He spoke very highly of this budget.  
Mr. Speaker, I know Bill Davis. 
I very much value and respect his opinion. 
He knows what he is talking about.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to stand and talk about this budget.  
I honestly, truly hoped that I would be able to do that.  
The Liberals said they had an excuse for cutting health. 
That would arch over my questions to my Liberal colleagues.  
Members have heard that a lot. 
I hope they will hear it a lot more.  
Today Canada is number five in the world. 
We have plunged from two to five as a per cent of GDP. 
That is the Liberal record.  
We are so close to the bottom we are almost the anchor. 
That is the Liberal legacy.  
What will be the balanced result of that? 
The balance is pretty simple. 
I have chosen three big groups.  
With the budget it has moved from emergence to urgent. 
``This is a band-aid''.  
The amounts are not sufficient''. 
This is not a political statement. 
This is a statement by somebody who deals with the patient.  
She did not mention that but I will.  
Would my colleagues agree? 
Would my Liberal colleagues agree? 
They made a prebudget submission. 
The first thing concerned funding. 
They also asked for $3 billion over the next three years for the damage. 
It was a C-minus. 
The Liberals did only one of those three things.  
The CMA asked for a complete tobacco policy. 
I give the Liberals an F. 
The CMA wanted the non-taxable health benefits maintained. 
Who was totally missed in this budget? 
Not one penny for the left out hepatitis C individuals.  
I would like to make another little announcement today. 
Next week that is exactly what the victims and I are doing. 
That is what is left for the patient lying in the emergency room. 
There were so many other choices. 
So many wasteful things could have been scrubbed.  
I am going to make one last prediction. 
This budget could have been so much better. 
The hon. member of course has five minutes of questions and comments. 
I think I can get about a minute in at this point. 
Then I want to go to Statements by Members. 
The hon. member for Mississauga South has about 40 seconds to get it in.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
That is not comprehensiveness any more. 
There is a slide downward of the things that are covered.  
The member across the way decries, as I do, the changes that have been undertaken. 
This is not what medicare should do. 
Fault laid at the feet of the Liberals? 
Fault laid at the feet of the provinces? 
But the funding has dropped.  
We will take that up after question period, but right now we will hear statements. 
The hon. member for Cambridge.  
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
They do not want handouts. 
The poor who need it most will not get a nickel.  
I hope the lesson to be learned is clear. 
Not even the poor can rely on programs cooked up by the government.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Fredericton, Lib.):
THE LATE YVON DUFOUR 
Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau, Lib.):
Yvon enjoyed life, and was a generous and fun-loving person.  
Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):
Better yet, co-operation was the watchword throughout the discussions.  
This agreement represents an important step forward. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Peaceful efforts to resolve this situation have failed.  
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Canadians have much to celebrate. 
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, February is Black History Month.  
Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-East York, Lib.):
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
THE LATE KIRK MILLER 
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
Kirk had no choice. 
He could not and he would not leave his family without an income. 
He knew he would get no EI if he quit. 
Now there is no life for Kirk and only despair for his family.  
I ask the House to pay tribute to Kirk and his family.  
COUNCIL FOR CANADIAN UNITY 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
All of them were on the no side in the last referendum.  
But they will not get off lightly.  
Tell me whom you finance and I will tell you against whom you are.  
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
What a fine example of tolerance on the part of the sovereignists.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Mississauga East, Lib.):
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We have balanced the books. 
The economy is in good shape. 
The people are happy. 
Only the Reform Party is having problems these days.  
The hon. member for Medicine Hat.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, let us talk about the new politics from the Liberal government. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we would cut fat and the finance minister would be gone.  
He should be ashamed of it.  
I pointed out that taxes are going up. 
I want an answer from the finance minister. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will answer the question very quickly.  
We will protect the Canada pension plan. 
I have answered the questions.  
Now let the Reform Party answer its questions. 
I answered its questions.  
We have questions here and answers here.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
I would like the Bloc Quebecois and Parti Quebecois members to admit this.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Equalization was not mentioned then.  
Does he remember those statements?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I would ask hon. members to be kind enough to listen to the answers.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Where were they, him and his Quebec colleagues? 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, what is unfortunate is- 
The hon. member for Roberval.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, here we go again. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to put some quotes again today to the finance minister.  
Whose words are these? 
Why is this government following the lead of the Reform Party?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
This is exactly what the NDP was asking for. 
Just like the Reform Party, it cannot take yes for an answer.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
The hon. leader of the New Democratic Party.  
Meanwhile, citizens are paying 30 cents on every health care dollar. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there are reasonable NDP leaders. 
The Premier of Saskatchewan said he is in agreement with us. 
And then there is this complaining group in the corner. 
The hon. member for New Brunswick Southwest.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
Mr. Speaker, I made a mistake. 
It is the fourth party, not the third.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
I am quoting Mark Twain but it is up to the public to decide. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Let us talk about our troops in Macedonia. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would not believe any of that. 
The conditions under which our troops will go in will help to ensure their safety.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the fact is there are 62 members of the Canadian forces in Macedonia. 
They are ill equipped. 
They cannot do their jobs adequately. 
This government and this minister have the responsibility to look after them.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, they are not being sent into harm's way. 
But they are there in an engineering capacity and in a medical capacity. 
They are not actually going into Kosovo at all. 
They are there in a supporting role. 
They are in fact quite safe and secure.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the poor member is really out to lunch.  
For immigrant settlement services, Quebec receives 34% of spending. 
From the Canada Development Bank, with 24%- 
The hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Finance is taking us for a ride.  
That is the reality.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will continue and give other examples.  
This is the fault of the federal government. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
You would call that two tier health. 
You would call that Liberal medicare.  
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the rhetoric is fine but the facts are quite different.  
If Canada has hit the debt wall, they have an excuse for this.  
The hon. member for Macleod.  
My question is very straightforward. 
That is their legacy. 
Why did they do it?  
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I reject absolutely the preamble to the member's question.  
We will never allow that to happen. 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Is Quebec poorer than Newfoundland? 
Quebec receives $78 more per capita than Prince Edward Island. 
The hon. member for Temiscamingue.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
There is another thing. 
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
My question is very simple. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The finance minister still has time if he would like to answer the question.  
Mr. Speaker, I am so anxious for his supplementary.  
The hon. member for Battlefords-Lloydminster.  
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, small business participates in the overall economy of the country. 
What has the overall economy of the country done?  
We have eliminated the deficit. 
We are the only major industrial country now paying debt. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
The French government is obviously unhappy about this incident.  
When is she going to wake up?  
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Carmen Provenzano (Sault Ste. Marie, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Natural Resources.  
Canada is a big player in that market.  
All Canadians will benefit.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the proof is in. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is absolutely not what the study revealed. 
It is quite the contrary. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, let us look at the facts. 
When will the minister clean up this mess?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I can say that the program is working very well. 
I can say one thing. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Overwhelmingly the largest percentage increase- 
The hon. member for Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
The provinces claw it back. 
He knows that benefit is not a great deal.  
It reads, ``The introduction of the hated GST has compounded unfairness and complexity. 
The hon. Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Luckily the Prime Minister was not playing. 
Now I am told the Sea Kings are restricted to Shearwater.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
All of that is being rectified.  
We do not fly aircraft unless they are safe to fly. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
The soup is still frozen in the cupboard.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
How will this announcement benefit all Canadian communities?  
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the auditor general says that our army is vulnerable. 
We direct all questions through the Speaker, not directly to the minister.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, if our troops go to Kosovo they will be properly equipped.  
There are new search and rescue helicopters and submarines. 
We are going through an upgrade of the CF-18s.  
This indicates the kind of commitment the government has.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
We do not condone terrorism in any way. 
A country has to be able to appropriately apply its judicial system. 
That is something that has to be done through very careful negotiation over time.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
The Senate wants to go on yet another spending spree. 
Now it wants another 6%.  
Will the Minister of Finance- 
The question is out of order.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Next week is a constituency week for members.  
Thursday, March 4, shall be an allotted day.  
THE LATE WALTER HARRIS 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
He also served Canada with courage during the second world war.  
He was my kind of minister.  
Every time you see one of those RRSP commercials, think of Walter.  
He was a distinguished parliamentarian whom everyone will greatly miss.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
The legacy he has left behind will never be surpassed. 
That is not all. 
Let me identify just a few.  
He practised law in Markdale, Ontario, and he was successful at it. 
He served in France during World War II. 
He served in the House of Commons in 1940. 
He was re-elected in 1945, again re-elected in 1949 and again in 1953. 
Walter Harris was predeceased by his wife Grace. 
He is survived by three children. 
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
In other words, he lived through almost the entire 20th century. 
Re-elected in 1945, he soon became Louis St. Laurent's right hand man.  
When he became prime minister, Mr. St. Laurent kept Walter Harris on as parliamentary secretary.  
Mr. Harris' patience and loyalty were rewarded. 
In this regard, I would like to recount an anecdote.  
History has a way of repeating itself.  
After 1957, Walter Harris had a long career as a lawyer in Markham, Ontario. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
The children of Walter Harris must be very proud of their father. 
PUBLIC SERVICE ALLIANCE OF CANADA-SPEAKER'S RULING 
The hon. member for Yorkton-Melville rose to support those interventions.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I move: 
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
It is not usual for a Speaker to give reasons for it. 
I refer the hon. member to article 409 in Beauchesne's sixth edition.  
That is the reason for my decision and my decision will stand.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
I am also tabling background information.  
FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF MINISTER OF FINANCE 
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
I would like to ask a question of the member. 
Demographics clearly show that we have an aging population. 
As well, as we grow older our demands on the health care system dramatically increase. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the question. 
Here we have $11.5 coming. 
We are bantering back and forth. 
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
That is what the government has done to Canadian families.  
Why does it not just give it back?  
One has to ask why the government continues this war against the family. 
Why is the government through its taxation regime so determined to do that? 
It has been suggested that some sort of social engineering is going on. 
What is this master plan the Liberals have had for so many years? 
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
This is not a discriminatory budget at all. 
Let us talk about single taxpayers earning $20,000 or less. 
It is easy to pull out numbers. 
That is what members saw. 
In my home town we have a medical community, a research community. 
I think of what that will mean in the health of the nation. 
When we put money in research we are showing forethought. 
There is choice here. 
We are talking about current day Canadians and a society that is good. 
What century does the hon. member plan for?  
Madam Speaker, I thank the member for her rhetoric. 
However these are the facts. 
Their total income is $60,000.  
All the rhetoric in the world put forward by that member cannot dispute that. 
Where did I get the numbers from? 
It was from the finance minister's own budget. 
That is where the numbers came from.  
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
The current Minister of Finance is merely miserly with the people. 
He takes what little people have and gives it to the rich. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the member for the question.  
There would be zero tax for a $30,000 household income. 
That is what we would do.  
Hon. Claudette Bradshaw (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
We all know that today's children are tomorrow's leaders. 
Today I would like to speak about Canadian children. 
The 1999 federal budget invests in the future of our children. 
By protecting their future, we are protecting the future of Canada.  
The spirit of the 1999 federal budget is health. 
More important, this money will help to ensure a healthy future for our children.  
This is an investment we are making in our future. 
Fifty-five per cent of people in our Canadian prisons are fetal alcohol syndrome victims. 
We need to help these children become taxpayers and not offenders.  
It can affect fetal, infant and childhood development. 
We all know these are the most crucial years of development for all Canadians. 
We must work to prevent these effects.  
This is an investment in the future of Canada.  
This government does not take that priority lightly.  
Two million modest and middle income families will receive these benefits. 
More importantly, this money will help our children to successfully prepare their future. 
This way we are helping them become the pillars of our society.  
These children of the new millennium have the support and commitment of this government. 
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
She talked about toxic substances in toys. 
Maybe we should wait for more specific areas to come. 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
There is the millennium fund. 
We brought in the child tax credit. 
We brought in the transitional job fund.  
Canadians listening to this debate wonder why they are hearing all these different numbers. 
I sit here every day and wonder about all the different numbers. 
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I have a very brief question.  
Yet, funding for rural communities and the regions has been cut by $100,000.  
This week, we gave Quebec $380 million.  
Mr. Gary Pillitteri (Niagara Falls, Lib.):
This government has listened. 
The results may be seen in the positive turn taken by the Canadian economy.  
Now it stands at its lowest level in almost a decade. 
This in turn translates into jobs.  
This means 13,000 more jobs than last year. 
As a result of previous Liberal budgets, interest rates have declined substantially. 
We have wrestled to the ground. 
Now it is firmly under control. 
All the economist indicators are telling us that it will remain so.  
Today Canadians believe their government can make a difference. 
These concerns had to be addressed. 
Here, once more, we have listened to Canadians.  
Canadians also want to know how and where their health care dollars are being spent. 
Now good health care is as much about preventing illness as curing it. 
Support and research are paramount to a good health care system.  
This is a very important measure in this budget. 
With the provisions in this budget the Liberal government has provided target tax relief. 
The Canada child tax benefit has been enhanced by $300 million. 
This will extend benefits to modest and middle income families. 
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
Now, after the good wine, the sour grapes. 
I realize that Ontario is a privileged province. 
Unemployment has always been lower there than in Quebec. 
In fact, it is a richer province.  
We do not need money to provide for unemployment. 
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
Trying to get through the smoke and mirrors is a problem with this. 
We will keep saying that until they get the idea.  
His area happens to be in Ontario. 
The other area in Canada that is doing well is Alberta. 
Madam Speaker, the government is not only dealing with statistics. 
It is dealing more with people. 
When more people are employed they are creating other jobs. 
We are trying to put a human face to it.  
Therefore the whole economy moves much better and faster. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak to the budget. 
First they went after education, and now they are going after health.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
It is not ``our'' money.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
First they go after education and now it is health.  
So there is a hidden agenda here. 
This is the real intention behind this government's long-standing strategy. 
Who is bearing the brunt of the finance minister's generosity? 
Who is being made to pay for this strategy by the Liberals? 
The provinces have had to come to terms with this offloading of the federal deficit. 
It has not been a laughing matter.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member for Quebec.  
Many unemployed workers have been overlooked in the new budget's strategy.  
It is there in black and white. 
I could give many examples.  
He's a tinkerer.  
So they are still cuts. 
The millennium scholarships are a case in point. 
They put their finger on the sore spot and talk about fixing it.  
There will be $400 million in administrative costs.  
What has the federal government to do with all this? 
A national health surveillance network will be created. 
This represents an investment of $75 million over three years. 
This will overlap what CLSCs are doing. 
There is also the research and evaluation fund for nursing staff. 
We know the challenges they are now facing. 
The prenatal nutrition program is another example of duplication.  
They are taking another approach to health care in rural communities. 
It is to centralize. 
This will be another very unpopular budget in Quebec. 
There you have four measures with $20 million. 
We know that the public has commented on the surpluses. 
In 1994, payments intended for the provinces were $18.8 billion. 
And the government tells us it is being generous with this budget.  
That is what that means.  
They perhaps need more medical care. 
What does the government do in the new budget? 
The federal government has reached its deficit objective. 
It has reached it and now it gloats. 
It wants credit for the fact that Quebec will eliminate its deficit. 
That is what that means.  
For the child tax credit, it means $602 less. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I would ask hon. members to be very careful in their choice of words.  
From whom was this $7 billion taken every year? 
An individual is not eligible if he or she has any income, however small. 
There is nothing for the poor, and a few crumbs for the middle class. 
And the Liberal government is talking about equity? 
What exactly is equity? 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I listened intently to the comments made by the hon. member opposite. 
That is working extremely well. 
I want to point to one specific example in terms of the service delivery. 
One part of the budget deals with research. 
They were expecting $500 million for health.  
They always talk about what makes them look good. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I congratulate the member for Quebec on her speech. 
Let me talk about somebody who has a low income. 
This is nowhere near the government's numbers.  
That is what we deplored. 
The hon. member is right. 
No, they are going to invest it.  
Madam Speaker, I have a follow-up question. 
We thought there might be some sensitivity. 
This budget is very disappointing. 
The middle class contributed enormously to the deficit. 
They are being crushed under the weight of taxes. 
They are losing manoeuvring room in order to help the economy.  
Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):
Who is not happy with our budgets? 
They can never say they are satisfied with the government's achievements.  
This goes to show that this is really a balanced budget. 
But then again, that too will be blamed on the federal government. 
But I have to confess that I am biased. 
I believe the government is doing a terrific job. 
That's the most striking element in Tuesday's budget announcement.  
This budget has the distinction of being balanced at the centre of the political spectrum. 
We believe this is a responsible, moderate budget.  
It will not solve every pressing issue on the spot. 
But that is the stuff of political fiction. 
There is hope sewn into the lining of this budget.  
I believe the Ontario electorate will be able to understand the figures. 
I do not believe that the electorate will be deceived. 
He was referring to the Harris-Martin tax cuts.  
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
Madam Speaker, I do not believe that was a question. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
The member talked as if happiness was the absence of misfortune. 
In terms of employment insurance, the government could improve the situation of the unemployed. 
With the banks, it could pass legislation on community reinvestment. 
But it did not- 
I suggest our backbencher remain calm.  
First, we notified all the provincial governments. 
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
It provides tax cuts and health care funding. 
Health care is the first priority of this budget. 
This is also a key issue in my riding. 
This year's budget has answered this demand. 
The second important aspect of this budget is research and development funding. 
The third important aspect of the budget is tax relief. 
Now we have begun to offer broad based tax relief to all Canadians.  
It is great news for all of us.  
Finally, it provides tax relief for all Canadians.  
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
The members opposite are parrots. 
And the Liberal members from Quebec even applauded.  
The people of this very wealthy province are now even wealthier.  
Mr. Rene Canuel: ``Servile'' means ``servant''. 
They are little people. 
They cannot understand that Quebec is the loser here, the big loser.  
There were about 800 workers and unemployed people- 
He is afraid of people.  
There will be no food for their children. 
C'est le probleme de Landry 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
This budget missed the boat in an essential area. 
The government does not listen very often to anybody from any other political party. 
What are these reviews saying? 
Why is Canada's productivity failing? 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Vancouver Kingsway.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for the good point. 
Yes, we would like to increase our productivity. 
That is one of our recommendations in the report of the finance committee. 
We do focus on that.  
Research and development is what we will address. 
We have given $800 million to the centre of innovation. 
This year we are giving an additional $200 million to the centre. 
That will create many jobs. 
In the meantime this will prevent brain drain.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
It is sad to stand up today to talk about this budget. 
It is sad because it is such a failure. 
It is sad because it is a missed opportunity. 
They are empty words. 
We need to judge people by their actions and not by their words. 
Thankfully those who do are able to pay for it. 
I want to tell the House a personal story. 
What happened when she was in a public hospital?  
That happened not once, not twice, not three times but four times. 
The family could not always be there. 
They all lived a distance away from where she was. 
This was not to be the topic of my speech today. 
In this particular case it hit very close to our family.  
I want to talk about the issues of debt and taxes. 
They came before before committee and testified. 
Their message was crystal clear: we need to reduce taxes. 
By having a plan for reducing the debt.  
Sometimes for recreational reading I read the Fiscal Monitor . 
Not many people do that. 
I looked at the Fiscal Monitor to see what is happening to our debt. 
It is very distressing. 
This is what has caused the greatest break in our economy. 
I always do this in my speeches. 
I always try to find at least one place where I can thank government members. 
I have looked at the projections of the Minister of Finance and his department. 
It grew to $545 billion and to $574 billion. 
Those were the projections unless the deficit could be beat.  
Thankfully the Liberal government was at the right place at the right time. 
It lucked in and won the lottery. 
What is it for subsequent years? 
It is projected at $579.7 billion and $579.7 billion.  
Members can look it up themselves. 
They are forward loading and back loading. 
They are not dealing with the present reality. 
As a result our debt will continue.  
Public debt charges are projected to go up. 
It is in the document. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not know where to start. 
Maybe I should focus on one aspect, and that is the debt. 
The member seems to want to talk about the debt. 
He started off by dealing with the growth of the debt.  
That deficit had to be dealt with each and every year. 
Now we are getting surpluses.  
That may very well be. 
This is where the rub comes in. 
What does the budget say? 
What is the number that is being communicated by the Liberals? 
What number are they using in terms of what they are putting into health care?  
The number is $11.5 billion. 
We hear it all the time. 
They multiplied the number by five for the next five years.  
This is an annual budget. 
Those are the actual numbers. 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
I am concerned that Canadians are aware of the taxes they are paying. 
This is a hidden tax.  
It must be to Canadians when they find out about it. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I must interrupt the member. 
The time has expired. 
The hon. member for Elk Island on a very brief comment.  
What this government is giving is mediocre. 
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
The problem began in the first days of this government. 
That is a reality. 
The numbers are there for anybody to see. 
This government has never got its wild spending habits under control. 
Members opposite will say to look at the tax cuts.  
Average taxpayers will see a few dollars per week from that one. 
It works out to about a cup of coffee a week. 
The reality of this cut is on average $79 a year. 
Business is calling for it. 
It is a tax on jobs. 
That is the reality again. 
If we add all this up, what do we get? 
We pay more, we get less. 
What do we get for this? 
Do we get more health care? 
Do we get more economic activity? 
Do we get more national wealth? 
No, we get more politics, the last thing we really need.  
They have programs to run.  
He who has the money makes the rules.  
The budget just released puts $175 million into DND. 
The Canadian forces as we see them now are overcommitted. 
Members opposite will say to look at the wonderful job they do. 
That is the whole point. 
The Canadian taxpayer is in the same leaky boat. 
This budget repeats what we have seen in the last three. 
The minister's projections are wrong. 
They are none of these things.  
It is not their imagination. 
It is being exposed everywhere. 
The numbers are there. 
They are documented very well.  
For how long are Canadians going to accept this outrage? 
This Liberal government has failed on health care. 
It has taken out far more than it intends to put in. 
It has failed to perform the federal role it is supposed to focus on. 
And it is losing the trust of Canadians by manipulating the national books.  
I do not suppose that is because it is another missed opportunity by this government. 
We have been losing ground on these issues for years. 
These studies indicate that our tax burden is just too great. 
Our standard of living is falling; disposable income continues to fall. 
Why is this acceptable? 
Why is being 17th in the world good enough? 
There is so much more that has to be done.  
What did the minister do about the small business deduction? 
It is still mired in 1980 values. 
Nothing in this budget. 
We pay more and get less.  
I do not see anything productive about that.  
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
There are two aspects of this, paying and getting. 
Those members are showing total irresponsibility by ignoring that aspect.  
The member also talked about small business. 
I guess he is not very happy to know this as well.  
The federal government does not have its hands in it one way or the other. 
It is money contributed by employers and employees for their pensions. 
I guess that points to what the member was talking about.  
The biggest problem we have in the country is underperformance. 
People are penalized to get out and make things happen. 
We have a tremendous problem with brain drain. 
Taxes are driving people out of this country. 
We have a burgeoning underground economy. 
As a contractor I can pass that on and claim it back. 
It is the heavy tax load on everything. 
That is not being addressed. 
There must be fairness in the taxation system.  
The member also talked about the debt and the deficit. 
They are looking for some sort of relief from this overburden. 
They are looking to the government for some direction and leadership.  
This budget is a small step in the right direction. 
We need to take large strides. 
We are going into a worldwide economy. 
Canada can be a leader. 
We do not have to settle for 17th place.  
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, just to conclude, paying Uncle Sam? 
Some of the members across the way have touched on this issue.  
Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time as well.  
But productivity basically means how efficiently we use inputs of production. 
The object of the exercise is to utilize those things more effectively and more efficiently. 
That is often what we call productivity.  
But that is not what I am talking about at all. 
Why is this important? 
This is important because it impacts our standard of living. 
It addresses that issue in some very fundamental ways. 
It does that by increasing our funding by about $1.8 billion. 
We are very concerned about finding cures for some of our medical problems.  
There is an additional $150 million that has gone into the technologies partnership program. 
Some banks ask what they are going to give them for collateral. 
It is paid back to us through a royalty payment system. 
We are keeping Canadians employed and we are keeping them at home.  
Why is this a problem? 
Frankly, I do not know. 
Some of my colleagues will say it is because of our tax laws. 
That is not quite the case. 
The business sector is somewhat responsible for this.  
That is not the case in Canada. 
We have to find better ways for Canadians to use the technology that is available. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague from the Liberal Party for his speech.  
I want to ask him some questions. 
I do not think that some of the members across the way get it. 
That can be extrapolated to private sector companies. 
That is not the issue. 
The fact is it cannot because the tax structure is too high.  
What about personal tax?  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Who gets the biggest tax breaks? 
Their tax bill will be reduced by $3,800. 
This is an insult. 
Madam Speaker, I have taken a close look at the budget. 
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Eglinton-Lawrence, Lib.):
I do not mean to make light of interventions that colleagues make. 
What do we have? 
What does the opposition say? 
It didn't go to my province. 
My province didn't get what it wanted''. 
The Canadian public got what it wanted, in fact it got more. 
Not only did it take the $3.5 billion- 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
That is not a point of order.  
The hon. member is absolutely correct. 
Stones must hear the good message. 
It is an additional $8 billion over the next five years. 
That is much more than anybody had anticipated.  
Yet what have we heard? 
The opposition said we took out $20 billion. 
None of this bureaucratic in between let us manipulate this ministry hideaway. 
This is what the opposition is lamenting. 
We are losing them because of high taxes.  
It exceeds their wildest dreams. 
Ask them if this is money well spent and they will tell them yes. 
Because the money that we spend this way collectively brings us greater results. 
Did we meet their demands? 
Of course we met their demands.  
First nations everywhere have been at a disadvantage. 
All members on this side of the House recognize that. 
We have already put a mechanism in place. 
How much do we find? 
How much did the Prime Minister and cabinet find? 
What did the health minister look for? 
The opposition said no, we should not do that.  
I do not understand those people any more, I really do not. 
They say that there are other issues. 
It has been listening to the Canadian public. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Nine years later we get back to 1995.  
Is he not ashamed of that?  
Does the hon. member share the same opinion as the member from Scarborough?  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
They won the jackpot.  
I have been conducting a little survey throughout this debate. 
Where were the Liberal ministers from Quebec? Where were the Liberal members from Quebec? 
They are nothing but doormats.  
Madam Speaker, I am really surprised. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Otherwise he might be a victim of- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
This is not a point of order. 
It is debate and there is no time left.  
The question is on the amendment to the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment to the amendment?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the amendment to the amendment will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I declare the amendment to the amendment defeated.  
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP):
What happened in those 30 years? 
It went to their friends. 
Economic development Liberal style.  
Only a corporation being run into the ground by those paid to preserve it. 
For every dollar invested it put five back. 
Of course there is money to be made in Cape Breton. 
God knows we need jobs in Cape Breton.  
That is all he felt Cape Breton was worth. 
That is what he thinks about nearly 2,000 jobs.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The time has expired.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
The minister is aware of the participants. 
There is a list of them. 
Redfern Resources has a proposal called the Tulsequah Chief Mine. 
The state of Alaska participated in it. 
The environmentalists have shifted gears. 
They do not care about the fact that there was an environmental review done. 
They do not care about the science. 
They do not care about truth. 
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
The member has provided, as he said, the documents to Revenue Canada. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 7.05 p.m.)
