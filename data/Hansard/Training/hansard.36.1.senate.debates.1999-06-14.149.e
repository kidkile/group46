The Senate met at 4:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
The federal government is investing $60 million. 
Honourable senators, Mr. Yvon Beaulne died last week in Hull.  
He chaired the commission in 1979.  
It was my privilege to participate in the activities of this centre. 
We had the full support of Ambassador Beaulne.  
We offer our deepest sympathies to the family. 
On tabling of documents: 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Social Affairs, Science and Technology 
Committee Authorized to Meet during sitting of the senate 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators to adopt the motion?  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I shall attempt to bring forward a definitive answer to that question. 
I believe that her answer was in the affirmative. 
That is as far as I can go at the present time. 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
Honourable senators, my question is also to the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I shall make very strong representations, as presented by Senator Comeau. 
Again, I will have discussions with the appropriate ministers.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
They are underarmed and have been criticized by the Auditor General of Canada.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I have not had an opportunity to consult with the Minister of Agriculture. 
Honourable senators, it is difficult to ascertain what the Minister of Agriculture will do. 
For the information of this chamber, it continues to rain in that area. 
The situation is becoming more and more critical. 
It is having a ripple effect throughout the entire economy.  
I would appreciate it if this matter could again be taken up with the minister. 
Budget Implementation Bill, 1999 
Third Reading-Motion in Amendment-vote Deferred 
( a ) on pages 10 to 12, by deleting Part 3; and 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The bells will ring at 4:45 p.m. 
Bill to Amend-Third Reading 
Allow me to address these concerns briefly.  
Honourable senators, I should like to say a few words on Bill C-79.  
Let me briefly relate the facts. 
Three other trials were about to begin. 
The Supreme Court majority quashed the order prohibiting publication. 
Justice Gonthier, along with Justice l'Heureux-Dube, wrote dissenting reasons. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.  
Bill to amend-Third reading-Debate Suspended 
This new act will improve an already excellent program. 
Its business structure allows it to fulfil that role. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
You can finish your speech when we come back, after the vote.  
Budget Implementation Bill, 1999 
( a ) on pages 10 to 12, by deleting Part 3; and 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, the question before us is on the motion in amendment.  
Motion in amendment negatived on the following division: 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Were you in your seat during the vote?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
There is a problem. 
If you are in your seat, you must either vote or abstain.  
Those who draft the Debates of the Senate will make mention of this. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, we are now back to the motion for third reading.  
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Merchant Navy War Service Recognition Bill 
Motion for Second Reading Negatived 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Would those honourable senators in favour of the motion please say "yea"?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Would those honourable senators in who oppose the motion please say "nay"?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
In my opinion, the "nays" have it.  
And two honourable senators having risen.  
The Hon. The Speaker :
I see two honourable senators. 
We will then proceed with the standing vote as per the order of the Senate.  
Motion negatived on the following division: 
Bill to Amend-Third Reading 
Exports are the key to Canada's future prosperity.  
Hon. P. Derek Lewis (Acting Speaker) :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.  
Bank Act Winding-Up and Restructuring Act 
Bill to Amend-Third Reading 
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.  
The Estimates, 1999-2000 
Interim Report of Committee Adopted 
He was quite forthcoming. 
In fact it has never been used since it was brought into effect. 
There are certain express conditions which must be followed.  
He encouraged us to explore measures that would mitigate these costs. 
Dr. McBean's forecasts were quite disturbing. 
I believe Senator Fraser may have asked the question. 
Of course, our committee is interested only in the natural aspects of disaster.  
That, honourable senators, is the report.  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable senators, is it your pleasure to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Appropriation Bill No. 2, 1999-2000 
The reference is not at all needed and is in fact, in my view, misleading. 
I thought that honourable senators should have some clarification on this point. 
As always, Mr. Neville was very candid and open in his responses. 
I do not know if this is a proper precedent. 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Miscellaneous Statute Law Amendment Bill, 1999 
Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
Consideration of the proposals is non-partisan. 
Part 3 repeals spent acts and contains conditional amendments.  
Others were withdrawn at the request of the initiating departments. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Would the honourable senator answer some questions for clarification?  
First, which minister is responsible for the bill?  
Is that how the process works?  
At that point, every amendment that was at all controversial was dropped. 
The committee would then report back on the bill.  
The Senate accepted our report on these proposals back in May. 
However, I believe that approximately 20 clauses were dropped.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
I Honourable senators, I have a question for the chairman of the committee. 
Perhaps you could give us some reassurance on how this came about?  
This came about purely as a safety concern. 
It is purely a matter of health and safety, really. 
This was why the committee decided to go ahead and accept the proposal.  
Those grounds would be in the statute.  
I am trying to find the precise section that the honourable senator is speaking about.  
It is on page 40 of the bill, section 134.  
On page 40, I have section 148 and 149.  
I am sorry, page 36 of the bill.  
It was only because it was a safety matter that we agreed to it.  
That is quite true. 
However, because it was a safety matter, we let this one through.  
I congratulate you on an excellent report. 
I know you did a great deal of work.  
However, I will leave it at that.  
I believe that that was the only one.  
Honourable senators, we have before us another bill to amend. 
The title of Bill C-84 is self-explanatory:
The suggested amendment must not 
( b ) involve the spending of public funds; 
( c ) prejudicially affect the rights of persons; or 
Something must be done about this terrible anomaly! 
This will have to be looked at.  
On motion of Senator Lynch-Staunton, debate adjourned.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
I think the clock will say six, soon. 
We will see what happens at six o'clock.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
If there is no agreement at this point, I will interrupt at six o'clock.  
Bill to Amended-Second Reading- Referred to Committee 
They immediately call for stricter laws and stronger sentences. 
They argue for gun control. 
They call for more protection for police and the public.  
The public, quite rightly, would be storming this place demanding action.  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, do not worry about the clock.  
Thank you, Senator Prud'homme.  
This is a debate for another day. 
I have come to refer to drunk drivers as "terrorists on wheels."  
I eventually took up the cause and spoke out. 
I found that to do so was very therapeutic. 
MADD is an organization, honourable senators, like no other. 
No one aspires to be a member. 
That is the goal we all work toward. 
It will be a happy day indeed if and when it is finally reached. 
However, as the saying goes, hope springs eternal.  
Those, honourable senators, are the minimum sentences.  
Alberta has had a great deal of success with this interlock program.  
This is an increase from the current two hours.  
Honourable senators, that increase is very important. 
I have talked to many police officers about this. 
Two hours go by very quickly when confronted with the scene of a horrific crash. 
In some cases, the perpetrator is removed from the scene to the hospital as well. 
This provision would give the police more time to gather evidence. 
The crime, honourable senators, is vehicular homicide.  
I was surprised by the resistance of the Bloc Quebecois. 
The changes (to the law) will likely prevent some of that carnage. 
Responsible politicians would act now. 
Statistics are just that - statistics. 
I will use the next few moments to do just that.  
What do we say to Scott DuBois and his mother Diane? 
The lists and circumstances could fill pages. 
Colleen and Susan are the driving forces behind the Ottawa chapter of MADD.  
It is a non-partisan issue which most of us have participated in and embraced. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Involvement in Yugoslavia-Relationship to International Law-Inquiry-Debate Continued 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Perhaps I might seek leave in advance.  
Why do we have rules?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Senator Grafstein is requesting leave. 
Honourable senators, to continue: 
Like the common law, customary law grows in episodic ways. 
It adapts to new situations, not by a regular process. 
It grows by actions and conduct. 
As Oliver Wendell Holmes once explained the development of common law: 
The life of the law is not logic but experience.  
This epigram applies with even greater force to international law. 
Rather, it is a different branch of the same trunk. 
This is an organic doctrine of law. 
Even these principles emerged out of customary precedents. 
The Monroe Doctrine, amplified by Theodore Roosevelt to extend to the Far East, reigned supreme. 
Honourable senators, let me be clear. 
Minorities' rights were to be accorded respect and equal treament. 
We should note that customary law does diverge from English common law. 
Uncertainty in international law is not necessary a criticism. 
Laws are stated in general terms whereas facts are never general.  
As Brierly noted in 1944, the political theory that defined 
vital interests of the State as political 
gone out of fashion although it continues to be indecently argued.  
Hence, sovereignists argue that the international rule of law is optional. 
Canon lawyers transferred this doctrine from the ethical to the legal realm.  
The rationale for "just cause" has not changed in centuries. 
Obviously this doctrine had difficulties. 
It required a determination, a judgment on the facts, of which side was "just."  
"Just cause" required evidentiary demonstration. 
As Brierly fairly pointed out: 
So let us turn to the NATO action more closely for a moment.  
There are two arguments against NATO's action. 
About this, there can be no serious question.  
I will just give you the date line. 
That is not an exhaustive list, honourable senators. 
The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was a signatory to that convention. 
I emphasize the words "to prevent and to punish."  
Lauterpacht's article states, in part: 
States dealt with the states; states did not deal with the individuals. 
They paid with their lives for that belief. 
The UN failed to enforce its own safe havens. 
The UN failed to uphold compliance of its own repeated and "just" resolutions. 
Further, it failed to defended safe havens on the ground. 
Clear, unquestioned, unambiguous, egregious, demonstrably serious breaches of international law are at hand. 
In my view, there is no prohibition in international law to this effect. 
It would be prudent either as a condition precedent or a condition subsequent.  
However, that is not the question before this chamber. 
Time does not allow me to explore the precedents in full. 
I would hope, perhaps, to respond during the debate.  
This is the one paramount principle underlying the legitimacy of any state. 
Honourable senators, international law was rescued by international law.  
On motion of Senator Roche, debate adjourned.  
Canada-Europe Parliamentary Association 
Hon. Lorna Milne rose pursuant to notice of June 8, 1999: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Review on Anti-Drug Policy 
Motion to Establish Special Senate Committee- Debate Adjourned 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin , pursuant to notice given June 2, 1999, moved: 
I am referring to the paragraphs that read as follows: 
And paragraph 8, which reads as follows: 
I move this motion in amendment because I got a little ahead of myself. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
Honourable senators, I move that this motion, as amended, be adopted.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Do you agree to dispense with actually reading the motion?  
At the time, I maintained that this was almost a deliberate unwillingness to see. 
Let us look initially at the situation in Canada. 
Among native people, alcoholism and drug abuse are rampant. 
Here are two facts. 
A second group at risk is that of street children. 
They are also affected by the use of illicit drugs. 
The chance of their dying is 12 times greater than that of their peers.  
A third high-risk group is people living in poor neighbourhoods. 
It is even higher in certain regions of the country, including among aboriginals. 
There will soon be such a program in place in Spain as well.  
Honourable senators, let us look now at the application costs of Canada's drug policy. 
Let us turn to the economic cost for Canada. 
Users get their supply from a lucrative and violent market where crime is ever present. 
That was almost 30 years ago. 
The position adopted by the politicians was to do nothing. 
We saw at the hearings the public was worried about their kids. 
The public saw those current laws as a tremendous injustice.  
It cannot go on like this indefinitely. 
And yet, the situation in this matter keeps on changing.  
Let us look at the change in the situation in the area of illicit drugs. 
Six states, with the exception of the District of Columbia, approved the proposed measures.  
That was being said three years ago. 
We were saying exactly this three years ago. 
Finally, little by little, things are moving forward. 
This position was supported by the RCMP.  
He had been found guilty of trafficking and sentenced to one year on probation. 
Naturally, it captured the interest of parliamentarians. 
It was passed by the House of Commons on May 25. 
I think that we should congratulate the minister on his action.  
Prejudices against those who take narcotics remain extremely strong. 
They are not new. 
Each year, new detailed studies are being added to the literature on the subject. 
Marijuana is a good example.  
She also has an excellent reputation abroad.  
That could therefore justify the repressive approach of Bill C-8.  
However, that obligation is subordinated to the principles enshrined in the constitution of each country.  
In short, these conventions explicitly provide for exceptions to prohibition. 
They also allow signatory countries to have them amended or to terminate them. 
This approach can only make the unbearable situation of drug users even worse. 
Fortunately, the situation is not that serious yet in Canada. 
Drugs are a tragedy for addicts. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
There is so much truth in what he has said. 
On this issue, I am utterly conservative.  
I believe that the committee should be struck. 
If I am convinced, I will become one of your best supporters. 
Would they let people from our country in or vice-versa? 
That is one of the many concerns I have. 
Let me first say that I deliberately avoided this particular mandate. 
I deliberately chose not to include a review of U.S. policies in the mandate. 
The answer to your question is yes. 
It is a cornerstone of the examination we will undertake. 
You mentioned the shooting galleries located near to where you live. 
These are not found just in Montreal, but in Ottawa, as well. 
We must stop putting our heads in the sand like the Americans. 
No. We must do this together, and this includes our colleagues in the other House. 
I have waited long enough.  
In Switzerland, they had the same problem we do. 
The problems of heroin users concern society as a whole.  
Better yet, we help them find jobs. 
This is the sort of thing I am inviting you to do.  
I have a supplementary question. 
And the way to do that is by going after illegal drug users. 
This goes hand in hand with the issue of suppliers. 
The document addresses this. 
If the Senate agrees to strike a committee, we will have to examine this situation. 
My focus of interest is not traffickers. 
My interest is ultimately in those users who die. 
They are a danger to the Canadian social fabric. 
This is the problem facing us. 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Liquor is a form of drug. 
Hash, marijuana and others are forms of drugs. 
I want to examine the cause, rather than the effect, of drugs."  
I raise that as a philosophic point. 
Honourable senators, Senator LeBreton is not trying to prohibit the use of alcohol. 
She wishes to prohibit the use of alcohol and driving. 
I, too, want that. 
There is a difference.  
My proposition is to look the subject squarely in the face. 
These people are Canadians and have fundamental rights. 
I beg to differ with you on that point. 
There is no contradiction in our positions. 
That is another piece of the puzzle needed to solve some problems. 
People are speeding while under the influence of drugs. 
I believe that our positions are complementary.  
We used to have prohibition on alcohol. 
We owe that to Canadians.  
We need to study it with all of our combined wisdom. 
It is a grave health problem.  
I appreciate the senator's response. 
However, I believe that alcoholism is also a grave health problem. 
I have been told that alcoholism is as serious an illness as drug dependency. 
We have a serious conflict of social policies. 
Perhaps we do not understand the problem. 
We need to redefine the problem. 
Perhaps we should look at the answers they have found.  
On motion of Senator Carstairs, for Senator Kenny, debate adjourned.  
Poulin , pursuant to motion of June 10, 1999, moved: 
That the committee presents its final report no later than June 15, 2000.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I should like to have an explanation for this venture. 
I should like to know how much it will cost, and the parameters of it.  
However, I would be pleased to explain the theoretical framework.  
Over the summer, we will be developing the theoretical framework for the appropriate study.  
On motion of Senator Kinsella, for Senator Forrestall, debate adjourned.  
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
