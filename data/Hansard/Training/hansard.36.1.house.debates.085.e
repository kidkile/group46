Wednesday, April 1, 1998 
The House met at 2 p.m. 
Members sang the national anthem ] 
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
It is time the government learned a thing or two from farmers. 
Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
My thanks to all participants for setting a new and positive course.  
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
We are now entering into the final stage of becoming an official territory of Nunavut.  
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
By contrast, Reform policies are family friendly. 
Our priority is the well-being of families, not larger tax grabs.  
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it must be April Fool's Day. 
Mike Harris and his cabinet must be paranoid.  
I know the Tories do not trust the people of Ontario. 
I know they do not trust the unions. 
The hon. member for Dewdney-Alouette.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
This year over 12,000 school children are expected to visit Xa:ytem.  
QUEBEC FINANCE MINISTER'S BUDGET 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
As a matter of fact, it was like attending a meeting of sovereignist supporters.  
They need lower taxes. 
The hon. member for Louis-Hebert.  
BUDGET OF QUEBEC FINANCE MINISTER 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, yesterday, Quebec finance minister Bernard Landry tabled an excellent budget. 
Here we have a glowing example of the federal government's cynicism, pettiness and ingratitude. 
Now, that is pettiness- 
The hon. member for Sackville-Eastern Shore.  
THE ATLANTIC GROUNDFISH STRATEGY 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
We need a financial commitment from the government today.  
This is Newfoundland's ice storm. 
The lights are still off and the need is just as great.  
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, next Tuesday, April 7, is World Health Day. 
This year's theme is ``Safe Motherhood''. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
This government should be commended on its stalwart economic record. 
Never before have Canadians seen such a golden age.  
Oh yes, happy April Fool's Day.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Many are slowly dying.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We have been dealing with the provincial governments. 
I think it is a very generous program.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
It is morally wrong for the government to abandon these victims of its own negligence.  
The Prime Minister is concerned about his place in history. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this terribly difficult decision was made by 13 governments in the country. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
There is no excuse for doing the wrong thing. 
There is no political excuse.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We are dealing with a medical and health system in which there are sometimes risks. 
Before 1986 the risk of infections through the blood system was well known. 
That is the difference.  
Where do governments compensate? 
Do they compensate the people who have anesthetics and suffer adverse reactions? 
The hon. member for Edmonton North.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
The rest of them will suffer with nothing.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
What difference does that make? 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member ignores distinctions that do not suit her purpose. 
For those after 1986, in the period to 1990, we are acknowledging that- 
BUDGET OF QUEBEC FINANCE MINISTER 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there are several provincial governments in Canada. 
The great majority of them are able to balance their books. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
The Prime Minister is perfectly right. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I think that we have done our job well here in Ottawa. 
We have balanced our books. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
This is the reality.  
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member. 
The Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
However, we still have a debt of $583 billion. 
That being said, I am very pleased- 
I am sorry to interrupt the minister. 
The hon. member for Roberval.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
They know that it is not fair or just.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I just said that it is a difficult decision. 
The minister is explaining the situation very well.  
We were not the government when that problem occurred. 
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
This question is for the Prime Minister. 
Some of his own members are asking for a compensation package that includes all victims.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the minister keeps saying that this decision was made by 13 governments. 
It is still a wrong decision.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
That is the principle at issue here. 
Thirteen governments have made their decision and I say it is the right one.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
New Zealand has a no fault compensation package. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member should take care with his examples. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
So far, however, all our attempts to do so have not succeeded.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.:
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
If he has nothing to hide, he should let the committee do its job.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
He should really acquaint himself with it.  
I want to clear up a factual error the health minister keeps on repeating. 
So he will not compensate people who contracted the disease before then. 
That is not the truth.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, in various places throughout the world various tests were proposed. 
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, that is an unacceptable answer. 
What is particularly painful is how the Prime Minister is picking and choosing favourites. 
He will compensate only the top tier of victims. 
Everyone who contacted hepatitis C before 1986 is being abandoned. 
This is a national disgrace.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
YEAR 2000 COMPUTER PROBLEM 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member raises a very important question. 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
I ask the Prime Minister what has changed. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
CANADA PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD 
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
What are the minister's views on this and how does he intend to react?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Senate has produced a very good report. 
It is largely supportive of the government's position.  
Are there differences of opinion? 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, maybe some day we will get an answer to our questions too. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let us remember what has happened here. 
Two people are dead and a community is in mourning.  
In response to that there is a criminal investigation under way. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
It will be a whitewash, a glossing over of all the problems. 
The Assembly of First Nations is not a court. 
It is not an impartial government agency. 
It is a large organization, a political organization very close to the Liberal Party.  
When is she going to do what Connie's family has asked her to do?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
These people are duly elected, as we are in this House.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the problem of coho salmon is extremely difficult. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Can the minister shed some light on this rather shady deal?  
Once again colleagues we are getting a little close.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
I will try again.  
I ask the minister, why did Serco win the Liberal lottery?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Everyone was aware of what the rules were for the bid. 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Why do we not fund similar events in the same way?  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my hon. colleague for this question. 
A tiny fraction is what it would be if that amount was given.  
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
What will the minister's response to these tragic deaths be? 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
What do those members do? 
They point fingers, create division, incite doubt. 
They insist on finding blame. 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
We are doing the same thing in all these cases as well. 
However, we will do it in a fair and humane way.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
The hon. minister of defence.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Everybody understood the process and nobody complained about it. 
They just did not like the results.  
Goose Bay is used by our allies in terms of air force training. 
We would have lost this facility if we had not remained competitive. 
The hon. member for Bourassa.  
CANADA-QUEBEC AGREEMENT ON MANPOWER 
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Maybe it is time for an audit.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has the gall to use the word democratic. 
They are challenging duly elected chiefs and councils. 
I find this absolutely outrageous. 
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.  
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Certainly to hide behind the liability and legal issues does not make sense. 
It was very inhumane.  
My question for the minister is one I raised with him on Monday. 
It is a very constructive suggestion. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
This report is deemed adopted on presentation.  
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
Is there unanimous consent for the parliamentary secretary to move the motion?  
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
JUSTICE AND HUMAN RIGHTS 
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
The contents of this are very serious. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
They are before this House on false pretences.  
Type of Firearm Recovered According to Offence''. 
This would leave the 1993 data in circulation. 
I am, therefore, requesting your assistance to resolve this issue. 
J.P.R. Murray.  
Mr. Speaker, do you realize the seriousness of what is transpiring here? 
It is in the Ottawa Citizen today. 
In this article he says the RCMP is wrong.  
The Chair will consider the admissibility of the amendment.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, it gives me real pleasure to speak on this matter. 
This is an incredible revelation to think that this could have knowingly occurred. 
The RCMP is questioning these statistics. 
Mr. Speaker, what else do we need? 
Accordingly, I will put the motion to the House.  
That the House do now proceed to the Orders of the Day.  
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mr. Speaker, I realize you are going to ask the question on this particular motion. 
I think hon. members clearly disagree. 
The member who spoke was on debate. 
We are not free to debate it. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
And the bells having rung: 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
Is there unanimous consent?  
I declare the motion carried. 
The chief government whip proposes that we now return to Routine Proceedings. 
Is that also agreed by the House?  
GOODS AND SERVICES TAX 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
It states: ``Taxing reading is unfair and wrong. 
Literacy and reading are crucial to Canada's future. 
Removing the GST from reading material will help promote literacy in Canada. 
`Applying tax to books and periodicals discourages reading. 
That is one of the difficulties with reading from petitions. 
I invite her to summarize the petition and get to the point of it promptly.  
The hon. member has gone through the ice.

MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I suggest that all questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
I am going to take a different approach in speaking to this bill today. 
I want to talk about some of these stupid decisions. 
Quite frankly, Bill C-37 does not address any of that.  
It is typical of our country. 
I want to talk about three issues in my riding. 
I could name more from some of these witty judges. 
I first want to talk about Judge Harry Boyle. 
As Darren Ursel went through the court system he went before Harry Boyle. 
Members on the other side might say ``Here comes that Reformer. 
I know Diane quite well. 
What do we say about Judge Harry Boyle? 
Let us talk about Judge T. D. Devitt in Abbotsford, my hometown. 
He did about seven years out of the eleven he was supposed to serve. 
In this day and age I suppose that is a lot of time.  
The lawyers got together and tried to do a little plea bargaining. 
They got it down to molesting a couple of children. 
The man got no time in jail. 
I talked to the mother. 
She does not believe in the justice system. 
She does not believe in judges. 
Let me read some statements about William Gibson Brown. 
This comes from the parole board. 
He cannot or will not accept that he needs help. 
He would not guarantee that he would not offend again. 
He does not even deserve to be on the bench. 
That is what I would say.  
Let us look at Howie Slaunwhite. 
I talked to Howie the other day. 
That is what we would say. 
That is what Howie said.  
So Howie is guilty of assault. 
He should be debenched for such stupidity.  
I have so many issues I do not know where to start. 
You, sir, are a disgrace and should be debenched.  
He should not be sitting on the bench.  
We cannot forget Howard Wetson, the judge in Manitoba. 
Prisoners having the right to vote is absurd. 
They made a recommendation for open disciplinary hearings against judges to the public. 
Is that in Bill C-37? 
That came from the justice system itself. 
Is that in Bill C-37? 
There is something wrong with the mentality of this House today. 
There is a head in the sand approach. 
It is not about their integrity. 
It is all about this system of patronage which has become a national disgrace.  
I do not understand why we do not end political appointments. 
I do not know why we do not have more predictability in sentencing. 
He killed someone in 1991. 
Just ask me if that judge would get one red cent out of my pocket. 
I would have him debenched like the others I spoke about.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
This is not a ruling I am making. 
I make that as a point of interest to all hon. members.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
There was no one questioning the speech of the member for Langley-Abbotsford. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I take the hon. member's point under advisement.  
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
You were not even in here.  
The member is correct in reminding the House that I was here. 
I am pleased that the Chair did raise this to remind us. 
We should keep this in mind when dealing with an issue such as this.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Obviously I do not want to run afoul of your ruling, Mr. Speaker. 
I want to be very cautious in my approach.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to make two quick points on this. 
How are traditions set?  
Second, when we came here we could not even refer to the other place. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):
He makes good points. 
He mentioned a number of judges. 
He answered his own question when he referred to Brian Sanderson. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sorry, we have to keep going. 
The member for Langley-Abbotsford.  
There is no question about that.  
I am really not interested in which court they are. 
This is not brain surgery, it is reality.  
There are hundreds of thousands of people today who are concerned.  
I am here to represent the people of my community. 
Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
The problem is that they do not know. 
This hon. member smears all of them with his irresponsible remarks.  
He says that the work of the judges is important. 
The comments he has made in the last few minutes absolutely leave me abhorred.  
Let me just say a couple of things- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Langley-Abbotsford.  
He does not understand. 
After all, this is a Liberal government, is it not?  
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
Judges are civil servants. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
What is so hard about that?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
I think that is a valid question to ask.  
It is frightening, quite frankly. 
Part of it is the issue of decisions made by judges. 
We are to reward them and give them a raise. 
Some of these decisions cannot be defended. 
I believe that is what my colleague from Langley-Abbotsford was trying to show. 
Certainly that is not what I got from the speech. 
It is not just our saying it. 
We hear it every time we go back to our ridings.  
What is Bill C-37 all about? 
I do not have a problem with that. 
There is certainly a case to made for more resources in certain areas. 
I raised the question with the police chief the other night. 
It costs a lot of money to investigate criminal activity. 
Some of these investigations take years.  
I asked him what good it did. 
What message does that send?  
It is worse than doing nothing. 
What message is that sending?  
I am referring to accountability. 
There has to be some way in which they can be held accountable.  
Something is wrong with this picture. 
I do not know if members across the way are aware of this fact. 
Yet we are giving judges an 8.3% increase.  
There are some excellent judges. 
It is those other judges. 
It is just like people in this Chamber. 
It is the same old story. 
It is the few bad apples who spoil the reputation of all. 
Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
We just want to have them show some responsibility.  
We have to think this through. 
If we say that to judges, it is a measure of intimidation. 
Let me make one other point. 
He asked what is justice. 
It is a pretty profound question. 
I would like to ask a question in return. 
Is that what the members of the Reform Party are saying?  
The question of what is justice is very profound. 
And yes, it includes even those who commit a crime. 
We want them changed so they will lead a productive life eventually.  
Mr. Speaker, that was quite a rant. 
I will try to respond to some of the issues the hon. member raised.  
I think I dealt with that fairly extensively in my presentation.  
If we cannot raise these types of issues here, what does he want? 
Does he want us to sweep it under the carpet? 
That is what the Liberals have been doing for many years. 
They have been turning a blind eye to these things. 
Who are we to criticize the decisions made by judges?'' 
Well, if not us, then who?  
I think I laid it out quite clearly.  
My colleague talked about the death penalty. 
Obviously that does not sit well with the hon. member. 
We believe, unlike the government, in bottom up democracy. 
I personally support that. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
I would concur that all members indeed should be in favour of justice. 
There is a very serious injustice being discussed here.  
They want to know when the government will pay them what they are due. 
I see that as a very serious injustice, one which I think should be addressed. 
The member has raised the issue of equity. 
What about the crown prosecutors? 
We could run through a list of them and name them too. 
We are frustrated here too. Reformers are frustrated. 
Are they awake over there?  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
We talk about accountability. 
To whom are they accountable?  
To interpret that law.  
We tell the judges what to do by the law we pass in this place. 
We see open ended legislation where judges are allowed to decide. 
Judges do not like minimum sentences. 
We are told that judges do not like this. 
They want greater flexibility and I understand their rationale.  
We look at that. 
Should it carry a minimum four year sentence?  
What we have to do is draw a balance. 
Legislators should be doing that. 
We should not be allowing judges to tell us what to do. 
Yet that is what is happening.  
We could talk for hours about charter rights. 
Again, we look for a balance. 
My goodness, we saw what happened there. 
What do we have here? 
There is a supposed a raise in pay involved in this statute to the courts. 
Is that what we are arriving at? 
When this bill comes before the committee we are going to be calling witnesses. 
I eagerly await their answers to those kinds of questions.  
That is the direction it appears we are going in. 
We have to weigh that.  
We look at the fairness of the 8.5% increase or whatever it is. 
We had the Kim Hicks family in Parliament before Christmas. 
Judges are making approximately $140,000 a year now. 
If this raise goes through some judges will be making $150,000 or more. 
Is that not reasonable? 
The question of fairness and balance must enter into this. 
Why are we making an exception in this case? 
Do we start at the top when it comes to responding to salary demands? 
How do they feel? 
They want another 8%.  
Their remuneration is guaranteed.  
Their employment is guaranteed, assured. 
Their remuneration as well is guaranteed, assured. 
We do have a degree of responsibility. 
We do have a sense of responsibility in this area. 
We must guard the independence of our judiciary. 
I will look forward to the further examination of the bill. 
The bill does not provide for the appointment of additional judges. 
Because we have a court system that is clogged. 
Why do we have a court system that is clogged? 
There are 40,000 cases backlogged in B.C. alone.  
Why do we have a backlog? 
We saw 745, the faint hope clause. 
What did we have there? 
Instituted another level of appeal. 
They slow down the court cases.  
Cases are being thrown out. 
I want all members to take a very close look at this bill. 
The honouring of our judges should be automatic. 
It should come as a result of our being well served. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
They are very significant and important matters.  
There is the role of leadership to society. 
Would he comment on that?  
I want to thank my colleague for his question.  
We looked upon judges for that.  
I heard the debate earlier on and it was rankled and so on. 
It is so that we can examine those sensitive issues without fear or apprehension. 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
On the addition of the judges, we must support that. 
If I could put it this way, it is supportable.  
If that is a part of this bill, then what does it ultimately mean? 
We as a committee want to look at that. 
I will certainly be asking questions about it.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask my colleague a question. 
He alluded to his background. 
I too in various capacities served in this area. 
I am quite used to that procedure.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Crowfoot has 30 seconds for a response.  
I do not know if I can address his specific question.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The member's time has expired.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
I am going to cater my remarks to the supreme court.  
This case has profound implications. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
I would like to start with a definition of the word ``clone''. 
First a brief historical overview is necessary.  
There was no provision for the application of the Criminal Code.  
This clause is found in Bill C-247. 
Limits must be set, but what should those limits be? 
We see that the entire world is concerned by this problem.  
But any creation of embryos for research continues to be prohibited. 
Obviously, cloning raises a number of ethical and legal problems. 
Cloning does not seem to be a solution for ensuring the survival of our planet. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Give me a break, Mr. Speaker. 
I cannot see how that can be.  
That is how important this is.  
The question is where to draw the line. 
The line is right here before us today: ban human cloning.  
Sex selection for non-medical purposes.  
The cloning of human embryos.  
The creation of animal-human hybrids.  
Commercial pre-conception or surrogacy arrangements.  
Transfer of embryos between humans and other species.  
Research on human embryos later than 14 days after conception.  
Creation of embryos for research purposes only.  
The offer to provide or offer to pay for prohibited services.  
When scientists start playing God, everyone ought to be alarmed. 
Parliamentarians should be doing something about it now. 
This is another example of the misplaced priorities of the government.  
My hon. colleague from Wanuskewin spoke in favour of this bill. 
I read with interest the comments of the hon. member for Charlotte on this issue. 
Why should this be? 
This is the message Canadians want to hear from their government. 
I encourage the government to support this bill. 
Further, when it is passed, the government should propose amendments to strengthen it. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Our Constitution divides jurisdiction over health matters between federal and provincial governments. 
In one respect, the hon. member's bill is admirable. 
They are of great concern to all Canadians.  
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
This study had long been demanded by a Canadian coalition of feminist groups.  
That government bill contained an important flaw, however. 
It did not criminalize human cloning. 
However, since the election, the government has been slow to take action.  
In Quebec, consideration of the subject continued too. 
Mastering cell division meant better understanding the living, in his opinion.  
They have also enabled us to kill one another. 
To quote Liberation , ``the race to clone all species is on. 
A major industrial and medical undertaking''.  
Is this the type of society we want? 
I do not think so. 
We must reflect on this. 
Where do science and medicine stop? 
Where does the temptation to legitimize a eugenist project begin? 
It is a fine line.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is obviously a fascinating and interesting subject.  
They would like to do away with it all. 
This bill is almost an anomaly. 
It could go to committee. 
Let us do our homework on this.  
It is just opposition politics.  
We think it should go further.  
It does not go nearly far enough.  
This bill would indeed amend the Criminal Code. 
The Criminal Code contains provisions for general application. 
Perhaps there should be a way of addressing those concerns. 
Do we really want to cross that line that I have heard other members mention? 
I would suggest that is very critical. 
I have to ask hon. members opposite why the push all of a sudden. 
It is absolutely critical that takes place. 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
We have waited long enough for the Liberal government to act. 
My colleague, the hon. member for Mississauga West, asked members in opposition to wait. 
He wants members to wait. 
Does he want us to wait until after human cloning has begun?  
That is why we are addressing this concern today.  
The whole issue of timing is important. 
How present is the danger and fear about the possibility of cloning humans? 
That is why my hon. colleague is bringing the bill forward. 
It is critical to address the issue now. 
The list of activities specifically mentions cloning. 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
There has been evidence that cloning of human embryos is technically possible. 
However, there is no evidence that germ-line genetic alteration is being carried out.  
This is still justice's position and that of the government.  
However, the second bill was never introduced.  
I will not discuss the merits of the proposed prohibitions. 
The proper place for such prohibitions is in the principal legislation.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
There is a lot at stake here. 
This is not about bikers riding around on their motorcycles. 
This is about money. 
This is about big business which is illegal. 
This is about the sale of illicit drugs.  
We owe them our full protection.  
Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the member for Waterloo-Wellington for his question. 
The government has done numerous things. 
In 1996 we implemented the Witness Protection Act. 
In 1997 we implemented the Criminal Law Improvement Act. 
The most recent thing we did was implement the anti-gang legislation.  
However the responsibility and the jurisdiction for enforcement falls with the local authorities.  
We consider all threats to the safety of police officers a very serious matter. 
I want to thank the hon. member again for his question.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
Judge Thomas' words are clear and unambiguous. 
Judge Thomas stated ``the fishery was not lawfully open to anyone''.  
Yet the minister has done just that. 
That is the rule of law.  
This country and this Parliament is founded on the rule of law. 
Currently 30 fishermen are before the courts on trumped up charges. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The time has expired.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
DFO is not defying the court. 
This decision does not cancel the aboriginal fisheries strategy. 
The judge's comments were taken seriously by the minister. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.39 p.m.)
