The Honourable Marcel Prud'homme, P.C. 
Felicitations on Thirty-fifth Anniversary in Parliament 
Hon. Orville H. Phillips :
Senator Prud'homme is a lawyer by profession. 
I agree with that statement wholeheartedly.  
Congratulations, Senator Prud'homme!  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
That was back in 1964. 
Senator Prud'homme was, and is, very articulate. 
His greatest passion is for Canada. 
Senator Phillips has mentioned Senator Prud'homme's interest in international affairs. 
Was it a secret ballot?  
It was not a secret ballot. 
I have been closer to him than all of you.  
At that time, I did not know him.  
A Montrealer who did not know Quebec City! 
Jean Lesage got a record number of delegates from Montreal.  
After that, he became an MP in 1964. 
Those three positions gave him three votes. 
I arrived in the Liberal Party of Canada in 1978 as its director.  
He and I put together a team of young people. 
The evening of the convention, everyone wanted to nominate someone right away. 
Marcel wanted to have two young people submit my name. 
He got the signatures right away. 
That was how I came to work for the Liberal Party of Canada.  
He replied "He is not interested. 
Every time I ask him, he turns me down." 
We know why that was, he wanted a monument. 
So Marcel said to me "Tell him I am not interested." 
It was the same when they wanted to offer him a Senate appointment. 
I thought about you today, Marcel. 
I met Prime Minister Jean Chretien. 
I am going to read you a message from him: 
I wish you many more years as a senator. 
We both started out at almost the same time. 
Honourable senators, like Senator Prud'homme, I will try to be very brief. 
I have known Marcel for over 40 years. 
We have had the pleasure of working together in various political activities. 
There are not enough pot-stirrers in this world; we need many more. 
Hon. Therese Lavoie-Roux :
In August, in our respective ridings, we have the Santa Anna festival. 
Marcel issued my first invitation. 
Marcel is an old friend. 
I support their comments. 
Above all, I wish him good health. 
Take good care of yourself, otherwise you may regret it. 
I wish you many more years in the Senate, Marcel. 
Thank you for your friendship.  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Believe it or not, I shall be brief because we have work to do.  
He has been in the Senate for 36 continuous years.  
I was with him in London and in South Asia. 
I learned from him, and I am richer for it. 
I thank him for his kindness.  
I thank my longtime friend, Leonce Mercier. 
Therese Lavoie-Roux spoke of the festival of Santa Anna.  
Santa Anna is a great celebration in the Italian community. 
For 30 years I have made sure that I do not miss it. 
The procession is in August, right in the middle of the summer. 
That is also celebrated in the middle of the summer.  
People wish to be themselves under the Canadian flag. 
We must understand that.  
My thanks to those who have been kind enough to say a few words. 
I will do my best to live up to them. 
We may not share the same opinions.  
That is what I learned.  
It is amazing how quickly 35 years have gone by. 
I feel truly honoured to see all my colleagues. 
I think I know at least 95 per cent of them.  
It was quite an experience. 
Senator Chalifoux is a new addition.  
I have just a bit of gossip. 
I said I would not speak for long.  
Honourable senators, thank you for helping to celebrate. 
I will return your kindness many times over. 
As Senator Bacon said, I always give more than I take.  
Atomic Energy of Canada 
Safety of Nuclear Technology and Disposal of Waste 
Hon. Lois M. Wilson :
The Honourable Sergio Marchi responded by saying: 
However, on one critical point some confusion remains.  
The panel report stated: 
We stated that as clearly as we could in our report. 
Many scientific caveats were also expressed.  
By the time you get to the end of the circle, the message is distorted.  
I trust he will be as good as his word.  
Afghanistan-Plight of Girls and Women 
Since 1996, a radical Islamic group has held power in that country. 
The Taliban regime has instituted a systematic campaign to erase the identity of women. 
Their freedom, dignity and physical well-being have been obliterated.  
Women are being marginalized. 
Schools for girls have been closed. 
The law does not protect Afghan women. 
The Taliban's young and often illiterate enforcers are a law unto themselves. 
Men hold the power of life and death over female relatives. 
For some women, the only escape is suicide. 
Even among the fundamentalist regimes, the Taliban leaders are extremists. 
In the past, Afghan women enjoyed relative freedom. 
Women were to be found at the top levels of Afghanistan's civil service.  
This limits our direct influence, and we must find other ways to register our protest. 
We must continue to protest this appalling situation. 
Hon. Wilbert J. Keon :
These are now well identified and are preventable to a large degree.  
Parliamentary Group of Friends of UNESCO 
Hon. Rose-Marie Losier-Cool :
More than 1,200 NGOs cooperate with UNESCO.  
Youth Unemployment and Debt Load of Graduating Students 
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson :
Honourable senators, the latest report on domestic job growth is good news. 
Youth are not fully participating in Canada's stronger economic performance.  
However, we must make education more affordable.  
The adverse side effects of high caffeine consumption on adults are well known.  
However, that is only part of the picture. 
In Canada, we are already drinking 25 per cent more soft drinks than milk.  
Many health advocates strongly disagree.  
That is the crux of the problem. 
The parallels with rBST are striking. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Thursday next, February 11, 1999, I will move: 
That the committee present its final report no later than December 17, 1999; and 
Search and Rescue Helicopter Replacement Program-Request for Update 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Shall I read them to the honourable senator?  
Senator Forrestall can read them into the record if he so wishes. 
It was number three - after the Labradors and Sea Kings.  
This was done on the recommendation of our Armed Forces. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I bring these matters to his attention on a regular basis. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The National Post reported today that: 
"The decision (not to go) was made before the holiday...The 
Would the Leader of the Government in the Senate care to respond to that?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
He is an outstanding soldier and an outstanding leader. 
Those are the facts and nothing but the facts.  
These have a consistent thread.  
We were not even listed. 
Essentially, our representation by the Minister of Foreign Affairs was ignored. 
That letter, printed in the Jordan Times , stated, in part: 
Symbolism in the Middle East runs deeply. 
Seemingly small details are rich with significance. 
Furthermore, Prime Minister Chretien had a personal visit with the Jordanian ambassador. 
Were they all skiing?  
As well, in this hemisphere, a number of countries were represented by ambassadors. 
It would be inappropriate to speculate on the reasons for those absences. 
Plight of the Homeless 
Hon. Erminie J. Cohen :
It would have given these people some semblance of hope.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham , Leader of the Government:
Honourable senators, the answer to that is "yes." 
It is more pronounced in some areas than in others.  
Business of the Senate 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Canada Customs and Revenue Agency Bill 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motin?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Bill To Amend-Motion To Concur With Message From Commons-Debate Adjourned 
That act concerns very complex issues. 
Other points were raised in submissions made to the Senate Banking Committee. 
Let us be clear about what is being proposed. 
Bill C-20, (Whistle-blower Provisions) 
Bill C-20, once enacted, will put an end to many of these practices.  
I know that members of that committee will want to deal with the matter expeditiously.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, we already have a motion already before the house. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
On motion of Senator Lynch-Staunton, debate adjourned.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
