Business of the Senate 
Monday, September 13, 1999 
The Senate met at 4:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Status of Plans for Proposed New War Museum 
This raises a more fundamental question. 
Dr. Jack Granatstein, Director of the War Museum, stated: 
We are convinced the veterans want this. 
My seat-mate, Senator Balfour, is chairman of the Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs. 
That prospect should concentrate the mind of some past and future witnesses.  
Senate hearings should not be necessary. 
Together they celebrated our language, their aspirations and the dreams they shared.  
Response to Request for Flag Pins 
Hon. Thelma J. Chalifoux :
He wrote that we, as senators, listen to ordinary Canadians.  
They provide so many basic services for the crews. 
The response has been overwhelming. 
Hon. Lois M. Wilson :
It also included three delegates from civil society. 
We look for an integrated strategy in this area very soon.  
Bloc Quebecois Definition of Quebecers 
Hon. Jean-Robert Gauthier :
For me, a Quebecer is someone who lives in Quebec. 
For them, it is something else. 
The September 11 La Presse ran an article with the following headline: 
Bloc Quebecois Buries French Canadian Nation 
The BQ identity defining document said the following: 
There is no longer a French Canadian nation in Quebec. 
To my knowledge, Quebec is still part of Canada. 
The French Canadian nation is far from dead. 
Supreme Court of Canada 
Announcement by Chief Justice of Intended Resignation-Notice of Inquiry 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Does the minister have an update on that matter for us?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Yes, honourable senators, I will be tabling the document not later than tomorrow.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I thank the honourable senator for his question. 
I thank the honourable senator for that answer.  
Policy on Arranging Flights for Civilians on CF-18 Aircraft 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
I know my colleague Senator Atkins would love to take such a flight. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I see Senator Robertson smiling. 
She must have been up on a flight herself.  
I was in attendance with my grandchildren Saturday afternoon at the Shearwater Air Base. 
Cormorant was paying for them.  
They were also taking people for demonstration rides on the Bison land vehicles. 
I do not know that that would be accurate. 
Status of Plans for Proposed New War Museum 
I should like to ask a couple of questions about the Canadian War Museum. 
Have requests for proposals gone out? 
Exactly what is the government's plan as of today?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Is this a settled policy? 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
As far as the government is concerned, it is full steam ahead.  
Manitoba-Seizure of Assets of Individual for Non-payment of Taxes 
This particular action shows what happens when too much power is given to government institutions. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Yes, honourable senators, I would put my best efforts forward. 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
These considerations would come under the general heading of medical requirements. 
I come back to my first question. 
However, that is another question for another day.  
Are we ready to play that role?  
Honourable senators, the answer to such a question could cover a lot of ground. 
I personally watched our peacekeepers in Namibia. 
I have seen them in Nicaragua and other countries. 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Honourable senators, I wish to be clear on the answers given to my colleague. 
Honourable senators, I will find that out.  
I do not know if that has yet been determined, Senator Nolin. 
However, I shall attempt to find out at the earliest possible time. 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Canadian Environmental Protection Bill, 1999 
Third Reading-Vote Deferred on Motion in Amendment-Point of Order 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
I thank the Honourable Senator Lynch-Staunton for raising the matter. 
I will look into it immediately.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Our rule 23(4) states: 
A hoist motion is included within the category of dilatory motions.  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, I am trying to follow what is being asked for here. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Public Sector Pension Investment Board Bill 
Third Reading-Debate Continued 
I have difficulty seeing the logic of that argument. 
Ask the fishermen on the East and West Coasts. 
Their retirement benefits are non-existent. 
The issue here is how this fund will be used. 
The surplus could indeed be directed to such a worthy need. 
However, there is a danger in adding to benefit packages. 
Senator Lawson's comments were certainly right on. 
As a child, I lived for 15 years in an isolated post. 
My father was the only officer. 
He was on duty 24 hours a day. 
In those 15 years, I never saw him out of uniform. 
Ownership of the surplus will be determined in the courts. 
That is a different fight and one that I shall pursue.  
A dead bill goes nowhere. 
Honourable senators, I congratulate Senator Christensen on her maiden speech.  
Honourable senators, I should be pleased to respond.  
I must tell you that my father retired from the RCMP in 1949. 
I was in grade seven or eight at the time. 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
In so doing, she referred to my speech of Friday morning. 
Does the honourable senator have any thoughts on that?  
That is where I have some difficulty.  
The judges said in the appeal court - 
Maiden speeches are not questioned.  
We did not question your maiden speech.  
On motion of Senator Andreychuk, debate adjourned.  
Canadian Environmental Protection Bill, 1999 
Third Reading-Motion in Amendment-Vote Deferred 
Hon. Thelma J. Chalifoux :
Honourable senators, I am my own person. 
Honourable senators, personally, I view this bill as a living document. 
This is not spelled out in this legislation.  
The definition of "aboriginal land" must be reviewed. 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Does the honourable senator support what Senator Hays said?  
I met with Gerald Morin this morning concerning this bill. 
I explained everything to him, and he was of the same opinion.  
Has she read it?  
I will make a speech tomorrow and refer to that decision at length. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I regret that I must interrupt the debate. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Honourable Senator Ghitter moved, seconded by Honourable Senator Cochrane: 
I rule that the motion in amendment is in order.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
I am very confused. 
The bells must ring; let them ring.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
We have three minutes. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I refer the honourable senator to Beauchesne. 
The hoist is an amendment and, therefore, is debatable. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I do not know where that information came from. 
This is a constant difficulty, both for myself and for the Table Officers. 
However, it is not for me to interfere. 
This is something that possibly we should consider as a Senate. 
Now, is it for us to interfere? 
That is the point that the Senate must resolve for itself.  
Let us speak beyond 15 minutes, while we are at it. 
Ignore the rules completely. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Motion in amendment negatived on the following division: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The question now before the Senate is the motion for third reading.  
I am not the only one to hold this view. 
I wish to make that point.  
That is our only option. 
The Senate might have performed an outstanding service to the country. 
The opportunity was lost to expediency.  
In their excellent brief they stated: 
What about the Inuit Tapirisat of Canada? 
Is this just an exaggeration?  
There are 33 boxes on it.  
The Canadian Institute of Child Health set it out clearly: 
Among them, influences from the environment rate highly....Exposures 
However, it is not a question of emphasis, honourable senators. 
It was a key issue for them. 
They told us that. 
They were quite above board.  
Therefore, clause 65.1 is effectively irrelevant. 
I will not repeat them. 
We also agree with the 1993 Red Book where it states that: 
We saw a mill in Saskatchewan that had no effluent at all. 
It attracted customers from Europe because it was a closed-loop process. 
We need to stop using them and producing them as by-products. 
There are not many of them. 
Just a dozen have been identified. 
Industry developed replacement chemicals that are not as harmful. 
Already we have seen the impact of that change. 
It is as simple as that.  
I also wish to raise - 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Are you requesting leave?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I wish to set out what is at stake.  
This is a new kind of biotechnology. 
This is not the traditional breeding that we have had for years. 
It breaches the walls of species.  
Governments have been making a large investment in biotechnology. 
Of course, it would be a very bad thing for Third World countries.  
Debate in Europe over biotechnology has been intense. 
To give you a few, we do know that genetically engineered products can be toxic. 
If cabinet rules that other regulations are equivalent, that will be conclusive proof.  
That is a different thing, because biotechnology may affect bio-diversity. 
Cabinet now has that authority. 
There is a great deal of infighting going on.  
The relationship between a regulator and the regulated - 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, it is six o'clock.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
The government acted prematurely. 
This is a most unusual procedure.  
Health Canada will assess the health aspects.  
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is under the auspices of the Department of Agriculture. 
Bill C-32 is an extraordinary bill. 
This legislation affects many treaties. 
Honourable senators, is it necessary that I read each amendment into the record?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is it agreed that the amendments need not be read?  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
It is moved by the Honourable Senator Spivak, seconded by the Honourable Senator Cochrane: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
On motion of Senator Kinsella, debate adjourned.  
Motion for Allotment of Time for Debate Adopted On Division 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is there agreement, honourable senators?  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
However, they have indicated that they are prepared to do so. 
I believe that Senators Cochrane and Buchanan, in particular, would like to speak.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I saw Senator Prud'homme rise.  
Honourable senators, we have just agreed to three hours of debate.  
I do not oppose the agreement which has been reached. 
Senator Carstairs informed me of it. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
They should be back soon. 
We need to make enough copies for all honourable senators.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I move the motion standing in my name.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
That pursuant to rule 39 not more than a further six hours of debate - 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will all those honourable senators in favour of the motion please say "yea."  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will all those honourable senators opposed to the motion please say "nay."  
The Hon. the Speaker :
In my opinion the "yeas" have it.  
Motion agreed to, on division.

( i ) in clause 347, 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, we are now back to debate on Bill C-32.  
Are there other senators who wish to speak?  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, His Honour is quite right, we are certainly rewriting the rule book now. 
The notice of motion has been passed. 
I think Senator Murray is quite right. 
What did we pass?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The time allocation motion has now passed. 
That is my understanding of the status of things.  
How much time do we have to debate?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
After six hours of debates, will all the questions be put?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
There could be a number of amendments, I understand. 
Each of them would have to be dealt with at that time.  
Is that as clear as it can be, honourable senators?  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Will all six hours of debate be taking place tonight?  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Is that what we should all understand?  
It would be preferable if these agreements were better explained. 
I will speak now as if I were a new senator:
Everyone wants to understand what is going on. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Yes, this debate will finish tonight.  
When will the vote take place?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
However, it cannot go beyond six hours.  
I am in His Honour's hands, Your Honour. 
I am trying to be accommodating and understanding.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I have no idea what other speakers there might be. 
That is all I can tell the honourable senator. 
The debate cannot go more than six hours in any case.  
Haste never produces good legislation. 
That is something we must avoid.  
That is all I am asking. 
Honourable senators, perhaps we can clarify this. 
I agree that it is very muddy.  
Senator Spivak's amendments are now being distributed. 
My understanding is that other senators might have amendments. 
It is the Senate that should be satisfied.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
However, I cannot do that until I receive the amendments.  
That is up to each senator who has amendments to propose. 
I cannot do that. 
That might be a solution that those senators who wish to make amendments might entertain.  
The majority in this chamber supported that position. 
That is where we stand now. 
That is my position. 
The date, September 14, should not have been there.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I refer to rule 39(7), which states: 
Therefore, I would need to have leave of the Senate to proceed with any amendments. 
I caution you now. 
His Honour is quite correct. 
Under the rules of the chamber, there cannot be any amendments. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I should like to make a few remarks about this bill. 
The committee hearings on this bill were cut short. 
My colleagues have given you the details of those shortcomings. 
I implore honourable senators to improve it.  
In her testimony to our committee, she said: 
We are dealing here with dangers that cannot often be seen or identified.  
Inevitably, they will swallow some of that water. 
We heard horror stories about it. 
Their children are ill and they have been sentenced to an early death.  
They spend their week-days in schools days adjacent to all of this contamination.  
Families everywhere do what they can to protect their children from harm. 
There are unknown dangers with unknown effects that cannot be seen. 
Therefore, honourable senators, I move: 
"Children's Environmental Health Protection Commission 
(6) The objects of the Commission include 
( b ) to ensure that current scientific information is peer-reviewed and widely disseminated; 
As well, honourable senators, I move: 
Hon. Fernand Robichaud (The Hon. the Acting Speaker) :
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
The following are the main provisions in this bill that concern aboriginal peoples.  
According to Michael Anderson, a researcher for the Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak, and I quote: 
They also apply to determine which community will be eligible to sit on the committee.  
According to the bill, these will be harmonized with federal and provincial environmental programs.  
You will conclude, as I did, that 14 First Nations is not a large number. 
Under the new legislation, the provisions apply with respect to aboriginal lands. 
Parliament cannot overlook them. 
According to Jody Pierce from the British Columbia Metis council, and I quote: 
I am now getting to that brief review.  
The court added, and I quote: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted for him to continue, honourable senators?  
These are not small imperfections. 
I object to that. 
The Supreme Court reminded the federal government of its rights and obligations. 
Parliament must respect these rights. 
That is what it must do.  
It is quite obvious to me that the bill is flawed. 
And in French, it says: 
It would seem obvious to me. 
The committee heard from a linguistic jurist, a rather unusual profession. 
The English version does not mean the same thing. 
The French version is much more comprehensive than the English version. 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
d ) un representant pour les Metis choisi par le ralliement national des Metis.  
In the other official language, and I quote: 
You will note that there is an additional amendment in English. 
That amendment is self-explanatory.  
"each of the provinces;"; and 
( d ) one representative for all Metis selected by the Metis National Council.".  
I am going to read it to you in English.  
"postponing effective measures to prevent".  
The Hon. the Speaker :
It was moved by the Honourable Senator Nolin and seconded by the Honourable Senator Spivak: 
That Bill C-32 be not now read a third time - 
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Honourable Senator Nolin.  
Can you confirm that contradiction in the French language? 
In the French version, the measures would not necessarily be cost-effective. 
In fact, they could be costing more than other measures and still be "effectives." 
I will repeat what I said in French, and I will try to be clear. 
In English, every measure needs to be cost-effective.  
Mr. Perez was the witness representing the Canadian Petroleum Products Institute. 
That response tells us a lot. 
The industry wanted to include the positive, cost-effective measure. 
No one has looked at the French version except the Senate. 
It is our job to correct that.  
Honourable senators, I have another question for Senator Nolin.  
Cost-effectiveness may prevent implementation of the precautionary principle.  
My question is hypothetical. 
That definition could cost a great deal more. 
The best way to make good laws is to say as little as possible.  
Do not try to say too much. 
You want measures that are "efficace," not "effectives." 
"Efficace" is the proper word because "effectives" means that it produces an effect. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, is there a connection with the famous Rio Declaration? 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
This has occurred in two earlier instances. 
Thirty years ago, cause and effect linked smoking with cancer. 
The same thing occurred with the lead poisoning issue.  
They will not vote to change the bill. 
So why are we here? 
I will tell you why we are here.  
Honourable senators, this is bad legislation. 
Bad legislation should be corrected to make it good legislation. 
I want to tell him that I watched what was going on in that committee. 
I broke it down to three situations. 
First of all, it is bad legislation. 
I will explain to you in a minute why.  
Second, witnesses who came there had been hoodwinked. 
I will explain that later as well.  
How is legislation good or bad or in between? 
The report of the committee was emasculated by the government.  
A letter from another large company, Alcan, was made public after the vote. 
Yes, I think that may be right.  
So what did the government do? 
They were not aware of this particular letter from Alcan to the Prime Minister. 
That is why they did it. 
I look at the front bench here and I see member former cabinet ministers. 
I have dealt with many cabinet ministers. 
What was the end result? 
You can laugh, but you know it is true. 
Even Senator Kenny knows it is true!  
The witnesses were ignored. 
Is she your friend?  
Her mother is a good friend of mine. 
This matter will be looked at now because I am going to the Senate committee. 
Did she ever vote for you, Senator Buchanan?  
No. You knew the answer to that question.  
In a political sense, do you know what is at stake here? 
The credibility of the Senate. 
They will listen to us. 
He was only on the job for five days!  
In other words, he is saying, "I agree that this is bad legislation."  
No. This was not in a letter.  
He also wrote a letter.  
After he realized that he had made a mistake, maybe. 
But it was too late.  
He knows it is bad.  
He is respecting Senator Spivak's comments!  
He said that "the existing Bill C-88 is better. 
I think we can live with it." 
What does that mean, Senator Taylor? 
He says, "We can live with that. 
We will live with the existing one until you do that." 
That is sound reasoning on behalf of the minister. 
In other words, he is saying: "Let us not pass bad legislation. 
"Consensus" is always a good word. 
It is appropriate to use that word here. 
What is happening here with the political process? 
They can do it because they have a majority. 
We had barely even started to hear witnesses. 
He had not even heard one of them yet. 
That is how ridiculous the situation is.  
This is bad legislation. 
The political process has been damaged; it has been torpedoed. 
We are not destroyed yet, though; I can tell you that. 
That is why we are here. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
A regular minute or a Buchanan minute?  
As usual, I am at your disposal.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
I thank Honourable Senator De Bane. 
That is not true. 
What did we have to do in this case? 
In the words of Sir John A. Macdonald: 
That is what he said.  
I ask you one question. 
What was the rush? 
The answer from the minister: "Oh, well, look, I want this over with. 
I want it done. 
It has been in the House of Commons now for years." 
Why close out the Senate? 
Why tell the Senate what to do? 
Because they want to prorogue Parliament. 
Good legislation is more important. 
Do not let me hear you saying, "Oh, but then it will take years again." 
The government, however, has decided.  
Make this a better bill. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
I take my clue. 
Then I look for an answer back. 
If there is no answer back, then I am not in doubt.  
I have had the privilege and pleasure of working with Charles Caccia. 
I want to pay homage to him. 
He is opinionated and stubborn. 
For a while, he was the chairman of the International Parliamentary Union. 
I do not want to make a long and passionate speech. 
I see that the end is coming, and I regret it. 
He is highly respected.  
The Senate chose not to continue the debate.  
Some of our new senators probably already find this place to be partisan. 
I hope that some day we will not be afraid to take our responsibility. 
Parliament is two houses: the House of Commons and the Senate. 
I want to ensure that the new senators understand that we are members of Parliament. 
We must set the record straight.  
Senators want to proceed, to my regret. 
This was a good opportunity for senators not to vote along party lines. 
That will not happen this time, so we wait for the next opportunity.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I have three sets of amendments. 
The latest set was proposed by Senator Nolin, seconded by Senator Spivak. 
The previous set was proposed by Senator Cochrane, seconded by Senator Robertson. 
The first set of amendments was proposed by Senator Spivak, seconded by Senator Cochrane.  
I am sure that His Honour has read all the amendments. 
If he is satisfied with that, we can proceed in that manner.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I wish I could answer the Honourable Senator Prud'homme.  
That is agreeable to us. 
On others, it will not be necessary to have a standing vote.  
With agreement, there will be a half-hour bell.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The procedure in which we are engaged is totally irregular. 
Thus, this is the way we are doing our business.  
I shall proceed to the first question before the Senate. 
It was moved by the Honourable Senator Nolin, seconded by the Honourable Senator Spivak: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those honourable senators in favour of the amendment please say "yea"?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those honourable senators opposed to the amendment please say "nay"?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I declare the "nays" have it. 
The amendment is defeated.  
And two senators having risen.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
So I read your amendments and was told to dispense. 
So I did not read both amendments. 
We have had two honourable senators rise. 
We are calling for a standing vote. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
A standing vote has been requested.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
In this regard, I speak just for myself. 
To do otherwise would be arrogant.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
The vote will be held at 8:35.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Shall I dispense with the reading of the amendments?  
Motions in amendment (Senator Nolin) negatived on the following division: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
There are three different amendments here. 
I have been asked to deal with them separately.  
( a ) in the preamble, on page 2 - 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motions in amendment?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Those honourable senators in favour of the motion in amendment will please say "yea."  
The Hon. the Speaker:
Those honourable senators opposed to the motion in amendment will please say "nay."  
The Hon. the Speaker :
In my opinion, the "nays" have it. 
I declare the motion in amendment lost.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
With leave, we can do whatever we want. 
The alternative is to have the vote immediately.  
We should have it next Wednesday.  
I think the agreement was that it would be immediate. 
Honourable senators knew that when they had the original half-hour bell.  
I do not mean to be difficult. 
I would object very strenuously to that. 
I think the bells should ring for at least a few minutes.  
Hence, we made an agreement that we would allow four amendments. 
I would agree with His Honour's suggestion.  
Honourable senators, I think the government will get what it wants tonight. 
We should not be stubborn for the sake of five, six, or seven minutes. 
Senator Murray is right in standing up.
