The House met at 10 a.m. 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
They are concerned that it has not announced any moratorium. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
The petition has to do with human rights. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ) moved: 
This government wants to arrive and say ``We have the solutions''. 
It has no solutions, it created the problems. 
This spending power is how the government has managed to intrude everywhere. 
Members should remember 1982, when Quebec was isolated. 
Remember the smell in the kitchens of the Chateau Laurier. 
These people know how to reward their friends. 
We are not even talking about surpluses anymore. 
As a result of all this, we now have a $600 billion debt. 
We should be singing their praises. 
The amount has dropped from $19 billion to $12 billion or $12.5 billion. 
The government wants us to believe these people added $7 billion. 
Please let me know when I am nearing the end of it.  
Are provincial leaders being told that they are irresponsible? 
That they lack compassion? 
These folks have been running health care in Canada for 132 years. 
Everything was fine until transfer payments were cut.  
Ottawa will take care of it. 
It is the old ``Ottawa knows best'' song. 
We know how this government likes to meddle in other people's business.  
Yet Saskatoon has given them.  
They are also committed to invest all of the money in health care. 
We would get some applause. 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
It seems quite clear to me.  
The role of the federal government regarding health care is to redistribute money. 
He sings a different tune now. 
Whatever happened to these nice principles of freedom of action and respect for jurisdiction? 
This is not the sovereignists talking, but the Canadian Medical Association.  
In a press release on August 5, 1998, the Canadian health care association said: 
William Robson, senior political analyst at the C.D. Howe Institute, said: 
These are not our words. 
However, the federal government is again reverting to old reflexes: arrogance and encroachment.  
I am going to conclude, because I have one minute left.  
Since I have only one minute left, I wish to propose the following amendment: 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order on another matter. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
ALLOTTED DAY-HEALTH CARE 
The House resumed consideration of the motion and the amendment.  
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on the opposition motion before us.  
This means that they, the provinces and territories, have the responsibility for negotiating with physicians. 
Poll after poll indicates great public support for these national principles. 
Health care is a unifying factor in this country. 
The Canada Health Act is the foundation of medicare. 
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
The hon. member says the provinces are primarily responsible for the management side of things. 
This is what I find unacceptable.  
Those people, as an example, are the Inuit, our first nations and other groups. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it was a fascinating discourse from my colleague across the way.  
The Bloc members have made it very plain. 
But worldwide we have aging populations. 
We really have fairly restrictive policies in Canada when it comes to a safety valve.  
I give the Liberals a bit of respect on this issue. 
They are really quite sneaky in the way they did this. 
In other words, their actions speak much louder than than their words.  
It is easy to compare Canada with other countries. 
These statistics really do not tell the story. 
I received a letter this morning from a Manitoba women. 
She was diagnosed with possible bladder cancer. 
She needed an MRI. 
The diagnosis was cancer. 
The treatment was therefore available to her in a short period of time.  
Liberal government cuts to Ontario alone have totalled $3 billion. 
That is a fascinating indictment. 
The provinces know where the important programs are. 
I still do not know why they were cut.  
This is a warning for my colleagues across the way. 
There have been three polls conducted in the last five months since October 1998. 
Let us compare that with 10 years ago. 
Ten years ago the exact same question was asked. 
However, another poll was just done by Pollaro. 
This was done for the Coalition of National Voluntary Organizations and Merck Frosst Canada. 
The first question asked:
Does it need a minor tune-up? 
Does it need major repairs? 
Forty-five per cent of Canadians said that it needs major repairs. 
The last question asked:
The public, however, is going to drive this debate. 
This will not be driven by politicians, by the medical profession or by the bureaucrats. 
The patient will come first.  
The Bloc Quebecois says no to such conditions, as do Albertans and Reformers. 
It has nothing to do with the Constitution. 
A change is needed in Canada.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank my Reform Party colleague for his excellent speech.  
I am wondering about the government members. 
Then they tell us they will give some of the money back. 
This is why the provinces are putting up a united front on this issue.  
This statement is quite clear and I will be supporting it.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
I listened very carefully to what my Bloc and Reform colleagues had to say. 
The figure used by my Reform colleague was something in the neighbourhood of $16 billion. 
It is very large. 
I differ with the Bloc on its motion. 
It is not a motion that the NDP can support. 
However it does not do that.  
I listened very carefully to both the Bloc spokespersons and my Reform colleague. 
Neither one of them ever uttered the words Canada Health Act. 
Neither one of them ever uttered the words national standards. 
I do not think this is a coincidence. 
It is not a position that is held by the New Democratic Party. 
We will vote against the motion.  
I support the Canada Health Act. 
I was here at the time it was created. 
There are two things I have to say to the Liberals in this regard. 
I will not go into who was the health critic at that time.  
This is the heinous political crime being visited upon Canadian history by the Liberals.  
It is not surprising because there has been a deterioration in service. 
They all have stories to tell. 
It is not that long ago as politics go. 
Mr. Gerard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):
The members of the National Assembly of Quebec are not a bunch of boy scouts. 
They are not a bunch of losers. 
They are capable of managing and they have a mandate to do so. 
The nationalist movement in Quebec has always been a bit of an ideological grab bag. 
But there is nothing like that in the motion.  
Any motion which calls that into question is unsupportable.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
They should have spelled this out.  
The message we get is: without any new condition, but under the existing rules. 
The Bloc did not do its homework as well as it should have. 
There is something missing. 
However, they do not mention any amount. 
Do they want to have $6 billion more for the provinces or $2 billion? 
Should it be over two, three, or five years? 
However, I think our New Democratic friend went a little far. 
In the future, I think the drafting could be a little more professional. 
I think this is going a bit far too. 
I would like to say why we are debating this today. 
The budget is of course coming up in a few weeks. 
This is the federal government's idea. 
As you can see, this could backfire.  
This thing about conditions came up after the Saskatoon agreement. 
Will the amount of money be set today? 
There is a danger of this becoming a stumbling block today. 
I have absolutely nothing against the Canadian flag, I am a federalist. 
Health is about the public interest. 
It is time for the ground rules to be clarified. 
There are disputes about jurisdiction. 
We will be supporting the Bloc Quebecois motion. 
My colleague said we should get our money back without any precondition. 
And then in 1993 perfection dropped to two members.  
I would like him to elaborate further on this.  
This is near perfection. 
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
He should have thought about that before''. 
That is the reality we live in. 
That is why I am in favour of transfers. 
We are getting less than 25 per cent of what we were getting before.  
I ask my colleague if he- 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
We are not having this debate to go after the Liberal government. 
We want to avoid repeating the battles of the past. 
We want patients to spend the least amount of time possible in emergency rooms. 
That is the reason behind this kind of motion.  
The basic principles are being changed. 
Yes, indeed without any strings attached. 
It let us deal with the cuts. 
In our case, in the Lower St. Lawrence region, the figure would be $34 million.  
I must disagree with the hon. member for Chicoutimi. 
There is a model in place in Quebec. 
This shows there are successes. 
These are examples of things that are working.  
It has been necessary to make cuts in the last few years. 
We got through that. 
Now the federal government has the money. 
It is taking its time. 
And how should that be done? 
There is something wrong with the government's attitude. 
We are here to show that you do not have this double legitimacy.  
Increasing them, means raising them.  
The people have understood that. 
Well we know that they are coming for the most part from the federal government. 
The Canada social transfer was meant to be unconditional. 
Let them deal with the cuts. 
There is a fundamental problem with this Parliament. 
There must be targeted consultations. 
It is not right to take them hostage. 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
The Canada Health Act requires the provinces to adhere to these five principles. 
The federal government is not giving us anything. 
The motion does not trivialize the five Canadian tenets. 
That is not its purpose. 
The Government of Quebec has never asked that legislation be set aside. 
This government has not always done so. 
This may explain why those on the other side are so nit-picking. 
They behave differently themselves.  
We do not have money to burn in that area. 
We do not have money to burn these days. 
We cannot wait to invest in the right programs.  
This is also a cry from the heart. 
We want to strengthen existing programs. 
This is the meaning of the motion we introduced in the House today. 
It aims at bringing the government to abide by its own Constitution.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
It reads as follows: 
The reason is rather obvious.  
So they told the provinces: ``We are cutting $6 billion. 
The federal government wanted to show what a good sport it was. 
However, they were not so worried about visibility a few years back.  
Let me make a suggestion. 
Maybe they could use billboards. 
On top of that, premiers have made a clear commitment. 
It is still in effect. 
There are very severe penalties for those provinces who do not respect the act. 
I know there is an ongoing dispute about that. 
The federal government wants to increase its role. 
The network is established according to a plan. 
This planning is the responsibility of the Government of Quebec, which delivers health services. 
This strikes me as contrary to what the public wants in the way of services.  
Now I will draw a parallel with another matter, the millennium scholarships. 
There is, perhaps, another priority to be considered for the moment. 
But it is wrong because it does not work. 
People want effective services. 
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire:
You are on the right track.  
We are indeed on the right track.  
Our colleague just spoke of the obsession with visibility. 
Reference was also made to absolute truth. 
Here we have the President of the Treasury Board. 
Objectivity is required in a debate.  
I have a concern. 
This morning is a case in point. 
That is the result of 25 years of PQ government in my region. 
That is what we have to show for it.  
But is my colleague not concerned about his region?  
There are statistics to back this up.  
Everyone knows he was asked to run. 
I will leave him to ponder that.  
The shift toward ambulatory care has been mentioned because it is a very important reform. 
Our first need is additional financial resources.  
These figures are no longer valid.  
It is not just in Quebec. 
But it is our taxes. 
I have no problem.  
There is only taxpayers' money.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
Federalism is essentially a very flexible system. 
However, the Westminster model is not the only model of federalism. 
It is ordinary common sense.  
As a term of art it is post-war German federalism. 
There is nothing wrong with that. 
It is very hard to amend the Constitution by the front door. 
They respond to new problems and nobody is going to say nay to that.  
But there is nothing to prevent administrative devolution in the spirit of co-operative federalism. 
The message from the Prime Minister is that we would like to work with you.  
We want the co-operation of the provincial governments. 
This has been a good debate. 
It has been intelligent. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the philosophical speech of the member opposite. 
Why should the federal government interfere even further? 
This is what co-operative federalism is all about. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
I do so on behalf of the residents of Waterloo-Wellington.  
It is a fundamental element of our individual quality of life in Canada. 
It is more than just the absence of disease. 
It is a resource for every day living. 
The federal government plays a key role in health promotion. 
The results of this work have been truly remarkable. 
Their eating habits have improved and smoking rates have gone down. 
All this is not to say that all Canadians lead a healthy lifestyle. 
There is much more to be done. 
Health is much more than a product of individual choice. 
How does it do this? 
This program has been successful in building community capacity. 
At no time has this been more important than now. 
In the years to come our senior population will grow tremendously. 
The first edition was issued by ministers jointly in 1996. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciated the speech of the member opposite, a very good philosophical speech. 
No one can object to virtue and glory. 
However, I have a concern. 
I would like to know what his position on hepatitis C was?  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite for the question. 
What we on the government side have been saying is not theoretical. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for my hon. colleague. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member opposite for the question. 
That is precisely what Canadians want. 
Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):
Is there something new here? 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite for the question. 
He now talks about the ability of partnering and co-operation.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
We must be very careful. 
I would like people to hear clearly what I am saying. 
At the present time, the federal government is playing with words. 
So let us not be deceived. 
Some will say that $2 billion is still a significant amount. 
The provinces will know how to use this money most effectively.  
All the federal government has to do is trust the elected representatives. 
That is what I wish for with all my heart.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Rimouski-Mitis for an excellent speech.  
In fact, government or at least cabinet members seem to be making conflicting speeches. 
They do not always say the same thing. 
He is also telling us that his government totally abides by the Constitution.  
The way this government is behaving is unacceptable. 
There is no question in my mind that the federal government infringes on our jurisdictions.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
To have come to this is totally abnormal.  
One has to be unbelievably hypocritical to make such a statement. 
Under the Constitution, health is undeniably an exclusive provincial jurisdiction.  
They are not even complying with their own Constitution. 
It also makes for great theatrics.  
This is today's reality. 
The federal government is the great destroyer of the health system in Canada. 
Negotiations are now ongoing, and I hope they will be successful. 
But that is not what was done. 
This is a monumental farce. 
Six billion dollars every year, this is not peanuts. 
I think it is sad and tragic that we have come to this.  
I will explain to you how we have come to this. 
The Prime Minister made no bones of it. 
That is what he did. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
This House is an appropriate forum for presenting arguments. 
I think this is not helping the debate. 
I am sure that was not his intention.  
Mr. Speaker, I have fully complied with the rules. 
I referred to a budget that is hypocritical. 
I have never made a personal attack.  
That is where we are.  
There is not much difference between that and the mafia. 
There is not much difference between that and an organized vendetta. 
Is he dragging down the health care sector? 
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
It has been said that the federal government is cutting left, right and centre. 
The Quebec government decided to do a major cleanup in health care in three years. 
Now they point the finger at the Government of Canada. 
They should be ashamed.  
We eliminated the $42 billion deficit in five years. 
They should take a look in the mirror. 
It is really appalling to hear things like that today.  
We want to set up a scholarship program in concert with governments. 
It will be up to them to choose the recipients.  
People should know that.  
The members opposite do not talk about that. 
They just talk about the bad things. 
If they want to be honest, they must tell both sides of the story. 
Quebeckers must know the truth.  
What would the member do things? 
How would he improve health care? 
Talk about good management!  
The member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot should explain the solutions he is advocating. 
All he does is criticize. 
He never has a solution to suggest. 
He should suggest something.  
We call it Quebec sovereignty. 
This is our great solution.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
I urge him to use appropriate language when he speaks. 
Sometimes, one gets wound up.  
Ah, that's better.  
The member should stop saying things that are not correct. 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
The irony is palpable when we listen to that kind of debate.  
We thought you would.  
Mr. Speaker, I do not intend to disappoint them now. 
It really is ironic. 
I said I sure would. 
How does one say ``myopic'' in French? 
How does one say ``double standard'' in French? 
How does one say ``parochialism'' in French? 
How does one say ``provincialism'' in French? 
How does one say ``hypocrisy'' in French?  
I would replace those five words with one word in English, which would be Bloc. 
We are tying up three crews of ambulance workers. 
There is something wrong with that. 
This government knows that. 
The Canadian people know that.  
They can blame the federal government if they wish. 
That is the foundation of medicare.  
I would like her to tell us what that solution would be. 
I highly doubt it. 
Would she like to see the party of Brian Mulroney back in power? 
Or is she naive enough to believe it would be the New Democrats?  
Would she really believe the New Democrats are going to form a national government? 
We do not hear the other side of the issue. 
She would like to stand and say get rid of the Liberals. 
That is the opposition. 
That is the best thought she has had today. 
She does not know what to counter it with or what to replace it with.  
The reality is this federation works. 
That is very important.  
I assume that by this motion the Bloc would have us abdicate our responsibility. 
This is not about respect. 
It is about abdication.  
We have to balance that fear. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
The government claims that all of a sudden it balanced the budget. 
They are going to be giving some money back in health care. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
I am certain it was inadvertent. 
I would like to give him the opportunity to right this wrong.  
Costs have been driven through the roof, no question about that. 
This requires more money in health care. 
Mr. Gerard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the member a short and straightforward question.  
It leaves me almost speechless, something that does not happen to me very often.  
That is what the Bloc does not like. 
It is truly shameful.  
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
Jurisdictional issues are important indeed. 
There is no denying that. 
We have a constitution that must be respected. 
They love discussing the Constitution and jurisdictional matters, instead of talking about- 
If we relied on people such as you, Quebec would not be defended.  
Obviously it still bothers them. 
They yell because it bothers them. 
This is the reality.  
Are we discussing how we can get rid of the long lines outside our hospitals? 
I have three doctors in my family, two of whom work in Quebec. 
We have a shortage of anaesthetists. 
We have a chronic shortage of radiologists. 
Hospital emergency care is in dire straits in so many provinces.  
This is why this budget will be geared to health care. 
That will solve everything.  
No. What do we do? 
We talk about the Constitution, about petty squabbles, once again. 
How will they sew their mishmash together? 
Meanwhile people are waiting for solutions. 
They are waiting for beds in hospitals. 
They are waiting for access to hospitals. 
They are waiting for the federal government to make this truly a health budget. 
We will do this despite the Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party.  
Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne-Blainville, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I can hardly believe what I have just heard. 
My colleague opposite was lamenting the fate of sick people waiting on stretchers. 
That takes the cake.  
But that is not what I want to talk about. 
Here is the first one: 
Here is the second request: 
-to increase transfers to the provinces for health care unconditionally- 
This means the government should restore the level of transfer payments to the provinces. 
With this second point, we are asking the federal government to be honest. 
Here is the third point: 
-to avoid using budget surpluses to encroach upon the health care field.  
With that third point, we are urging the federal government to abide by the Constitution.  
The answer is clear. 
One only has to look at the mess- 
He made such a mess of things that he almost lost his seat. 
He was elected by a very narrow margin. 
This is not the fault of the federal government. 
Money is the only thing they are interested in.  
It seems quite straightforward. 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
What they do not seem to understand is that the problem remains the same. 
Maybe the Liberals should read it. 
The member for Mississauga West talked about working with the provinces. 
I do not know how to say it politely, but that is a pile. 
There is no indication that this federal government is working with the provinces.  
Talking with the provinces was another reference made by the member for Mississauga West. 
Yes, they are responsible for it. 
They want a report card for the provinces. 
That is a bloody joke. 
I would encourage her to refrain from using that word. 
I will call it a bleeding joke, Mr. Speaker. 
It gives itself a perfect rating. 
I understand that it is actually a criminal conviction. 
Do these people not realize that it is not their money? 
It is the taxpayers' money, the people who pay the bills. 
We heard that commitment from this government. 
Now we hear ``It depends''. 
The government says that opting out cannot be allowed. 
I think Canadians should take a really good look at what opting out means. 
Part of the problem is egos, which politicians in this country have. 
I do not deny it because I have an ego myself. 
The government has an ego. 
It is putting the health of our citizens at risk.  
The partnership will not work. 
If this government cannot see that, then there is something terribly wrong.  
The Constitution clearly outlines federal and provincial jurisdictions.  
Nowhere in that Constitution does it talk about health being a shared responsibility. 
Nowhere in 1867 was health ever considered to be a shared responsibility. 
Mr. Gerard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):
The same thing happened again in 1997.  
The question I want to ask the member- 
I invite him to do so. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I compliment les deputes du Bloc quebecois pour avoir introduit cette motion.  
This situation is felt by members from across the country. 
Every member in the House knows that and every member wants to fix the system.  
The scope of the problem is massive. 
I will give some specific examples. 
All these people are sick.  
The government has money to put into health care. 
Understandably the government wants credit for doing that.  
This is a turf war. 
The federal government is in a unique leadership position. 
That is a profound tragedy.  
Health care is a provincial responsibility. 
That is in our Constitution. 
It does not preclude the government from funding.  
The government, we have seen, has taken away money to balance its budget. 
It has taken money away from health care. 
As a result, we are seeing a very compromised health care system. 
I am going to speak personally and not on behalf of the Reform Party. 
We have a Canada Health Act that was constructed in the 1960s and 1970s. 
That system was fine under the economic circumstances of that era. 
They are the ones who are being compromised in the system today.  
In this system the rich would be subsidizing the poor. 
The government is rationing health care services to the public. 
I know there are questions and answers to be broached after this discourse. 
Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Since 1997 they have had 15 days of direct bargaining and 7 days of conciliation. 
These civilian employees have been in a strike position since January 18. 
When will the government get back to the negotiating table?  
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam, Lib.):
Many nations are now moving to reduce the factors contributing to acid rain. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
The hon. member for Kitchener Centre.  
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
The YMCA has had a presence in Kitchener since 1895. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
The Minister of Veterans Affairs responded with some meaningless gobbledegook.  
This cries out for an independent investigation.  
SCIENCE, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
We watch daily in disbelief and disgust the slaughter and destruction. 
MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the Liberals prefer to have a peekaboo ethics counsellor. 
HEART AND STROKE FOUNDATION 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
It makes important efforts to encourage all Canadians to live healthy lives.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Final offer arbitration works this way.  
That is supposed to be what is in place. 
That is because the dispute between labour and management remains unresolved.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
After all, Saddam Hussein was known to possess anthrax. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is totally untrue. 
The safety of our troops is of utmost importance to us.  
They got their vaccine from the same source.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
He just said that it was tested and retested- 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
I have discussed this matter with them. 
We also had that same company do very thorough testing. 
Our doctors consulted with it. 
Health Canada has been part of this picture. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
The minister knew the vaccines were stale. 
He knew that the labels had been tampered with. 
Why did he order our troops to be human guinea pigs for this vaccine?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
I visited the HMCS Toronto in Kuwait harbour. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I wish we could be so confident for our Canadian troops.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the only thing mouldy is the thinking in the Reform Party.  
The medical profession in the Canadian military has looked at this closely. 
The United States has also looked at it. 
The same vaccine has been given to many more Americans in their military forces.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the minister said this vaccine has been tested and retested. 
This minister somehow seems to think it is okay.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
The vaccine was tested very thoroughly at the laboratory by an independent company. 
It was not tested in Canada. 
Our medical doctors are fully satisfied that this vaccine is safe.  
HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT CANADA 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Why are the cuts three times the figure for fraud?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
This is our duty to all those who trust us with their funds. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, what a lot of words just to cover up reality.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
They have the same kind of administrative practices over there.  
The hon. member for Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
The hon. member for Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I do not want any harassment to take place.  
They do not have knives at their throats. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
We have been in discussion with U.S. authorities on border water issues. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Of course it is not. 
We want to make sure we do this in full collaboration.  
HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT CANADA 
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We expect to recover a certain amount of money in each region.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Will the minister get off his knees and stand up to his cabinet cronies?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will not tolerate any harassment by my department. 
I am telling my agents not to harass the Canadian public. 
That is absolutely clear.  
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the cancer is spreading. 
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, unemployed workers are not the only targets.  
My question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, what sort of government are we dealing with?  
What sort of government are we dealing with?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have a good government. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We have a government that is doing its job in a balanced way. 
We also have a government that is capable of compassion. 
That is not something the opposition has a monopoly on.  
Our government introduced the national child benefit- 
The hon. member for Calgary Southeast.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
In Alberta, William Eric Hughes refused to enter a plea at court. 
My question to the minister is- 
I will allow the hon. member to put his question.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
How can she assure us of that?  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
The attorney general of Alberta will duly prosecute the law.  
HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT CANADA 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, our employees work hard. 
They are covered by a collective agreement. 
We must respect the integrity of the system. 
I can assure you that managers are not threatened. 
We are not encouraging harrassment. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
We saw no directives for elsewhere, but it is a lot more.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let me be clear. 
I do not ask them to harass. 
That is the directive I give all of them across the country from this House.  
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. gentleman may be confusing two things. 
The rules are very clear. 
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, Canadians do not need a lot of legal doublespeak. 
Canadians want to know the truth.  
Is there such an agreement in place today?  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
We are carrying on with the bill as it stands. 
So far, however, none have been forthcoming.  
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
I am told that the first ministers meeting has now concluded.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
My question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I want things to be very, very clear.  
They review all projects in the same way. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT CANADA 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
I am outraged by their lack of compassion''.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the workers in my department are already humane. 
That is what the Department of Human Resources Development does.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
This is not human management. 
This is the government depending on the UI fund.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have received their instructions. 
This is why we have a Canada jobs fund to help create employment.  
They do not exist. 
We are having some estimates of good management practices. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
She wanted to make sure they got it to protect them. 
That is exactly what we did. 
We gave it to them to protect them. 
It was safe and it was effective. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, in fact the FDA did not shut down the plant at all. 
It said yes, there needed to be improvements. 
The plant partly closed to make those necessary improvements. 
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
We are saving the lives of women with maternal health programs. 
I trust that the member would prefer that we prevent- 
The hon. member for Okanagan-Coquihalla.  
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
If the hon. minister wants to, he can address himself to the preamble.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is not true at all. 
The plant was not shut down. 
The plant was told that it had to make some improvements. 
I never said it was tested in Canada. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
That was very important.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
In fact we have debated it many times in the House.  
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Health Canada was not involved at all.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
I have had our medical people in the Canadian forces describe to me that process. 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Next Tuesday and Thursday shall be allotted days.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my intention was to ask the same question. 
The hon. member recognized that in the tone of his question. 
I will inquire about that as well. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
We are also free to use parliamentary committees and their funds. 
It makes a mockery of parliament and is a contempt of parliament.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
We recently referred one of those cases to the board of internal economy.  
The rights of members in the House are being ignored on a consistent basis. 
Now we see a minister's department working with the Liberal caucus making press announcements.  
It will only get worse. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
He is spearheading that attempt.  
The Reform committee will canvass the views of Canadians for strategies to address youth smoking. 
That is what has happened with this news release. 
The privileges of our health critic have been compromised. 
That is not right and it contravenes privileges of the rest of us.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):
That is a different story all together.  
I am sure the minister will want to respond to this at some point.  
Does the hon. member have the consent of the House to table the document?  
There are a number of things to be considered in this point. 
Matters of privilege should be raised as soon as possible. 
I would like to hold a decision on my part in abeyance. 
I will come back to the House if necessary.  
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
Also there is no documentation of reconciliation before or after.  
Does the hon. member have the consent of the House to table the documents?  
THE LATE JAMES BASKIN 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Mr. Baskin represented the Ontario constituency of Renfrew South from 1957 to 1963. 
He was known as a great constituency man.  
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
Jim knew that sooner or later the race of time, with sickle 
And pass them all on the home stretch 
No matter how game or how fast; 
The eyes would grow dim, the wrinkles creep 
Over the face that we seem to know, 
Time has been lashing us year by year 
And making us heavily blow.  
But furrows and seems and lines of care 
With a twinge in the knees and back, 
Just whispers it low to us, 
You're getting too old for the track; 
``Age is nothing-it's the bloodlines that tell'' 
J.W. Baskin, the veteran said, 
And he drove Cimarron and won the race.  
Now he sits on his sulky, dead.  
A wonderful race is this race for life, 
Some seem to be stayers and last, 
While others break down at the head of the stretch 
By rushing the quarters too fast: 
Go steady my friend, go steady, 
And the record you still may lower, 
But let it be said that you were fair and square 
When your race for life is over.  
And that he did.  
He was a winner in politics. 
No one could have done better. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the Reform Party. 
These are the words used in the House. 
Outside parliament Mr. Baskin excelled as a businessman. 
James Baskin was without doubt a man who touched many lives. 
He will be missed and leaves behind a space which cannot be easily filled. 
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
He sat in the House from 1957 to 1963.  
He ran this hotel until it was torn down in 1986. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
I certainly regret that I did not have the privilege of knowing him.  
We join with others in extending our sincere condolences to his family.  
ALLOTTED DAY-HEALTH CARE 
The House resumed consideration of the motion and the amendment.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
The federal government has done us no favour.  
The government now tells us that it will spend $2.5 billion. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Very well, but the member's time is over. 
The member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca may give a short response.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member from the Bloc Quebecois.  
It will only happen if the federal government takes a leadership role. 
It is rooted in preventing these problems rather than managing them.  
Hon. Claudette Bradshaw (Moncton-Riverview-Dieppe, Lib.):
I am very pleased to take part in today's debate. 
This dialogue is very timely. 
Indeed reality is quite different from what the member perceives it to be.  
What role is left for the federal government? 
The federal government has very clear responsibilities in the area of health. 
Programs and services are integrated as much as possible to ensure the greatest effectiveness. 
Let us look at the reality of the federal role in health research. 
It works and it works to everyone's advantage.  
Another example is the needs of children from low income families. 
Are these examples of federal interference, as the Bloc thinks they are? 
The principles listed in this act were supported by all parties. 
The first principle is accessibility. 
The second is comprehensiveness. 
The third principle is universality. 
The fourth principle is portability. 
The act provides the provinces and territories with great flexibility. 
It is not a straitjacket.  
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
The federal government's cuts were unreasonable.  
Does that hurt you?  
Yes it does, and it hurts the nurses especially. 
I was ready to vote zero in my riding. 
I am proud to be on the Liberal team. 
We hear our colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois talk about unemployment. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
The motion put forward by the opposition today reads: 
Canadians have had enough. 
Canadians care about their health care system. 
That is not in dispute. 
They have to plan, manage and administer health care. 
Despite all the rhetoric Canadians have had enough. 
Our laws are clear. 
The division of responsibilities is clear and indeed there are some guidelines. 
We want to maintain that health care system for other reasons as well.  
It is our common bond of association. 
These important principles have been reaffirmed. 
We have decided today to stop the bickering. 
I have just received the framework of these talks. 
This is the crux of the issue. 
I will not raise those arguments. 
It is time to put them away. 
It is time to stop talking about federal-provincial bickering. 
Canadians should have the comfort level that these issues will be addressed.  
There will be an accountability mechanism.  
Their mechanism will be simple, timely, efficient, effective and transparent. 
It will be a public fact finding issue.  
That is very important. 
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
Since 1993, we have sustained massive cuts. 
This government has yielded to pressure from the public and all the provinces. 
The second matter the member made a query about was with regard to dollars. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, there is a limit after all.  
There is no question about the interference matter raised. 
The premier is not concerned about interference. 
Get used to it.  
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
And what about the national report card the health minister has announced?  
Will we have the right to opt out?  
The health issue should have been an eye-opener. 
But what if it were a question of pride?  
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
There is almost no programming left relating to employment activities.  
The problem we deal with in our region is also present elsewhere. 
The accumulated deficit is about $75 million. 
That explains why we face such serious problems.  
Health care is a priority. 
We have to defend our fellow citizens on practical issues.  
This is the concern I wanted to raise during this debate. 
They are closing down hospitals.  
As someone back there said, they are closing down hospitals. 
We will not argue about the regions. 
There too, there were organizational problems in health. 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part in this debate.  
It is true that cuts were made everywhere. 
I wanted to remind him that the cuts were decided upon there.  
At the time of the federal election in 1993, the level was $18.8 billion. 
An illustration of the concrete meaning of $1 billion to Quebec is necessary here. 
It means closure of half the hospitals in the Montreal region. 
As we know, those infected before 1986 are not eligible for compensation.  
As I said, this is still going on.  
Indeed, an agreement was reached regarding the recovery of part of the transfers.  
The issue of social union was also discussed. 
An agreement was reached to recover transfers. 
I used to sit on the human resources development committee. 
This experience makes me say that there are two different mentalities in our country. 
In Quebec, we think differently.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
This is a lot of money, $38 million, this is not peanuts. 
This is money it took out of our own pockets.  
It said ``We do not want to know, you deal with it''. 
This was a contemptible move on the part of the federal government. 
Since 1993, the federal government has cut provincial transfer payments by $6.3 billion. 
We listen to our people. 
We are attuned to what every member of Quebec society thinks. 
Mr. Speaker, I have heard similar comments. 
I would like to go back to the issue of difference. 
I still say there are two countries within this country. 
We feel this is important. 
That is no longer the case today.  
The federal government, with its spending power, uses the money. 
That is the example that always comes to mind.  
Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
I would like to talk to this motion from two perspectives.  
Mr. Speaker, I forgot to mention that I will be sharing my time.  
The federal government has always had an important fiscal component in health care. 
The central vehicle of this has been the CHST. 
Canadians risk losing confidence in their health care system. 
That begins with an understanding and co-operation in terms of measurement.  
Traditionally the federal government has had some small direct spending ability. 
Today in the talks it was again articulated. 
Look at our CAPC program. 
I implore my colleagues across the way to help us decide. 
There were social union discussions today. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
For the most part, it is an excellent motion.  
That is precisely what is in the Constitution. 
We must remember it is a provincial jurisdiction.  
I have difficulty with that.  
I will give an example in my own province. 
I hope the Bloc members are listening. 
There are indications of this suspicion. 
Every fall at fairs in my riding I hold opinion polls. 
I have four jars on a table. 
However, if I said to them ``Oh, just one moment. 
Remember that the federal government does not control social spending. 
I watched the poll all the way through. 
I stayed there for the three days that it was carried out. 
That raises the whole matter of what is wrong. 
It is a problem that is easily fixed. 
In other words, there has to be some form of accountability. 
There has to be some form of transparency.  
Why should all the provinces not do precisely that?  
When we talk about unconditional we talk about no transparency and no accountability. 
I do not see much problem with the motion. 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
This is totally false and I am pleased to set the record straight.  
But I can tell members that this claim is unfounded.  
It is these transfers that have been cut. 
I look forward to the time when they actually take out the word unconditional.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
They should do the same for employment insurance.  
It will be the workers who will benefit from it. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question. 
That is very sad.  
I do not know what the member actually means. 
Would he increase the amount? 
Perhaps he is suggesting that we should cut employment insurance premiums. 
Perhaps that is what he is driving at. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I will split my time with the member for Churchill River. 
I seek unanimous consent to have this debate continue until 5.30 p.m. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
We appreciate the timeliness of this debate. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Perhaps the hon. member could clarify this. 
She would have a 20 minutes speech with 10 minutes of questions and comments. 
Is it the plan to allow for these two speeches and questions on those alone? 
If so, it would end before. 
Perhaps the member could clarify what he is trying to do.  
Mr. Speaker, I would like some clarification. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
There are some delicious ironies in this debate. 
That is one delicious irony of this debate.  
It is in ourselves, in the atrophy of national policies''.  
It is more than about money on the table. 
It is more than claiming political credit. 
It is truly about direction, about standards and about leadership.  
We are rapidly losing hold of a sound publicly administered system.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
This is the kind of rhetoric Canadians do not want to hear. 
She is talking only about cash and not about tax points.  
This is all the stuff Canadians want to stop hearing about. 
Canadians do want accountability. 
Yesterday I received the report of the advisory council on health infrastructure. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
Mr. Speaker, I will answer the last question first.  
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
It is a major responsibility.  
I looked at health care issues specifically in my area. 
Diabetes is a major issue.  
It was an emergency that they had to fly in sweetened soda pop. 
Our people's diets that are causing health problems are a major cause of concern.  
PCBs were a part of that study.  
Not only Inuit live off the traditional lands. 
Contaminants are impacting all our northern communities. 
The Arctic polar regions get theirs from Europe and Asia. 
It is circulating all over the north and into our regions of Canada.  
This is having an impact on our health. 
I have another health statistic which is a predominate number. 
Of our northern population 37% is under 15 years of age. 
Almost 50% of our population consists of children. 
They are not moving out. 
The development of the north is very crucial to this. 
We share this all the way from British Columbia to Labrador. 
Canada is a major highlight.  
The aboriginal people were missing from there. 
They did not have a chance to be heard. 
Provincial jurisdictions are providing services to those communities but the federal responsibility is crucial. 
Our communities are mixed. 
Then there are Metis obligations and the Inuit obligations. 
I want to raise this in terms of a doctor's story. 
We want them in our clinics and in our hospitals. 
Finally health care is on the federal agenda.  
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
There is nothing that is perfect but I do believe- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I have to give the hon. member for Churchill the last word.  
We have to look at health care. 
Is it a top down initiative? 
I do not think so. 
That is where the responsibility has to be. 
Those decisions must come from the community. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
MILITARY MISSIONS BEYOND THE BOUNDARIES OF CANADA 
The House resumed from October 29, 1998, consideration of the motion.  
As you know, 60 minutes are set aside for Private Members' Business. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca has requested unanimous consent of the House. 
Does the hon. member have unanimous consent?  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I shall be brief since time is of the essence. 
He made a brilliant speech. 
This is somewhat frustrating. 
The government does not seem to want to consult Parliament. 
Would it be under the UN? 
This might make for an interesting debate.  
He did not read the report. 
We submitted a report to him and he did not even read it. 
He does not care about us one bit. 
Unfortunately, that motion is flawed. 
It is difficult to defend because it is incomplete. 
What is meant by ``a significant contingent''? 
We already have aircraft stationed in Italy that are ready for action in Kosovo. 
Must we have a debate about that? 
The minister said we would have a debate in this House.  
Everyone has been told except us parliamentarians.  
The motion is incomplete, and we will have a lot of trouble supporting it. 
It is ineffective from a governmental point of view. 
Take the humanitarian missions, for example. 
There was no debate in the House in the case of Hurricane Mitch. 
The member for Red Deer means well. 
However, the motion perhaps conveys more frustration than credibility. 
I congratulate people for being interested in the military question. 
However, a message needs to be sent as well. 
That makes no sense.  
What do they want? 
A scout troop with hard hats? 
If that is it, let them say so. 
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Our position has not changed. 
Canada has made a name for itself internationally, and it is proud of it. 
For example, last year, parliament discussed several highly visible international events. 
In October, the House focused its attention on the situation in Kosovo. 
The joint meeting unanimously resolved that Canada should participate. 
We have taken these lessons to heart by improving our ability to react very quickly. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
This is an issue of accountability and an issue of democracy. 
This should not be left as an executive decision. 
There is an element of accountability and an element of democracy. 
Many things need to be done and we need to illustrate a very important problem. 
The hon. government member mentioned there were debates taking place in this House. 
Not when the foreign affairs minister is saying something completely different. 
Motion No. 380 would prevent that from happening. 
It also gave very pragmatic solutions to address those problems. 
The minister of defence needs to listen to that report. 
He needs to enact its solutions and resolutions immediately. 
Our country desperately needs those capabilities. 
But as the SCONDVA report very articulately mentioned, that is not there.  
They cannot work as two entities. 
They are two halves of the same whole. 
Many meetings have taken place. 
The former Yugoslavia is another example. 
Kosovo is a perfect example. 
From a non-military perspective there are foreign affairs initiatives that can take place. 
Our foreign affairs department has the capability of dealing with preventive measures. 
That is the root of the motion from the member for Red Deer. 
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
We are asking them to put their lives on the line. 
This kind of support is essential. 
That is what this motion is all about.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, that is correct.  
Mr. Speaker, I would simply like to clarify something. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
No later than 6.20 p.m. 
The House has heard the suggestion of the hon. member. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
All 301 duly elected members of the House represent Canada.  
Entering a war zone is a very unique situation. 
These are the issues we are talking about.  
The hon. member has highlighted active military mission. 
Other missions are not active military missions. 
The symbolism of war designed the architecture of this room. 
There is no unity in this room. 
Even the words are antagonistic and protagonistic.  
We have a budget to renovate this room over the next 15 years. 
Why do we not renovate the library? 
The building is a circular one. 
We could shed our political stripes. 
It would be not as a New Democrat, a Reform member or a Liberal member. 
We could shed that at the door. 
Our system of government was adopted from Britain. 
I want to draw attention to one.  
We must make decisions in that way.  
It persevered a test on the Hill. 
For that strength of collective unity in this country, let us consider it.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
We should not mix it up. 
We are all proud of our forces. 
We should not mix up the ice storms and various other disasters.  
We owe that to our troops. 
We believe that our troops do exceptionally well at them. 
He condemned the government for that. 
I have read those speeches over and over again. 
I thought he meant it.  
I still believe he has that mission.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House adjourned at 6.20 p.m.)
