Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples- Budget Report of Committee on Study Presented 
Wednesday, April 28, 1999 
The Standing Senate Committee on Aboriginal Peoples has the honour to present its 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Thursday next, April 29, 1999, I will move: 
Present State and Future of Forestry- Budget Report of Committee on Study Presented 
Wednesday, April 28, 1999 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Are the conclusions reached in this article valid?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, as of today it is, yes.  
The members of the committee and senators are masters of this chamber. 
Members of the committee are masters of the committee. 
In the meantime, the hearings continue, and the committee is doing very good work.  
The committee is doing excellent work. 
On that basis, I think we should all stand together. 
I am looking for a quick and speedy passage of this bill, senators. 
That is why we are sitting here tonight. 
Yes, and there are more to come. 
There is no question about that. 
Most of them are irrelevant to the hearings on the bill.  
Cape Breton Development Corporation 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Those meetings were held on Monday. 
I do not know whether the package stands as it is at the present time.  
The minister stated "The package stands." 
I would not want to confirm or deny that, honourable senators. 
Closure of Mines-Responsibility for Environmental Clean-up-Government Position 
All of those, in an environmental sense, are the responsibility of the Government of Canada. 
The liability is in the hundreds of millions of dollars. 
The work needs to be done over a period of years.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
That will be very encouraging.  
If not, when may we expect a decision to be made? 
Will the minister assure us that Cape Breton is in the running?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, as I understand it, the decision has not been taken. 
I have made representations on behalf of Cape Breton. 
I know that other parts of the country have made representations as well. 
I take Senator Murray's suggestion seriously. 
It would certainly help in alleviating the economic circumstances in that part of the country.  
The government has agreed to write off all those amounts. 
That adds up to well over half a billion dollars.  
The government is very cognizant of the difficulties in that particular part of the country. 
We are listening carefully to the public. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
Is the general well?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, he is both alive and well. 
As a matter of fact, I saw him yesterday and he is in excellent health.  
I am pleased to hear it.  
He is taking his responsibilities seriously. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
That kind of evaluation and assessment is going on constantly.  
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
That would be realistic, and I would not want to rule it out, honourable senators. 
I suppose I am treading into dangerous territory here. 
That is, perhaps, cutting a fine line.  
That is why these matters are being considered on a daily basis. 
I honestly do not know. 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Has he stated that there would not be a vote? 
The minister indicated that it is a decision of the executive. 
I ask you that, honourable senator, in the spirit of cooperation, not confrontation.  
He has indicated that executive decisions have been taken in the past. 
There are precedents for such decisions. 
Canada-United States Relations 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Honourable senators, Canada and the United States share one continent. 
My question is for the Leader of the Government. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I am aware that negotiations are underway. 
I am not aware that we have made any agreement. 
Indeed, I believe I can say with verity that we have not. 
Honourable senators, I would not anticipate any serious difficulties arising out of any disagreement. 
It applies to our Armed Forces in exchange of visits. 
Seriously, I would not consider this matter to be a problem. 
Honourable senators, the United States has taken a stand. 
NORAD is an agreement between two sovereign countries. 
Canadian companies will no longer be able to sell arms to Americans. 
Is that what we want?  
Honourable senators, perhaps I am a little more optimistic than Senator Nolin. 
I believe he has a legitimate concern and I am glad he has raised it. 
He wants an answer.  
If I had an answer I would give it, Senator Lynch-Staunton.  
Tell him you do not have the answer.  
I do not have the answer, and I believe that is obvious.  
As I said, there are continuing negotiations. 
In some cases there is an honest difference of opinion. 
Hopefully, they will all be resolved. 
We are all respectful of the importance of NORAD and its surrounding agreements.  
As the minister knows, the space industry is very important.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
This must be the last question, Senator Nolin.  
It will be my last.  
Finally the Americans decided to hit back. 
We are very concerned. 
I hope the minister is also very concerned.  
Honourable senators, I am very concerned. 
It is important to the whole country. 
I am sure that whatever negotiations are underway will be brought to a successful conclusion.

Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, I rise on a point of order. 
The wider chamber relies on the recommendations and the report from that committee for guidance.  
Yesterday, in my remarks I said: 
Those were my words yesterday. 
Can the senator be more specific, please?  
I answered, restating my previous remarks. 
Senator Nolin then responded: 
The senator must be very specific. 
She says that we would allow hearsay. 
Of course, I would not support that.  
I was repeating what they had said, honourable senators.  
I shall put some of them on the record.  
Continuing on page 63: 
At page 63 she continues: 
Complex cases may require hundreds of such affidavits.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
I see no infraction of the rules that has occurred on which I could rule. 
Honourable senators, I am not indulging in a second debate. 
That is not a point of order. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
There is no rule that you have cited which is being broken. 
No, I am not.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I am sorry, I cannot accept that as a points of order.  
Your Honour, I am not disagreeing. 
I am asking for the Chair's guidance.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
That is not the Chair's responsibility. 
There is a motion before us for the reading of a bill. 
There is also an amendment. 
Those are the questions before the Senate.  
I am sorry, I see no point of order. 
What is the point of order?  
That is not a point of order!  
It is a point of order.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators may change their minds, if they wish, on any issue. 
That is the question before the Senate. 
That question is open for debate. 
The honourable senator has not cited to me any rule that has been broken. 
I am not attempting to speak twice. 
I know the rules very clearly.  
You are out of order!  
I am prepared to speak at third reading. 
If people do not wish to hear me, that is fine. 
I will vote against the bill, that is all.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
All senators in this chamber have equal rights. 
There are no senators who have more rights than others. 
My role is to enforce the rules.  
However, there is no indication here of a rule having been broken. 
The Minister may refuse to make a surrender order if the Minister is satisfied that 
That means no death penalty for kids.  
Each year, we receive approximately 200 requests and extradite 30 to 40. 
This is a situation under the current legislation which allows ministerial discretion.  
Without this discretion, Canada will not have a functioning lever at all.  
This will make it easier in the future to prosecute. 
I urge you to support it without amendment.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Would the Honourable Senator Pearson entertain a question?  
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
I take all my experience from the Convention on the Rights of the Child. 
I am not sure how to answer the honourable senator's question. 
I am not an expert in these matters.  
We have, in effect, two Charter codes. 
Would the honourable senator agree with that?  
Honourable senators, I presume that would be the case. 
That, in effect, is the logical conclusion of your argument. 
I think I understand your question now. 
That is the point I was trying to make.  
We hear about how people in Kosovo are carefully collecting the evidence of witnesses. 
I should like to ask the honourable senator a question.  
I shall quote to you article 37 of the convention: 
States Parties shall ensure that: 
This is the convention by which Senator Pearson feels we are legally bound.  
The Minister may refuse to make a surrender order if...  
...the person was under the age of 18 years...  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will the honourable senator please proceed to his question?  
How does the honourable senator reconcile those two positions?  
The convention applies to people under the age of 18. 
Although that may be a very fine line, the distinction exists.  
That is a difference of opinion.  
Under clause 47, the minister "may."  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable Senator Joyal, will you proceed to your question, please? 
I cannot allow you to continue with your comment.  
Rule 37(4) allows for questions and comments.  
I believe that the assurances in the bill are adequate. 
That is where we disagree.  
That is a very interesting question. 
I agree with the honourable senator. 
However, I do not know how to do that.  
Is it or is it not explicitly proscribed?  
Honourable senators, I think the - 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I should like to point out that the time has expired. 
Is leave granted for the honourable senator to continue?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Please continue, Honourable Senator Pearson.  
The honourable senator would know more about that than I would.  
They stated a reservation.  
That instruction is found in clause 47( c ). That is my view.  
I thank the honourable senator for that reply. 
Like many women, I am rather pragmatic about these things. 
We also had an in camera session with judges. 
In a structured context of that sort, it was an entirely appropriate activity.  
Hon. Lois M. Wilson :
They look upon them as policy options, not as legally binding obligations.  
That is my position. 
It is not appropriate in this particular instance, honourable senators. 
I do not see what you could put in the legislation itself. 
I do not quite agree with what I think is the implication of your question.  
Honourable senators, would the Honourable Senator Pearson entertain two more questions?  
Yes, Senator Fraser, I would agree with your understanding of what that resolution says. 
I think for example of the United Kingdom. 
France, and indeed the European Union countries in general, have such guarantees. 
As we have described it here, it should be adequate. 
The fact that there will be double protections is great; so much the better. 
On motion of Senator Andreychuk, debate adjourned.  
Preclearance played an important role in achieving the objectives of the agreement. 
In 1998, 9.3 million travellers passed through American preclearance. 
Canadian sovereignty will be maintained in preclearance areas. 
The border process involves civil, criminal and administrative enforcement. 
Thus, one amendment was proposed relating to false statements. 
In short, this bill is bringing our border into the 21st century. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators, to leave matters where they are and proceed to adjournment?  
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
