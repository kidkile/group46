CANADA PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ACT 
PARLIAMENT OF CANADA ACT 
Presently members of Parliament swear allegiance exclusively to the Queen. 
Nutrition is an essential component of an individual's health. 
AGREEMENT ON INTERNAL TRADE IMPLEMENTATION ACT 
However, it has not been completed. 
This committee has interpreted consensus to mean unanimity. 
This is what has happened many times.  
CULTURAL GRANTS ACKNOWLEDGEMENT ACT 
They speak of it in terms of motherhood and apple pie.  
Second, it will give some acknowledgement to the long suffering taxpayer.  
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
I strongly urge this government to grant their request.  
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have three petitions to table today. 
The rules say the hon. member cannot read the petition. 
He may only summarize the petition in his remarks. 
I ask, Mr. Speaker, that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
REQUEST FOR EMERGENCY DEBATE 
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
It is an agreement which when arrived at will bind Canada for 20 years. 
It will tie the hands of future Parliaments. 
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE 
RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
It ensures universal quality health care for all. 
This is essential to the success of that agenda.  
Most important, it is absolutely crucial to the creation of jobs. 
One out of three Canadian jobs is directly tied to trade. 
We are all touched by trade and we all share in its benefits. 
To do so governments must work better and smarter. 
Departments must speak to each other in a consistent single message. 
We must seek closer partnerships with the business community. 
Fifty large corporations account for over 50 percent of Canada's trade. 
Canadians have links to every corner of the globe.  
That is one of Canada's biggest advantages. 
Ultimately investment generates jobs. 
The world is growing ever more competitive by the day. 
It means that we cannot rest on our past laurels. 
It means that we have to compete with the best. 
Freer trade has been positive for Canada. 
Over the past few years our export figures have increased exponentially. 
Rules for Canada and for other countries are the equalizer. 
The world has experienced protectionism and has suffered through its consequences. 
Canadians know that we cannot build a fortress and lock ourselves inside. 
Neither is our goal free trade at any cost. 
I believe that on the matter of trade, Canada is doing just that. 
It is jumping over that fence.  
Canada has rare strengths and enormous potential. 
We are competent, we are competitive and we are confident. 
In the world of global trade and investment, Canada has come of age.  
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
I would agree with him.  
I welcome the Liberal caucus to the area of free trade. 
One by one, the Liberals are slowly becoming believers. 
It was not always the case. 
That is simply not acceptable.  
They never used the processes that were put in place.  
That is simply unacceptable.  
What will they do to correct this problem? 
He also touched upon the history of the Liberal Party. 
I urge him to reread the history of political parties a little more carefully. 
We stood up for and spoke to a rule based mechanism. 
I think the member has the history on that issue quite backward.  
Our trade has shot up. 
Our investments in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Mexico have gone up. 
It is very anxious to be in the free trade area of the Americas. 
Yes, the member is right about internal trade barriers. 
There was a reference in our throne speech to bringing down those walls. 
The member's last point was on dispute mechanisms. 
He said that we needed to work closely with the business community. 
On the other hand he said that we had to use those mechanisms.  
It too has to size up: ``Do we go to the wall? 
Do we fight on this issue? 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
He was asked a question and he went on and on. 
The idea is to have a variety of questions and answers. 
I did not feel that the entire 10 minutes had expired.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
It is a great privilege to be here.  
What criteria did the government use to determine how this formula would work? 
I do not remember any of that.  
That seems to be implicit in this.  
Unfortunately that did not happen.  
There is one line about tax relief and debt reduction. 
Where does it go after that? 
Truly I wonder what is going on here. 
It is as though Pierre Elliott Trudeau never left this place. 
There is a social program in every pot.  
We should be very concerned. 
It is already borrowing against future surpluses.  
I am very disappointed. 
We believe it is very important to consult with Canadians on this issue. 
They worked long and hard for it. 
We have produced a document called ``Beyond a Balanced Budget''. 
We do that by asking seven basic questions.  
Second, what is the optimal level of government? 
Third, can these surpluses be increased by more responsible federal spending?  
Fourth, what is the optimal level of taxes?  
Fifth, what is the optimal level of debt?  
What is a realistic projection of future surpluses once the federal budget is balanced?  
That is a very conservative estimate. 
Others estimate as much as $20 billion. 
However, at the same time the federal government had trouble letting go. 
In the third section we talk about that. 
In the fourth section we talk about the optimal level of taxes. 
Canada's personal income tax rate is through the roof.  
This has a tremendous negative impact, like the brain drain for instance. 
In the fifth section of our paper we talk about the optimal level of debt. 
We point out the horrendous impact of the debt. 
We pay $47 billion in interest payments on the debt each and every year. 
It is time to start reducing the debt. 
In the next section of the paper we talk about responsible spending. 
And Liberals claim to be members of the party of compassion.  
I know that is a novel theme in this government. 
We know the government has promised in the past to be more accountable. 
That is what is in our paper. 
I think that is ridiculous.  
This whole debate reminds me of a mutiny. 
They are going down the Niagara River. 
As they go down the river a din is heard in the distance. 
Can you imagine what the Canadian people are saying? 
Let us ensure that Canadians have a say in this. 
Their rhetoric and their imagery is improving. 
If that is not consultation, what is?  
Specifically, what is the member's opinion of the electoral process? 
My friend says it was a major plank. 
A lot of people voted on the basis of cutting taxes. 
Some people cast their ballot on the basis of the MP who was running.  
Then they had elections and they won. 
By and large, they won them.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
I listened carefully when it was being read. 
I do not remember hearing any comment. 
Also he made comments about tax reform. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate hearing from the hon. member for Kamloops. 
He always provides thoughtful questions. 
He has asked me a number of questions.  
It just is not in there. 
Perhaps it was a typo.  
The member also asked about tax reform. 
Tax reform is extraordinarily important. 
Canadians have talked about it for a long time. 
It is not in this document. 
It is not in here at all.  
My hon. friend has asked me about the GST, a very important issue. 
That is well known.  
We leave that open for Canadians to tell us to do that.  
That is part of our consultation. 
We have talked about a number of different tax reforms in our document. 
That is the Reform approach to helping low income Canadians.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
I would have thought the number one issue would be jobs.  
We want to be independent. 
We have the breakup of families. 
We have to have government programs.  
It starts to change the economy in Atlantic Canada.  
That is our plan.  
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
My duty is to articulate the concerns of my constituents, to be their advocate. 
That obligation is to our country.  
Personally speaking, I am one from a family of ten. 
I have five sisters and four brothers. 
It is precisely this ability that marks the signature of a great leader. 
My son Tyler, who is 12, goes to a French school in Pembroke, Ontario. 
If need be we must join a crusade to keep this country together. 
We must turn lethargy into energy. 
We must counter misguided passion with focused conviction. 
We must overwhelm narrow minded nationalism with broad minded federalism. 
We must overpower this scurrilous innuendo with the unmasked truth.  
This acknowledgement comes as a result of our tremendous strengths. 
We are also a very accomplished nation. 
It was a Canadian who discovered insulin. 
However this is not enough. 
We must do more. 
We must continue to pursue excellence on behalf of our country Canada. 
This is my duty and I will do so without fear and without favour.  
Let us not fail at this critical time. 
Let us, yes, sprint forward together and continue to build a great country called Canada.  
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
But how many are left today? 
Some of them changed sides, and he is one of them. 
He should realize that.  
But what is Canadian culture? 
I would like to hear what he has to say on that. 
Is it selling the Calgary stampede in Paris? 
Perhaps he could do that, but that is of no real interest to me. 
I cannot find the right words. 
I think we might resume debate.  
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
I am very happy to be here today.  
But we have some fundamental decisions to make. 
I want to be clear about this concept. 
Certainly, regulation is required. 
The political risks of such initiatives are being eliminated as successes are being documented. 
The lack of secure employment manifests itself in any number of social symptoms. 
As a government we must strike a balance between the present and the future.  
Let us commit to working toward, not simply planning for, the new millennium.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my comments and statements will be brief. 
That is how good it was back then. 
They are following the Reform right down in a rush to the bottom. 
They are ripping up labour contracts and denying people their basic rights. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
I was describing where I think we need to go as a country. 
We certainly face challenges. 
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
They spoke with pride at being elected to this place. 
I am struck as a new member by the differences and the similarities. 
What I have heard in response troubles me. 
I feel sad that there are those who would tear this country apart.  
Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne-Blainville, BQ):
I imagine my hon. colleague denies Quebec's right to separate. 
Mr. Speaker, certainly the world has regions that are separating. 
But if we look at the world, that is clearly the minority opinion. 
In Canada we have not only two cultures but three. 
I think the people of Canada are starting to realize that. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate you on your appointment.  
I was outraged by the speech from the throne that was delivered two days ago. 
This year, the minister will take $7 billion from that fund. 
What did the minister himself do in all this? 
What was his own contribution?  
These folks no longer show up in the official unemployment figures. 
This is not what being a responsible government means.  
He will move right into areas of provincial jurisdiction. 
Our program had six points, basically.  
These are no small amounts we are talking about.  
Not a cosmetic 6 cent per $100 of insurable payroll. 
This is a real battle against child poverty. 
Every instance of duplication and overlap in programs entails administration costs borne by taxpayers. 
The public must know that. 
That is what I mean by distorting the reality behind public finances.  
There were of course a number of such misunderstandings, but I targeted four.  
These misunderstandings go as far back as 1867. 
However, over time, we came to realize that such was not the case. 
English Canada will not admit at all that Quebec is different. 
The throne speech reinforced this first historic misunderstanding. 
Quebecers stood their ground and I am proud of that. 
We never agreed to this Constitution.  
Now, after the Calgary declaration, they have come up with unique character. 
Quebecers are not interested. 
So was English Canada's paternalism. 
But it does not work any more. 
Whether or not you want this partnership does not change anything. 
The next referendum will be the right one.  
Our aspirations are legitimate and deeply democratic. 
They do not rely on justice to be planned. 
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
Those steps were necessary.  
First, I never said anything to insult the Minister of Finance. 
I criticized his budget policy because I consider it savage. 
It therefore represents a majority of Quebecers. 
That may be distressing, but that's life.  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened attentively to the member's remarks. 
Business looks for stability and business needs stability.  
It seems to me this is perfectly clear. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Poverty is not something that we have to accept as a reality.  
I agree with the NDP member, Mr. Speaker. 
The government should give us some credit.  
These people have to rely on welfare.  
So, do not try to appeal to our emotions. 
We are not going to be fooled by the finance minister's crocodile tears. 
It is not right to present things in that light. 
Do you know what the government is doing? 
This would be an effective way to fight poverty, particularly child poverty.  
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
Member spoke in Inuktitut.] 
It it a great honour to be back in this Chamber. 
I did not think then that I would be representing Nunavut 22 years later.  
Member spoke in Inuktitut.] 
The land covers fiords, mountains and tundra.  
Nunavut's high Arctic hosts two lead and zinc mines. 
Alongside this is the challenge of protecting our environment. 
We have to make sure our land remains natural and beautiful.  
We need to promote fisheries and the processing of country food. 
There are many barriers that stand in the way of our youth attaining higher education. 
One avenue to keep youth in school is through athletics. 
There are no roads. 
Air freight is the only reliable way to ship goods and perishable food. 
The constituency that I represent cannot be compared to any other part of the country. 
We are part of Canada and proud to be Canadians.  
We have tremendously talented artists who need to have their work marketed. 
Therefore it is very disturbing for me to see imitation art displayed in stores. 
Means to promote economic development of art must be explored.  
I guarantee that their experience will be unforgettable.  
Member spoke in Inuktitut ] 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
I want to congratulate the hon. member for Nunavut. 
I look forward to working with them once again. 
She is absolutely right. 
We are there to help them.  
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I too want to pay tribute to the member for Nunavut. 
In my riding, they would tell her in Inuit: 
There are 14 Inuit villages in Abitibi. 
So I am very familiar with the Inuit culture. 
We have many problems right now. Housing is one of them. 
I realize that much needs to be done. 
They are participating in the economy.  
I wish to congratulate the hon. member on her election.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Certainly I agree with her.  
I thank the hon. member for bringing that up.  
Ms. Nancy Karetak-Lindell:
I am proud to be a part of it.  
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
I was greatly impressed.  
My understanding is that an agreement has been reached. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
If the member could have a very very brief response, please do so. 
Ms. Nancy Karetak-Lindell:
Mr. Speaker, as far as I know that is being put into place. 
We have had a bit of resistance to the changing of the traps. 
As I said in my speech, Inuit are very adaptable people. 
We are trying to go with the change. 
I hope I can answer it more satisfactorily with a bit of research.  
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I too want to congratulate the hon. member for Nunavut. 
I am sure she will represent her riding with a passion unparalleled. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate you on your recent appointment. 
I want to thank the constituents of Simcoe-Grey. 
It is a responsibility that I do not take lightly. 
I ask my constituents to join in that challenge.  
My riding is a diverse and precious place just like the people within it. 
I am very pleased to see that happening.  
Simcoe-Grey is a riding that leads in agricultural excellence. 
As I mentioned earlier, my riding is very diverse. 
At long last there is a glow of optimism within industry.  
His fiscal formula has been a remedy for success.  
Simcoe-Grey is likely one of the most well-known tourist destinations in Canada. 
We have a scenic geography that is second to none. 
I extend that same invitation to industry. 
We want them too, and we need them.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
I would also like to thank the new member for Simcoe-Grey. 
He strikes me as being full of good will. 
Mr. Speaker, I question how well the hon. member listened. 
The member seems to have his facts in error. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
There is that phrase ``fresh start''. 
It goes on to state: 
A constant process of consultation and co-operation must be restored. 
This throne speech goes on to state: 
It goes on and on.  
It sounds exactly the same.  
Liberal, Tory, same old story.  
This is the same throne speech. 
They did not even bother to re-write it. 
It was a new governor general, that is all. 
This throne speech is worth nothing. 
This is absolute pap. 
Yap, yap, who cares? 
I would ask him to restrain himself.  
Mr. Speaker, I apologize. 
Pap is pretty cheap.  
There is a reference in the throne speech to the deficit war being won. 
This should be a top priority if we are a caring and decent country.  
I do not think this is funny. 
I acknowledge that luxury car sales are up. 
I acknowledge that the Toronto Stock Exchange is at historic levels. 
What will the government do about this? 
There must be some goodness left in this government. 
I am being asked to talk about something new. 
The Liberals would love me to shut up about this topic. 
This has to stop. 
Is that the kind of country we are? 
Is that what we have come to? 
Is there anything in this throne speech about a national child care system? 
I heard minister after minister promise to introduce it. 
That has to change and change soon.  
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let me congratulate you on your appointment.  
Unfortunately he was not listening.  
They all talk about doom and gloom. 
Was that a question, Mr. Speaker? 
It was kind of a rant, I thought.  
My hon. friend is right. 
Is this not nice? 
In fact it was more precise. 
By the year 2000 it will take some action.  
They would consider doing away with tuition fees in our post-secondary institutions.  
We always hear whining from across the way.  
This is not a new concept. 
We will be dishing out money now for the helicopters. 
That is what this job is all about. 
Helicopters will probably be a lot more important than helping poor children. 
That is a decision that the government might well take.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Where was his compassion? 
We did it because we care about Canadians. 
We care about the debt and we care about taxes. 
Where is the compassion?  
The hon. member for Charlotte on a point of order.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the Reform member is mentioning pensions. 
That is a ridiculous statement and is completely out of order.  
It was a matter of debate.  
If so, I will give him a moment. 
Mr. Speaker, I will be very brief. 
My hon. friend asked about the MPs' pension. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
We will keep our promise. 
We will not break our commitment to raise those issues day in and day out. 
He said ``Tell everyone that we will make Ottawa rock''. 
I am proud to carry on his work. 
It was a dream I had. 
Unfortunately it just was not to be. 
We will be there day in and day out.  
We now are at the base floor of $12.5 billion.  
It does not look at the growth in the economy. 
It does not consider growth in population.  
There are so many more issues to raise and so little time. 
I want to acknowledge the challenges we all face. 
Many of us have young children. 
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
This place is a stiff, dull place at the best of times.  
I would like to ask the member a specific question. 
I believe they had a fiscal dilemma on their hands. 
They are both good people. 
Could the member please respond to that?  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
It is absolutely critical that we all work together to reverse that trend. 
The question was how much. 
The member asked for specifics. 
Let me make two very quick references.  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
And the source of funding?  
There are dozens and dozens of ideas. 
We will keep bringing them forward in the House. 
I look forward to the member's supporting our proposals.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
I wish you well and I look forward to it.  
Fortunately for me it has done so once again.  
In addition we have our share of concerns and problems. 
That is absolute nonsense. 
It is interesting that is almost deja vu in this place.  
We care about social housing problems. 
We need more in my riding. 
I was on that board for nine years. 
We have women's shelters and a food bank. 
We have youth unemployment and under employment. 
We have new Canadians, refugees who need help to adjust. 
We need to fight crime to take back our streets. 
We hear calls to spend more from the left. 
What I hear from the party of the left is to spend more.  
I watched what the Tories did. 
That is the nonsense of getting into extremes.  
I find the official opposition to be rather interesting. 
It is the politics of Ross Perot. 
Our plan is a balanced plan. 
It is a balanced plan that we believe the people of Canada believe in. 
Clearly they have sent us here to administer that plan and to deliver it.  
Recent surveys show that the vast majority of Quebecers want to stay in Canada. 
Quebecers want to be a part of this great country.  
I suggest they join us to continue building this country.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
And he referred to Quebec as a very unique province. 
This qualifier adds to the uniqueness. 
He said that Canada and Quebec should work together. 
He also referred to two referendums.  
What I would like- 
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Could you clarify that for me? 
I saw the hon. member. 
There were two members who rose. 
I am choosing a round as best I can in exercising discretion.  
What is normal is that an opposition member gets it.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye:
Mr. Speaker, I acknowledge and appreciate your customary wisdom. 
I also want to thank my other colleagues for their smiles and moral support.  
He wants Quebec and Canada to work together. 
I am waiting for his answer. 
I will now listen to what he has to say.  
We recognize it as a unique society. 
I personally recognize it as quite distinct. 
I can see that is obvious. 
You have one goal and one goal only and that is to destroy this country. 
Frankly that is not what- 
I invite him to do so and he may continue his answer.  
Mr. Speaker, the party opposite has a clear-cut goal. 
We want Canada to be strong.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
It is an honour for you and deserving of both you and this great institution.  
I am exceedingly proud, honoured and humbled to represent this great riding. 
Waterloo-Wellington captures the essence of Canada. 
Elora, Fergus, Jacobs, Elmira, Baden, New Hamburg, Harrison and Palmerston. 
It contains that famous place called Punky Doodle's Corner.  
Farming is important to our part of Ontario.  
Canada will march confidently into the 21st century and the new millennium. 
The foundation of that plan is to balance the books. 
Jobs are being created at a remarkable pace but we need to do more. 
Unemployment, especially youth unemployment, is at an unacceptable level. 
A hungry child is much more likely to be a behavioural problem. 
The social and economic impacts of youth crime are unacceptable to Canadians. 
Investments in that regard made today will pay enormous dividends tomorrow.  
I look forward to working together with my colleagues for the betterment of Canada. 
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Let us look at what the Liberals have done right. 
When and how much?  
There is importance in getting our fiscal house in order. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
I would address my remarks to the member for Waterloo-Wellington, an educator it seems. 
The rate of unemployment among young people increased.  
Of course I am going to recognize the hon. member for Charlotte. 
Would that be acceptable to you?  
Mr. Speaker, that would be more than acceptable.  
Mr. Jerry Pickard (Kent-Essex, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this week is Legion Week here in Ontario. 
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
It was very educational for the Federal Fisherman. 
I am sure the member for Burin-St. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Fergus, Ontario is located in my riding. 
Fergus is also famous as the home of the Fergus Scottish Highland Games.  
Needless to say, I support this very worthwhile effort.  
CENTRE DES FEMMES DE LAVAL 
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
Long live the Centre des femmes!  
Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
It was truly a happy occasion.  
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
I congratulate Dr. Bolton.  
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
We owe it to ourselves, our families and our constituents.  
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have reason to be proud of Canada's youth.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
I would have preferred to talk about good news this week. 
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
Of particular note is its wish to maintain national unity. 
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
One of the most important strengths of Vancouver Kingsway is its cultural diversity. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
It is time to listen up, Mr. Prime Minister. 
THE LATE DUDLEY GEORGE 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Two years ago Dudley George was shot dead. 
He was one of 40 people peacefully protesting at Ipperwash. 
The responsibility for this anti-native act lies with the current Ontario government. 
Transparency and accountability, enough words.  
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Mr. Speaker, taxes are too high. 
With that I am going to recognize the hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
The whole thing was a shell game.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We are reducing it to zero. 
That is a very big difference. 
According to the Speech from the Throne it will be done in the next year. 
We are not there yet.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
And on top of that there are 1.4 million unemployed.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, if we reduce taxes we are not reducing the deficit. 
That is something people will understand. 
We said that in the end we will be in a position of surplus. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the prime minister has done it to health care. 
What it promised are 29 new spending proposals from the government.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I can assure the hon. member that I will do that.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Yet now even he refuses to set a mark. 
I want to caution the member to please choose his words judiciously.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Let me be very clear. 
We are going to balance the budget in 1998-99. 
There are going to be surpluses. 
We are going to be in a position to cut taxes. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
However, I did not say we would.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
No, that is not what I said. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, each provincial government will decide what form of consultation it will use. 
There are many ways to consult the public. 
We think that we can consult the public if necessary. 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
If he is making use of a modern method of consultation, that's fine. 
Each province will have its own method of consultation.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, there is of course no connection. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the prime minister.  
Our west coast salmon fishery is in dire straits. 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
They have said no to such contacts.  
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
He is preparing another team Canada trip for January. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The business community of Canada is lining up to be on the trip.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I think the Prime Minister has his priorities wrong. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay-Okanagan, Ref.):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay-Okanagan, Ref.):
A strike shuts down Canada's entire mail delivery system.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
The collective bargaining process can work and will work. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Quite the opposite, Mr. Speaker. 
Canadians are very proud of it and the Reform Party should be too.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
He said so yesterday.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
I have another question for the minister. 
Mr. Minister, do you support- 
Dear colleague, I think he heard the question. 
Moreover, you must always address the Chair.  
Mr. Speaker, in fact- 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
That is the federal system.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
This is the case with Vietnam, China and other countries.  
Ms. Jocelyne Bujold Girard (Jonquiere, BQ):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
PUBLIC WORKS AND GOVERNMENT SERVICES 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Members of the union will vote on October 3.  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for her response. 
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
I am sincerely sorry, Mr. Speaker, for using the word ``stealing''. 
So I will say ``taking the money''.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE 
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I will.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We will not do that.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
That is what we have done. 
This is a reform which was necessary.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Trade.  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let me thank the hon. member for her question.  
In fact Canada has either signed or negotiated up to 50 of the agreements. 
There is a need to multilateralize.  
At the same time I am sensitive to the hon. member and other hon. members. 
Obviously we need to do that in an open and transparent fashion. 
That would bring to a close our question period for today.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let me thank my colleague across the way for this excellent question.  
Tuesday shall be an allotted day. 
COMMENTS DURING QUESTION PERIOD 
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
It has to do with the expression ``picking the pockets of Canadians''.  
I hope the House would indulge me at the beginning. 
I will have a look at Beauchesne's again of course. 
However, I would prefer that we use words that are less inflammatory.  
I will surely look at the precedents and refresh my memory. 
If it is necessary I will come back to the House. 
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
We are going to go to tributes. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
At that time he was honoured appropriately on the Hill.  
But he first ran for Parliament in 1935.  
We will miss him and we will miss having him here with us. 
I remember seeing him the night before his stroke. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
He was an outstanding expert on the procedures and the rules of the House. 
He will be very much missed. 
He will be very much missed in this House and in our country.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Knowles' contributions to this House and to Canada are well known. 
Stanley Knowles began his career as a minister of the Christian gospel. 
But I also think of him as a servant of a higher master.  
Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):
This is why he went into politics.  
He was elected to Parliament and quickly became an expert on procedure. 
He was a man of courage, in spite of his physical frailty. 
He was an honest man, respectful of and respected by his political opponents. 
The families of politicians inevitably pay a price for this dedication. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
His memory seems to hallow the very ground on which we stand.  
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE 
RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
Mr. Speaker, it is nice to be back here. 
I will be sharing my time with the member for Shefford. 
I want to congratulate you on your elevation to the Chair. 
The throne speech was a big disappointment to me. 
It is often said that the essence of life is hope. 
The government has failed miserably. 
It cannot seem to grasp the reality that there are a lot of people hurting.  
But let me tell the House it is not. 
I believe that was for a very particular reason. 
I believe it is because there are lot of very disillusioned people.  
The rest was downloaded on to the backs of the provinces.  
Health care is an example. 
We have the brain drain of Atlantic Canada. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
I have two questions for my colleague from the Conservative Party. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.  
The sustained rate of unemployment is hurting us. 
Ordinary Canadians have no confidence in the future. 
That includes the citizens of Quebec. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
The member believes there is only one taxpayer. 
They are basically satisfied with the government.  
This country as a whole is what I am worried about. 
It has not spread north, east, or west in some areas. 
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I would first like to congratulate you on your appointment. 
They turn whichever way the wind blows, taxing, cutting, taxing, spending.  
Tuesday's speech from the throne contained at least one piece of good news. 
The government will soon have a budget surplus. 
The bad news is that Canadians will not see a cent of it. 
Time has come to take new approaches and to offer new solutions. 
However, a vision and a plan are not enough. 
Leadership is required to achieve key priorities. 
There are 1.5 million children living in poverty in Canada. 
These children are poor because their parents are poor. 
I am convinced that it is possible to find a basis for agreement. 
It is time again for us to join forces around a common ideal. 
Let us not get hung up on the words, the reality is clear. 
Quebecers are Quebecers, and just as proud to be Canadians.  
I apologize for not mincing any words, but his leadership is worn out.  
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
Punch Imlach was able to bring the Stanley Cup to the Toronto Maple Leafs. 
I congratulate the member on her election. 
I have a question for the hon. member. 
She talked about lowering payroll taxes. 
If she does not know, I will be glad to remind her. 
Ms. Diane St-Jacques:
Mr. Speaker, I will try to respond. 
Mr. Maurice Godin (Chateauguay, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the remarks of my colleague from Shefford.  
What is the role of each province in the Constitution?  
Ms. Diane St-Jacques:
We must keep talking to try and find a solution.  
I am very proud of the government's economic record. 
The throne speech reflects our commitment to thoughtful economic management. 
The government achieved the first annual surplus since 1982.  
All the spending contained in the throne speech is funded by budgetary surpluses. 
I want to be crystal clear on this point. 
The budgetary surpluses during this mandate will be the source of funding for new programs.  
The government will not be relying on borrowing moneys. 
We will not be spending our children's inheritance. 
Internship programs will be extended and expanded. 
The government will provide enhanced funding for student summer placements. 
I am particularly encouraged by the government statement on national unity. 
In the words of the throne speech: 
The government therefore views its mandate in that area in a global and encompassing fashion. 
Any measure that strengthens the country will have a unifying effect on Canada.  
Our federation as we know it is flexible. 
This needs to be repeated over and over in the presence of separatists. 
Far from being fixed and immovable, our federation is one that keeps evolving.  
We have come a long, hard way, but the end is in sight.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to be here today. 
I feel privileged to represent the constituents of Kings-Hants.  
I am a Conservative, an Atlantic Canadian and a small business person. 
None of these are mutually exclusive. 
Compassion is not partisan in principle. 
Compassion is something we all should have within the House. 
That is but one example of the vision that we need to show.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
I heard him speak in English about being firm. 
Is the hon. member prepared to do that?  
Of course, we use inclusive terms such as ``society''. 
Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. 
Clair for their support in the June election. 
Clair have only local concerns. 
One way to do that is to offer more support to our local industries. 
It is important also that we support other industries. 
However, there is a fly in the ointment. 
I am talking specifically about games of dice.  
Those gambling casinos will have dice games. 
It is a very important part of the puzzle that is unemployment. 
The federal government has been trying to initiate discussions with the provinces. 
In general foreign trade is very important to Windsor. 
As Windsor prospers economically our other problems subside. 
Our crime rate is lower than it has ever been. 
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
No, I will not acknowledge that, Mr. Speaker. 
I think my hon. friend misses the point here. 
The fact is this is a good general plan. 
Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):
Manicouagan is one of the loveliest ridings in Quebec. 
Mr. Speaker, I see a theme evolving on the Bloc benches. 
There is a theme on the government benches too. 
I am proud to be a Canadian. 
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
They have small incomes and they cannot afford to pay the taxes. 
Youth cannot get enough money for education. 
The answer is that there is still a deficit and there is still a debt. 
We will spend time looking at the debt. 
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
It is surprising but at the same time I suppose somewhat remarkable.  
I would like to give the House some examples. 
That is what it is, another tax.  
This is my favourite one. 
There were 36 individual tax increases brought in by this government. 
Let us not forget that.  
Let us not forget how the Liberals got there. 
One has to ask did they get any flyer points for that. 
I wonder if that is a relative of one of the Liberal ministers. 
Here is one that I should not be upset about but I am. 
A golf tournament for literacy received $85,000.  
I do not look to the Canadian taxpayer for money.  
It goes on and on. 
The throne speech is like a shell game. 
I assure the House that we are going to keep the pressure on.  
I know the difference, Reformers know the difference and ordinary Canadians know the difference. 
By the time this Parliament is through, the Liberals are going to know the difference.  
Mr. Joe Comuzzi (Thunder Bay-Nipigon, Lib.):
First, let me congratulate you, Mr. Speaker, on assuming your position in the chair today. 
All of us on this side of the House wish you well. 
Someone on the other side who was speaking earlier made some reference to your looks. 
If not kissing cousins, they slept in close proximity to each other.  
We have eliminated the deficit which is what Reformers have been talking about. 
What has the hon. member got against the senior citizens in this country? 
Could he respond to that please.  
That is a certain thing.  
Second, I have nothing against seniors having fun. 
There is an interesting point about reducing the deficit though. 
Yes, we have been talking about this Liberal government getting the deficit reduced. 
We ask the government to be more prudent and reduce its spending. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
It was a book filled with congratulations. 
The government congratulated itself on what it sees somehow as a brilliant record. 
But let us take a closer look at that fiscal and economic record.  
The Liberals talk about job creation and prosperity. 
What we have today is 1.4 million Canadians out of work. 
That is the economic record of this government. Youth unemployment is over 17 percent. 
They have lost economic opportunity because of the policies of this government. 
We see anaemic economic growth of under 3 p. cent. 
The government calls this an economic record to be proud of.  
How did they do that? 
By acting responsibly as so many of the provincial governments did? 
That is the shameful fiscal record of this government. 
And what has it done?  
That is a shameful record and one it ought not to applaud.  
So what is the answer? 
The throne speech is filled with page after page of new spending programs. 
There is no imagination, no vision in this throne speech.  
The government has done nothing to act on that. 
It came within a whisker of losing power. 
We know that the Liberal Party exists to take and maintain power. 
The government ought to listen to the message that was sent by the voters. 
What about tax fairness for families? 
Governments around the world are doing that.  
Provincial governments that have made the hard decisions know differently. 
Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):
I would like to welcome him to the House. 
The people endorsed our programs.  
We still see the Liberal arrogance creeping into that member's comments.  
Let us talk about some of this. 
How about starting with the hon. members pension plan?  
Why don't my hon. friends start with the same kind of leadership by example?  
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
It may be due to the fact that we keep hearing all the negativism. 
Canadians are fed up with negativism. 
On the one hand, they want the deficit eliminated. 
Clearly there are more Canadians going back to work. 
Could he explain to me what are the chequebook politics? 
Helping Canadians I believe is what the government is doing in the throne speech. 
Maybe he should read that.  
Could the member comment on what he defines as chequebook politics?  
Mr. Speaker, talk about Orwellian rhetoric. 
It is a simple mathematical thing.  
Perhaps you have never balanced a family budget. 
Heaven knows this Liberal government has never balanced a government budget. 
The hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood on a point of order.  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
Is there unanimous consent to extend the time for questions and comments?  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, thank you very much. 
I am happy to be here in the House for the member's maiden speech. 
Would I support the elimination of all the so-called tax expenditures? 
Are hon. members rising on questions or comments? 
Ms. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
Second I would like to offer the government an idea. 
Third is the principle of tolerance toward individuals and groups. 
Tourism plays a significant role in the economic mosiac of Kitchener and surrounding areas. 
Many visitors, future residents and investors became acquainted with our community through tourism. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
I also congratulate the hon. member on her maiden speech.  
The figures are in; I am sure she is aware of them. 
She said the right things, that we have to bring down internal trade barriers. 
My question to her is when and how.  
The Government of Canada has the constitutional power to do this. 
We have a constitution that says that interprovincial trade must be free and open. 
Mr. Speaker, I will reply to the two questions the hon. member has posed.  
I have every confidence the government will get where it needs to be.  
Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):
I have two questions for the member who just spoke. 
My Canada includes Quebec. It is a vibrant, thriving society.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
They can fire us nonetheless. 
The Reform Party and hopefully some of the new parties might bear that in mind.  
All MPs on all sides of the House share this responsibility. 
We express this responsibility by the questions we pose in committee.  
Many of the flaws were due to a lack of accountability. 
As MPs we are accountable. 
It is the machinery of government we must scrutinize. 
Now it is devolving it to the municipalities.  
That is the situation in Ontario.  
It is the last thing Canadians want. 
All I can say is good luck. 
Look at what happened to a former Conservative prime minister.  
I have to come to the Speech from the Throne.  
I am sorry, but I found it a bit uninspiring. 
I think that the throne speech lacked eloquence and inspiration. 
I found him eloquent on the subject of the government's ideas.  
I would like to conclude with a quote. 
We have built that nation and we continue to shape its elements. 
Our young will do so in the next century. 
Their architecture will be new but it will be Canadian. 
Greatness may have a different meaning, but it will still be Canadian.  
That is the essence of the Speech from the Throne.  
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
He got a little confused there, if you will.  
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, first I wish to congratulate you on your appointment. 
I have a question for the hon. member. 
Mr. Speaker, in my opinion it is simple. 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Unfortunately, the government is not really working for the people. 
Lester B. Pearson's legacy has completely disappeared. 
Those days are really gone now. 
The vacuum is particularly noticeable in the area of cultural development. 
It contented itself with micro-managing seriously reduced budgets. 
The government speaks proudly of our films. 
Telefilm Canada has its work cut out for it.  
The most vital criterion should be script quality. 
In this area, the anglophone culture is more vulnerable than the francophone.  
Watch for the next instalment.  
In the Speech from the Throne, there is also a reference to videos. 
Being ``connected'' is a praiseworthy objective. 
This is another subject to follow.  
There are gaping holes in this speech. 
When it was promised stable financing, it actually got cuts. 
This time, it is not even mentioned. 
On this, we will have to wait and see.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
Per hour of programming?  
Is the Liberal government once again going to abandon the cultural sector?  
The government is not interested in how useful or effective these programs will be. 
What matters to the government is to be visible with its flag.  
The Liberals are obviously inspired by this ideology. 
We must remember that the money we receive is our own money. 
It comes from our taxes. 
The federal government does not have a penny. 
The money belongs to us and not to the government. 
You will be surprised when we reveal these figures. 
The sums are really huge. 
Take a good look at Statistics Canada's figures. 
Concealment is definitely the name of the game for this government. 
However, Quebecers are nobody's fool. 
Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering-Ajax-Uxbridge, Lib.):
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for recognizing me. 
I am not particularly interested in all that. 
The hon. member was on the same committee.  
The hon. member opposite has some nerve, Mr. Speaker. 
First, I suggest he reread my speech over at leisure. 
I have never said that we were the only francophones- 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
Don't be arrogant.  
I think this is an important point. 
I never said such a thing.  
We have followed with interest the situation in Ontario. 
We have seen what happened with Montfort Hospital. 
Because the City of Vanier voted in favour of partition. 
You know, the hon. member opposite is in no position to criticize us. 
Naturally, we all have our own personality. 
I for one am a passionate person. 
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
The hon. member talked about Quebec's culture. 
There is a French Canadian culture. 
There are many cultivated people in Quebec. 
Perhaps I should commend her for her interest in this matter.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his kind words, of course. 
I asked whether there would be an information highway for francophones. 
The information highway covers quite a distance. 
I would have a lot of trouble stopping it at the Quebec border. 
I spoke about an information highway for francophones, meaning all francophones in Canada.  
But I am no longer part of that group. 
Later on, I was told that I was a Quebecer and I like that better. 
As a French Canadian, I am a second class citizen. 
As a Quebecer, I am a first class citizen. 
That is the difference. 
Mr. Speaker, I am referring to the Canadian Constitution. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma-Manitoulin, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, first let me offer my congratulations to you on your new office. 
We are all confident you will do a great job.  
I am very pleased to participate in this debate. 
We all had supporters among our volunteers and our loved ones. 
The less we express and show that, the more distant they feel.  
The throne speech expresses the caring nature of the government. 
We can find no greater evidence than in the words of the throne speech.  
Let us start with the issue of the economy. 
There will always be challenges and problems to face. 
They know we will respond.  
That is the nature of our modern society. 
Many of my constituents have faced that challenge, particularly in Elliot Lake. 
I heard from the seniors. 
They were worried about the future. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
That strong voice just was not there. 
Four thousand men used to work there. 
None are working there now. 
The government is selling off all the housing of CMHC. 
Do you know who lives in CMHC housing? 
All the low and middle income people live in those houses. 
I do not believe that the government understands what it has done. 
It is time for it to stop and take a look. 
The member talks about a crack. 
However, right now it is a total disaster.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Brent St. Denis:
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the remarks of the hon. member for Saint John.  
I admire the member for Saint John. 
However, I believe she is missing the point.  
In the last Parliament the government had to make some tough decisions. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate you. 
He used little phrases in his comment that really caught my attention. 
Does he call that accountability? 
Does he call that being left behind? 
What is he talking about?  
Mr. Brent St. Denis:
None of us in the House wants anyone to be left behind.  
That is not a fantasy nor is it a dream. 
It is now 6.15 p.m. and we are out of time. 
Perhaps we can come back to this next time.  
The question is on the subamendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the subamendment?  
All those in favour of the subamendment will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
I declare the subamendment defeated.  
(The House adjourned at 6.47 p.m.)
