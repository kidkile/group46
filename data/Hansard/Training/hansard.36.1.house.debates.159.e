The House met at 2 p.m. 
Members sang the national anthem ] 
Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):
Certain falsehoods must be dispelled about this issue. 
When will the Harris reformatories come clean on this issue? 
JESSE ``THE BODY'' VENTURA 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Mr. John Maloney (Erie-Lincoln, Lib.):
Hogs are selling for half the cost of producing them. 
The farm income situation is urgent. 
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN QUEBEC 
Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):
In Brome-Missisquoi, that will be heaven.  
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
The PQ leader is a secretive person. 
On November 30, let us not take any chances, let us vote for the Liberals.  
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
That is our government's performance, counting 50 years and more.  
It is unconscionable that these concerns continue to exist after 50 years. 
The hon. member for Vancouver Kingsway.  
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Congratulations to the Prime Minister for his constructive work in Asian countries.  
NATIONAL ACTION COMMITTEE ON THE STATUS OF WOMEN 
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP):
Today our voice is threatened.  
NAC is still waiting. 
The time for playing politics is over.  
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
UN HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
International environmental organizations are waging an unjust campaign against the Canadian forest industry. 
The outcome of their efforts has been devastating to coastal communities in British Columbia.  
The Liberal government has done nothing to counteract this advertising campaign.  
Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
However, the trains routinely break down leaving commuters stranded. 
It is incredibly inefficient.  
This could be a major tourist attraction and generate a lot of money.  
However, what does this say about the case of Canadian investors in this country? 
My other concern is what if RailAmerica decides to abandon the rail line? 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, what a glimpse into the Prime Minister's values. 
He refuses to accept any responsibility for his solicitor general's resignation. 
Instead he looks for someone to blame. 
He blames the media. 
How can the Prime Minister possibly defend this outrageous witch hunt?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister is obviously upset. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I said it is not true. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
But last week the institute refused to become embroiled in the affair.  
How can the minister guarantee now an independent review of the CPP report?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
He will do a very thorough, very comprehensive review.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The superintendent was acting within his full scope. 
I was not asked for my opinion. 
I met with the provincial finance ministers. 
The acting chief actuary has met with the provincial finance ministers. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
That is the real issue.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Can I find something clearer than that?  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The following is what the terms of reference stated in February: 
They are fully independent. 
And I trust that, some day, the opposition will be able- 
The hon. member for Charlesbourg.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the solicitor general clarified the situation yesterday.  
He said the commission's report would be made public. 
This is crystal clear. 
When he answered the question, he had a doubt. 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the solicitor general surely got the answer from the Prime Minister's office.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Let the commission do its job. 
That is all we are asking.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Well, these allegations have been proven true. 
It is the Prime Minister who owes the apology.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
She never retracted that. 
She said to this House that we had called the president of the university. 
The hon. leader of the New Democratic Party.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
The story has been proven true. 
The former solicitor general did prejudice the inquiry.  
My colleagues, it is getting a little bit difficult to hear the questions. 
I am sure we want to hear the questions as well as the answers. 
I call on the right hon. Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is not very complicated. 
The commission is looking at all the arguments. 
The commission has not ruled on the affirmation she made. 
Again, she should wait to have the facts. 
She is not very good on that.  
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member should get his facts straight. 
GOLDEN WEST DOCUMENT SHREDDING 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, in the beginning of July my department learned of this incident. 
We took it very seriously.  
We just received a report from the RCMP. 
We are studying the report and will take the necessary steps.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
The shredding of documents is a very simple issue. 
It is a very simple but important issue.  
This company sold the material for profit. 
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
After five months I am surprised he is raising the issue.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the answer is quite simple. 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Yet the minister could have built on Quebec's legislation.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
That was what was done.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, blah, blah, blah. 
That is not the right answer. 
That is not the answer at all.  
Statistics Canada has the answer. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, blah, blah. 
Another brilliant policy insight from the Reform caucus.  
Payroll taxes are such a clear indicator. 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
This all smacks of improvisation.  
My question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Last week, the industry made us a counteroffer. 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Why does he not just do it?  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Also, the member knows that we have frozen those fees until after the year 2000.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Again, when will he suspend these taxes?  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):

Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Where is the new Captain Canada over there? 
What is he doing? 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
The reply was there is no policy change.  
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
The tragedy behind these numbers is manifested in every community across the country. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That is why we brought in the changes we did. 
As I mentioned, it is paying off. 
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
The government's policies are simply not working.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the record of the government on job creation is pretty impressive. 
Since we took office, more than 1.3 million new jobs have been created. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Is the minister willing to explore this avenue?  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her kind comments. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I know what the minister of veterans affairs is referring to. 
Will this minister and this government- 
The hon. Minister of Veterans Affairs.  
Mr. Benoit Serre (Timiskaming-Cochrane, Lib.):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
The hon. member for Lakeland.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Immigration.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of the Environment. 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
We will be bringing forward our decision very soon.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
REQUEST FOR TABLING OF DOCUMENT 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
The minister did not quote from the report. 
He indicated that a report was being prepared. 
The explanation is correct. 
There is no point of order.  
OFFICIAL LANGUAGES IN HOUSE OF COMMONS 
Mr. Benoit Serre (Timiskaming-Cochrane, Lib.):
REQUEST FOR TABLING OF DOCUMENTS 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
I would ask for that document to be tabled.  
You might have a question that you are putting to the House leader. 
If he wants to answer the question I will permit it. 
If the hon. government House leader wishes the floor I will give it to him.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
The Deputy Prime Minister did quote from a document.  
We will leave it at that.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):

Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we will be answering Question No. 119 today. 
Question No. 119- Mr. John Cummins: 
(c) There were no costs incurred in 1995. 
Mr. Speaker, I would ask that all remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
Shall the remaining questions stand?  
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like Motion P-36 to be called.  
The parliamentary secretary is not able to make that request.  
Either we put the question, or we have another submission. 
Is the Minister of Natural Resources rising on this point?  
The motion is transferred for debate pursuant to Standing Order 97(1).  
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like Motion P-37 be called.  
The motion is transferred for debate pursuant to Standing Order 97(1).  
Shall all remaining Notices of Motions for the Production of Papers stand?  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
That is the trouble. 
No one else rose. 
I said can we now have them stand and everybody said yes. 
I do not like to be difficult, but we had disposed of the matter.  
Perhaps we could revert. 
I was not trying to raise the mettle through the House.  
It was Motion No. P-33, was it not? 
P-33 is called.  
The motion is transferred for debate pursuant to Standing Order 97(1).  
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like Motion No. P-46 to be called.  
The motion is transferred for debate pursuant to Standing Order 97(1).  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
That is for tomorrow. 
I am a day ahead.  
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Permit me to briefly outline the contents of Bill C-42. 
Bill C-42 addresses these concerns. 
Instead of merely restricting promotional activity, the bill will prohibit them entirely.  
That, in a nutshell, is the purpose of Bill C-42.  
These groups told us that they also needed fairness. 
In conclusion, we have all heard the alarming facts. 
Obviously as a caring society we have a moral obligation to act. 
We have not failed them. 
We will have the wherewithal to say to tobacco manufacturers ``Thanks, but no thanks. 
I would like to share my remaining time with the member for Oak Ridges.  
There are 30 minutes remaining in the hon. member's time.  
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
I know these kinds of programs can be and are effective. 
No doubt critics of the legislation will claim that the government is going too far. 
Canadians recognize that smoking is our number one health problem. 
Figures like these are very disturbing. 
Assumption patterns reveal that the number of young female smokers has been rising significantly. 
As all youth smokers get older, they smoke more. 
For young people, taking up smoking is a gradual process. 
Regular use and addiction follow. 
Many young people contemplate quitting, prepare to quit and then try to quit. 
But quitting is not an easy proposition. 
It is ironic that my own father quit smoking three years before he died. 
It has often been said that young people are the future of this country. 
That is what this amendment is all about.  
I call on all members of the House to support the amendment. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
However, I am absolutely dismayed by the comments which have come from the other side. 
The government claims to be the great upholder of smoking prevention in this country. 
Yet the government went ahead and did it.  
I understand the circumstances. 
It was a solution that had worked before: an export tax.  
We had the same situation in 1991-92. 
He removed the export tax and smuggling resumed. 
If we look back in history we will see that the solution was there.  
This is my message for the government. 
In 1996-97 that figure climbed to a whopping 48,000. 
There are 48,000 people every year who die of tobacco related illnesses.  
The numbers have changed. 
That is a profound tragedy.  
They do not start when they are 20.  
As a result, our efforts must be addressed to younger individuals. 
Teenagers and young children do not understand that. 
They know the effects of tobacco. 
However, 80% of them will still be smoking eight years later.  
We have to address young girls in particular. 
We must address their narcissism, not their mortality. 
That will put it at five years.  
All they need to do is look at the experience in Europe. 
Europe did the same thing. 
They introduced laws very quickly. 
Sporting events and such got other sponsors, including car racing.  
That is completely untrue. 
That could be done now but it is not being done.  
The government believes that tobacco companies can be trusted. 
They thumbed their noses at the government and the Canadian people.  
The government could have introduced other things. 
Right now it is an open book. 
That needed to be in this bill and it is not.  
The government could have had a delay period for tobacco sponsorship promotions. 
They had been in high positions in the U.S. government. 
We can also look at their actions in other countries. 
What they do in China is appalling. 
A good chunk of their efforts are designed to hit that vulnerable group.  
It is not just a matter of death. 
Smokers have greater chances of becoming sick than non-smokers do. 
Smokers stay away from work longer. 
The cost to the gross domestic product is enormous.  
It is not rocket science. 
This is perhaps the most important message the government needs to listen to.  
The government can twiddle all it wants around the edges of this issue. 
It can talk about education. 
I wonder if the minister truly is ashamed of this bill. 
That minister and this government has failed, failed, failed in that promise.  
The facts do not support those allegations. 
We can see what is happening in the United States today. 
We cannot let them off the hook. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Basically it boils down to the government making a major mistake.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Obviously there is not unanimous consent for the motion.  
Madam Speaker, I would ask that you seek the unanimous consent I requested.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Reform Party will give consent to this particular motion. 
We are only agreeing with the change in dates. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
There is not unanimous consent.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Certainly we are prepared to give unanimous consent. 
Madam Speaker, I would point out that we will also support this change. 
That rather reduces the role of parliamentarians. 
The government pushed us a bit during consideration of this bill. 
I simply wanted to say that. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there unanimous consent for the motion?  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Many things have been said. 
These statistics have made us aware of this scourge. 
We are often tempted to think there are fewer smokers. 
Bill C-42 has mainly to do with tobacco sponsorships.  
We are talking zero tolerance.  
This total prohibition will take effect immediately following the five year transition period. 
The European Union intends to prohibit all industry sponsorship by 2006. 
The Bloc Quebecois is in favour of any measure to reduce smoking. 
Organizers will have until October 1, 2000 to decide which form of transition they prefer. 
The federal government should also have established a compensatory fund. 
The Quebec legislation provides for a tax on tobacco. 
These people are very appreciative.  
In two years' time, they will have to find another sponsor.  
There were many complications. 
One year later, we are therefore no further ahead. 
It is not easy to change a habit that goes back several generations. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
There is no question abut it. 
What did the Liberals do? 
The bill does not have its origins in those good intentions.  
That is what we are dealing with. 
What we are dealing with is a cave-in. 
Let us be clear about it. 
This is an absolute cave-in, a buckling to those huge lobby forces today.  
Why would the present Minister of Health be any different from his predecessors? 
Who is standing up for health care? 
Is it the Minister of Health or is it the Montreal Grand Prix? 
Is it the Minister of Health or is it the Marlboro man?  
We wonder why it had to happen this way. 
That is exactly what is happening. 
We are weakening an act that protects children. 
We are allowing for bad public policy to proceed. 
The government would not listen. 
Why was it necessary to do that? 
They were given very short notice. 
They were given very little time to prepare. 
It was rammed through committee. 
I acknowledge their contributions to this whole area.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):
It is basically about the health of Canadians.  
It is a statistic that even Health Canada supports. 
It is a big problem.  
In other words from 1939 to 1945 approximately 42,000 to 45,000 Canadians died. 
That is a very disturbing statistic. 
There is another way to put it in terms of those 40,000 deaths. 
If it happened in any other jurisdiction the government would do something about it.  
They would not last long. 
Why will it not do something about it? 
That is the part that is so bizarre. 
I would identify those people as being the cigarette manufacturers of Canada. 
I think hon. members will be surprised when they hear what Imperial Tobacco owns.  
Imperial Tobacco Limited is Canada's largest tobacco company. 
Its major brands include Players, DuMaurier and Matinee. 
I guess we have heard those names.  
That is pretty powerful, but it does not end there. 
Basically they do not want to see the government do anything. 
Something has to be done about that.  
Senator Kenny's bill would do something about that. 
This is a strategy on the part of the government. 
Unfortunately, he is out-voted in cabinet. 
This is not a tax, but a levy.  
The fight is coming from the finance minister. 
Taxation is sacred to the finance department. 
It does not want to give up any revenue or any tax points. 
It does not want to give up its future ability to tax.  
This 50 cents a carton is being opposed by the finance minister. 
I want to compare this to the EI account. 
Therefore, the finance minister would lose control. 
One might ask ``What would be wrong with that?'' 
The government gives and the government can take away.  
Does anyone in this House remember David Dodge? 
He was certainly a senior official in finance during those years.  
David Dodge is now the health minister's deputy minister. 
Talk about the system perpetuating itself. 
There is no argument about that. 
It is a surplus that it loves to play around with.  
Incidentally this would break down to about $20 million a year.  
In other words, I guess we would have cigarette police out there.  
This is so illogical I cannot believe it. 
In other words, there has to be federal-provincial agreement to do that.  
It was the single largest reduction in taxes in the history of Canada. 
It is just like a rocket taking off.  
Let us take a look at my home province of New Brunswick. 
In New Brunswick people are paying $3.74 a pack. 
That was as of September 30, 1998. 
I think the government should do it.  
This is something that I have to put on the record. 
The manufactures at one time argued that there is a death benefit to smoking. 
They actually commissioned a study to prove this. 
The manufacturers said that there is a net gain in Canada if we all smoke.  
Their reasoning went like this. 
If we smoke we are going to die younger. 
I go back to my basic argument. 
The attack on cigarette smoking can only be done in three ways. 
There is a direct correlation between price and consumption. 
Economists call that fundamental pricing theory. 
The second way is advertising and the third is education. 
Unfortunately they are not in the bill. 
It has been weakened and weakened badly.  
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr Speaker, I want to make a comment. 
I listened very carefully to what the member had to say. 
Canada is a world leader in our legislative initiatives. 
I know that is really hard for the member opposite to take. 
I actually think he is quite a nice guy. 
We have to talk about reality in this place. 
Senator Kenny went around the country from coast to coast. 
I was first elected in 1988. 
I have received thousands of letters. 
I will entertain other questions from the floor.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have also received a lot of letters. 
Did he not receive more letters on the GST?  
I hope I am not contaminated by that type of thing. 
Now he is advising the government. 
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
How about Bill C-42?  
We were talking about it and the member was talking about it. 
I want to ask the member relating- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Speaker, I will happily rephrase the question.  
Mr. Speaker, that is the question I cannot answer. 
He sent me a little note. 
I do not think there is an answer other than that.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Of course we will recall that the member's party voted against Canada. 
Maybe he could answer this question.  
I cannot fathom that question. 
It seems to me maybe there has been a lot of caffeine on every side.  
I am in the hands of the House. 
Does the hon. member wish to start his remarks?  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
First, the government reduced prices to combat smuggling. 
Second, it caved in on plain packaging. 
It is very instructive to look at what has been the result of these measures. 
It is not that tough to do. 
The statistics I will be presenting today will be very specific for Canada since 1991. 
The reduction of tobacco smoking in 1991 was 6.16%. 
This is total market for tobacco. 
That includes tobacco smuggled and tobacco used in Canada. 
Some would look at statistics and say we do anything we want with them. 
In 1994 the Canadian statistics took a dramatic jump. 
The jump was directed, and Statistics Canada shows this plainly, at our youth. 
Bill C-71 was directed at youth. 
Is it the intention of the House to proceed with putting the question? 
Is the House ready for the question?  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP) moved: 
I think that is wrong, as do many other Canadians. 
So I moved Motion No. 53 to remove that absolute privilege. 
The Court of Queen's Bench ruled that they had to testify.  
He called Senator Berntson as a witness. 
I will go into the specifics of the privilege issue shortly. 
Mr. Hopfner was convicted and sentenced to 18 months in jail. 
Beauchesne's sixth edition was published in 1989. 
Speaker Fraser declined to do so. 
I maintain and support that point of view.  
I hope hon. members will find the motion worthy of support. 
I look forward to addressing their comments at the end of the hour.  
It is appearance as witnesses that we are discussing.  
I believe this motion should not be supported. 
They are also available in parliaments in jurisdictions abroad. 
I suggest to my hon. colleagues that it continues to be needed today.  
It does not protect members from criminal prosecution. 
For example, it does not stop members of parliament from being sued.  
In other words, privilege ensures that this House will function effectively. 
We need to be vigilant in preserving parliamentary privilege against frivolous attack.  
In other words, I do not understand what the point of this motion really is.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
It kind of comes home when one does these things.  
In such a conflict, the duty to parliament clearly outweighs the duty to the courts.  
This automatic immunity should be abolished. 
I want to talk a bit about freedom from arrest. 
This would be consistent with most other cases involving members' privileges.  
What about the privilege of not being required to attend as a witness? 
Here we get into the specific privilege referred to in Motion No. 53. 
What about privilege of exemption from jury service? 
The privilege of freedom of speech is another issue. 
It happens here once in a while. 
Freedom exercised in this way is viewed by the government as an abuse.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les Patriotes, BQ):
Our legal institutions are cited as examples worldwide. 
The second point I wish to raise concerns parliamentary privilege specifically.  
Decisions in recent years has been particularly telling. 
We form what is called the legislative power. 
Our presence in Parliament, as Joseph Maingot said, is a vital one. 
In the eyes of the law, we are not superior to our fellow citizens. 
I am concerned at the erosion of parliamentary privileges. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Every Canadian, parliamentarians included, must enjoy equality under the law. 
Protection and prosecution apply by virtue of the Canadian charter.  
Members of parliament and senators are not free from arrest. 
Let us get that straight.  
It is unfortunate as well that the word privilege carries so much baggage. 
Like many specialities, parliamentary law has its own particular vocabulary. 
Sometimes the vocabulary can be confusing. 
We say that he is a rich man and leads a life of privilege. 
It is not an exercise in pageantry. 
It is not ritualism. 
We should recall that courts are the crown's courts. 
It is also forgotten that this is the Queen's parliament. 
Keeping this in mind, we can delve into the argument a little clearer. 
He will make a representation on behalf of this place. 
Let us look at those words: 
Privilege is a particular immunity under the law. 
I doubt there are any members present who would want to see these privileges abandoned. 
Similarly, parliamentary protections or immunities exist for a single purpose. 
They were not just dreamed up by parliamentarians of a superior class. 
These immunities are in place to protect parliamentarians from intimidation and threat.  
Parliamentarians are not above the law. 
I think this is the root concern of his motion.  
The abolition of our immunity would result in the egalitarianism of an oppressed society. 
There would be no freedom of speech in parliament.  
The literary community has recently raised the danger of what is called libel chill. 
Libel chill would become a parliamentary petrification.  
Specifically the issue of jury duty has been raised. 
All sorts of exemptions apply.  
I realize I am at the end of my time limit. 
This is not an abuse that occurs.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, this has been a valuable debate. 
This is true of parliamentary privileges.  
I hope it would use that from time to time.  
You could never get immunity, for example, for crimes against humanity. 
The British judges are now going in for progressive generic interpretation. 
They reflect their particular space and time dimension. 
New facts demand a re-examination. 
Let us have the re-examination but have it in an all party sense.  
I served on it in a sense; I cut my parliamentary teeth there. 
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I thank the member for Vancouver-Quadra for his remarks. 
I think he raised some good points in his speech. 
We are looking at abolishing that particular reference. 
I think that is a very good suggestion. 
I think it is something we should look at.  
This is one example in about five or six. 
I have been attempting to implement some democratic reform and to modernize parliament. 
I have raised a number of issues in the House. 
This is yet one more. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
The minister's response was nothing short of abysmal. 
Needless to say, Mr. Tkatch was not impressed either. 
Think about that for a moment. 
Unfortunately Canadians should not bother holding their breath waiting for it to happen.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
SOLICITOR GENERAL OF CANADA 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
The overwhelming majority of them said he should resign. 
They were ecstatic that their views were going to be heard. 
I was very disturbed by the Deputy Prime Minister's response. 
But this Liberal government does not seem to care much about democratic rights.  
The right to protest is another crucial right in a democracy. 
This is part of freedom of speech. 
The sworn affidavits confirm this to be so. 
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General, Lib.):
Her remarks are so childish and so full of contradictions.  
Another contradiction is the allegation that ``the process is tainted''. 
He is referring to jokes that make us cry.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
They have talked about gag orders. 
They have talked about files being stolen. 
They have talked about intimidation. 
They have talked about the inability to do their jobs as scientists.  
I am looking forward to a response from that office.  
My concerns have been dismissed.  
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
It is being reviewed and evaluated internationally. 
Some countries have approved rBST and some have not.  
It is as clear and straightforward as that.  
It does not matter whether it is in veterinary science, human science or economic science. 
There have been no gag orders. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
(The House adjourned at 6.45 p.m.)
