Tuesday, May 4, 1999 
The Battle of the Atlantic 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
We started with a tiny navy. 
By 1945, Canada had a navy of 93,000 men and women. 
The Battle of the Atlantic was the dominant factor of the war.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Canada, loyal as always, answered the call and rose to the challenge. 
In the end, the Allies turned the tide. 
Key to the turning of the tide to victory was the Merchant Marine. 
Nevertheless, we came through that terrible storm of fire and steel to ultimate victory.  
I just wanted to add that.  
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
I took advantage of that. 
Prairie boys always went off to the navy. 
Perhaps it was because all of that flat water very much resembled the flat grass. 
The Canadian navy was stuck with doing the Murmansk run. 
We were seconded to the Royal Navy in a number of cases. 
It is interesting how things go around in circles. 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
There was something missing from the ceremony, honourable senators: the stained glass windows. 
Access to Census Information 
Unacceptibility of Petition in Electronic Format 
Their main media of communication are the Internet and electronic mail. 
Hon. Therese Lavoie-Roux :
Mental health is an essential element to a person's health. 
Everyone has a mental health.  
On first examination, mental health in Canada seems to be in fairly good shape. 
Honourable senators, one Canadian in four is unbalanced. 
We face greater and greater pressure individually and collectively. 
Currently, governments are falling short of meeting the need. 
Only a third of people with depression seek help. 
The very existence of prejudice contributes to the problem. 
We need in Canada to better understand the scope of the problem.  
In Canada, a third of the homeless have psychiatric problems. 
Tomorrow, a Canadian film will premier in Montreal. 
Changes to Nova Scotia Pharmacare Program 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
This duplication of drug programs resulted in needless government expense.  
His letter explained the untenable position in which seniors find themselves. 
This is an issue which must be resolved, and resolved quickly. 
Honourable senators, as the students would say, Reverend Lang is "quite a guy." 
There was no animosity, honourable senators; only profound sadness.  
Instead, said Reverand Lang: 
That would be awesome, and that would be radically different.  
Criticism by Nortel Executives of Tax Base 
Elderly Patriot scolds Nortel. 
"Why would you not like this wonderful country," she said.  
She comes from a very well-known and respected Cape Breton family. 
She has earned our appreciation.  
Annual Report of Commissioner Tabled 
The Hon. the Speaker :

The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
ASSEMBLEE PARLEMENTAIRE DE LA FRANCOPHONIE 
Reports of Canadian Delegation to Meeting in Cairo, Egypt, Tabled 
Hon. Pierre De Bane :
Lack of Government Support-Notice of Inquiry 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Access to Census Information 
Conflict in Yugoslavia-Refugee Quota-Government Position 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
Is it in the order of approximately 300,000?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Where did this number of 5,000 come from?  
North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Conflict in Yugoslavia-Release of American Prisoners-Increase in Bombing Activity 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
President Clinton has not proposed a unilateral pause in the air campaign. 
Conflict in Yugoslavia-Plight of Refugees 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
However, that was not acceptable to Mr. Milosevic.  
Loss of Disposable Income as a Result of Taxation-Government Position 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I neglected to bring my calculator with me. 
The reality is that all of the economic indicators in Canada are positive. 
Our real GDP rose 0.2 per cent in January. 
I could go on and on.  
I believe they are down 25 basis points as of today. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Awarding of Contract for Replacement of Sea King Helicopters-Request for Information 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, it is on the same issue of equipment that I rise. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The Sea King, I might add, has performed admirably.  
Honourable senators, I have a final supplementary question. 
Honourable senators, there is no question about it. 
I have met with some of the people who maintain the Sea Kings. 
The pilot was in control of the situation and landed without incident.  
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government. 
The other day, he was seemingly contradicted by the Prime Minister. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I agree unequivocally with the Prime Minister.  
Honourable senators, I am sure the minister agrees. 
Honourable senators, I note the Leader of the Government has said that. 
All the economic indicators are positive.  
Delayed Answers to Oral Questions 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
(These types of landings are referred to as precautionary landings.)  
3. LAND IMMEDIATELY: means that an immediate landing / ditching is mandatory.

Auditor General's Report-Comments on Underground Economy-Government Position 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Donald H. Oliver on April 20, 1999) 
Conflict in Former Yugoslavia-Funding for Humanitarian and Military Initiatives-Request for Information 
These costs will continue to accumulate over time. 
(Response to question raised by Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk on April 20, 1999) 
It is on this latter basis that the recent negotiations in Ottawa took place.  
Pages Exchange Program with the House of Commons 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Erin Mansfield is studying accounting at the Faculty of Administration of the University of Ottawa. 
Erin is from Upper Sackville, Nova Scotia. 
Welcome to the Senate.

Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Bill C-40 was no exception. 
It is in fact this common understanding that this debate in the Senate furthers.  
Article 1 of the International Declaration of Human Rights states: 
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. 
First he quoted Article 6 which states: 
Every human being has the inherent right to life. 
This right shall be protected by law. 
No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life.  
I believe "arbitrarily" is the operative word.  
Subparagraph 2 begins as follows: 
In countries which have not abolished the death penalty...  
Article 6.6 also puts a duty on all of us. 
Following those death penalty exceptions and conditions, it states: 
Paramount is the right to life. 
Committee members are elected by state parties to serve in their personal capacity.  
I can only hope that there has been change to the positive since then.  
Article 15.7 of their opinion states: 
It is instructive to note two things. 
I believe that they in fact have been.  
At stake in Bill C-40, in my opinion, are two issues. 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
I regret to interrupt the honourable senator but her time has expired.  
Is leave granted for the honourable senator to continue?  
A second issue troubles me. 
The Minister of Justice has a special status and a special obligation. 
However, whose rights are we protecting? 
Whose life is more valuable? 
The answer, of course, is neither.  
Article 1 of the Universal Declaration states: 
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. 
How would we face the family or the friends of any future victims? 
How do we shelter and shield these people from harm?  
To release an Ng to the streets would foreseeably lead to harm to innocent people. 
Otherwise Canada could become a haven for criminals. 
Similar policy concerns apply to extradition. 
Thus, I will not go into that.  
There is no such clemency for them. 
I should like to turn to the other amendment moved by Senator Grafstein. 
The two tribunals are still in the making. 
Therefore, they should receive a fair trial.  
Instead, we sit back. 
To me, that is folly. 
It is neither good international law nor good national law. 
Thus, Bill C-40 remains.  
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Would the honourable senator permit several questions?  
The first concerns the fast-tracking with respect to alleged war criminals. 
Their view is that we should wait until we are in Rome. 
The minister will agree with me that Rome was not built in a day.  
I thank the honourable senator for the question. 
It is a conundrum. 
It will take a long time and it will not be an easy task.  
It has been unconscionably delayed. 
We know what this one will do. 
I thank the senator for that. 
Negotiations between two states are often confidential. 
I would not have the same political influence with another state. 
Honourable senators, I have one final question.  
Senator Andreychuk referred to the Kindler and the Ng cases. 
This is not to be confused with the Declaration on Human Rights. 
What does the honourable senator make of that? 
To me, those authorities are more compelling at this moment. 
We will await the outcome of the Supreme Court decision.  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
I am interested in the fate of those who are extradited.  
That is a very interesting question. 
I have not pondered it. 
I am not quite sure what would happen in such a case. 
However, I would be prepared to look into it and bring an answer.  
That is precisely why I prefer our extradition. 
I do not know the full rules. 
In fact, I have looked for them and have not found them. 
They seem to be in the making.  
What happens to people in that instance?  
As you know, there are ongoing trials and executions in Rwanda. 
We would exhaust the patience of senators if we went into that discussion. 
It is a separate issue. 
I would certainly entertain an inquiry into that as a separate issue.  
However, it does not give me much confidence. 
These questions are large and complex.  
Would they be detained in Canada? 
These are questions that should be foremost in our minds.  
What is important to me is what principles will be utilized. 
Equally, I am aware that the tribunal has had difficulties with that. 
I thank the honourable senator again. 
I asked this question last week and no one had the answer. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
At that time, he argued, and I quote: 
Then, on April 20, Senator Bryden responded to Senator Grafstein's proposal. 
Senator Bryden's conclusion was, and I quote: 
However, it was her view, as she stated: 
We are legislators, not philosophers. 
If we build that haven, they will come.  
She raised the point again today. 
In doing so, we know that we cannot achieve perfection. 
However, the world as we know it is far from perfect. 
A fugitive found in Canada is, first and foremost, a Canadian problem. 
Honourable senators, reference was made to the Ng case today by Senator Andreychuk. 
Having committed no other crime in Canada, he could not be held.  
In his remarks of April 14, Senator Grafstein said: 
My response is that that is not our concern.  
With all due respect to Senator Grafstein, I disagree profoundly. 
I do not believe that this is simply a fear. 
But are these the people we want to encourage to come to our country? 
In my view, Senator Grafstein's amendment would do the exact opposite. 
That is why I cannot support it.  
That, honourable senators, is not correct. 
A number of states had problems with that wording. 
Following intense negotiations, an international consensus was achieved.  
The paragraph, as ratified overwhelmingly on April 28, 1999, now reads as follows: 
This approach is exactly what Bill C-40 provides. 
He quoted the committee as follows: 
This was not, in fact, the case. 
As far as the main point is concerned, the committee reported as follows: 
Here the report refers to then Minister Allan Rock. 
The questions stand; the author should be corrected. 
I will correct the Hansard on that.  
Having said that, I wish to ask Senator Graham a few questions. 
That is already anticipated. 
It is anticipated that there will be a different track. 
The only question is when.  
I think that is a fair proposition. 
In the final analysis, I do not know of any.  
The Minister confesses his support for abolition but then fails to act on his conviction. 
That is a decision of the Court of Appeal of British Columbia.  
Does the honourable senator agree with that particular contention?  
I am not aware of any.  
I appreciate that, honourable senators. 
This is not a new concern. 
He then goes on for a page to give examples of that.  
Canada is not a haven now and, therefore, few come. 
However, we have had evidence of that possibility; for instance in the Charles Ng case. 
That is our responsibility. 
We have been given that responsibility by the people whom we represent.  
On motion of Senator Wilson, debate adjourned.  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
It deals with the very important issue of life and death.  
All of these recommendations are supported in Bill S-29.  
These elements are reflected in Bill S-29. 
The committee heard from at least 150 people from all over Canada. 
It does so by introducing a process in which standards are established. 
Another unanimous recommendation of the committee states: 
I trust that she will support the present legislation.  
Bill S-29 includes both of these elements. 
Support for this bill is widespread. 
No one has wanted to touch it and so, for 20 years, no one has. 
The time has come for action.  
Public pressure is mounting. 
The threat of opening the door to euthanasia is increasing. 
There are many such examples.  
Its sole purpose is to serve the public as well as possible. 
That was fine with me. 
On motion of Senator Carstairs, debate adjourned.  
Health Care in Canada 
Hon. Norman K. Atkins :
This is not reality. 
This is one of the vital factors missing at the present time.  
Rural hospitals and rural health care in general are decidedly different from their urban counterparts. 
Health care will be always foremost on their minds. 
On motion of Senator DeWare, debate adjourned.  
The Senate adjourned until Wednesday, May 5, 1999, at 1:30 p.m.
