The House met at 2 p.m. 
Members sang the national anthem ] 
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
I wish them every success.  
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
So single income families will continue to be cheated. 
THE LET'S GROW COMMITTEE 
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):
2003 WORLD FORESTRY CONGRESS 
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Quebec City was the unanimous choice of all of Canada. 
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
If you do not meet old friends, you will make new friends.  
March 17 is almost a statutory holiday in the valley. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
This event marks one of the first steps in a truly historic process.  
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Every Liberal voted against the motion. 
What did the motion say? 
How can anyone expect anything- 
QUEBEC FINANCE MINISTER'S BUDGET 
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
In particular, he claimed not to need the federal government's money. 
However, did anyone notice how quickly our cheque was cashed?  
So, sovereignists, stop playing these prereferendum games. 
Quebeckers are calling you to order.  
JUDIQUE CREIGNISH CONSOLIDATED SCHOOL 
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP):
Judique is not alone. 
The Grammy count for the graduating class must be down this year. 
I take this opportunity to express my support- 
The hon. member for Matapedia-Matane.  
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, no man is a prophet in his own country. 
The hon. member for Toronto Centre-Rosedale.  
Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre-Rosedale, Lib.):
We, the Liberal members from Toronto, are very proud of Toronto's multicultural character. 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):
They will not be disappointed.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
That is what they are saying.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the government's position is very clear. 
We believe in individual taxation. 
We believe in progressive taxation. 
That is our position. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
He has brought in six budgets that discriminate against them. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister evades my question. 
Does the Prime Minister agree with his lawyers or not? 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have a system of fair taxation. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister still did not answer the question. 
That is their argument. 
Is that argument the position of the government? 
Does the Prime Minister support it, yes or no?  
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I wish the hon. member would get his facts right. 
There are no lawyers anywhere.  
I do not know if the hon. minister had finished.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have a progressive tax system in Canada. 
We have policies that help families. 
We have tax credits and so on.  
That is very well known.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there are international rules to be followed. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
On the subject of culture, Quebec has something to say. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that was a government decision. 
We communicated with the French government. 
We do not invite Corsica to cultural discussions here in Canada.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Canada is an independent country. 
There are international rules that have to be followed.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. 
There is something odd about this lease. 
Does the Prime Minister- 
The Right Hon. Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, at that time the Minister of Finance will be 85 years old.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
As long as there is life, there is hope.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Let us stick with the policy.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Her government's policies pit family against family.  
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am not jumping to any conclusions at all. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
She continues to insult- 
The hon. member for Edmonton North.  
Does the Prime Minister agree with these intolerant views or not?  
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
It is something that we think is important. 
We are not pitting parents against each other. 
CANADA-QUEBEC AGREEMENT ON MANPOWER 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
It is not a problem in Alberta. 
In Alberta they value parenting. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we know what the minister thinks of committees. 
His Liberal committee went to him and said please end tax discrimination. 
What did he do? 
He ignored the report. 
He threw it in the garbage.  
That is what he thinks of the- 
I ask the hon. member to go to his question.  
Mr. Speaker, Alberta ended tax discrimination. 
Why does the minister not do exactly the same thing?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
Quebeckers are waiting for the federal government to clean up the mess it made.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
It has never listened. 
Is it not obvious that Liberals support discrimination? 
They defend it at the UN.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let us understand the real agenda of members of the Reform Party. 
What it would discourage is people getting married. 
Is that their motive? 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
The Alberta government has moved ahead in this regard. 
We have put forward proposals on it. 
Why does that Liberal government continue to ignore the voices of Canadian families?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, what we intend to do is very clear. 
That is the basis- 
I would ask hon. members, please, to lower their voices.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Tomorrow the deportation order is due to be executed. 
This family has been left hanging long enough. 
The minister must make her decision known now. 
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have already answered that question this week. 
The case is under review. 
Mr. Charles Hubbard (Miramichi, Lib.):
The hon. member for Miramichi.  
Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
The member for Vancouver Kingsway told them that they were taking the easy way out. 
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
They voted against the child tax benefit. 
They voted against increasing funding for the prenatal nutrition program. 
They voted against making child support payments tax exempt. 
The hon. member for Calgary Southeast.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
I am simply repeating what Reform members themselves said.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
The point is not really to argue about the substance of any particular meeting. 
That is why the government has put $900 million on the table.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Bob Wood (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Bob Wood (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member does have that assurance.  
The bill has the support of all members of the House. 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
The hon. member for Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik.  
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
Hon. Gilbert Normand (Secretary of State (Agriculture and Agri-Food)(Fisheries and Oceans), Lib.):
Most of these involve children and seniors, and are often related to tractors.  
The hon. member for Selkirk-Interlake.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
It is time for the minister to take a stand.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Discussions are going ahead.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
My question is for the Solicitor General. 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
We have and we will.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I can certainly give you the last part of that question. 
That response is now being worked on. 
We have 150 days. 
It is part of the cabinet process. 
As soon as the timetable is met, we will be tabling a report. 
I am sure the hon. member will be very interested in the result.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Now his decision has meant higher banking charges for Canadians.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The member's questions will be answered.  
I would like to answer one other question. 
Mr. John Godfrey (Don Valley West, Lib.):
What is the Minister of Labour doing to resolve the issue?  
Hon. Claudette Bradshaw (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
This is very encouraging for us. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
They sit on their hands, say nothing and do nothing. 
It is time to come out. 
I remind hon. members to please address your questions through the Chair. 
However, we got the gist of the question.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have asked the various stakeholders to comment on the Estey report. 
This government accelerated the review by one year. 
We appointed Justice Estey who was universally accepted by everyone in the industry. 
I would hope that the Reform Party will join us in that effort.  
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the President of the Treasury Board.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
New Brunswick's Liberal government is refusing to provide assistance to new gappers.  
My question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
You are the ones who have created problems for people.  
I remind the hon. member to address his remarks through the Chair.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
At the time, there were close to 7,500 of them. 
COMMENTS DURING QUESTION PERIOD 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Did the hon. minister quote from a document?  
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
I address myself to the member for Edmonton North. 
Is it the contention of the member for Edmonton North that she was directly quoted?  
I address myself to the minister for the status of women. 
It is a matter of interpretation of the facts and we will let that sit.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I believe that probably she was quoting another member here, possibly me. 
I think I have the right to ask for that to be tabled.  
Mr. Speaker, the quotation is from my notes.  
This point is settled.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I would like to table those documents if I might.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
No, we are not saying that at all. 
We are entitled to the document. 
That is the ruling I made.  
Today I understand there is no document from the hon. minister. 
She says she just had some notes. 
She said she was quoting.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
I am also tabling an explanatory form of notes. 
I ask that an order of the day be designated for consideration of the motion.  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
I am pleased to be able to carry on his good work.  
This bill amends the Hazardous Products Act. 
If someone is injured, the criminal will have 25 years added to their sentence.  
I look forward to the support of members on both sides of the House.  
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The document that I would like to table is from the Ottawa Citizen .  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
This petition combines with those presented by my other Bloc Quebecois colleagues.  
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
The petitioners are all automotive technicians who are employed at car dealerships. 
Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay-Boundary-Okanagan, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions to present today. 
Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay-Boundary-Okanagan, Ref.):
Therefore, your petitioners call upon parliament to repeal- 
The hon. member is reading. 
He is to give a brief summary of the petition and not read it. 
I know he knows the rule and would want to comply in every respect.  
Mr. Speaker, I was paraphrasing what is in the actual petition.  
Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to present two groups of petitions. 
Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
This petition combines with those presented by my other Bloc Quebecois colleagues.  
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Eglinton-Lawrence, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to present two petitions in the House of Commons.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Vaughan-King-Aurora, Lib.):
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions today.  
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
GAP BETWEEN RICH AND POOR 
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
The petitioners are perplexed. 
I am summarizing, but basically the petitioners are perplexed.  
QUESTIONS PASSED AS ORDERS FOR RETURNS 
Question No. 137- Mr. David Chatters: 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like Motion No. P-59 to be called.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
The motion is transferred for debate pursuant to Standing Order 97(1).  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like Motion No. P-53 to be called.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:
The motion is transferred for debate pursuant to Standing Order 97(1).  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Some three months have elapsed since it was placed on the order paper. 
We are now on Notices of Motions for the Production of Papers. 
Perhaps we could complete dealing with those.  
If the parliamentary secretary wishes to respond to this point, he can.  
I am sure this could be sorted out between the members.  
FEDERAL-PROVINCIAL FISCAL ARRANGEMENTS ACT 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
I reiterate that today.  
It is an arrogant approach. 
That is what the Liberal government believes. 
The alienation committee can find it now. 
An hon. member: $100 billion.  
That approach simply has not worked. 
That is why there is Liberal alienation in western Canada. 
We saw reference to that yesterday in the House. 
That is their approach to governing and it is shameful.  
The bill is another example of the way of doing business with the Liberal government. 
The people of Canada are growing very tired of this approach. 
That is how the Liberal government deals with the people of Canada. 
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
Shame on him for repeating my remarks.  
I want to end on that note. 
The government is out of touch. 
The bill proves it. 
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to respond to the member's remarks.  
First, I would like to correct the record. 
The member stated that I was an interventionist. 
Let us make sure we get that right.  
I believe the member made that statement.  
I want to be very specific. 
To me, it is part and parcel of our daily responsibility in the Chamber.  
Let us look at the national energy program. 
Yet these Reform Party members were knocking it yesterday.  
Mr. Speaker, I understand exactly where the member stands. 
I was quoting directly from Hansard , from his comments. 
He reinforced them again today. 
We are the federal government. 
We are the big daddy''. 
That is what those dollars are.  
The hon. member brags about the national energy program. 
Government members just do not get it. 
We are willing to make a positive change for the future. 
I am hoping that members opposite will also be willing to do that.  
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
I believe there are seven provinces in Canada that receive them.  
This is what we are talking about today. 
There cannot be any opportunity given to these provinces to catch up.  
Newfoundland has been in Confederation for approximately 50 years. 
We have to consider the fact that we are members of this nation. 
It will be a reduction.  
The population of Newfoundland has gone down significantly over the last number of years. 
The five hours of debate have expired.  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
I would like to read from the Constitution, section 36(2) which states: 
That is the way in which the country was built. 
We are now at the point where provinces help provinces.  
That rule book is called the Constitution of Canada. 
It is wrong to intervene and violate the provisions of sections 91 or 92. 
That is where intervention ought to halt. 
It has not halted there. 
Three out of the five said it was all right. 
What was their rationale to come to that conclusion?  
The member is saying that that is all right.  
One of the problems in this country is this thing called unity. 
The federal government sticks its nose into provincial areas unrequested. 
What about interprovincial trade barriers? 
This bill opens the door for that kind of debate and intervention. 
We, as members of parliament, cannot do it.  
The only protection they had was from the courts of this land.  
We feel it every time we hold a public meeting in western Canada.  
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
However, it is not only this government. 
Let us have a look at this bill. 
The government has had five years to study this bill. 
We were not allowed academic input. 
I have news for government members. 
It has exactly what it can gouge from the taxpayers of Canada. 
That is the only money it has and that is the money it uses. 
Let us look at what we are talking about cost-wise. 
To me $700 million is a large amount of money.  
I really have to wonder about that. 
The bills states that casino funds will be put into the mix. 
I had the opportunity to travel to Newfoundland last year. 
British Columbia as well is having tough times. 
I cannot say that it is all the provincial government's fault. 
We know that is what kills jobs. 
It is not hard to see where this government comes from. 
It is called tax and spend. 
I know Liberal members do not like to hear that. 
That upsets government members terribly.  
This government only thinks of one thing. 
I really have to wonder about that.  
Let us look at the unfairness of some of this. 
Let us look at what the auditor general gave the government in 1997 to address. 
What has it done to date? 
Property assessments are infrequent and done in different years.  
The government is lumping this all in as one, but it varies. 
Bring it in under the provincial GDP. 
Let us open it up, have a look at it and discuss it. 
Government members say ``Here it is. 
However, on this side of the House the times are changing. 
Whether they like it or not they are coming into a new century.  
The people of Canada are waiting for you people to finally do that. 
They have been waiting and waiting and waiting.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay-Boundary-Okanagan, Ref.):
I will give those members some solutions which are a little different. 
Second, it will be short and succinct. 
It is a new idea. 
It is my idea. 
This is not the party speaking, this is me as an individual.  
The government interferes in areas of provincial jurisdiction. 
What is the solution to that?  
Can you not just say thank you?  
That is probably why they cannot get these solutions.  
That is the fundamental purpose of government. 
We are supposed to represent the will of those people.  
Taxation was at the provincial level.  
The government does not seem to realize the war is long over. 
Governments are starting to recognize the folly of deficit finance. 
Governments at the provincial and federal levels are starting to recognize that. 
Let us keep it going. 
Where then does the federal government get its money? 
It gets its money by billing the provinces a fee for services rendered. 
It bills them on the basis of the provincial GDP. 
British Columbia is still potentially a very wealthy province. 
As a B.C. taxpayer, I do not have a problem with that.  
Look at the taxation system. 
An individual making $8,000 or $9,000 a year pays income tax. 
Bill the provincial governments a fee for services rendered on a provincial GDP basis. 
That will be the equalization. 
We will have a lot more control in our province. 
In the province of Alberta, it would give a lot more control. 
Alberta is another very responsible province that seems to be running well.  
Others can take a page from that. 
What we need is a new look at a new system. 
I hope the Liberals are listening. 
They have certainly quieted down since I started talking. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
Canadians are not sure how this affects them one way or another.  
These are noble ideals. 
Is somebody still complaining? 
There is no federal money versus provincial money, only taxpayer money. 
We have to accept some of this no matter what we do. 
It is sometimes difficult to predict what the outcome might be. 
What does this government do instead? 
Why should we think provincial politicians will be any different? 
I do not mean to point fingers anywhere in particular or at anybody. 
The last item is of extreme importance. 
Property taxes have the ability to kill investment as fast as any other factor. 
This can kill a small business or a farm. 
We see industry moving to the States.  
What does Bill C-65 do? 
It actually rewards the provinces for high property taxes. 
This is not really helping anyone. 
It is just a transfer of funds.  
This is not equalizing anything for any Canadians.  
We can see why they come up with complex bills such as Bill C-65. 
Brain drain is an excellent example. 
Industry moving to the States is another excellent example. 
They have to go there.  
It must be transparent. 
All Canadians should be able to look at the mechanism and understand it. 
There is no way they will support it anyway. 
My party suggests the macro formula. 
It is very simplified. 
I find it difficult that my home province of Saskatchewan is a have not province. 
We export them and they head up companies all over the world. 
There are other federal systems around the world. 
We have to see more flexibility in the way we work in this country. 
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
Governments unfortunately always waste a portion of the money. 
They simply shuffle it around in the paperwork and it gets lost. 
Wasting money is the government's special skill. 
This is a terrible waste of money as identified by my constituent. 
It is the type of waste of money that we see throughout the government. 
It is certainly there in the transfer of payments.  
There is something wrong with that scenario. 
Nobody really believes that Quebec is a have not province. 
These are real problems that need to be addressed.  
That seems to be a problem as well. 
Does the government really understand how the people in B.C. feel? 
This would start to assist north-south trade.  
He had no knowledge of it at all. 
Maybe it should be a have not province. 
We should look at ways of tough love.  
The federal government should do its best to assist them in making that happen.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The vote is deferred until 5.15 this afternoon.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the suggestion of the chief government whip. 
Is there unanimous consent?  
(The sitting of the House was suspended at 4.43 p.m.) 
The House resumed at 5.15 p.m. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
(Bill read the third time and passed.)  
This bill has several themes of fairness. 
Those who use negative option sales reverse that method. 
It is a sleight of hand type sale of a service. 
Negative option sales occur under many guises or disguises. 
I will give some examples of this technique.  
One is in the realm of banking. 
There was no requirement to say yes. 
The first thing they do is call Bell Canada to have a phone installed. 
The fourth example is even more insidious. 
Page seven of the brochure contained a negative option suggestion. 
Why did this happen? 
Because it required the consumers to say no, they do not want this to happen. 
There is an interesting twist on this. 
It is the cable companies in Canada.  
The answer is very specific. 
What could possibly be wrong that? 
Banking is also clearly a matter for us in this Chamber to deal with.  
In return what did we receive? 
Negative option marketing and sales cuts the legs out from under this.  
That is a fair question. 
Having said that, they do want to control the circumstances of exercising that choice. 
Negative option techniques remove any suggestion of choice. 
That is why we in this place must move to give consumers that right.  
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
I recognize the work of my colleague from Sarnia-Lambton on this issue.  
We are often just to busy to be careful consumers. 
It is clear that consumers are looking for protection from negative option billing. 
The question is simply how do we provide this protection. 
I think a balance must be struck.  
I am sure we are all familiar with Columbia House Records. 
This is a company that made its money through negative option billing. 
When faced with this competition, Columbia House very quickly revised its negative option billing practices.  
It is the invisible hand of capitalism at work.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
The hon. member for Sarnia-Lambton has expanded his bill. 
Commenting on this decision and talking about telecommunications businesses lawyer Pierre Trudel wrote: 
They would surely have wished to take them into account had they understood. 
The speaker goes on to say: 
I could go on at length. 
This was Ms. Drolet's testimony.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
It is just not fair from the consumer's perspective. 
That is a principle with which I agree.  
Let us face it. 
I heard a lot of negative comments about that in my constituency office. 
It needs to stop now. 
That hurts them and it will hurt consumers dramatically. 
It is a competition issue and it is a consumer issue. 
It is time we made a comprehensive re-examination of the whole policy area.  
We are the only country that does not have one to protect consumers. 
That is unacceptable in this day and age.  
In summary, I support the principle of the member's bill. 
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
We need more members like the member for Sarnia-Lambton in the Liberal caucus. 
As such, Bill C-216 dealt solely with cable television. 
Bill C-216 is history. 
We are now debating Bill C-393. 
The bill proposes fines for those who contravene the act. 
The overall intent is extremely positive. 
The legislation would significantly increase the level of consumer protection. 
Again I applaud the member for Sarnia-Lambton. 
We need more initiatives from Liberal caucus backbenchers.  
Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):
No one else should presume to have that authority without my express permission. 
Negative option marketing endangers this. 
In plain language, self-protection is what we are debating here today.  
It seems simple enough. 
This simple formula has been the basis of our capitalist system for centuries. 
Some of our provinces have already taken appropriate steps to rectify this.  
In short, the said company considers his lack of response to be a purchase agreement.  
At a glance this does not seem to be a bad arrangement. 
However, suppose the mailing was delivered to the wrong address or even lost. 
It has become clear that the public is demanding change. 
Again, I would suggest that this bill advocates that type of change.  
The list of examples seems to go on endlessly. 
We can all name many examples of this type of information pillaging. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
These super ships are too wide to navigate the Panama Canal. 
At 45 feet New York hits bedrock.  
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
These comments are directly related to the comments made by the member from the opposition.  
This nomination process has been reflected in the letters patent. 
In addition, the province and the municipality each appoint a board member.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
At that time I asked the federal government to reform employment insurance. 
Does the minister know what is going on in his department? 
Does the minister know what is going on? 
This is what is happening in New Brunswick.  
There are people who are suffering. 
These are individuals who contributed to the employment insurance fund. 
The minister must realize that seasonal workers are suffering.  
We are creating jobs. 
Now, the provincial government is making matters worse.  
I will end on that note. 
I hope the minister will wake up and take a serious look at this issue.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We have tried to be sensitive to their circumstances. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Members from all political parties attended this important event. 
Dr. Mergler is an expert on the effects of manganese on the human population. 
The government continues to ignore reality. 
The majority of European countries and the United States do not use this product. 
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
As with all scientific issues, gaps exist in our knowledge.  
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
We might ask why he is afraid. 
He says there are only 2,000 gappers.  
I think we ought to define the word ``gapper''. 
He said there are 2,000 gappers in the province. 
There are not just 2,000 in New Brunswick. 
The minister has to come and see. 
We know he is afraid.  
Still the minister refuses to make changes.  
In the department, they talk about investment in the regions. 
New Brunswick loses $275 million a year. 
Two weeks ago, I visited a number of food banks. 
Both are Liberal governments; one would sometimes think they were in cahoots. 
The government says that many women are covered. 
The fact is they contribute, but they do not qualify for benefits. 
I am not making that up, I can see what is going on. 
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada is sensitive to the needs of seasonal workers. 
The province is now responsible for the delivery of these programs.  
In 1994 about 7,500 seasonal workers were affected by the gap. 
Since then this number has been on the decline. 
They get EI when their job ends.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 7.13 p.m.)
