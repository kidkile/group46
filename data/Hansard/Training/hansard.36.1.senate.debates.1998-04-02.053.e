Thursday, April 2, 1998 
The Senate met at 2 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Some of the expectations raised by Jean Charest's decision are excessive and unrealistic. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
It was a very enlightening and pleasant conversation. 
As I recall, he chuckled at that suggestion.  
Mr. Charest was being urged by his supporters to enter the contest. 
The answer came back very much in the affirmative. 
He said, "Senator," and I said, "Minister." 
He said, "Yes, I do." 
The question was referred by the Prime Minister to Stephane Dion. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I do not have a prepared text. 
I will let my heart and my head do the talking. 
I have faced the same problem on a number of occasions. 
There are times when decisions have to be made. 
I am delighted Mr. Charest made this decision. 
On the weekend, I met a lot of people. 
Something extraordinary is happening in Quebec with the arrival of Mr. Charest. 
The latter is finding expression in the person of Mr. Charest. 
Jean Charest's message is a positive one. 
And God knows that for 16 of them I had to oppose these people. 
I know what that involves. 
He will not limit himself to looking back at the past.  
The government team in Quebec is tired and worn out. 
His career is well documented. 
In the Senate, it was the official opposition. 
Jean Charest recognized the great importance of the Senate. 
We had a very good relationship with him. 
And we are grateful to him today.  
I may be young, but valour 
Is never a matter of years.  
In my opinion, this was destiny calling.  
We owe a great deal to Jean Charest. 
We wish him the best of luck in his new career; he deserves it.  
To conclude, we are going through some very difficult times. 
There are currently two opposite poles: the federalists versus the sovereignists. 
We federalists must work together for our country. 
That is what Jean Charest is doing right now. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, the 15-minute period for Senators' Statements has expired. 
Would it be agreeable to hear from Senator Corbin as well?  
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
Honourable senators, I also wished to make a statement. 
However, I saw so many colleagues rise that I held back. 
Perhaps the courtesy could be extended.  
Hon. Raymond J. Perrault :
I will not proceed with my remarks at this time. 
I would prefer to listen to the other tributes to Jean Charest.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Visit of President and Mrs. Clinton to Africa 
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
This was very much a first and an important one. 
However, there is another message in that visit, and one that very much concerns Canada.  
It is a grand opportunity.

The Standing Senate Committee on Fisheries has the honour to present its 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.

Business of the Senate 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is that agreed?  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
For what purpose would we want to delay this item?  
What are we talking about?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
The Leader of the Government replied, in part: 
...it is really a question of talking about periods of time.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Would that not cost an additional $1.1 billion? 
How tragic this is. 
These are indeed very sad circumstances. 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
You certainly cannot say that we do not have the time.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, my honourable friend raises a valid point. 
Senator Comeau has raised an interesting point with respect to pre-study. 
Either negotiations broke down or we found a solution to the problem. 
It is not a solution that we write off entirely.  
That is something that would have to be examined by the chamber as a whole.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I am glad that the Honourable Senator Kinsella has raised this particular point. 
We anticipate new legislation in the very near future. 
Cape Breton Development Corporation.  
There are seven days left on the debate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I anticipate that, in the coming months, that projection will be tabled in the house.  
I appreciate that undertaking on the part of the minister. 
Yes, I will give that undertaking.  
Answer to Order Paper Question Tabled 
Tobacco Industry Responsibility Bill 
Second Reading-Points of Order-Speaker's Ruling 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I am now prepared to rule on the point of order.  
The first has to do with the possibility that the bill requires a Royal Recommendation. 
After Senator Kenny had spoken, several other senators made some comments. 
Let me begin with this general proposition. 
Senator Kinsella identifies the possible petitioners as the "tobacco industry." 
The first is the fact that the objects of the bill affect public policy. 
Therefore, I can see no requirement for a Royal Recommendation for this bill.  
This is evident from Part II of the bill. 
It is also clear that the levy is imposed upon the tobacco industry alone. 
Clause 3 states categorically that the purpose of the bill is: 
The first criterion is that the levy must be for industry purposes. 
More important, they also seem to be applicable in Canadian practice.  
There is further evidence that the levy was not viewed as a tax. 
Honourable senators, in light of the - 
The Hon. the Speaker :
He is in order, and he may proceed.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
That forms the largest number of Canadians to die from a preventable disease. 
This is our most serious problem and one that we must confront.  
It does not make sense. 
This is an incredible outpouring of our resources.  
I feel obliged to tell you that these are not duplicates. 
I also see submissions from the Ontario Campaign for Action on Tobacco. 
The bill is before you because Bill C-71 had two fundamental faults. 
There were two serious omissions in the Tobacco Act that was enacted last year. 
There is no provision for additional funding for that cause.  
However, this is a drop in the bucket; this is a miniscule amount. 
Why is it important that we approach young people? 
Why not approach someone who is 45? 
Why not approach a smoker who is older? 
The critical ages, I am told, are around 10, 11, 12 and 13. 
Some do it because they are emulating someone they admire. 
Perhaps it is Jacques Villeneuve getting out of a racing car. 
You can see the picture now. 
He has just won a race, and he is perspiring. 
He has his new, blond-coloured hair. 
If you want to be cool because we are cool, you had better smoke too." 
I have tested them. 
After the first 15 or 20 minutes, they start telling you things. 
Most senators in this chamber are parents. 
Even those who are not parents are familiar with adolescents. 
That is how young people are coerced into smoking.  
The last motivator has to do with young women. 
Young girls aged 13, 14 and 15 take a look at their role models. 
They look at the magazines designed for young people. 
It speeds up your metabolism; it helps deal with putting something in your mouth. 
They think they will be thin because they are smoking.  
Honourable senators, what am I trying to say? 
They told us that there is no one solution. 
There is no one answer to solve the problem. 
Yes, they thought there was some point in having regional programs. 
They said that their biggest problem was funding. 
I met with a group in Vancouver called Clean Air. 
They operate on a budget of less than $5,000 a year. 
They work on keeping bars and restaurants smoke-free. 
I have been to high schools in New Brunswick which have anti-smoking programs. 
No one starts to smoke at 27, 34 or 45 years of age. 
People start to smoke when they are adolescents. 
I have a list of over 280 organizations that are dependent on tobacco money. 
None of these groups have, as yet, had time to find alternate sponsors. 
They have not had enough time to find sponsors to replace the tobacco company money.  
I know that many people in this room have been involved in fund-raising. 
That is intended to deal with the second deficiency in Bill C-71. 
However, the five years is not a straight giveaway. 
The bill calls for a 50-cent levy on each carton of cigarettes. 
Fifty cents on each carton will generate $120 million a year. 
That is the program I spoke about that could be national, regional or local. 
We hope that its emphasis will be local.  
Without replacement, these organizations will die. 
After five years, funding is cut off. 
It is also designed to push. 
The last $10 million of the $120 million goes to farmers. 
That is designed to assist them to find other crops. 
It is very difficult for a tobacco farmer to move away from tobacco. 
When they grow apples, it takes five years before they harvest their first crop. 
This bill takes that into consideration.  
Young people are very price-sensitive. 
The higher the price of cigarettes, the less they smoke. 
I do not believe that smuggling will be an issue here. 
I do not believe it will be a problem.  
Proposition 99 is referred to briefly in your summary. 
They simply added a tax, boom, to each pack of cigarettes.  
California is no bigger than Canada. 
California has a population very similar to the size of Canada. 
We do not need to have 40,000 people dying every year. 
It is a real "no-brainer." 
This bill introduces a levy of fifty cents a carton. 
It will not cause more smuggling. 
The fifty cents a carton produces $120 million in the first year. 
It goes from $60 million up to $120 million. 
Honourable senators, that in a nutshell describes the bill. 
I have left with you some letters of support. 
These are serious people who feel this bill can work. 
We have an Easter break coming up. 
I believe you will find that the answer is yes to all of those questions.  
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
I do, however, wish to go on record as a supporter of this bill. 
It was not the right time to amend a government bill. 
We did try, but unsuccessfully. 
I have three children, two of them teenage boys aged 15 and 14. 
At 15, we are non-smokers and have pretty well worked out our problems. 
We want people our own age to talk to us. 
Only 30 per cent do, a minority." 
Senator Kenny has just responded to a call from the tobacco industry. 
Bill S-13 is a response to a call by the industry. 
We have the same goals, especially those who, like me, are trying to stop smoking. 
I am very aware that it sets a bad example for my children. 
I do not smoke in their presence.  
It is not even a burden. 
Smokers will pay that without a murmur. 
They are happy to pay the money and they will say thank you.  
We will try to examine all aspects of the issue: there will certainly be amendments. 
Changes might be required and you will be presented with the final product.  
I will touch on tobacco sponsorships. 
I have been following this issue in Quebec mostly. 
In 1997, they sponsored events to the tune of $31 million. 
This means organizers do not have to pay for this publicity themselves. 
We are talking about a total amount of $42 million. 
There is nothing we can do about it; that is just the way it is.  
The elimination of this financial assistance would be disastrous. 
I cannot conceive of these eight events disappearing. 
Some will certainly say this was not the right solution. 
Instead of losing it all, they will take the money.  
I urge you to support this bill. 
Hon. Celine Hervieux-Payette :
Hon. Wilbert J. Keon :
However, I have grave problems with this proposal. 
The Canadian tobacco industry has been totally irresponsible and continues to be totally irresponsible. 
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
Lack of Accessibility for Disabled to Facilities-Inquiry-Debate Concluded 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Today, I will speak to both of these issues.  
I am sure each and every one of you agrees with this portrayal.  
However, the time has come for us to look at our own doorstep. 
Our House of Parliament is supposed to be a house of the people. 
Needless to say, there should be no barriers to its accessibility. 
One such service is home care. 
Honourable senators, with the issue of home care goes the issue of accessibility. 
We must both identify and address the shortcomings. 
Let me provide an example. 
My husband is his only child. 
On average, it costs us $55,000 a year. 
How many Canadians can afford that kind of care in their home?  
Much of that cost is beyond the ability of the average Canadian. 
We need for our Senate to be accessible. 
We need for public buildings to be accessible. 
In closing, let me remind you of a speech given by Senator Cohen. 
For even if we miss, we will find ourselves among the stars. 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
If no other senator wishes to speak, this inquiry is considered debated.  
Hon. Wilfred P. Moore , pursuant to notice of March 31, 1998, moved: 
Both refused to testify.  
This occurred while the inquiry was still ongoing. 
In my view, this is a grave injustice. 
On motion of Senator Berntson, debate adjourned.  
Hon. Charlie Watt , pursuant to notice of April 1, 1998, moved: 
Business of the Senate 
Leave having been given to revert to Government Notices of Motions: 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
This third week will clearly be a committee week.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, April 28, 1998, at 2 p.m.
