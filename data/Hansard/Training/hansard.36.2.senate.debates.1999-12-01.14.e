The Senate met at 1:30 p.m., the Speaker pro tempore in the Chair.  
Hon. Erminie J. Cohen :
Honourable senators, I rise today to observe World AIDS Day. 
The twelfth annual World AIDS Day is targeted at the youth of the world. 
This year's theme is "Children and Young People:
Hon. Jean-Robert Gauthier :
Honourable senators, the Francophonie spoke out clearly on the protection of cultural diversity. 
RCMP Inspector Robert Upshaw 
Leave having been given to revert to Senators' Statements: 
Hon. Calvin Woodrow Ruck :
Canadian District of the Moravian Church of America 
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
The Estimates, 1999-2000 
Notice of Motion to Authorize National Finance Committee to Study Estimates 
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Thursday next, December 2, 1999, I will move: 
That the Committee present its report no later than March 31, 2000.  
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Thursday next, December 2, 1999, I will move: 
Notice of Motion to Authorize Committee to Engage Services 
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Thursday next, December 2, 1999, I will move: 
Cost Overruns in Capital Expenditures on Embassies Abroad 
He is from Alberta.  
An Albertan more efficient than a Manitoban? 
I do not think so. 
They are fairly simple questions. 
Not only that, but the $22-million overrun may have cancelled the project. 
The land is vacant. 
That is a lot of money in India.  
They have been doing this kind of thing for years. 
Perhaps the Leader of the Government would care to respond.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I thank the honourable senator for his remarks.  
Answer the speech, please.  
I will attempt to obtain more specific information to address the honourable senators's concerns.  
The honourable senator raises concerns with respect to the vacant land. 
I think we owe something to this chamber and to the people of Canada. 
We have these outrageous overruns. 
How are you addressing this problem? 
How will you prevent it in the future?  
The honourable senator raises an important issue. 
Appropriate Level of Reserve in Employment Insurance Fund 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
If so, what is the number and how was that particular number determined?  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I believe they are acting, if I may say this, conservatively. 
However, my specific question dealt with the issue of reserves in the fund. 
What does the minister consider to be an adequate reserve? 
When can employers look forward to some relief?  
What is an appropriate level of reserve? 
I cannot provide a specific answer to the honourable senator's question. 
It may depend on the economy at a given point in time. 
Other factors may be brought to bear. 
One would certainly wish to err on the side of caution in any event. 
I cannot give a personal view as to what the appropriate level should be. 
As the Auditor General reported: 
The figure is startling. 
Yet it is not at all clear what services are being provided. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
That is a new definition of "some", I must say.  
Honourable senators, I will quote from the Auditor General again when he said: 
I may be there.  
No, you will be there and, honourable senator, you will wish you were here.  
We will be there, too. 
Honourable senators, I understand more people may be seeking a nomination. 
It is an example I am not sure I would recommend.  
The minister will take seriously the comments made by the Auditor General. 
Honourable senators, the honourable senator has clearly expressed her concerns. 
Honourable senators, my question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I have read some of the comments to which the honourable senator refers. 
One can ascribe whatever motives one chooses.  
That was the practice in some jurisdictions, and it was a very dangerous practice.  
It has been popular to forecast surpluses for the next five years.  
Hon. Michael A. Meighen :
Honourable senators, my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Norman K. Atkins :
Honourable senators, my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
The matter that the honourable senator raises is a serious one. 
As he points out, it is not one with which I am familiar. 
However, I will certainly make some inquiries and undertake a personal tour.  
New War Museum-Nature of Private Financing 
What kind of private financing was the minister talking about?  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Perhaps the minister could inform us as to how this will happen.  
I find it shameful that we are even talking about this matter. 
Business of the Senate 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, the time allowed for Question Period is up. 
Is there leave to continue, honourable senators?  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Your Honour has risen regarding an extension of time for Question Period. 
Delayed Answer to Oral Question 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Possibility of Further Assistance to Protect People Against Violence 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Herbert O. Sparrow on November 16, 1999) 
A number of provincial jurisdictions have identified home invasions as an area of concern. 
CCJS also publishes reports on overall criminal justice trends. 
An options paper is presently under development. 
Courts have been imposing stiff sentences for this type of crime. 
Civil International Space Station Agreement Implementation Bill 
Hon. William M. Kelly :
Canada's space industry has become a major contributor to the Canadian economy. 
I hope this decrease in spending is not a sign of that in this case.  
I said earlier that I thought this initiative deserved our enthusiastic support. 
The ISS has no direct military role or capability. 
For example, it will have no launch capability for satellites or missiles. 
This guarantees the ISS is used for exclusively peaceful purposes.  
Russia's experience with the MIR space station is of enormous benefit to this project. 
Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets are also an important part of the project. 
How far we have come! 
We have sent probes to the outer reaches of space. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read a third time?  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, I rise to speak to Bill S-7. 
In this Senate, I took the Oath of Allegiance to Her Majesty. 
The Constitution Act, 1867, section 17 states: 
Bill S-7 poses an important and pressing constitutional question. 
The Statute of Westminster stated in part: 
It is simply too inconvenient for ministers to attend. 
Honourable senators, I challenge those who assert that the Royal Assent is a mere formality. 
I say that their false or wrong assertion cannot by repetition become true or right. 
Nor is this veto of the English monarch an empty form. 
Royal Assent is no mere formality. 
The Clerk of the House of Commons is the Under-Clerk of the Parliaments. 
This alteration is a limitation. 
Etapisme, the certain, persistent deletion of the language of the constitutional monarchy of Canada.  
The Royal Consent is generally given at the earliest stage of debate. 
However, for a private member the situation is quite different. 
For a private member on the opposition benches, the situation is also interesting. 
That could have the makings of a constitutional crisis. 
I believe that committee was chaired by Senator Gildas Molgat. 
The report's recommendation No. 3 said, at page 1469: 
The operative words are "address" and "praying that she approve".  
This intimation should be given before the committal of the Bill. 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Having said that, honourable senators, I should like to move an amendment to the motion. 
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
I have never done that.  
I wonder if Senator Cools would not want to withdraw that word. 
Honourable senators, I should like to thank Senator Corbin for his particular question. 
I should like to make it quite clear that those words were not my words.  
Are you demeaning the rest of us?  
If you would like to take the floor, you are quite welcome.  
Those words were not my words. 
This bill has its supporters, as it certainly has its opponents. 
That is exactly what I am doing at this moment.  
She made me feel very receptive to her point of view.  
Nevertheless, we must choose our words carefully. 
In fact, I think it diminishes the entire debate.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I rise on a point of order. 
I believe that this motion goes way beyond the bill. 
Therefore, I ask that the Speaker rule it out of order.  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I was intending to move the adjournment of the debate. 
If it is, I will so move.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, a point of order has been raised. 
I will hear other senators who wish to speak to the point of order.  
Honourable senators, I agree with the Honourable Senator Lynch-Staunton's point of order. 
The bill deals with the process by which that assent will be given.  
From my interpretation, there is no violation whatsoever of the prerogative. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
We have a series of safeguards built into the house procedures. 
Rule 2 of the Rules of the Senate reads: 
"Bill" means a draft Act of Parliament and includes a private and a public bill; 
Honourable senators, I should like to respond. 
My amendment is a good amendment. 
The question before us right now is a point of order. 
These are matters that should be left to the whole chamber.  
My amendment is clear on the face of it. 
I have given my copy of it to Senator Lynch-Staunton. 
I did not say that there should be any limitation on him. 
These issues have been debated quite extensively. 
For the time being, I will quote Lord Lansdowne. 
Honourable senators, the Royal Consent is the assent in advance. 
I do not think anyone will dispute that. 
In the instance of the Royal Recommendation, it is more difficult. 
That is mandated by sections 53 and 54 of the BNA Act, 1867. 
On the particular issue of the Royal Consent, it can be given later.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
No one in this chamber would dare challenge it. 
That is not for us. 
It is a constitutional requirement, which we respect. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
If not, I will take the matter under advisement.  
Debate adjourned to await Speaker's Ruling.  
Legal and Constitutional Affairs 
Committee Authorized to Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
Leave having been given to proceed to Motions: 
Hon. Lorna Milne , pursuant to notice of November 25, 1999, moved: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
It is as simple as that. 
I sympathize with Senator Milne. 
Senator Kolber is about to ask for the same permission, and I understand why. 
That was the agreement at the time. 
This system is not working. 
Again, I will state my frustration, which, I believe, is shared by many. 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
I do not disagree with him. 
In fact, I understand his point very well.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
It was moved by the Honourable Senator Milne, seconded by the Honourable Senator Taylor: 
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Committee Authorized to Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
Hon. Leo E. Kolber :
With leave of the Senate and notwithstanding rule 58(1), I move: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Energy, the Environment and Natural Resources 
Hon. Mira Spivak rose pursuant to notice of motion of November 2, 1999: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I move the amended motion standing in my name.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion as amended?  
Unfortunately, we could not improve Bill C-32. 
Frankly, part of what they suggested just cannot be done. 
How is that feasible?  
For those still in use, the minister has two choices. 
For that reason alone, several substances have not been regulated.  
I hope you will take my word for this kind of categorization.  
Which will it be? 
A process that is feasible or a process that some industries favour. 
It is important to Canadians, and to none more than to those in the North.  
First, the committee in the other place has a full slate. 
It has yet to complete a review of the system dealing with pesticides. 
Our committee does not have a huge backlog of bills to consider at this time. 
In fact, it has contradictory meanings in our two official languages. 
It excludes the Metis from a new national advisory committee. 
It does not recognize the voluntary efforts of responsible private-sector corporations. 
I hope that the bill will be redrafted for the better. 
However, that did not happen and is now past history. 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Would the Honourable Senator Spivak accept a question?  
Is this something that the committee has discussed? 
Is that the case with respect to this matter?  
No, that is not the case, as the Honourable Senator Hays well knows. 
We are talking about beginning a review. 
The last review took five years. 
Perhaps the proper thing is to have someone adjourn the debate.  
On motion of Senator Taylor, debate adjourned.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
The intention is behind those words.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The honourable senator has done so today.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Honourable Senator Cools objects.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
This is a proper point of order. 
I undertake to do so. 
Energy, the Environment and Natural Resources 
Committee Authorized to Study Matters Related to Mandate
