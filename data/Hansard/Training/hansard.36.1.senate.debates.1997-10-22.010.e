Wednesday, October 22, 1997 
The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
She previously had a distinguished legal career in Nova Scotia. 
The issue in this case was an allegation of "racially based judicial bias." 
Judge Sparks referred to her own life experiences when she observed: 
In their findings, Justices L'Heureux-Dube and McLachlin stated: 
Racism is a pernicious reality. 
Judges McLachlin and L'Heureux-Dube further stated: 
We do this by taking different perspectives into account. 
This is the path out of the blindness of our subjective conditions.  
I have known Judge Sparks for many years. 
International Day for the Eradication of Poverty 
Hon. Erminie J. Cohen :
In its resolution to that effect, the UN stated: 
I am certain that honourable senators will recognize the fundamental truth of this assertion. 
I, for one, could not agree more.  
Unfortunately, honourable senators, the war on the deficit has become a war on the poor. 
Annual YWCA Worldwide Challenge 
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
Last year it was held in no fewer than 17 countries. 
Each day of this Week Without Violence addresses a specific theme. 
Today, for example, it is "Confronting Violence Against Women." 
Each and every one of us can help improve the lives of Canadian families.  
Major Crop Losses in British Columbia 
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
They suffered $30 million worth of damages. 
I ask honourable senators to take this devastation into consideration. 
Social Affairs, Science and Technology 
Report of Committee Tabled 
Energy, the Environment and Natural Resources 
Notice of Motion to Authorize Committee to Engage Services 
Honourable senators, I give notice that tomorrow, Thursday, October 23, 1997, I will move: 
Notice of Motion to Authorize Committee to Permit Electronic Coverage 
Honourable senators, I give notice that tomorrow, Thursday, October 23, 1997, I will move: 
Notice of Motion to Authorize Committee to Study Matters Related to Mandate 
Honourable senators, I give notice that tomorrow, Thursday, October 23, 1997, I will move: 
That the committee report to the Senate no later than March 31, 1999. 
Hon. John B. Stewart :
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Tuesday next, October 28, 1997, I will move: 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I think that all honourable senators would be concerned about this situation. 
We watched with sadness as it developed. 
I certainly will bring that suggestion to the attention of my honourable colleague.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I cannot confirm definitively that such discussions have taken place. 
On page 22 of that document he tells Canadians that a payroll tax: 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Everyone applying for employment insurance starts with a clean slate. 
Honourable senators, my question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
If I am wrong, tell me I am wrong.  
Even Alberta is doing something. 
Perhaps I can give my honourable friend a little information. 
My friend says "not lately." 
Taxes have been cut by $2 billion over three years.  
I will tell you where. 
That was all picked up by the provinces.  
There is a $16-billion surplus in the employment insurance account. 
The standard of living of most Canadians is dropping dramatically. 
The economy is not just creeping along, it is roaring along. 
Replacement of Outdated F-18 Hornet Aircraft- Government Position 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
It could do rolls. 
It was a menacing contribution to Allied forces.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I never made it to the Air Cadets.  
If he has the answer, perhaps he could give it to us.  
I was confirmed in that rank.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the leader's answer leaves me as puzzled as I was last week. 
There must be some indicators. 
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
I believe that our governments have always supported small business. 
We also believe in keeping people in their communities.  
Because his contract was up, he had to bid on a new contract.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
In the meantime, the contract with ADGA, which has already been awarded, will continue.  
This matter should surely be re-examined. 
It is simply unacceptable.  
Prime Minister's Office 
Liberal Appointments to Prime Minister's Office and Canada Post 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Delayed Answers to Oral Questions 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
At Work in Rural Communities 
Cost and Purpose of Producing Material- Government Position 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson on October 1, 1997) 
There are two versions of the kit. 
Canada Communication Group printed the cerlox versions.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Cape Breton Development Corporation 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I welcome that consensus. 
It was reconstituted for a short period earlier this year. 
They are looking for justice and a level playing field. 
That has not changed. 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the Deputy Leader of the Government is correct. 
Consultations have taken place, and we have agreed to a committee with nine members.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
It was moved by the Honourable Senator Murray, seconded by the Honourable Senator Forrestall: 
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Bill to Amend-Second Reading 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
We are now ready to have this bill sent to committee.  
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
When shall this bill be read the third time?  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
I would thank Senator Lewis for expediting this matter. 
On motion of Senator Kinsella, debate adjourned.  
Speech from the Throne 
Motion for Address in Reply-Debate Continued 
4th day of resuming debate ). 
Only a few years ago, the nation's finances needed emergency care. 
Clearly, we have come a long way in a short time. 
We are looking to our future together with a new optimism. 
That commitment is of special importance to the province of Prince Edward Island. 
This, again, is of great importance to Prince Edward Island.  
In the last while, my province has made strong economic gains. 
Come to our shores in the height of summer - the landscape is spectacular. 
It is a sight to behold. 
In my own province of Prince Edward Island, there is a growing mood of optimism. 
Already, the benefits are enormous. 
Hon. Therese Lavoie-Roux :
The areas I am referring to are children and health care.  
That was the situation.  
As we say in French, "se peter les bretelles." 
I do not think it is a record the government can brag about. 
Honourable senators, that worries me. 
This is a lot of money. 
It is not only a matter of giving more money to the people. 
The provincial ministers responsible for social policy are concerned as well. 
To return to the question of the family. 
The family has never been in more upheaval than it is at present. 
Divorces are common, and single-parent families abound. 
The figure for Canada as a whole is one in five.  
Families are concerned with more than child rearing. 
It is not rare for parents and children to have 50 years together. 
Fifteen per cent of the Canadian population lacks any type of drug coverage. 
There is no doubt that shaping social and health policy is a challenge. 
Poverty, however, goes far beyond income tax returns and insufficient income.  
In closing, I would like simply to caution the government. 
I will simply read you a quote from the newspaper Le Devoir : 
We could add in the area of health. 
In conclusion, honourable senators, I hope there will be serious thought given. 
What objectives are they after? 
Who are they focusing on exactly? 
How do we evaluate the results? 
It is a lot of money.  
It is a big word, but we must give it careful thought.  
I agree with some parts of this speech. 
For instance, Canada is indeed seen around the world as a success story. 
This was a painful process, but we had the courage to do it. 
However, it is the current government which has reaped the benefits. 
It is no wonder that the Conservative government inherited such a mess. 
There are five factors involved. 
Third, there is the mild economic growth which has lessened unemployment a little. 
Is that not a record we want to break?  
This will have an enormous impact on consumption by Canadian taxpayers. 
I guess we are beating the French. 
There has been nothing. 
Honourable senators, I am pleased to see that the government has become a free trader. 
Recently, however, the Minister of Finance seemed to change his tune.  
After so many costly mistakes, I thought they would finally have learned their lesson. 
But I guess some people never learn.  
The minister is not known for his lack of arrogance. 
So, ladies and gentlemen on the government side, let us see a little humility. 
I guarantee you that taxpayers will know where their true priorities lie. 
The people in Quebec see these targeted federal grants as provocation. 
Everyone is aware of that. 
In other words, the state knows better than we do what is good for us. 
The hand Privy Council has had in this is not obvious. 
There are single parent families, because of separations? 
Is there a problem with children dropping out of school? 
The same goes for businesses. 
Why should the government manage risks better than the banks do? 
The speech does what it was designed to do.  
All of these have supplemented the research of many students. 
As the Leader of the Government has described it, we now have restored confidence. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I wish to support what Senator Bolduc said. 
...collaboration is an essential ingredient for the success of Canada. 
More than ever, Canadians want their governments to work together in partnership.  
Honourable senators, the way of the future rests on co-managing the federation. 
The auditor general came to the same conclusion in his report tabled two weeks ago.  
I was looking forward to positive initiatives in several areas. 
This co-management approach would emphasize economic and social union. 
The Speech from the Throne does not mention this. 
The government's track record when it comes to co-management is non-existent.  
However, this should take place in the context of a partnership. 
It does not allow Ottawa and the provinces to build constructive relationships.  
This partnership mechanism could resolve many of our problems.  
Their speeches show that they bring purpose and conviction to their presence here. 
This chamber is distinguished by their participation. 
I come from an island on the other coast. 
We have come this far fighting against a very strong current, the federal government. 
I want to remind senators of some of the history of this program. 
That was not the case.  
There were, however, many costs to this plan. 
This has proved to be the case. 
It was also to suggest appropriate adjustment measures and improvements to the plan.  
They are becoming entrenched in the system.  
To quote again from the French Creek fisher: 
It is a no-win situation. 
Please help us and others that are in this dilemma.  
The other 10 had earned very little money. 
One had fished only six days in the previous two years. 
Of course, the income levels of those families reflect that.  
That is what the government came up with. 
This was "Admiral Mifflin's" program of spending. 
Whatever it takes to retrain displaced fishers amounted to $18 million for crisis management. 
They are not make-work jobs. 
The time has come to honour that commitment.  
To put it simply, are the people being trained? 
Are they fulfilling the jobs? 
Are the jobs being done?  
This is a way of ensuring that the program is accountable. 
The economy in B.C. is very different from the economy in the maritimes. 
The last few years have not been pleasant ones for my community.  
In addition, some sixty civilian employees of CFS Masset have been laid off since then. 
In 1995, we were hit again by the federal government. 
This in itself was not the worst news. 
This opportunity was denied us by the Minister of Fisheries. 
Just when we needed it. 
The mayor's letter continues: 
That makes sense if the fishing fleet is denied access.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable Senator Carney, your allotted time has expired. 
Are you requesting leave to continue?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
We are facing other problems, some due to the federal government, some not...  
We all realize that the nation's finances must be put in order. 
Cutbacks and downsizings are the buzz words of the times. 
Do we all move to Vancouver or Toronto? 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Something of major importance was about to be announced. 
If only that were true. 
Perhaps the Prime Minister should read some of the studies prepared by certain government departments. 
Even the Minister of National Defence does not recognize that there is a problem. 
This panel will be looking into the issues of racism in the armed forces. 
This report rated Toronto residents as the most intolerant in Canada. 
Yet this government does not want to admit that there is a problem.  
One has to wonder why they want to hide these immigration reports. 
Why do they not want us to read them? 
Would you send your children to school under those circumstances? 
So far, we have not received a positive response.  
The Speech from the Throne states: 
The Speech from the Throne states that: 
...Canadians feel better about their own future. 
We are looking to our future together with a new optimism.  
The Prime Minister recently stated: 
The Speech from the Throne refers to justice issues, but two key issues are missing. 
The first issue concerns the rights of victims of crimes. 
It is the victim who has suffered. 
Post-secondary education concerns are of vital importance to Canadians. 
The government must take steps to ensure that repayment plans are reasonable. 
Frankly, that amount of money is not available in a number of Canadian households. 
In addition, some universities are now insisting that students have a computer. 
The government must take steps quickly to address this concern.  
The Black Cultural Centre in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia is one that comes to mind. 
What is lacking is the funding to translate such an initiative into action. 
Yet the computer can be of tremendous benefit to our isolated communities. 
Knowledge is literally at their fingertips. 
The 20th century shall be the century of Canada and of Canadian development.  
...it is hereby ordered as follows:
On motion of Senator Carstairs, debate adjourned.  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading 
The present bill is meant to deal with this situation.  
In that way, it does not interfere with the freedom of expression.  
There are those who may say it did not receive adequate attention and consideration. 
In fact, several arguments against the bill were raised in committee. 
Honourable senators, there has been considerable support expressed for this bill amongst interested organizations. 
In any event, I consider that these matters can be dealt with in our committee.  
In April, moreover, after his speech, I supported his motion. 
I think the author of the bill deserves congratulations.  
The bill comes before us again today. 
He may be right, but I for one am not ready to accept that. 
They express serious reservations, which deserve consideration. 
Their views deserve to be heard. 
Their concern is precisely that the bill went through the House of Commons so quickly.  
The bill is now before us. 
I am of the view that the bill does have a great deal of merit. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I withdraw my motion.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is there unanimous agreement?  
Hon. Raymond J. Perrault :
Honourable senators, I shall be brief. 
We had that monstrous serial killer Clifford Olson. 
Subsequently, Mr. Olson wrote Members of Parliament. 
I was one of the recipients of his letter. 
I can tell you I did not provide any support for that suggestion. 
However, he did it to a number of other people in public life.  
He said he is getting lonely. 
We should accede to that request, honourable senators. 
I think it might be very interesting.  
Hon. John G. Bryden :
I will be brief as well, honourable senators. 
I think I can understand why the other place would rush it through. 
We are not here to determine that. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I concur with the sentiment expressed by Senator Bryden. 
The second one is Parliament and the legislative assemblies. 
That was a key part of the health of democracy in America.  
Hon. John B. Stewart :
Could I ask the honourable senator a question? 
If it also meets several other tests.  
You will have to vote before you answer those tests.  
Of course, I understand the limiting of rights. 
I have no difficulty with issues of limitation. 
Hon. Richard J. Doyle :
That would not have happened if this law had been in effect in Canada.  
Motion agreed to and bill read the second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
When shall this bill be read the third time?  
Establishment of Special Committee-Debate Adjourned 
Hon. William M. Kelly , pursuant to notice of October 1, 1997, moved: 
That the Committee present its final report no later than April 15, 1998. 
The report of the first committee was tabled in this place in June 1987. 
We wanted to anticipate the risks and to prepare ahead of time.  
The committee members felt very proud of their first report. 
Since then we have seen a rise in the prominence of some of these groups.  
I am talking about turf battles.  
Over the last seven years, there have been no major terrorist incidents in Canada. 
In this light, it is important to scrutinize our own security intelligence apparatus. 
I think that is very counter-productive.  
Honourable senators, I want to assure this chamber that this is not a witch hunt. 
On motion of Senator Carstairs, for Senator Hays, debate adjourned.  
Committee Authorized to Study State of Financial System 
That the Committee submit its final report no later than December 10, 1998. 
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
