Tuesday, December 8, 1998 
The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Honourable Jean B. Forest 
I should like to offer my words to Jean today.  
I will miss her wisdom, her support and her laughter. 
Hon. Catherine S. Callbeck :
Honourable senators, on-ice brilliance does not just happen. 
This week, the Charlottetown Abbies retained their number one ranking in the country. 
This is obviously quite an accomplishment. 
I am hopeful that they will be successful as the season moves towards its conclusion.  
Anniversary of Signing of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
In the context of world history, this is just a short time ago. 
By June 1997, 138 countries had ratified this covenant. 
These articles are important.  
Honourable senators, look around at our democratic institutions. 
We are fortunate to live in a country such as this. 
Adoption of International Covenant on Rights of Indigenous Peoples 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Honourable senators, aboriginal rights are human rights issues. 
This covenant is a powerful statement on the rights of indigenous peoples. 
This is another example.  
Honourable senators, this is a perception that is morally untenable, malicious and damaging.  
Anniversary of Commencement of Siege of Hong Kong 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
In all, 40 per cent became casualties.  
Those who survived are only just now being recognized by our country.  
The Royal Canadian Air Force was active against Japanese forces in the Aleutians. 
A Canadian Canso squadron served in Ceylon. 
Yes, we do have heroes.  
Fiftieth Anniversary of Signing of International Declaration of Human Rights 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
As you know, honourable senators, Canada has upheld this commitment for a long time. 
In a few months, however, these provisions will be a thing of the past.  
Business of the Senate 
Distsribution of Document Requested to be Tabled 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham , Leader of the Government:
Honourable senators, I wish to raise a matter arising out of yesterday's proceedings. 
It is my understanding that we have the agreement of the opposition.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
Privatization and Licensing of Quotas 
Report of Fisheries Committee Tabled 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is it your pleasure to adopt the motion?  
Canada Small Business Financing Bill 
Tuesday, December 8, 1998 
The Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce has the honour to present its 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall the bill be read the third time?  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Canadian NATO Parliamentary Association 
Veterans Health Care Services 
Hon. Orville H. Phillips :
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Wednesday, December 9, 1998, I will move: 
Hon. William M. Kelly :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it in your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Estimates of Department of Fisheries and Oceans 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Wednesday, December 9, 1998, I will move: 
History of the Chinese in Canada 
Pages Exchange Program with House of Commons 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Chad is from St. John's, Newfoundland.  
I welcome you on behalf of all senators.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
I invite honourable members to read that letter. 
Officers from the Prime Minister's Office have decided - 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham , Leader of the Government:
Honourable senators, the evidence is clearly before all honourable senators to read for themselves. 
It is dated November 30 and addressed to me. 
Presumably there was one addressed to the Leader of the Opposition as well. 
Allow me to draw your attention to the concluding paragraphs of that letter.  
Honourable senators, many complainants file complaints under that process. 
The former solicitor general has also taken the fall.  
We should not be intimidated or shrink away from that responsibility. 
There are matters now before the Federal Court. 
We are following due process. 
The government, even if it wanted to, could not end the hearings. 
Honourable senators, I wish to continue with the same line of questioning regarding APEC. 
It concerns something called "credibility."  
If not, will it?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Mr. Morin has resigned for his own personal reasons. 
I suggest that we allow them to get on with the job.  
This government believes in due process. 
Like the Somalia inquiry?  
What about the Airbus and due process?  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I will have to take that question under advisement.  
Senator Forrestall poses interesting questions on these matters. 
That is a good question.  
It is a fair question. 
I inquired about that very matter this morning. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
The T-58F engine on the Labrador exploded after it was turned off.  
It is clear that using 35-year-old helicopters is like rolling the dice.  
This is the late 1990s. 
When will these helicopters be grounded? 
I refer to the cancellation of the contract for the supply of EH-101 helicopters. 
They could have been pressed into service in search and rescue.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
However, that is not my information.  
Let us talk about the word "grounded." 
It is an important term that has been used extensively in this particular exchange. 
Honourable senators, I have one final comment.  
Will the minister consider this suggestion?  
Senator Forrestall raised the question of the HMCS Halifax . 
I just want to hitchhike on this particular question.  
That is very important for purposes of clarification.  
It was out on another mission, no doubt.  
And the only option.  
That was not an option.  
They did what was appropriate under the circumstances. 
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson :
I am reverting to the APEC problem.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the answer is a simple "yes" because, again, we are following due process. 
I thank the honourable leader for that answer. 
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
All of the evidence provided before the Public Complaints Commission will be public. 
It is a public forum. 
All of the documents presented to the commission will be transparent and made public.  
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
It is often televised and shown across Canada. 
This is also a time when our Jewish colleagues reflect upon their celebrations. 
These groups have approached the NCC. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Cape Breton Development Corporation 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I stand by the answers that I gave yesterday. 
I do not know where the Canadian Press got its information.  
Bill to Amend-Third Reading-Debate Adjourned 
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
On motion of Senator Tkachuk, debate adjourned.  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading 
Hon. Therese Lavoie-Roux :
I wish to emphasize an important point in broaching this issue. 
This is an issue which touches our conscience since smoking kills. 
Our responsibility is one of protecting the well-being of Canadians.  
That is more than 100 a day. 
And the forecast is 47,000 by the year 2000. 
In Quebec, one person in four dies of cancer. 
This is one of the highest rates in the world. 
Children are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effect of smoke. 
The statistics are alarming. 
Young people think they are invincible, but that is far from the case. 
I certainly urge you to give careful consideration to Bill C-42.  
Do we really mean it when we say we want to protect our young people? 
Should we not think of them first? 
I have nothing against such events. 
Not so long ago, I really enjoyed playing tennis. 
They could revive events they previously sponsored. 
Honourable senators, we must not fight this battle in a half-hearted way. 
Our response must match the magnitude of this problem. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
When shall this bill be read the third time?  
Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
It gives Canadians an appropriate legal tool with which to respect our international commitments.  
This bill will provide much needed modernization to our extradition law. 
Both are more than one hundred years old. 
Society, however, has evolved a lot in the last decades; so has criminality. 
We therefore need to strengthen our legislation and eliminate its deficiencies. 
Lawyers refer to this as the prima facie test.  
When we say "extremely difficult," we mean extremely difficult. 
It can take years to prepare these cases. 
This record of the case would be certified by appropriate authorities in the requesting state. 
The bill strengthens the guarantees accorded fugitives. 
Honourable senators, Bill C-40 also improves considerably the procedure for extradition. 
In this bill, the current two-track system is maintained. 
I believe that it merits our support.  
On motion of Senator Beaudoin, debate adjourned.  
Royal Canadian Mint Act Currency Act 
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
I am referring of course to the Canadian Mint.  
Many parts of the legislative text are of an administrative nature.  
That is why the government proposes enhancing its borrowing power.  
Supplementary Estimates describe the government's need for additional supply.  
That report was adopted in this chamber yesterday.  
Some of these major items include the following. 
Their performance was excellent. 
The entire committee was struck by the work of these two gentlemen. 
We were extremely appreciative of their testimony.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Motion on Appointment Adopted 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs , pursuant to notice of December 7, 1998, moved: 
The Commissioner of Official Languages is a special ombudsperson who reports directly to Parliament.  
The role of the commissioner is clearly focused on people. 
She has been promoting and defending our two official languages for a long time.  
Hon. Noel Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I rise on a point of order. 
Perhaps His Honour could give us some guidance on that point.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
This comes from speaking notes that were given to me. 
I accept the deputy leader's explanation.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I would therefore call on all honourable senators to support the adoption of this motion.  
This is a position of the highest importance. 
The selection strikes me as an excellent one.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, are there any other senators who wish to speak?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Leave having been given to revert to Reports of Committees: 
Tuesday, December 8, 1998 
The Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has the honour to present its 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, we must follow some basic rules. 
We then proceed immediately to third reading where there is opportunity for debate. 
I do not know why we need to make an exception here. 
I cannot be persuaded that we should give leave on this matter.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Leave is not granted.  
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
Honourable senators, I move the adoption of the report.  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall the bill be read the third time?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Senator Kinsella correctly pointed to the novel aspects of this proceeding. 
Subsequently, I agreed to take the matter under advisement.  
Bill S-15 is not actually before the Senate for debate. 
Debate on the amendment of Senator Grafstein can now resume.  
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is it agreed that the report be discharged at this time?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, in the mode of withdrawal, I will not break the pattern. 
I thank Senator Grafstein for his courtesy.  
It has overwhelming support elsewhere. 
The traditional ceremony would remain.  
The United Kingdom is now moving to abolish heredity peers. 
In Canada we will be changing the oath of allegiance. 
I hope that what will be presented in February will meet with his approval.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted for Honourable Senator Lynch-Staunton to withdraw the bill?  
Motion agreed to and order withdrawn.  
It was a turning point. 
This Act was the product of the Laurendeau-Dunton commission. 
Three prime ministers invested particular effort in it:
The act of 1968-69 and that of 1988 complete the picture. 
I draw your attention to the equal status of the two official languages. 
Nevertheless, the two official languages enjoy equal status under the Constitution. 
Canada's political and legal framework is thus changed. 
The same cannot be said of the legislative authorities receiving delegated powers.  
Arrangements may have to be made that will make us incur additional expenditures.  
This will be money well spent. 
It is in keeping with the spirit of the Official Languages Act. 
A brief comment, in closing, on Part VII of the Official Languages Act. 
Section 41 reads as follows: 
We must take this a step further by actually promoting both official languages. 
On motion of Senator Corbin, debate adjourned.  
Hon. Erminie J. Cohen :
Unfortunately, their time was shortened to three minutes. 
I have the full presentation. 
I should like to read it into the record.  
NAPO has approximately 3,000 members - including 700 groups.  
With the repeal of CAP, these standards no longer exist. 
The changes to the Employment Insurance program have taken several forms. 
Regarding intolerance for the poor: 
The government of Canada has failed to act on this recommendation. 
It has become socially acceptable to openly abuse and malign poor people. 
And now for a few quick facts: 
The use of food banks doubled from 1989 to 1997. 
In March 1998, 162,496 people received food from food banks. 
By conservative measure, there are over 200,000 Canadians who are homeless.  
NAPO would suggest that the Committee propose the following changes to Canada.  
This concludes their presentation.  
To quote the New Brunswick Telegraph Journal : 
On motion of Senator DeWare, debate adjourned.  
( Honourable Senator Graham, P.C. ). 
Does no one on the government side have the courage to speak out? 
The minister [Axworthy] said he apologized for the poster campaign. 
August 11, 1997 - draft text for Letter from Lloyd Axworthy to his Indonesian counterpart: 
August 27, 1997 - notes of RCMP Superintendent Wayne May: 
Jean Carle does not want the demonstrators close at all!  
This also helps with the sight lines.  
On the same date: 
...address both the physical security and "proximity" concerns - 
His personal security is assured, and steps will be taken to preserve his comfort.  
October 3, 1997 - a letter from Jean Chretien to Suharto: 
The President therefore has decided to attend. 
Step one has been achieved. 
Peter Montague [Security Liaison to Indonesia]: 
Could we erect some sort of draping to cut off the view? 
Who is looking after that?  
November 20th - e-mail from Inspector Dingwall to Superintendent May: 
I assume that is the Prime Minister.  
- had planned to tour several sites and this may be affected...We 
On November 21 various RCMP notes reveal the following: 
Various "economies" are scheduled to tour the site in the next few days. 
The PM himself is scheduled to visit the site on the 21st. 
PM "wants the tenters out."  
PM says leave them until 6pm.  
PM wanted everyone removed.  
The University capitulates, and hands the site over to the Government. 
Six students are arrested on the 22nd and 23rd and charged with mischief. 
December 3, 1997 - a note to Superintendent Thompsett states the following: 
The writer then concludes: 
There is an odd contradiction here, would you not agree, honourable senators? 
"Snooping," the Prime Minister called it. 
They kept this up for days and days. 
"How dare you snoop on a private conversation?" 
Then what did they do? 
Now the Public Complaints Commission sits in limbo. 
All this suits the Prime Minister and the PMO very well.  
The following text is taken verbatim; these are the words of Dr. John Dixon: 
The APEC story runs, as the journalists say, on two very long legs. 
Dats some ting dat I put on my plate."  
Or maybe five or six question marks. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I am sorry, senator, but the 15-minute time period is up.  
I have only one more page to go, honourable senators.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I point this out not to depress, but to put us all on alert. 
So put these words on your fridge door now:
On motion of Senator Pepin, debate adjourned.  
Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
Commemoration of Fiftieth Anniversary-Inquiry-Debate Continued 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
I would also like to share some observations for your deliberation.  
The declaration further goes on to state: 
States are recognized as member states by joining the United Nations. 
I urge all honourable senators to read that report.  
The third example I wish to point out has been indicated by Senator Wilson. 
We must immediately stop allowing other countries to hide behind sovereignty. 
We must push the notion of the universality of these rights.  
On motion of Senator Roche, debate adjourned.  
Multilateral Agreement on Investment 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
This was an important observation.  
However, the MAI remains under negotiation. 
I would now move the adjournment of the debate in the name of Senator Eyton.  
On motion of Senator Kinsella, for Senator Eyton, debate adjourned.  
Results of First Hemp Crop-Inquiry 
Hon. Lorna Milne rose pursuant to notice of December 1, 1998: 
This year was certainly not without problems. 
Separate licences are required to purchase seed and to grow the crop. 
Several reported germination two days after planting. 
The real problems began when farmers started to harvest their crop. 
This year, 2,400 hectares were commercially planted in Canada. 
Manitoba was second with 606. 
By all accounts, the harvest went very well. 
In British Columbia, the number of growers was far less than predicted. 
In Alberta, Dr. Stanford Blade continued with his research plots. 
However, his crop progressed very well and was harvested on September 26. 
The growing was not the only success story this season. 
The processing sector is garnering attention from other countries. 
I want to warn Canadians that the Americans are coming. 
The Navaha of Arizona planted hemp two years ago.  
Hempline is selling vast fibre to American upholstery plants. 
This is an issue for industry as well as agriculture. 
Processors and farmers alike have made suggested changes in the application process. 
Canadian farmers are among the best in the world. 
They have proven this year that hemp is a viable crop in Canada. 
Whether or not it is an economically viable crop is still to be proven. 
It will depend on the increased efforts of the manufacturing and marketing sectors.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Election of Canada to United Nations Security Council 
Hon. Douglas Roche rose pursuant to notice of November 19, 1998: 
In doing so, I include the governments of Canada of the past 50 years. 
I do not bring a partisan position to this chamber. 
I sit in this chamber as an independent senator. 
I have worked with both major parties as they formed the Government of Canada.  
Therefore, I sincerely congratulate Bob Fowler.  
Honourable senators, now that we are on the Security Council, what will we do there? 
We must lower that number in the next century.  
They do not have the basic amenities of life. 
Can we not do better in next century?  
Can we not improve that situation in the next century?  
We are leaving behind a century in which human rights violations have been massive. 
Can we not do better in the next century?  
Honourable senators, we can and we must do better in the next century. 
Canada has a great responsibility and a very special role to play. 
However, we cannot live solely for ourselves in this country. 
We cannot do everything for everyone. That is certain. 
Nor should we try, and I do not suggest that. 
My message is short. 
With increasing frequency, these problems escalate into crisis and disaster. 
That list, honourable senators, can go on and on.  
The first is the development of international law. 
That opinion is being ignored by the major powers.  
We live at a time when democracy is spreading around the world. 
Of course it must be reformed and democratized.  
They did have one summit meeting. 
Let us have a better partnership as governments to advance that agenda.  
Military force is a last resort only, not a first resort. 
Finally, they talk about the reform of the UN and administrative reform. 
I am all for administrative reform. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, if no one moves the adjournment, I have no alternative.  
It is not my intention to speak at the present time, nor before the adjournment. 
Honourable senators, you will remember that I started this matter.  
On motion of Senator Graham, debate adjourned.  
Canada-Japan Inter-Parliamentary Group 
Hon. Dan Hays rose pursuant to notice of December 2, 1998: 
First of all, there are annual meetings that alternate between the two countries. 
The first annual visit occurred in 1995. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, there is agreement not to see the clock.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is it agreed that I not see the clock?  
I thank honourable senators.  
The Asia-Pacific Parliamentary Forum, now in its seventh year, is growing in importance. 
We are looking forward to participating in the seventh annual meeting in Lima. 
The theme of the conference was "The Sustainable Development of Tourism." 
Future participation should be considered worthwhile. 
I commend the report to honourable senators.  
I invite all honourable senators to participate in the work of the association.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Motion to Establish Standing Committee-Debate Adjourned 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk , pursuant to notice of December 3, 1998, moved: 
On motion of Senator Andreychuk, debate adjourned.  
Bill to Amend-Message from Commons 
Canada Customs and Revenue Agency Bill 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
The Senate adjourned until Wednesday, December 9, at 1:30 p.m.
