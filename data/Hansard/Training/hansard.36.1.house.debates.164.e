EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 164 
Wednesday, December 2, 1998 
The House met at 2 p.m. 
Members sang the national anthem] 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Stoney Creek, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
A combination like this is truly second to none.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
This year's topic was ``The famous Canadian I would like to meet''.  
INTERNATIONAL DAY FOR THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY 
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):
Great crops are usually good news for farmers, but not this year. 
I am confident we can respond to them quickly and adequately.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Even Scrooge would hang his head in shame.  
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia, Lib.):
Nationally, farm income is declining. 
I urge all members- 
The hon. member for Cambridge.  
WOMEN'S CRISIS SERVICES OF CAMBRIDGE 
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
I wish them continued success under the new name.  
THE SENATE OF CANADA 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Canadians deserve democratic representation in their government. 
The election of senators in Alberta is only the beginning.  
HOCKEY NIGHT IN OTTAWA 
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
Our veteran member from Nickel Belt was a shining, scintillating star for the winning team. 
The hon. member for Quebec.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
This is nothing for New Brunswickers. 
New Brunswickers know about Transport Canada's mismanagement of money. 
Atlantic Canadians will also see an increase in the price of goods.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
The reality is that one quarter of the federal buildings in Toronto belong to Quebeckers. 
Why would something that is good for Canadians be stupid for Quebeckers?  
The hon. member for Nunavut has the floor.  
HOCKEY NIGHT IN OTTAWA 
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
Defeat can be tough at times.  
Again we have proven that our Liberal team is hard to beat. 
Our players came together as a team of force. 
I have a message for the opposition. 
Everyone cannot be a winner. 
It is all about trying one's best. 
Unfortunately, the opposition's best could not topple our Liberal spirit.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
That is the only reason they won.  
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
This initiative will promote tourism, which is a major industry in our economy.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this Prime Minister owes millions of Canadian workers $290 each. 
This Prime Minister owes thousands of Canadian businesses $415 per employee. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
How independent are these commissions? 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am not blaming anybody. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I am very happy with his delivery.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Why is the minister being so stubborn? 
Why will he not lower it more?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That commission made a recommendation to the government which the government has accepted.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, in fact the government owes it, and it owes workers hundreds of dollars.  
Each business is paying hundreds of dollars more than it should per worker.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I think we should be very clear. 
The Reform Party talks about the working poor. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the answer is no.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
This is double talk.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I ask the hon. member to be patient. 
He will have his answer when we bring down the budget in February.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I could carry on but I do not have the time.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
There are 800,000 unemployed living without benefits. 
This year alone 37,000 more people have been forced to use food banks. 
What kind of balance lets our children go hungry?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Above all, we have established- 
The hon. member for Cumberland-Colchester.  
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
The auditor general came to some conclusions. 
We disagree that Transport Canada failed to provide accurate information. 
We get our information from the provinces. 
We work with the provinces. 
We do not parallel the provinces.  
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
It is the same thing we have been talking about for months and months.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
We have engineers and experts of the provinces- 
The hon. Minister of Transport.  
Hon. David M. Collenette:
We do not do that. 
His analysis is predicated on faulty assumptions.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Apparently he thinks that workers are not taxed heavily enough.  
He is a pathological tax hiker. 
He never met a tax hike he did not like. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
But that is not where the difference lies. 
It does not believe in sharing the risk. 
We beg to differ.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That is not where the difference lies. 
The difference lies in the forces of extremism. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the minister is seriously in need of taking Fair Taxation 101.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I believe we have achieved the desired balance.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, what a difference a day makes. 
Yesterday it was no to the social union; today it is a go.  
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. 
Canada has one of the best social unions in the world.  
Not only is the Government of Canada saying that. 
Canada was ranked fifth. 
That is not so bad.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
We would like to put the Prime Minister and his government to a test. 
Mr. Speaker, the member is not in the best situation to ask for clarification. 
The Tories were unable to say what they would do. 
Is that the new definition of the united right?  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Hon. Sheila Copps: -and allow a democratic vote. 
At least have the courage to respect a majority vote.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Their names appeared on the official list of delegates and lobbyists for Vancouver.  
The hon. member for Rimouski-Mitis has the floor.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
The hon. member for Selkirk-Interlake has the floor.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not believe that. 
It says a lot about- 
I do not want to hear from our ambassador down there. 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
I found his interest in agriculture to be very regressive.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
He was not on the committee.  
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Certainly we will do everything we can to co-operate with them.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Bass quietly goes his way and the other JTF2 accomplices are never charged. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
There were absolutely no deals, Mr. Speaker. 
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The hon. member for Winnipeg Centre.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
This reduction in premiums does nothing for unemployed Canadians.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
This party is asking us not to lower EI premiums. 
That is the NDP. 
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
However, this was not done.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
That should be satisfactory to the hon. member.  
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
All the parties to the agreement have complied. 
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
We have destroyed 11 million mines in stockpiles. 
The hon. member for Kelowna.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
The hon. member for Roberval.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
The only lobbying he has ever done was for Quebec City.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
We hope to announce some of those things in the very near future.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Is this the minister's idea of co-operative federalism? 
I do not think so. 
How many more premiers have not been consulted about this package?  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Those discussions will remain in cabinet until a decision has been made.  
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
It has now been nine years since the massacre at l'Ecole polytechnique.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, New Brunswickers will be paying thousands of dollars on toll fees. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
I have answered these questions in the House. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
The opposite is true. 
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
What does no kill mean to the minister? 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
I would ask the hon. minister to please withdraw his last statement.  
Mr. Speaker, a complex system was put in place last summer- 
I would ask the hon. minister to withdraw that statement.  
Certainly, Mr. Speaker, I will withdraw the reference. 
That will bring to a close our question period for today.  
COMMENTS DURING QUESTION PERIOD 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Today we heard the finance minister refer to the powers of extremism.  
Once again we have inflammatory words used on both sides. 
Do I have a definite cut-off point? 
BILL S-13-SPEAKER'S RULING 
Members will appreciate that this matter involves issues of a complex and technical nature. 
Consequently, a closer examination of the bill is required.  
If so, the charge would not be a tax.  
In the 21st edition, at page 731, May states: 
This would enhance the market for blank audio tapes. 
The text then goes on to read in subsection (2) of the same clause 3: 
Young people would constitute the future growth potential for the industry's market. 
Why is legislation like this required?  
I thank hon. members for their attention.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
This measure is not a levy. 
It will make room for aboriginal governments to levy their own income taxes. 
I ask that an order of the day be designated for consideration of this motion.  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS

Question No. 158- Mr. Jason Kenney: 
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
I therefore ask the hon. member to withdraw his motion.  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I propose that Motion No. P-45 be transferred for debate.  
CANADA CUSTOMS AND REVENUE AGENCY ACT 
Motions No. 28, 29, 32 and 33 will be grouped for debate.  
Motions Nos. 64, 65, 106 and 107 will be grouped for debate.  
Motions Nos. 100 to 103 will be grouped for debate.  
The Chair will remind the House of each pattern at the time of voting.  
If hon. members wish to hear them all, of course, I could do so. 
I would appeal to all of my colleagues to consider that.

It ought not to exist.  
Judging by a number of past experiences, these agencies have not been a great success.  
Here are a few examples. 
Let us take another example of a government-created agency, Aeroports de Montreal. 
As things now stand, the minister is all alone.  
The minister dares to say that the government has created a new tax collection vehicle. 
This shortage of professionals cost between $500 million and $1 billion annually. 
This is not acceptable.  
Creating a customs and revenue agency is totally unacceptable. 
Can we imagine this agency collecting municipal and school taxes? 
It is simply ridiculous. 
But it is empowered to do so. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
We do not oppose large sections of the bill dealing with that issue. 
It is an enormous power. 
That is not the kind of culture we want to see.  
We do not think thee are constructive amendments. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Many members in the House have independent spirits. 
It is a very important issue. 
What is being established here is a brand new taxation agency. 
In other words it was to be a super agency.  
My party and I are concerned about that for a number of reasons. 
It is supposed to collect federal, provincial and municipal taxes. 
It is because Mike Harris is against the agency as is the Government of Ontario.  
You don't buy a car before you see it.  
I have been around here a long time. 
I heard the member across the way. 
The Canada Health Act is a very good example. 
However, the government is putting the cart before the horse in this regard. 
That seems to be fair. 
There are all kinds of other concerns. 
The Reform and Conservative Parties want to form a very conservative alternative. 
We have a very conservative government across the way. 
The bill will once again shrink the size of the federal government. 
The other thing is the question of accountability. 
I worry about the whole question of accountability. 
His brothers and sisters in PSAC are saying ``Don't go ahead with this bill. 
It is a bad bill for workers. 
He is afraid to get up and speak his mind. 
That is very strange for a former national union leader.  
We should be listening to the workers. 
It did not travel to those communities.  
It met a few of them. 
It had a few hours of hearings, but very few.  
The government is afraid of what it would hear.  
The auditor general released his most report the other day. 
In this very voluminous report there is a section that deals with Revenue Canada. 
It makes a comment about the agency. 
It goes on and on. 
Yet the government wants to proceed.  
That is the kind of change we need in this country.  
That is why we need parliamentary reform.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
The issues are quite complex. 
That is assuming that all provinces opt in. 
That is a very big assumption. 
Instead the government is focusing on the logistics of the administrative aspects of tax enforcement. 
I believe that this is a misdirected effort at this time.  
Provinces want greater autonomy. 
It cannot simply be said that the provinces are going to sign onto this. 
There has not been dramatic indication from the provinces. 
I am very skeptical, as are members of my party, that that will occur. 
The fact is that the process is tainted. 
Members opposite will say there is no patronage. 
It was mentioned earlier that it is the largest government department. 
The public service has unprecedented low levels of morale. 
However, union issues are dealt with in the private sector. 
Ultimately, that would be far less effective and unwieldy.  
They have a public ethic. 
They want to work for the betterment of society and for the people. 
Keep in mind 25% of the public service is in this. 
These are significant issues. 
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
The business community was supposed to be the main beneficiary. 
However, reaction to the agency's announcement was restrained and ambivalent, to say the least. 
Trudeau saw such an act as illegal, even. 
For that, however, we should not really count on our colleagues opposite. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, at the outset we oppose Bill C-43. 
There are good things in the bill. 
In my province of British Columbia we have a mess.  
We support those elements in Bill C-43 that will streamline the system. 
It is an assurance to Canadians that they will be protected from an agency. 
They should be informed of overpayment in a timely fashion.  
Penalties ought to be applied fairly to all individuals. 
Most Canadians do their best to pay. 
Sometimes they run afoul of the payment schedule. 
They want a fair tax system. 
The other thing we want is an office for taxpayer protection. 
This would be a very constructive role by the government. 
We hope the government listens.  
Let us talk on the larger issue of tax cuts. 
We have been accused of somehow favouring the rich. 
We have been accused of instituting a plan that will destroy social programs.  
If that were the case we would not support tax cuts. 
That is one of the reasons the Reform Party came here. 
We saw the degradation of our social programs. 
Let us look at the facts. 
What do taxes do? 
Let us look at the tax burden briefly for a second. 
As a result, its economy is booming.  
Lessons can be learned. 
Let us take a look at the tax increases by the government. 
The government likes to say it has decreased taxes. 
I challenge any member from across the way to refute that argument.  
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the New Democratic Party opposes this new tax agency. 
We oppose it because it is not needed. 
The auditor general says we do not need it. 
It is not wanted. 
Businesses do not want it. 
The provinces do not want it and territories do not want it. 
I can give some examples. 
We want a responsive minister when it comes to taxation.  
It would continue to put intense focus on poor people.  
As MPs we are able to help in situations like that.  
If this tax agency comes into effect it will remove that kind of accountability. 
An agency should not be open to making a profit.  
Any new agency should be closely monitored, especially in its set-up. 
The union does not support that kind of transfer of authority. 
First nations people will now be paying taxes. 
They have been very proactive. 
This kind of bill is abdicating political responsibility. 
Canada does not fit that description. 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
All parties have been consulted. 
CANADA CUSTOMS AND REVENUE AGENCY ACT 
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
It is once again about to abdicate its responsibilities.  
Let us now have a look at what lies behind Bill C-43.  
Quebec is opposed to the creation of this agency. 
Where does his support for this bill come from?  
Who is this agency accountable to? 
This new bill is doomed to failure. 
Who will foot the bill for this agency? 
And where do the surpluses go? 
Into the Minister of Finance's pocket. 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
The appointment is at pleasure. 
It seems to me that would be much more important. 
Turning to clause 38, it reads: 
I draw members' attention to ``affect public finances''. 
It was the best Christmas present he ever had.  
Political shenanigans are starting to go on in this bill.  
A board of 15 people is being created. 
The only thing they have to do is run the agency. 
We see in clause 38 that the government wants to keep that to itself. 
That is why I have a problem with the bill.  
Granting severance pay would amount to several hundred million dollars. 
He answered that that was the agreement. 
The agency is smoke and mirrors. 
The government has to be responsible to the taxpayers. 
The people on reserves are untaxed. 
BILL C-43-NOTICE OF TIME ALLOCATION 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
Clearly, this is further proof of the Prime Minister's insatiable desire to centralize everything.  
In short, very little will change. 
So why create this agency? 
According to the President of the Treasury Board, and I quote: 
I do not get it. 
Modernize by doing nothing. 
Great jobs, these, for the party's political buddies.  
With this government, a person never knows what low blow can suddenly be delivered. 
I could go on and on about this.  
This is a classic example of bureaucratic empire-building.  
This is inconceivable and unacceptable. 
Clauses 47 to 49 are explicit about the agency's lack of accountability. 
Where is the transparency in this process?  
Quebec will not give in to this centralizing government. 
The Bloc Quebecois and its members are reasonable and responsible. 
They will certainly not vote in favour of this bill.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
CANADA-UNITED STATES DAYS OF PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP 
Mr. John Maloney (Erie-Lincoln, Lib.) moved: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent for the member to move the amendment?  
The relationship is thriving because it is carefully nurtured. 
A further step in this nurturing is the motion we are speaking to this evening.  
The 1987 motion was also seconded by the current member from Qu'Appelle. 
At the plenary all issues were reviewed by all delegates. 
We share a common history and a common culture. 
While we have many similarities, we are different. 
We disagree on the issue of culture. 
Our economy is another area. 
The value of this trade to both countries is enormous. 
Exports to the United States account for one-fourth of our gross domestic product.  
Much of this trade is in the auto sector. 
The future is even brighter. 
I will conclude on friendship engagement. 
Canada and the United States are more than neighbours. 
Our relationship is a model for the world.  
Today more than ever, let us reaffirm and renew our great tradition. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
From time to time we obviously have many trade irritants, differences and disputes. 
I need not go on any longer than that. 
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
I have lived beside the American people for 35 years. 
We had a curling rink with Americans. 
The Americans provided us with a little grocery store and a little bar. 
If we got too unhappy we could share facilities. 
It was quite an interesting experience.  
It is a service that really binds the two nations. 
It operated very well. 
As human beings we all have more or less similar needs. 
We want to do what is best for our families.  
The intermarriage between Canadians and Americans was unreal during the early part of the century. 
Their girls seemed to be just a little prettier than ours and vice versa. 
There was always that type of rivalry building.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:
Well, I am part American too. 
We do not get too much of a tan in this House. 
It got there and was used to make bread.  
I commend the member for bringing this motion forward again. 
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:
That is for history to debate.  
I encourage Reform members to support this motion. 
It is a motion that will benefit either side of the border.  
We can work to the benefit of all. 
We have to go in one direction.  
We have a lot more strength. 
We have a lot more to gain than we will lose.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
We hear too often of cases where Canadians try to bad mouth our American neighbours. 
Cross-border relations between the two countries have improved significantly in recent years. 
I am not surprised by the about-face the government has taken. 
Let us pray this trend does not continue throughout the fishing season.  
However, I would prefer we do something in conjunction with our American neighbours.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
President Kennedy's words ring as true today as they did many years ago. 
We co-operate in NORAD to share the burden of the defence of North America. 
The ties that bind us are strong and run deep. 
These are just a few indications of the uniqueness of our close bilateral ties. 
Do these need a formal declaration to bring them to the attention of our citizens?  
These are just some of the questions that merit additional consideration.  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
This country has been very good to me. 
We take great pride in having the longest undefended border in the world.  
We have tourism that draws heavily from the United States. 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to say a few words on this motion.  
I am reminded of the work that the member for Erie-Lincoln does. 
His riding holds the biggest border crossing of all the Niagara area crossings.  
That is the way we have been able to work for many years. 
It is very much appreciated.  
Accordingly, I would request unanimous consent to delete the year 1998. 
Over 50 years ago a U.S. president stated: 
What was true then is true today.  
However, he went on to say the following: 
Those whom nature hath so joined together, let no man put asunder.  
He then went on to say: 
This is a partnership, not an empire. 
But our alliance is born not of fear but of hope. 
Canadian apples and American apples make for a very great dessert. 
It is non-partisan. 
We must take the leadership on this. 
It is the right thing to do.  
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
One major source of mercury is from the burning of coal for power generation. 
By burning more coal, more mercury is released in the air.  
Up to 2.5 tonnes are released into the Great Lakes waters annually.  
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Canada will not rest there. 
I am sorry, the hon. member's time has expired.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, are the Sea King and Labrador helicopters safe? 
Was the tragic crash on October 2 avoidable? 
Apparently this helicopter burst into flames and broke into three pieces.  
Former Labrador pilot Lieutenant Colonel Dennis Hopping stated: 
What a terrible position to put a professional pilot in.  
Major Marvin Haagsma, retired, stated: 
I would like to finish with two final questions for the government to answer. 
What other options have been pursued such as short term leases?  
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
They are merely showing a great deal of caution.  
The first of them will be in service by 2001.  
The supply strategy for replacing the old Sea Kings is under study. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
The government needs to look at this issue and make changes to rectify the situation.  
It seems that the wealthy are getting wealthier and the poor are getting poorer. 
The gap was already present but to a smaller extent. 
These figures are self-explanatory. 
The gap has widened.  
In a country like Canada poverty is simply unacceptable. 
Canada is a rich country both in natural and human resources. 
Something needs to be done. 
It is important that as parliamentarians we try to rectify the problem.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Our youth employment strategy is there to help young people. 
The employment insurance system is a vital part of our safety net. 
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.42 p.m.)
