GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Vaughan-King-Aurora, Lib.):
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I ask for your patience this morning. 
I have a large number of petitions to present.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
These year I have introduced 139 pages with 3,409 signatures.

MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have the honour to present three petitions today.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
It is co-ordinated by the Animal Defence League.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I got a little carried away.  
Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay-Okanagan, Ref.):
LABELLING OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions today. 
The first has to do with the subject matter of misuse of alcohol.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the second petition has to do with the family.  
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
Question No. 21 has been absolutely languishing now for eight months. 
I have raised this countless times. 
Mr. Speaker, the member is correct. 
He has repeatedly sought an answer to this question. 
I can assure him that it will answered.  
I can only remind the House that patience is a virtue.  
Shall the questions stand?  
ALLOTTED DAY-CANADIAN ARMED FORCES 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC) moved: 
The truth can no longer be hidden. 
All these things have resulted in deplorable morale in the Canadian forces. 
That is not leadership. 
For these reasons this House must condemn the government for failing to provide strong leadership.  
Our forces have been criticized a lot over the last few years. 
He disbanded the airborne regiment and the problems grew. 
That is not leadership. 
The problems continue to grow.  
The 1994 defence white paper committed to combat capable forces. 
We covered a lot of bases.  
I first want to talk about equipping our forces. 
I am talking about uniforms and boots.  
When we talk about equipment we have to consider major purchases as well.  
No one should think that the government paid only $500 million. 
This government is still paying and paying dearly.  
That does not sound very efficient to me. 
Even that would seem high.  
Not only that, the pilots are afraid to fly them. 
If one motor fails, it is a chance whether or not they get back. 
Why are new helicopters not being ordered? 
He does not give them any leadership.  
That is not all I want to talk about this morning. 
This creates problems that are simply not necessary. 
My name is Michael Robert Innes. 
I receive 25% of this decision currently.  
God bless washing dishes. 
These are things I used to take for granted. 
Showering, getting dressed is difficult for me. 
The government closes its eyes. 
It provides no leadership.  
It gets rid of these soldiers because they are past their prime. 
He has no idea how they operate, so he is out.  
Has the government proposed anything like that? 
Because it never shows any leadership.  
They speak far more eloquently on how the government failed than I ever could. 
We have to chip the ice off the inside of all our windows. 
Our furnaces run steady just to keep the house liveable. 
Actually, it is not liveable.  
We have a river that runs through our basement every spring. 
When we showed up in Halifax, the whole thing had changed a bit. 
Maybe they consider they have indoor swimming pools. 
Our washers and driers are down there. 
A couple of years go by and they are still coming. 
I do not think any other landlord would get away with this.  
Is this acceptable to the House? 
I do not think so. 
Our soldiers and their families are living in terrible conditions.  
They will sell space, just like a hockey rink. 
Everybody will have a chance. 
She is somebody with a long experience. 
Let me tell you, I'm not too impressed with the whole system. 
You do your best and you get screwed. 
That's the way it is these days in the Canadian forces.  
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
I noticed pretty much the same things he did. 
Our military feel they are underpaid, and I agree. 
These three budgetary items must, unfortunately, be kept under tight control at this time.  
Does he have any idea how these funds should be apportioned?  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
I did not talk about salaries, which is also another problem. 
It was one of the main issues raised during our tour across the country. 
I am convinced that we will hear more about it.  
People join the army and most of them stay for 20 years. 
Then they leave without a profession to fall back on.  
Let me give you a specific example. 
Let us assume that a person is a licensed electrician in the armed forces. 
I could also talk about mechanics, whose situation is exactly the same.  
They have that opportunity.  
General Baril said there would be no trade-off. 
It is not possible to achieve both, but we have no choice. 
There is clearly a shortage of personnel.  
I hope this answers the hon. member's question.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
These fine men and women go away and serve our country. 
They are separated from their families for a very long time. 
What does my hon. colleague see as a solution? 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for the question. 
Unfortunately at this point I have to get ahead of the minister. 
A lot of that problem has been solved. 
There have been some good moves made toward that. 
That is only one point. 
Look at all the points we could have gained. 
There are still some problems to be looked. 
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
There is not enough time between deployments. 
But the major problem in all of this is always money. 
They do not have enough equipment either. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
And that is exactly what they are doing. 
Because of the big deficit we inherited from Brian Mulroney and the Conservative government. 
They virtually put the economy and the fiscal condition of this country into ruin. 
We have a balanced budget. 
The hon. member talked about helicopters. 
They botched that arrangement as well. 
How are they coping? 
Are they having difficulties in terms of pay levels or housing? 
All of these things are important to this government. 
It is important that we address them.  
What suggestions do those members have? 
They ridicule every other idea. 
They got it all wrong in the course of doing it. 
They know that is the case.  
It will not be done with the kind of advertising logos they are talking about.  
This has been going on for several years. 
He got that all wrong. 
The other thing he was wrong about was our allies. 
They all do it. 
We are bringing about institutional changes. 
They did not bring any amendments to the defence act. 
In many cases we are not even waiting for the reports. 
We are taking action now. 
The retirement allowance for the reserve forces is also something we are doing now. 
This government is showing solid leadership.  
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
There are some things that need to be remembered, if one wants to be objective. 
For instance, the matter of the debt, which will take but a few seconds. 
Let us talk about the period from 1970 to 1984. 
Instead of multiplying it by 11, we doubled it. 
That is a considerable slowdown.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:
They equally have a very difficult time coming to grips with the helicopter purchase. 
The taxpayers could not afford that.  
This helicopter will meet our requirements, which was the most important aspect of this purchase. 
We got rid of that big deficit which we inherited from the Conservative government. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
After all there is a $600 billion debt. 
The Conservatives added $250 billion. 
Nobody can claim the high ground.  
It became evident on how undemocratic our process really is. 
This bill is coming from the top down. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:
We are certainly happy to see him discuss the matter at committee.  
They have come through as a result of two things. 
A lot of the recommendations in there should not be new to the hon. member. 
We are updating and streamlining the operations. 
I look forward to the committee reporting back to this House.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am afraid that there is not unanimous consent.  
The time for questions and comments has now expired.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
There are no Conservatives in Alberta. 
I obviously appreciate the opportunity to speak to this issue.  
I certainly agree with them on that issue.  
I find that rather unsettling. 
And when it does so, it is superficial to say the least.  
Touching briefly on those points, first is decreased funding. 
The inefficiencies of the operation continued behind the scenes. 
There are no advocates for the military on that side of the House. 
In other words cuts should come from somewhere else.  
Now even the auditor general is warning that equipment is getting dangerously outdated.  
Let us talk about bureaucracy. 
Bureaucracy is a term that the Liberal side of the House understands to perfection. 
This had a number of disastrous effects.  
First of all it fostered a sense of careerism which had not previously existed. 
It refused to listen. 
The military is not and should never be just another government department. 
Why don't you talk about what the men and women say?  
It is control that this government really would like to maintain.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would like to listen to the debate that is happening here today. 
If the hon. member cannot hear, then he has a valid point. 
I know it is important that all members be able to hear the debate. 
The hon. member for Calgary Northeast has the floor. 
Mr. Speaker, thank you so much. 
That would help a lot.  
What do they really know? 
I have to say that the Liberals have only contributed to the problem.  
I would like to talk a little bit about the Somalia inquiry. 
It was in many significant ways an extremely important process. 
I certainly commend the member of the Conservative Party for bringing forth this motion. 
The debate is worthy and necessary. 
I commend the member on the motion he has presented to the House.  
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
Maybe they should get their stories straight.  
I have a question for the hon. member. 
As I look across the floor I see a wolf in sheep's clothing. 
Members opposite are riding on the backs of men and women in the military. 
With regard to money, I have a question for the hon. member. 
Referring to democratic procedures, they are sadly amiss over on that side.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
To suggest that somebody in the House has diarrhoea is absolutely outlandish. 
Enough of the rhetoric- 
Mr. Speaker, that was a very appropriate ruling. 
It is a top down process. 
That is the committee and that is the committee process that has to change.  
That will take care of the procurement problems and the rusting out equipment. 
That will take care of some of the social problems and complaints.  
The government has had five years to correct the problems. 
For five years it let the military suffer. 
The time for questions and comments has now expired. 
I know hon. members are disappointed.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
The motion reads as follows: 
I think we could simply call them the ``Canadian forces''.  
Having said that, let us get to the matter at hand. 
It is an incredible amount of money. 
In fact, it would eliminate the deficit in the province of Quebec. 
Let me give you some examples.  
The government bought a helicopter that was quite simply not up to the job.  
Another example is the Leopard thermal weapon sight. 
According to the study, that was the minimum that would have been acceptable. 
More money badly spent.  
Then there was the Lynx replacement project, project Coyote. 
What does this mean. 
More money badly spent.  
But enough about money. 
Money is important, but it is not everything. 
Justice Letourneau had a mandate. 
To properly complete his job, he would have needed a little more time. 
This caused a scandal, of course. 
The list goes on. 
I can remember part of what was said. 
First of all, the lower ranks are underpaid. 
They cannot provide their families with a decent living on their pay. 
This is not inconsequential.  
Is that political leadership? 
The government goofed a long time ago. 
Military personnel gets transferred from one base to another. 
But the reverse is also true. 
All this causes serious disruption to family life.  
But there is worse. 
What school is that young francophone going to attend? 
How is he or she going to get an education in French? 
Some situations are truly deplorable.  
Something must be done about this.  
There is also the issue of building maintenance. 
I can guarantee you that things would be different in a sovereign Quebec. 
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
There was no deficit in Canada before 1973. 
I do not think it does us great credit.  
Anyway, it is easy to always blame others. 
I have noticed several things. 
Let us use the example of our armed forces. 
Some people have too many hats, others have to do without boots. 
There is currently a lack of warm equipment for those who are posted to Alert. 
What is the problem? 
We are almost there. 
Eight months for a pair of boots, does that make any sense?  
The committee visited military housing. 
I do not know whether he would want to let anything live there. 
Morale has bottomed out. 
The military are exhausted. 
The armed forces are demoralized. 
Something has to be done to raise their self-esteem.  
This is the way our soldiers are being treated.  
When will all this come to a stop?  
Millions of dollars have been wasted. 
I remember the cancellation of the privatization of Pearson airport. 
At some point, there is a need for consistency, for logic.  
Perhaps he would give us some details.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye:
I would not even have given a dog a bath in that water. 
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
That sector is substantial. 
I went to a church that has now become my church. 
It is an anti-war song.  
There were many military families in that church that day. 
I think I really changed my mind that day. 
I began to understand some new things about what commitment meant.  
I am now the MP there. 
They are asking for assistance intervention with DND, with DVA. 
They are still fighting for recognition of his illness. 
Mrs. Rierdon had a question for the committee: 
It's not new to me. 
I do not blame them for their feelings of anger and betrayal. 
That ideal involved the concepts of justice, fairness, equality and protection of the weak.  
We hear the horror stories I have just put forward.  
This has to go further than that. 
In the fall there will be probably a very large report released by the committee. 
There will be lots of trees cut down in the interests of this weighty document. 
All we will have is generals who will be by themselves rattling their sabres. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
The white paper has been turned into a word of fiction. 
He certainly has not implemented the white paper.  
In fact we have been embarrassed. 
That is what we are to do. 
That is the way we are to raise money. 
I have never seen this done in Canada. 
It is an embarrassment around the world.  
That has affected equipment and training. 
It is a disgrace.  
A sailor aboard the HMCS Calgary canvasses for the United Way. 
His wife was there during that operation. 
I cannot believe this is happening.  
We will have decline for the next 15 years. 
We just will not have a Department of National Defence.  
Our minister of defence is saying that he will listen to the auditor general. 
What do they get in return? 
The government has made deep cuts to veterans programs. 
It has slashed veterans affairs operating budget over a three year period by $182 million.  
I cannot believe it. 
In particular, they were offered very limited career training opportunities.  
Why have we not compensated them adequately? 
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
I have two questions for the hon. member. 
One of them relates to the whole issue of the white paper. 
We talked to quite a number of people. 
Rear Admiral Miller was very clear in terms of his comments. 
The other issue she raised was on the personnel support programs. 
I spoke to one service person who showed me a card produced by maritime- 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We are on questions and comments. 
The hon. member has been giving a speech. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
It does not leave a lot of time for me.  
I have the answer if I have the time to answer.  
Madam Speaker, the other question I have is in connection with personnel support programs. 
It relates to some innovative thinking that is occurring within the Canadian forces right now. 
What is wrong with that? 
What difficulty does the hon. member have with that? 
It shows some real leadership and innovation.  
He has stated this is not good. 
It is an absolute disgrace. 
Ask around the world. 
It is embarrassing when we reach rock bottom like that. 
For our defence people that is embarrassing.  
So I say to him work to put back the respect that should be there. 
He wants me to be proud of that. 
No, I will fight tooth and nail to give them their respect.  
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
They are close to not being operational. 
Members of our armed forces have been and continue to be our national heroes. 
The government in power is waiting on the recommendations in committee reports. 
The supply department itself is extremely inadequate. 
These are things that could be done very quickly. 
But instead the government is waiting on the standing committee's report.  
And who is Canadian soldiers' worst enemy? 
It is the budget slashing Liberal government. 
They are the laughing-stock of other countries. 
With completely obsolete equipment, they are the best soldiers in the world. 
That is what the government should do something about and pronto.  
And it goes on. 
I prefer not to speak about R&D. 
What it did scrap, however, was the helicopter contract. 
We are not talking about 1939, before the second world war, but about 1996.  
The auditor general said that even machine-gun bullets could go through them. 
There are plenty of reports available. 
That much the government can do, and it should do it quickly.  
This is not Russia, or the former Soviet Union. 
This is not right. 
I hope the government will take into account the recommendations made by both the auditor- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member's time has unfortunately expired.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, the hon. member for Chicoutimi. 
The problem is that proper training is not provided. 
Individuals who leave the armed forces after a 20 year military career have no training. 
There should be an education system. 
This way the costs would be shared.  
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his comment.  
I want to go back to this. 
We need an ombudsman in the Canadian Armed Forces. 
It would allow us to improve military operations on a day to day basis.  
This is precisely what the auditor general asked of this government. 
But the government must act immediately, because our military are leaving the forces. 
I see it in my region, on the base in Bagotville. 
This is why we want to take action. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Madam Speaker, my hon. friend from Chicoutimi spoke very eloquently. 
He mentioned the helicopters. 
We heard from the minister of defence this morning. 
I wonder if my friend might respond to that.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member for Chicoutimi has 15 seconds to answer the question.  
The matter of the helicopters is another scandal of the present government. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I apologize to the hon. member, but his time is up.  
Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
As we all know, the world is in the midst of incredibly dramatic changes. 
One example is that NATO will expand to include former members of the Warsaw Pact. 
Peacekeeping also requires patience and discipline, as well as innovation and courage. 
In the government's view the choice is clear. 
We have an obligation to spend the taxpayers' money wisely. 
Numerous initiatives are under way and we are seeing excellent progress. 
Today the number has been reduced by more than half to 24.  
The Canadian forces need our support and they need our understanding. 
They must be given missions that are clear, realistic and achievable. 
They deserve our respect and our gratitude. 
That was a very proud and memorable moment.  
I know that these leaders are willing to accept their mantle of leadership. 
They understand that service is before self.  
We will be proud of them.  
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
Unfortunately, I have not reviewed the guard of honor. 
I guess he was accompanying the Prime Minister or some minister. 
I listened to these people. 
Earlier, I mentioned a francophone in Trenton who has a young quadriplegic child. 
The name of the person is Denis Paquette. 
He is at the Trenton base. 
This is all the child will be able to do.  
That is the member's wonderful Canadian armed forces.  
Our soldiers are poorly paid and poorly outfitted. 
We spent three weeks on the ground. 
He had no boots. 
How are we going to send them over? 
Wearing loincloths, like the Indian tribes of old?  
Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to stand here and correct the hon. member. 
I was doing the work as an everyday member of parliament in my riding. 
It is the men and women. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member, but her time has expired.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Pride in the Canadian military has very deep roots. 
The government has taken action. 
This is what leadership is all about.  
They were simply too expensive for what was needed. 
That is important to note.  
The process of reform is ongoing. 
Resources are focused on maintaining the core capabilities of the Canadian forces.  
This is a priority, and rightfully so. 
The government looks forward to its report and recommendations. 
We will certainly await that report and the importance it will carry.  
The government has provided the necessary leadership. 
It has made the right decisions and followed through on its commitments.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate my colleague from the Conservative Party for putting forth this motion. 
It is very deserving at this time. 
It has chosen to run the military with the same secrecy. 
But the government has not done that.  
The theme of the conference was efficiency and accountability. 
It was attended by Canada's top military officers and their guests. 
That is exactly what it is.  
Furthermore, this conference included $8,000 in tips to the staff. 
It sounds like a department to me. 
I have talked to some of these people in the military. 
That is what has been wrong with our military. 
It is like VIA Rail, it cannot replenish its stock. 
Only recently have the Liberals moved to do something about that.  
I hope they saw the squalor of some of the houses. 
It sounds like a department to me. 
It does not sound like the military.  
We still do not have the maritime ship borne helicopters. 
We are told we are going to buy them. 
I just spoke the truth. 
I realize members opposite do not like that.  
That would tell us what is thought of politics and government. 
This is a program we should give serious attention to.  
You just cannot cover it up. 
You cannot cover up the Somalia inquiry.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
I could not believe I was actually hearing what he was saying. 
It is incredible to think he would make that kind of statement.  
My question is really simple. 
Why would he downplay that? 
I think that is really appalling.  
Mr. Speaker, it is obvious that the hon. member was not listening. 
I was not condemning the present fact finding tour.  
You got it wrong. 
I did not say that and you know I did not say it.  
I know the hon. member means to address the Chair.  
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
I would like to hear my colleague on this.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the question.  
The member is right and it is a good question. 
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
Nobody is asking the government to provide leadership in the field. 
They fought with self sacrifice. 
They were completely selfless. 
They fought in trenches. 
They had a fledgling air force. 
They fought at Vimy Ridge. 
They fought at Maple Copse, the Battle of the Somme. 
We had the Korean war. 
They suffered not without meaning. 
They should not be left lying on the sidelines somewhere. 
They have trouble getting pensions and any number of things.  
It is not only in declared wars that our people have fought. 
They have served in temperature extremes. 
They have practised in the Arctic and have served in the deserts. 
One would think with all of that it would be enough suffering. 
I know a man in the navy who served on a wooden ship. 
It is almost the year 2000. 
What kind of things are we handing these guys to defend our country?  
These people are responsible for our national defence. 
The way they have been treated is unacceptable.  
In 1992 what did they find? 
There was no comprehensive training policy based on changing requirements. 
That would increase the morale of our people. 
What do we have? 
What have we got now? 
Does that make sense? 
What are they spending nowadays? 
It is $9 billion. 
What was it in 1993 when the Liberals took over? 
Our military has not been looked after. 
It just is not right.  
We do not think that is what the government should be about. 
It needs to have a purpose. 
We need to decide what it is to do. 
We expect the armed forces to support our political, economic and environmental sovereignty. 
We think that should be happening over Canada's territory.  
We need fast response. 
We need to provide these things now. 
We definitely need to have our military prepared for any event. 
We need them to be prepared on a variety of facets.  
Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
We had inspection of our cadet corps of young people. 
It was lovely to watch. 
I found it pretty amazing.  
Our military people are there when they are asked to be.  
We can talk about the recent fire in Alberta. 
We need to thank the military for everything it is offering our communities.  
I do not remember them dealing with the problems in the military. 
This military ethos is based on strong, principled and effective leadership. 
Discipline is the lifeblood of any military organization. 
It promotes effective and efficient qualities. 
The government looked closely at these events and acted decisively. 
The government has taken leadership. 
We are implementing about 83% of the recommendations in the commission's report.  
It reported on time and under budget. 
Chief Justice Dickson's recommendations are now being implemented.  
It will modernize the provisions with respect to the board of inquiry. 
They will enhance transparency and accountability. 
The Canadian forces will benefit from the movements with which we are going forward.  
At the same time I have heard some different viewpoints from the Reform Party. 
The Reform Party claims to strongly support a well equipped Canadian force. 
That is what I heard from the Reform Party during the election. 
That is what I have heard from the leader of the Reform Party. 
That is what most Canadians have heard from the Reform Party day after day.  
Yet today it comes in here and suggests that it is supportive of military actions.  
It is always more money here, more money there. 
It has totally turned its whole position around. 
To me it is very ludicrous.  
We need to put in place decisive measures. 
We need to move the agenda forward. 
We certainly need to show the respect that the Canadian military has and should have. 
We have to look at the experts and suggestions that are coming forward. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I will touch on one point that the hon. member mentioned. 
He started off by speaking about cadets. 
I will speak about air cadets in my riding.  
I was a member of the air cadets several years back. 
In the last two years they have had to close down. 
They have cut the hours out of the reserve. 
They only have 32 days a year to train.  
It is taking equipment away from them. 
It is cutting their hours.  
How can they possibly work with 32 days a year? 
Besides that, now they say no more summer exercises. 
This is where we get our young people involved. 
Maybe the member could comment on that.  
As a matter of fact, they were among the leading drill teams across Ontario.  
There is no question that the reserves are working in my area. 
They are doing the job with young people that really needs to be done.  
The army cadets are in a very well structured program.  
However, it is not the same scenario across Canada. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
It is making certain we have good directions. 
Would we have been able to react to the ice storm? 
To me the Reform Party has very little to give positive direction. 
It has been totally critical all the way. 
That is not good.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
The hon. member refers to pride, talent and excellence. 
At least I believe that is what the hon. member said.  
He spoke about the flood in Manitoba and he spoke about the ice storm. 
During the ice storm I saw the military. 
Believe me, I thank them. 
What the hon. member is doing is certainly not thanking them. 
He is embarrassing them.  
The member keeps saying ``The Tories were there before''. 
This is playing politics with the issue. 
The problems are here today. 
We could say that Trudeau was there before us. 
But what is that going to do to rectify the problems of today?  
Or are there Canadian standards? 
We should have an education system in place to protect these people. 
I would like the hon. member to comment on that.  
Mr. Speaker, I think there is a short memory here. 
I cannot equate the two. 
I do not believe Canadians can look at that and say they are consistent.  
I question how they can come back today and give that same type of sermon. 
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
We saw their actions. 
After less than two years they shut it down. 
We will never know the full truth. 
We can only speculate at the truth. 
Justice was never done.  
In order for justice to occur we must have the truth. 
What do we see is happening? 
So what do we say about the military? 
What is our vision for the military?  
The role of our military should be clearly defined. 
What should the role of the military be? 
That is our vision.  
They do not have anything to share. 
Why would they not take that opportunity? 
It is there for us all to express what we believe should be done.  
Does that not make common sense? 
It is that simple.  
What is the purpose of that? 
Or if we want to increase it, why? 
What is the role we want our military to play? 
It certainly does not inform them.  
You have to go to the government. 
We need a military. 
The military should be trained. 
Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
The Reform Party has consistently called for major cuts to defence spending. 
The Reform Party claims that it wants this.  
Reform cannot have it both ways. 
It talks only cuts and it does not talk about what it would do. 
What did she do with that opportunity? 
Let us hear what her plans are. 
She has not told us what her plans are. 
Why can we not hear what her plans are?  
How is she going to do it?  
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
In fact, what he is calling for is what all Canadians are waiting for. 
The parliamentary secretary has referred to rationalization. 
I would like to know whether this is what my hon. colleague was referring to.  
How do we decide that? 
There is an enormous difference. 
Is that what we want?  
That is what this government so far has been offering. 
Where is the vision? 
Where is the strategy? 
Where is the plan that the auditor general called for? 
The auditor general is crying out for it. 
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Of these 61,000 military personnel, only 6,500 are privates. 
There are 6,333 captains to supervise these 1,487 lieutenants. 
There are 2,938 majors and 66 generals.  
This may be one of the reasons. 
We have highly competent officers who have 6,500 privates working for them. 
Does that make sense? 
I would like to find out what my Reform colleague thinks of this whole situation.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question. 
He certainly came to this debate well informed with statistics. 
They say that if you are well prepared, you shall not fear. 
Leadership is so important at the grassroots level. 
It is very important. 
How did it get there and why? 
We have to look at those questions. 
Now is the time. 
Today is the day these questions can be answered by the government.  
We will now go to Statements by Members.  
Mr. Carmen Provenzano (Sault Ste. Marie, Lib.):
The issue of these stamps could not come at a better time. 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Canadians should be allowed to examine the facts on all sides of the issue.  
Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):
Despite the dozens of stitches that he required Steven survived. 
However Cindy was not so lucky. 
Cindy's life and death were dedicated to helping others. 
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):
Community theatre is an important part of Canadian culture. 
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE 
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the RCMP is celebrating its 125th anniversary.  
The 125 years of achievement by the RCMP are our proud heritage.  
Congratulations to the men and women who continue to make us very proud.  
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
The Canadian government's objective remains the same. 
After all, it is their future that is at stake.  
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
We need nurses and nursing. 
Almost everywhere health services are received nurses are there. 
I congratulate nurses and nursing for their forward thinking. 
We need our nurses. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Let us show solidarity for the victims of the tainted blood tragedy. 
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is for the benefit of the member for Calgary East. 
That is some photo op.  
That is some photo op.  
Many members of the opposition could be called frequent flyers. 
The hon. member for Quebec. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Their recent appearance in Los Angeles got rave reviews. 
The Los Angeles Times talked about a gripping and flawless performance.  
Congratulations to the Violons du Roy and their artistic director, Bernard Labadie. 
You are true ambassadors of our city. 
We are proud of your success and greatly appreciate your talent.  
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
I am back now. 
I am working on it again. 
The government owes the Mills family an explanation. 
It owes them justice or at least an apology.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
Quebec comes off the loser, how else would one put it?  
The hon. member for Wanuskewin.  
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
It ranks among the world's top five producers for some 16 major mineral commodities.  
National Mining Week celebrates the great contribution mining makes to our country. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Nobody knows what the federal government's position is.  
This government is trying to blame the provinces and say it is their fault.  
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada has always acted responsibly. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
It certainly was not the federal health minister who called for it.  
What is missing is federal money here. 
With federal money we think the rest of the provinces would be on side''.  
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
First off, its numbers. 
It said 60,000 to 80,000 victims. 
The victims say it is 23,000. 
It then goes on to the issue of fault. 
The victims say they will sign no fault. 
It then said the whole thing would break the system. 
These are all excuses.  
Why is the government continuing to try to get this conference to fail?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
So much for his credibility.  
We do not want this conference to fail. 
We want it to succeed in the interests of victims. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
This is quite different from the Deputy Prime Minister.  
The provinces are at fault''.  
Why has this federal government been followers instead of leaders?  
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
The hon. leader of the Bloc Quebecois.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
So, the hon. Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs has the floor if he wishes to respond.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister is missing the point.  
We are not asking the federal government to interfere. 
Mr. Speaker, I have nothing to add to what I said. 
The unity problem in Canada creates this kind of difficulty.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
That is what he just said.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Our message is very clear. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Canada's hands are not clean in this fiasco. 
Canada is hiding under the nuclear umbrella of the U.S. and NATO. 
Canada has failed to aggressively push for the global elimination of nuclear weapons. 
Canada must end its own ambiguity and complicity.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have been showing leadership. 
We will continue to do so with respect to Pakistan. 
We hope it will not be necessary. 
That is firm action and I think it speaks for itself.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
This House through members on both sides has been asking that his report- 
The hon. member for Red Deer.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
He simply said it broke its word. 
We toughened and strengthened the safeguards. 
We invited India to sign the new safeguards. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Canadians wonder why does the Prime Minister not act like a real leader?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
We have been encouraging that.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let me comment upon the hon. member's use of statistics.  
I believe that represents fundamental core values that are shared by all Canadians.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
They want us to have meaningful consequences when it happens. 
Nothing more than this response represents core Canadian values.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Who is the genius who approved this spending? 
Was it the minister? 
He got an invite.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
It did not cost $2 million. 
The internal auditor will soon be reporting on the matter.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
He has since been ordered deported.  
Even former president Jimmy Carter has talked to the minister about this case. 
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Secretary of State for Financial Institutions.  
The hon. Minister of Transport.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Industry has been somewhat preoccupied with this issue. 
A report that deals with the issue has come from the standing committee.  
All government departments are working on their own plans. 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
World leaders know this is a serious problem. 
Why is he leaving Canadians vulnerable? 
Where is the Canadian plan?  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I think I answered the question in the first reply. 
The government has been seized with this issue for the past couple of years. 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, first I want to thank the hon. member for her question. 
This is why we will proceed very soon with other initiatives.  
Mrs. Judi Longfield (Whitby-Ajax, Lib.):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
There are some 600 firefighters and some 24 forest fires in that area of Alberta. 
We want to help fellow Canadians and the people of Alberta.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there are two completely different issues here. 
First, there is the case of the individual involved. 
As you know, I never publicly discuss the details of an individual's case.  
The second issue concerns immigration consultants. 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
So they could learn Mandarin Chinese. 
This is yet another example of wasteful spending.  
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
First and foremost, these are students who are going to work in the tourism industry. 
The values of understanding a proper tourism industry are not just linguistic. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
It is an internal assessment of American attitudes within the delegation. 
In fact, it is neither. 
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. 
It is a problem that the Canadian government has been looking at carefully.  
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
It is much appreciated by all.  
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Vaughan-King-Aurora, Lib.):
My question is to the minister of defence. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
We will be arriving in Italy this Sunday.  
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
The hon. member for Beauharnois-Salaberry.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
We also have an independent report from three consultants with some suggestions. 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
Senor presidente, I thank the hon. member for Parkdale-High Park for her question.  
I very much doubt that the government will have to impose economic sanctions.  
I wonder why the official opposition did not participate.  
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Indian Affairs.  
Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Saint-Jean for his question.  
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
Forty-one of those jobs were lost in the maritimes.  
It seems its promise was not worth the licence it was written on.  
If the CRTC will not do it, it should be scrapped.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this question is almost as good as last week's question.  
Next week is a constituency office week. 
The government's intention is to work very hard. 
Tuesday, May 26 shall be an allotted day.  
ALLOTTED DAY-CANADIAN FORCES 
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to take part in this debate. 
I am going to be splitting my time with the member for Nepean-Carleton.  
I want to highlight a couple of issues and specifically talk about the reserves. 
In 1994 we produced the defence white paper. 
We cut the bureaucracy and reduced the number of top military brass. 
We increased the number of reservists to 30,000. 
We have re-equipped the forces. 
This is clearly leadership, not failure.  
I want to talk about positive things.  
The militia idea goes back to the earliest days of New France. 
We have a proud military tradition in this country. 
This is a record we can be proud of as Canadians.  
Canadians fought and died in Korea between 1950 and 1953. 
They have shown bravery. 
They were the shock troops of Europe in the first and second world wars.  
The reserves in particular are a bridge between the regular forces and the Canadian public. 
They are made up of the Canadian public all across this country. 
The reserves are not a frill or some out moded luxury. 
They are a necessity, an integral part of the Canadian forces. 
I know my hon. friend across the way would agree with that.  
I know it is easier to criticize than it is to provide solutions. 
The most complicated aspect of a restructuring program concerns the militia. 
While the complex labour goes on the government has not stood still on other fronts. 
I know my friends and colleagues on the other side would agree with that.  
Clearly we can be very proud of the work our reservists do. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Oak Ridges for his comments. 
So what we are doing is cutting out their training. 
We are not giving them a chance to train properly. 
That was four years ago. 
That will leave us with one submarine. 
That is our total fleet. 
We will go for a couple of years with one submarine. 
It is not very logical. 
That submarine will not be out too much.  
Maybe the member would care to comment on that.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. friend for his comments. 
As far as the reserves are concerned we are going through a process. 
Clearly the process is not finished. 
It is excellent value for the Canadian taxpayer.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Others are related to how people are treated. 
That is what we want to debate today. 
The member asked about whether we had failed in political leadership. 
I demonstrated at the very beginning all the things the government has done. 
The gentlemen over there should listen up. 
If they ask questions they had better be prepared to listen to the answers. 
Otherwise they should not ask questions.  
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
Just to get the motion on the record, it states: 
It is sponsored by the hon. member for Compton-Stanstead. 
The two of us are on the national defence and veterans affairs committee. 
He has done a good job that way. 
Let me take the opportunity to put this matter into some perspective. 
Certainly the world has changed greatly over the 1990s. 
All Canadians are concerned about security issues. 
As a result some decisions had to be made. 
As a result cutbacks had to be made in government. 
There were many other departments. 
That took a lot of political courage. 
From that standpoint the minister is to be congratulated. 
As I mentioned earlier, we have had the opportunity to go to many bases. 
For anyone who was counting that was 15 different locations to date. 
We have heard a great deal from members of the Canadian forces. 
We have heard about the issue of salary. 
The issue of housing has been mentioned. 
It is very old stock and it needs to be replaced. 
We have heard about other issues including the care of the wounded and the injured. 
We have also heard about the problem of post traumatic stress syndrome.  
They feel proud to wear Canada's uniform. 
They feel proud of the record of our Canadian forces men and women abroad.  
The issue of equipment is important. 
The forces are in the process of enhancing or improving the equipment available to them. 
The army definitely needs more equipment. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member who has just spoken. 
At least he alluded to the problems we face. 
I have been in the same area for a long time. 
Imagine having three sergeants and one constable.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I will have to interrupt the hon. member, because we have another question to go. 
The hon. member for Nepean-Carleton can form a response to that question.  
I think the answer is yes. 
The number has been brought down from approximately 130 to about 70.  
We are working toward 60,000 regular members at this point in the Canadian forces. 
Are 60 some generals too many? 
I am not sure it is.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
I would like to quote from an April edition of Maclean's magazine: 
This is by a member of the armed services speaking about the assault on morale. 
How does the member reconcile his remarks with these comments from an enlisted person?  
I can say this quite honestly. 
I have talked to hundreds of members of the Canadian forces. 
I am giving my general observations. 
In terms of discharging their work, they are very professional. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Note that the motion does not simply say provide leadership, but political leadership. 
Perhaps politicians fall in that category as well.  
It is not a job to be taken lightly. 
They retrieved body parts of soldiers blown up by mines. 
What makes us feel that today there is not that quality of leadership? 
There are a lot of problems around family life and inadequate housing. 
I think of military members who have families. 
She lives in a cramped apartment in the city's north end. 
My father worked on the railway. 
He was away from home at least three or four days each week. 
My father was not in any danger when he was away. 
These are some of the things which our armed services personnel are faced with.  
I shook for hours when I got home''. 
``My husband was shocked. 
I was shocked'', said Couture. 
``I still cannot believe I did that. 
But I had to''.  
Her husband chose not to speak. 
She did speak out because she had hurt so much. 
``It is very hard on your self-esteem. 
I think to myself I am worth more than this''. 
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
The second question I would ask concerns the Canadian public as a whole. 
Is that something the member and his party could support?  
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate those two very interesting questions. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
We have always been there and we will continue to be there.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
The hon. member can look to his own party. 
We are concerned about the present situation with respect to our Canadian forces. 
We are supportive of the concerns they brought forward. 
We want to work in the best interest of resolving those issues. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to take part in the debate this afternoon.  
Calling a committee meeting probably demonstrates the absence of political leadership. 
The easiest thing anybody can do is to have a committee to discuss an issue. 
It was to keep the defence committee travelling around. 
I am aware that there are professional people who do this on a permanent basis.  
I do not accept at all the premise I have heard earlier this afternoon.  
whole privatization process has dragged on far too long. 
This has been an extremely stressful time for all the employees and their families. 
As an employee of DND, I have only two burning questions. 
Please, we just want to get on with our lives!  
It is trying to be all things to all people. 
Its equipment, as we all know, is relatively seriously outdated. 
I have not seen any lack of leadership. 
I would agree wholeheartedly with the recommendation before us: 
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
The minister is to be congratulated.  
I have another comment to make before I sit down. 
The white paper provides for a multipurpose combat ready force serving Canada. 
That is exactly what we have. 
There is no confusion there. 
Why not sit down and do it that way?  
They do not want to do it.  
How is that known? 
Has there been a vote?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Please do not leave the Chair and the rest of members out of this debate.  
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for Nepean-Carleton says that he has asked people. 
Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Peterborough.  
I believe that the government has indeed shown tremendous leadership.  
In 1995 it was this government that established the commission on restructuring the reserves. 
To begin with, there is almost entirely a new leadership team. 
This project will significantly reduce the cost of training military pilots. 
Recently Canada agreed to participate in two new missions. 
Changes are being made on every front. 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
This government closed CFB Chilliwack in the Fraser Valley. 
There are over two million people in that area. 
The closest base has now been moved to a Liberal riding in Edmonton. 
The parliamentary secretary mentioned that there is a new naval base in his own riding. 
These things have been going on since the end of the second world war. 
Many of these bases were out of date and no longer needed.  
This was promised long and ever ago. 
It is now in place on the east coast. 
It is a very good naval base. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Veterans Affairs. 
Information is not getting across.  
There is a problem with different doctors. 
There seems to be a blockage. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his questions. 
However, I am confident this is being overcome. 
It is not 100% yet. 
There is no doubt there is a long road to go.  
Our defence policy is responding to the characteristics of the post-cold war environment. 
The Canadian forces are designed to do many things. 
Our military is recognized around the world for its expertise and experience.  
We also have responsibilities very close to home. 
They were replacing other Canadians who had been there busy performing the same function.  
Both missions were right and just. 
Both were rewarding and potentially dangerous. 
These missions and others like them are not easy. 
These are in addition to all our more longstanding, ongoing obligations.  
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
Some military personnel gave a wake-up call to the government by doing unacceptable things.  
What do we do with an army? 
I salute our military for their role in these instances.  
It is essential to define the role of our forces. 
But how are we going to equip them? 
We lost an incredible amount of money with the helicopters. 
Is this taking one's responsibilities? 
I do not think so. 
How many women said they were almost persecuted? 
How many women generals are there in the Canadian forces? 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for a number of interesting points.  
There is one thing I would like to say first though. 
That is what I was trying to do in my speech. 
The Canadian forces are a military unit. 
The hon. member mentioned the matter of equipment. 
I mention the submarines. 
I have studied sea ice in various parts of the north. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Canada has a very rich and proud military history. 
The exploits of our Canadian military personnel are legendary throughout the world. 
Vimy helped define us as a nation.  
Our Canadian peacekeepers are among the most respected throughout the world. 
It pains me deeply to have to say this about our military. 
The wishes of our military personnel are once again being ignored.  
These helicopters have long since worn out their usefulness and should be replaced. 
An hon. colleague says 70 hours of maintenance. 
It is not a good ratio.  
They distinguished themselves with honour. 
I am not sure it recognizes the valiant efforts of these soldiers.  
Military doctors question the existence of this syndrome. 
There is reason for fear as Sue discovered. 
Our military needs the government to show some leadership. 
If we do not speak up for them who will? 
If we continue to treat them with disrespect how will others treat them? 
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
We saved literally hundreds of millions of dollars in the awarding of that contract.  
He should inquire from his colleague in his own caucus. 
Is this a speech or a question?  
I am getting to the question. 
I just had to set the record straight. 
I will rush to the conclusion.  
Mr. Speaker, I take great pride in answering the hon. member's question.  
I think it hurts him. 
My mother used to tell me an old saying that the truth hurts. 
The truth is hurting and we are hearing it today.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member mentioned the morale. 
I would like to ask him the following question.  
No wonder the NCOs are in the mood they are in. 
Would the member not agree with that?  
It is how people are treated. 
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
I think that is the way it can be summed up lack of respect.  
Our military personnel go everywhere in the world. 
People react favourably when they see ``Canada''. 
We turn to the minister. 
The problem again lies within cabinet. 
We do not know how, but funding is being cut by 30%. 
This shows a lack of respect for Canadian forces.  
They came up with a name:
The issue was totally partisan. 
They waffled about for six months. 
This is a flagrant lack of respect.  
There is still a problem. 
Our soldiers have no boots. 
The uniforms are pitiful. 
There are no boots.  
If a pair of boots were worn out, we replaced them. 
They are having a hard time getting boots for the Canadian Armed Forces. 
Is there no respect? 
They will not admit that the gulf war was a war. 
Because, once again, they do not want to recognize gulf war veterans. 
It is the same thing with helicopters. 
There is a big problem somewhere. 
I hope the minister is not the problem. 
It is time to send them a very clear message.  
There are human problems on the bases. 
The human issue must be resolved by humans.  
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nippissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
My French is not as clear as that spoken in Paris.  
The hon. member has a big problem with money. 
I might ask my colleague to comment on that.  
Mr. Speaker, I understood perfectly. 
The member's French is truly excellent.  
I therefore ask him to be patient.  
I think that is important.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in this debate. 
Note the date, 1995. 
This is obviously an initiative of this government, not the previous government. 
It went more or less into mothballs for many years. 
It was very interesting. 
In one section of the proving grounds there is an artillery range.  
While we were there we saw artillery being fired. 
They use live rounds because they want to test the quality of the ammunition.  
The mock enemy were not all that mock. 
They were U.S. marines from Buffalo who were testing out the Meaford proving grounds. 
It was very interesting. 
It was very interesting for me. 
I have done some research in the past on the military. 
This weapon was totally without class. 
It is manufactured in Canada. 
It is a superlative firearm. 
In other words there is not a lot of maintenance. 
It is extremely reliable.  
Certain members might, perhaps.  
Nevertheless, this is a superb weapon, and I am very, very impressed. 
I was given the opportunity to fire the machine gun. 
It was quite amusing. 
It was quite amusing to see her down in the trenches firing this machine gun. 
I should switch for a moment. 
I have another story with respect to our reserves.  
It is like the C6 gun I was talking about. 
The Shawinigan is a superb little vessel. 
This is tomorrow's ship. 
Technically it is a minesweeper. 
It has multiple defence capabilities. 
There is a container in the back of the vessel. 
At that time the container contained extra barracks. 
The Shawinigan is designed just like a container vessel. 
It should be able to turn on its length.  
What does that have to do with the reserves? 
The entire crew of the Shawinigan except for the chief officer are reservists. 
I am sorry to say that we have to protect that status and our sovereignty. 
There are other countries which sometimes have designs on Canada. 
That should make us want to preserve a very active and capable military response.  
Your vision tends to be rooted very much in the past. 
Meaford was an interesting experience. 
There was a change from armoured personnel carriers and tanks. 
We are creating a Canadian forces based on the classic concept of the citizen army. 
It is just like republican Rome. 
This is where we should make the investment. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his very interesting speech. 
I quite enjoyed it. 
There is only one thing that bothers me a bit. 
It is this thing of the militia. 
The member has seen how the militia works. 
A normal training year used to be in the 60 day range. 
Now we are talking half of that time. 
Unfortunately they are lacking a lot of other things.  
Our soldiers find themselves in the opposite situation. 
Perhaps the member would care to comment on that.  
They had excellent weaponry. 
My thought was that if it rained they would get pretty wet. 
There was no doubt about it.  
I would like to see the reserve increased by another 10,000.  
I believe there are things the government can do. 
I agree with the member on the equipment problem. 
Next must come good equipment and, I agree, more hours if possible.  
I agree with my colleague. 
I heard the member's remark about the increase. 
It is like the Boy Scouts. 
It is a worthy investment. 
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
He said it was like a dream buy for the Canadian forces. 
They will also give us an opportunity to train well with the Americans.  
What problem does he see with the Upholders? 
Many people think it is a great deal?  
Basically that is what it amounts to. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
I will talk about this leadership from a couple of points of view. 
First, the lack of political leadership can be clearly demonstrated in several ways. 
Let us start with funding. 
Money is not everything. 
I challenge anybody to remember that. 
It has not happened. 
The Prime Minister is not committed to having a strong military. 
A woman by the name of Mrs. Dolhan phoned me. 
I talked to her for some time. 
It involves Master Corporal Dolhan who is a member of our forces. 
He was parachuting under very unsafe conditions. 
The chief of defence staff, General Baril, said this: 
She is not an unreasonable person. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
We are debating the necessity of clearly banning the cloning of human beings.  
She subsequently gave birth to a seemingly perfectly healthy lamb. 
If applied to human beings, this technique raises important ethical questions. 
This is from page 1022 of the Baird commission's report.  
But came the election and the bill died on the order paper.  
These concrete measures should be echoed in North America. 
Bill C-247 is a step in that direction.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
As we have seen, what once was thought to be completely impossible becomes reality. 
Again, hats off and praise to the member for Drummond. 
This in essence provides a vehicle to do that.  
Canada is very much in need of guidelines in this area. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
I congratulate the member for Drummond for bringing the bill forward. 
It prepares omnibus bills that address entire issues.  
Bill C-47 on human reproductive technology is a case in point.  
That is a frightening concept.  
Who would it be? 
Would it be some top politician? 
Who would be the first to be cloned? 
It is an absolutely unacceptable concept.  
The member for Drummond recognizes this. 
This is not an appropriate place for this type of penalty. 
We can give the government the benefit of the doubt on that. 
Maybe it will take us two years. 
The bill does it. 
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the constituents of Winnipeg North-St. 
I congratulate the member for Drummond on her initiative. 
Why did I define these terms? 
However the terms continue to be commonly used and we understand them in this context.  
Might it be implied wrongly that the others are sanctioned? 
I submit that we ought to use an approach that is integrated and comprehensive.  
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):
I am not opposed to the idea of prohibiting cloning. 
I would draw your attention to the second part of page two. 
The second part would necessarily prohibit the following, that is: 
That has now lapsed and Canada is no longer at that table. 
Why is that significant to this? 
There are about 4,000 genetic diseases known. 
There are two ways of doing that. 
There are possibilities that we could cure some of these diseases for good. 
My colleague from Hamilton-Wentworth was saying this could be in 10 years. 
That is what we strive for.  
I caution my colleagues in support of this bill.  
I think I also agree with the member for Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough. 
I think everyone can agree on that. 
We must not make that error.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Employment insurance is in a crisis. 
Is the government blind or simply stupid? 
After a year the government is wondering why people do not qualify.  
I would like to repeat the minister's response. 
I can guarantee you that I am familiar with my region. 
Ours is not the only area affected. 
Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
However, we realize the problem is more complex than the hon. member is suggesting. 
We understand Canadians would not be satisfied with a step backward to an obsolete system. 
Nevertheless we are carefully monitoring the recent declines in this ratio. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.14 p.m.)
