EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 220 
Monday, May 3, 1999 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
I will describe this later in greater detail.  
This is where the problem begins, because it is totally bad taste. 
I come back to my bill, which concerns toys specifically. 
Why was the word doll included in the bill? 
Probably far more can be done. 
My approach is aimed at banning this practice, using a specific example. 
I am sure, however, that a number of improvements can be made to this bill.  
In the process, some became more knowledgeable. 
A debate was held in the House on this issue. 
We need only think of recent events in our society. 
They end up in our businesses and they have an impact.  
We will not be able to deny people direct access to American channels. 
We will be able to regulate less and less. 
It will come directly on the computer, which will be hooked up to the TV. 
People will make their own choices about what they want to watch.  
What can we do? 
Can we do something?  
There are experts in the field. 
Questions have been raised, phenomena discussed. 
There are people who are experts in this area.  
I think it does have an influence.  
This is not a simple or easy issue. 
This kind of occurrence can never be completely prevented. 
We are not talking of disproportionate penalties to be made part of the Criminal Code. 
Public pressure will always be very useful. 
The vast majority of people find this unacceptable.  
If this bill became the law, it would be a deterrent.  
Before concluding, I should point out one thing. 
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
Parents make choices around those issues. 
Can we prove this? 
Can we prove it to a criminal burden of proof? 
That is a little different. 
It is a high burden.  
This is activity which happens in homes and schoolyards. 
However, I wonder whether we want to relegate it to criminal activity. 
If we do then we have limited some of the freedoms we enjoy. 
There is freedom of speech even in commercial labelling. 
That is one area. 
We have regulations to deal with those situations.  
This bill is specifically about creating a new criminal offence. 
They are more than rude. 
They use language and incite behaviour that is not found in Canadian values. 
However, we are talking about a doll and the labelling on the doll. 
There is a technical difficulty. 
However, there is another section that is comparable, so it could be corrected.  
On balance, the criminal law is a very serious tool. 
They have some protections under charters when we get into some of the areas.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
The toy we are debating about today is the warrior troll. 
They reflect society's moral and social values.  
Allow me to tell the House a little about this warrior troll.  
The toy in itself is not bad. 
Is that what we want our children to learn?  
Shame on the inventor and the corporation that is marketing this toy.  
Are our children not exposed to enough of this negativity in society?  
Today there are memorial services taking place in Taber, Alberta. 
I do not wish to say more. 
It is very painful. 
The member acknowledges that there is a problem but that is all she said. 
We know that if we do not do anything it will carry on and on.  
We can make a statement today by supporting Bill C-374. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
This is something not to be put aside. 
That is an incredible amount of support in the community. 
As we have heard, the bill would not ban toys. 
The issue is not toys. 
That is a very common sense approach. 
It is something we should all be supporting. 
The bill should be supported. 
We are talking about a multibillion dollar industry.  
Parents want to do the right thing. 
Let us not forget we are talking about a marketplace. 
Children are faced with very conflicting messages in society.  
We value that as a society. 
It is not just about freedom of choice or freedom of speech. 
We see programs that have been cut to the bone. 
The kids had nowhere to go. 
All these issues are linked. 
We believe it is a very important initiative. 
Something useful and beneficial can come out of it. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
However, nothing could be further from the truth. 
There is violence everywhere in our society. 
One only has to look around to see that violence is depicted just about everywhere. 
The Colorado tragedy is proof of this. 
What happened in Colorado is truly appalling. 
Details of such vicious attacks are becoming far too prevalent. 
Canadians are sick and tired of seeing violent young offenders getting off virtually scot-free. 
Canadians want the government to start focusing greater attention on victims. 
Bill C-374 will not eliminate youth crime. 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
I will not repeat what has been said so far on the issue. 
These instructions were aimed at young children. 
We know how vulnerable young children are. 
This will make a troll happy. 
Is this the kind of instructions we want to give children in Canada? 
The private member's bill introduced by the member for Temiscamingue deals with dolls. 
We cannot continue to do nothing and to not examine this situation.  
Is the Criminal Code the most effective way? 
This is why we want a debate.  
However, I think we have to create a criminal offence. 
Obviously, offences under the Criminal Code are not all the same sort. 
And they are punished differently. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC) moved: 
We are still waiting for it.  
This government has let the industry slide to the point of near extinction in Canada. 
We are not winning contracts. 
Again, the number of spinoff jobs is about the same. 
This is simply not acceptable.  
This sentiment was echoed by the current Prime Minister when he was in opposition. 
I quote from one of those letters. 
Today where is the Prime Minister and the Minister of Industry?  
In 1993 the Liberal Party became the government. 
What happened to the Liberal promise of change? 
The contract for the MCDVs created a steady flow of work into the shipbuilding industry.  
The following is from experts and is in today's Ottawa Citizen : 
That is a disgrace.  
The Liberal government has not followed through and the people are still waiting.  
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
The Liberals see the problem. 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
Our government continued to provide assistance and support to the industry. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
I commend the member for her efforts. 
Our people across the country are educated people and- 
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member but her time has run out. 
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
In 1990 there were some 12,000 people employed in the shipbuilding industry in Canada. 
In 1996-97 those numbers had dropped to approximately 5,000. 
That is a significant drop. 
This is why we have brought forward this motion. 
We are trying to get the support of our colleagues in the House of Commons. 
This matter goes beyond our own constituencies. 
I have a shipyard in my constituency of Burin-St. 
However the motion goes beyond our own parochial needs. 
Shipbuilding is a very important industry. 
It does wonders for us economically by creating employment. 
However he refuses to meet with the major players in the industry. 
He refuses to meet with the unions that are spearheading this campaign. 
We are paying our players in U.S. dollars. 
We are a small market.  
They are important as well. 
That is my point.  
No one is asking for direct subsidies. 
No one is asking for subsidies.  
That the motion be amended by adding after the word ``develop'' the word ``immediately''.  
We are trying to raise the profile of this important issue in parliament. 
There are still 4,000 to 5,000 jobs in the industry in Canada today. 
The amendment is in order.  
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened intently to the member for Burin-St. 
The member's statement is totally incorrect. 
I am not interested in playing petty politics. 
That is not what it is about.  
The Liberals have been in power now for six years. 
In 1993 they became the Government of Canada. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I meant to make that reference in my remarks. 
We must have a new national shipbuilding policy.  
There are possibilities for provincial governments to get involved. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
They are not asking for subsidies.  
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas-Charlottenburgh, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
It is an important part of Canada's marine industry.  
Many regions of Canada have shipbuilding companies. 
Two provinces have come forward with programs to foster shipbuilding in their jurisdictions. 
The international market for ships is much more complicated than that. 
We offer generous tax and export support. 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
There is a shipyard in his own riding. 
I met with him during the summer. 
We have heard over and over ``not a subsidy''. 
I am willing to meet with the member, as I have before. 
They are still meeting on an ongoing basis to discuss various other alternatives. 
That is the way it should be done, sector by sector.  
I am interested in how he would proceed from there.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Revising Revenue Canada leasing regulations is a tax incentive. 
My comments there were the same comments as here.  
There is a need to understand all aspects of the shipbuilding industry. 
Before we know it, when people talk about the various items, it becomes a subsidy. 
Is it a subsidy in the end or is it not?  
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
I had hoped to introduce an amendment to the motion. 
My questions for the Tory members of the House are:
It is that simple. 
It is so simple that even the Minister of Industry is beginning to understand this.  
This is an unacceptable burden placed on taxpayers.  
We cannot call for freer trade and then also call for protectionist policies.  
I offer this point to my colleagues as a word of caution. 
Sadly, it makes no specific policy recommendation.  
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed the last presentation by the member opposite. 
I would be interested in the hon. member's comments.  
Mr. Speaker, I commend the hon. member for his comments and his brief question. 
We have to address those key problems. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
These recommendations come from the shipbuilding industry, not from us. 
The people building the ships are the ones who know what has to be done.  
That is really all we were asking for. 
That is what we would like to address across the board.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
The motion reads as follows: 
An amendment was introduced to add the word ``immediately''. 
And a good thing. 
Naturally a summit would involve representatives from the shipbuilding industry. 
At one point, however, the industry employed up to 12,000 workers. 
A summit would also involve people for the shipping industry as a whole.  
Who makes up the shipping industry? 
Even today, they represent 40,000 workers. 
This is no small industry.  
There is the Pacific Ocean out west.  
But which one of all these industries costs the least per tonne? 
The maritime shipping industry. 
The maritime shipping industry.  
This should be a considerable plus for Canada. 
In my opinion, the St. Lawrence is far more than that. 
What does it do? 
It is strategic and vital economic development. 
They say that it is a traditional industry, outdated, a lame duck. 
A ship has as many computers as a plane, even more. 
Navigation is by satellite, in the same way. 
It is not an outdated field.  
I would like to take two minutes to talk about the situation worldwide. 
What is happening in the world? 
They subsidize their shipyards. 
And what are the Americans doing? 
When it comes to refundable tax credits, this is what Quebec does. 
The parliamentary secretary has studied the leasing measures in depth.  
The Americans are doing something worse that is detrimental to us. 
Not many members knew about this, but it is a fact.  
Negotiations are required to make changes to an agreement.  
We would need a summit, as the Liberals had planned in 1993. 
A coalition of unions was organized across the country. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to pay tribute to my hon. colleague.  
Last summer he worked hard on this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to clear something up. 
Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Quebec East, BQ):
It is a leading edge industry. 
At the present time, we are operating at only 40% of capacity. 
These are well-paid jobs, but no more so than in other countries. 
The most important thing is the economic fallout of those jobs. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
It is a very important motion so I am going to read it again.  
The motion has been very well crafted and it says a lot. 
Undoubtedly there is a need for a national shipbuilding policy. 
I say that in all sincerity. 
Yet, this policy seems to be long forthcoming. 
Ships have been sailing between Canadian ports for many years. 
We do not want to ensure a sound industry for our citizens.  
Yet shipbuilders on both coasts of Canada sit idle. 
One has to ask oneself why this is so. 
The U.S. provides generous long term loan guarantees for buyers. 
The Prime Minister wrote that when he was in opposition. 
I would venture that today it has probably gone even lower.  
Coastal communities are facing economic stagnation and chronic unemployment. 
We see it in the fisheries industry. 
Now the same thing is happening in the shipbuilding industry.  
That would create employment and work within this area.  
Today we do not see anything happening in that regard.  
We have to ask ourselves, what is the problem? 
This may be part of the problem. 
We have the equipment and the skilled workers. 
This is the important point. 
This is not the case with the shipbuilding workers. 
No. If we did have such a government, we would see this industry moving forward.  
This is very important.  
They do not want handouts. 
Those individuals are sincere when they say that. 
We know these individuals and we know them to be honourable people.  
We know that where there is a will, there will be a way.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Now he says it is not part of his agenda.  
I congratulate the hon. member on his presentation and I thank him for it. 
Mr. Speaker, unfortunately I have to answer the question in the negative. 
We must not say one thing and do another. 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Halifax West for his remarks. 
I can see positive signs at the moment. 
They even agree with their employers at the shipbuilders' association. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his excellent question.  
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
The motion before the House today seems crucial to me. 
It does not involve one region in particular, but several.  
He has traveled across the country. 
We are extremely well represented in the maritimes. 
These people help us raise our awareness of this major issue.  
There is nothing new in this morning's motion. 
Remember last election campaign. 
So the current government had promised to roll back the free trade agreement. 
Incidentally, the Liberals had promised to tear up the free trade agreement.  
It is difficult to fight this kind of talk during an election campaign. 
I remember the debate on free trade. 
In the end, the Liberals were elected. 
There was however a few measures contained in the red book with which I agreed. 
I think our government colleagues will be pleased to hear that.  
In their red book, the Liberals made an interesting commitment regarding shipyards. 
The Liberals did not make good on many of their commitments. 
Attacks on the Progressive Conservatives are always the same.  
It has become a world renowned shipping centre.  
The Canadian Patrol Frigate Program is an extremely important program. 
We cannot compete on the American market. 
It is a very captive market, with controlled zones. 
There is a complete ban on potential outside markets.  
George's and all the others who have met with people from this industry.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
I hope it is.  
That is all I wanted to say.  
We cannot ask that of our local yards. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
There is no reason.  
My comment is so what. 
We do not care. 
There are other markets we can chase down.  
Those are the kinds of ships we can be competitive with. 
Our labour is competitive in that regard. 
We have over $200 billion worth of trade with the Americans. 
Previously it was only $80 billion. 
The government has been in power for over six years. 
Rather, it has put the blame on the previous government. 
Do members know how many loan defaults there have been since 1936? 
That would lower taxes. 
I ask my colleagues again:
I will give the government a bit of credit in this regard. 
It has taken some steps with respect to the Export Development Corporation. 
First, we have to be able to establish a marketplace. 
The marketplace is threefold domestically. 
The Minister of Industry should be an advocate for this industry. 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
I will admit that he has a sincere interest in terms of advancing this file.  
We are not even going to argue what particular initiatives have to be taken. 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
He is very familiar with the whole area.  
If it is a priority, then let us do it. 
A priority is something on which there is an intent to follow through.  
We have put forward four initiatives. 
We have ports, we have an ocean and we have access to those markets. 
CANADIAN HUMAN RIGHTS TRIBUNAL 
Mr. John O'Reilly (Haliburton-Victoria-Brock, Lib.):
She continues to reflect the past while inspiring the future.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
The constitution was passed on May 3, 1791. 
The Polish constitution was an important contribution to the development of parliamentary traditions. 
Recent years have brought exciting changes to Poland. 
Poland and Polish Canadians have much to celebrate on this day.  
Please accept my best wishes on this anniversary.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Their many efforts do not go unnoticed. 
WORLD PRESS FREEDOM DAY 
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, today is World Press Freedom Day. 
Journalists have faced arbitrary arrests, threats, aggression, harassment and even torture. 
Currently, at least 117 journalists are behind bars in 25 countries.  
I salute the courage, integrity and commitment of all journalists.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
These are values we share with him.  
Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
A systematic ethnic cleansing has been taking place in Kosovo. 
Hopes and aspirations have been chattered. 
To satisfy a dictator's political ambitions.  
Tomorrow, Canada welcomes the first of the 5,000 refugees from Kosovo. 
Mr. Benoit Serre (Timiskaming-Cochrane, Lib.):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Everyone benefits from the program.  
They have not been announced. 
They are going to start some time in the future.  
They are calling to ask us what is going on. 
They want to know if the programs are being approved.  
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
TVA has promised to serve the francophone and Acadian communities. 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Conservative and Reform go together'', she said, ``like oil and water''.  
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF OLDER PERSONS 
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale, Lib.):
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):
Bravo and happy 60th.  
THE LATE GORDON OLMSTEAD 
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
Cold lonely duty, constant targets of a deep sea foe. 
Gordon Olmstead passed away on April 24. 
How fitting it would be to rename Bill C-61 the Gordon Olmstead act.  
BLOC QUEBECOIS YOUTH FORUM 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Will the Prime Minister step in between these two and just declare a winner? 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have already started to cut taxes. 
I do not know where the member was.  
I will give an example. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
I will quote his revelation from the weekend: 
I've been saying for a long time we've got to lower taxes. 
Personal taxes are much higher than in the U.S. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Now we have a tax credit of- 
The hon. member for Fraser Valley.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
He has had six years to set up some meetings. 
He has had six years to actually lower the taxes. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We are not preoccupied only with the rich. 
We are preoccupied with the poor. 
It is why we are preoccupied with the health care of people. 
We have a very good story to tell the Americans.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Please be judicious in the choice of words.  
I am a little confused. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The member should look back at what he has written in the past.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Again he is late, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We are now looking at possible adjustments.  
The hon. leader of the Bloc Quebecois.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the opposite is in fact true. 
Is that what looking out for young people means? 
Is that what the Prime Minister is proud of?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
That was the best performance in 20 years. 
Youth employment is still something that our government is focused on. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
They are people who think that youths should receive more employment insurance. 
That is how we on this side are trying to help them.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. 
Momentum is building toward a diplomatic solution to the Kosovo crisis. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what we are doing at this time. 
We are making the best contribution we can. 
He should withdraw his troops. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
We must leave no stone unturned on the path to peace.  
Will Canada call for an immediate suspension of the bombing?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
That is why we had to start the air strikes. 
It is not through stopping them that he will come to the table. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Speaker, Canada's low productivity has recently been criticized. 
We all know high taxes and ineffective policies kill productivity.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
We expect those will do the job.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Yes, Mr. Speaker, and in fact we already do. 
She is unaware of some of the things that have changed.  
What does Peter Cairns, president of the Shipbuilding Association of Canada say? 
He says it is a really good initiative, beneficial to the whole industry nationwide. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
They have just filled out their tax forms. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, that is right. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Well, the true colours of the Reform Party come out. 
Absolutely that is questionable. 
It will never happen.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We are happy with that.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Perhaps this will be an opportunity for the parliamentary secretary to inform herself.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are completely involved. 
We have been consulted about all the elements of that. 
We were as active as anybody else on the diplomatic front. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Canada is not part of that group.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are a member of a collective group. 
This contact group has existed for a long time. 
It was mainly made up of people from Europe. 
We cannot have a contact group of 19. 
We are kept informed of every element of the proceedings. 
We play the role that Canada is able to play.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Now all shipments have to be approved by permit. 
Oil and military equipment are forbidden in any respect. 
The member can be reassured that Canada has already made a move in that direction.  
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the solicitor general is handcuffing the RCMP with lack of resources. 
There are many RCMP officers burning out and leaving the force. 
As a matter of fact, there are 400 vacancies in B.C. alone. 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
It received a $37 million increase in the last budget. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the question is when?  
When is it going to happen? 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question.  
We are receiving consultations. 
The consultation process has just begun. 
No decisions have been made.  
The hon. member for Langley-Abbotsford.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Both of them were identified as dangerous criminals by the police. 
One was even up for murder three years ago. 
Both of these people got off their respective buses somewhere along the road.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let us get the facts straight.  
These offenders are on conditional release. 
But public safety is the number one priority for this government. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
I will give one more.  
Of course, he was a no-show.  
I ask the solicitor general, do the bus companies know about this? 
What is the liability of- 
The hon. solicitor general.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. 
They spoke about gag orders, files being stolen and intimidation. 
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
He assured them that it was their duty and their responsibility. 
The member has it all wrong.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Why is he allowing Canadians to eat potentially carcinogenic meat?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have agreed to be part of a process.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
It is not just hockey teams that we are potentially losing from Canada.  
Specifically, what taxes should we lower? 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
It left us with a $42 billion a year deficit. 
That is the problem we face.  
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, those questions should be saved for a senator.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let us be clear. 
That is the view we take: we have to do this in partnership. 
I would ask the hon. member to join us in that regard.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, like his colleagues from the Progressive Conservative Party, this hon. member lacks information.  
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
They had an increase of $37 million. 
I expect to receive that report shortly.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Technology Partnerships Canada is available to the shipbuilding industry. 
Support from the Export Development Corporation is available to the shipbuilding industry. 
NATIONAL EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS WEEK 
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
For that reason, this week has been declared National Emergency Preparedness Week in Canada. 
I invite all hon. members of the House to be more aware of emergency preparedness.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
The calls for accountability are coming from all over.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Could the parliamentary secretary explain why these funds are so late in coming? 
When will the funds be allocated?  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We are aware of the situation that the member raises. 
Final allocations will be given shortly.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I will ask the Prime Minister once again:
The Prime Minister was once a member of parliament for an Atlantic province. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not know how many times we can go through this.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The loss of a young life is never easy to understand or accept. 
Such a senseless act can never truly be explained. 
And the loss and emptiness it leaves behind can never be filled.  
You are in our thoughts and our prayers. 
Your loss is the loss of all of us.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Her life has been changed permanently. 
She is a girl who knew the disturbed boy who lashed out. 
She felt the fear and she heard the shots. 
She went to school that day expecting safety. 
She left the school in tears.  
Then this might not have to happen''. 
He believed in God and he showed it. 
This was a young man who lived like a Christian''.  
As Taber mourns, my friends who live there mourn. 
As Taber mourns, I personally mourn. 
As Taber mourns, every Canadian family mourns.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
This only adds to the tragedy and our bewilderment.  
It is always hard to understand the reasons for such actions. 
It is just as painful, if not impossible, to know how to interpret them. 
The easy way out, of course, is to say that violence breeds violence. 
The answer is obvious.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Their loss can never be forgotten.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Today, a family, a community and a country are burying one of their own. 
The Bible states blessed are those with a pure heart because they will see God. 
Today Reverend Lang stated that Jason has definitely seen God.  
We must open our hearts to one another and we must learn to love. 
The House stood in silence ] 
Is there unanimous consent to proceed in such a fashion?  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
TABLING OF TREATIES ACT 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
The negotiations have been ongoing since 1994. Right now they are at an impasse. 
There will be thousands more to come.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have the honour to present two petitions. 
The first one has over 50 signatures.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the second petition has 150 signatures on it.  
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
I am pleased to present the petition on behalf of the petitioners today.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions.  
SUMAS COMMUNITY CORRECTIONAL CENTRE 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
This makes for over 30,000 names. 
The petitioners are asking for action from the government sooner and not later.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Some of the names on this petition I actually recognize. 
They are people I know. 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Question No. 202- Mr. Daniel Turp: 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
The ACHR guarantees equality before the law but does not contemplate affirmative action.  
Question No. 217- Mrs. Michelle Dockrill: 
QUESTIONS PASSED AS ORDERS FOR RETURNS 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Question No. 168- Mr. Jean Dube: 
Question No. 191- Mr. Jim Jones: 
Question No. 192- Mr. Jim Jones: 
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
I would like to know the whereabouts of Question No. 189. 
Mr. Speaker, I have made note of Question No. 189. 
I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House resumed consideration of the motion and the amendment.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Exporting is a sign of health.  
For Canada to remain in the shipbuilding industry, we must export. 
International competitiveness is the key. 
Essentially there are three elements to this policy.  
In addition, the Government of Canada has several other key initiatives to support this sector. 
Purchasers can write off the entire cost of a ship 100% over four years. 
Price is only one consideration.  
Fourth, such subsidies are contrary to current international trade trends. 
The European Union is trying to eliminate subsidies among member countries.  
Fifth, Canada has strongly urged the elimination of such subsidies. 
No other industry receives support in the form of direct subsidy programs. 
There is a role to be played by the provinces. 
Nova Scotia and Quebec have already done this. 
More importantly, the shipbuilding industry also has a role to play. 
The federal government is clearly not the only player.  
In conclusion, I believe in dialogue with all industries. 
However, the provinces and the industry also have roles to play. 
Some progress has already been made. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
The comparison to railway cars is often used as an example. 
It goes down very gradually over a long period of time.  
It would be very expensive. 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
We do not have to talk about subsidies. 
Nobody is asking for that. 
I will give the minister the opportunity to respond to that.  
The EDC supports export sales. 
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
The technology has been paid for by Canadian taxpayers. 
The Department of National Defence is giving away that design.  
Why are we not building it in Canada? 
We are exporting Canadian jobs.  
Mr. Speaker, I do not know the answer to that question. 
I look forward to receiving information.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
That is not where the world economies are actually headed. 
I concur with him on that particular point.  
I will point out a couple of them. 
That is one initiative I would point out.  
I argue that we cannot afford not to do it. 
Why would the minister not support this initiative today?  
Maybe there is an argument to be made for that. 
It was not successful in penetrating the Jones act then.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
I go back to asking what is the Tory policy. 
I think the marine workers are looking for action. 
I will talk about those in a moment. 
We talk about the accelerated CCA, the capital cost allowance write-off over four years. 
This particular write-off of four years is a benefit to the industry.  
There are research and development tax credits in the system. 
All these things are in place and should be encouraging growth in the shipbuilding industry.  
The Tory motion actually speaks to what the party is looking at. 
First, it does not seem to have a policy. 
It is tax relief. 
There are the provincial governments. 
That is what is required. 
That will help to move this industry along as well as many other industries.  
I cannot say it any better than that. 
That is what the bulk of Canadian citizens are looking for today. 
They do not want any more subsidies. 
Loan guarantees mainly put the liability back on the federal government. 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
Usually the Reform Party refers to tax breaks as incentives. 
Therefore, it makes it possible to build something that otherwise would not have been built. 
It brings in tax revenues as well as creating jobs.  
I would like to know whether the Reform member agrees with this kind of measure.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, policies are necessary to expand Atlantic Canada. 
The shipbuilding industry is only one part. 
One of the policies is to keep government out of it. 
I have seen nothing but interference in many areas in Atlantic Canada. 
We could talk about the gas exploration industry, mining, and the oil industry. 
We see problems now with Devco. 
Problems are already starting with Voisey's Bay. 
My solution is to get government out of it. 
Let Atlantic Canada grow. 
It has more resources and more potential than many other parts of the country. 
Atlantic Canada's biggest detriment to expansion and progression is government. 
That is where the answer lies.  
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
I will be supporting this motion. 
This would rank well in the annals of understatements. 
I am in agreement with these views as well.  
Some are specifically intended for one ocean travel only. 
World class companies become so by building on their experiences. 
Such experience exists in the Canadian shipbuilding industry. 
We were the leaders in the construction of wooden ships. 
Most immigrants came to Canada in Canadian built ships.  
The technological transfer from wood to steel simply did not happen.  
The second occasion was after the second world war. 
Canada's shipyards went into decline. 
Government subsidies do not in the long term make any industry strong. 
I will briefly mention taxation. 
What people look to is what they are netting after taxes. 
Our country has the raw materials. 
It has the ports and it has the shipyards. 
It has the willing capable workers. 
Why are there no sales of Canadian made ships? 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
His position is not unanimously shared by members of his party. 
I hope he will be able to bring them around.  
I think Mrs. Verrault would be quite proud of the motion before us. 
Here is my question to my colleague. 
That would help us to diversify our regional economies. 
This would not necessarily be through straight subsidies.  
The problems seem to be apparent. 
Yet somehow there was some help to our shipbuilding industry at that time.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
It was a very small shiny thing. 
Of course that was King George VI.  
This is a memory that certainly predates school age. 
It is a classic stamp. 
It was a wonderful ship. 
La Salle built the very first ship on the upper Great Lakes. 
He built the Griffon in 1678. 
That ship set sail. 
It set sail on Lake Erie and went up to Michilimackinac. 
It is all across this country. 
I do have quarrel with the motion in this sense. 
Those are very noble sounding words. 
Brazil, Romania and Russia are complaining. 
There is a problem there. 
Then there is the other aspect. 
That will not do any good at all. 
We could try it but it is not going to do any good. 
What the minister has said is closer to what we must do. 
I would say he is precisely right. 
Unfortunately there have been major cost overruns. 
There is a lot to be said. 
That is a policy. 
That is what we should be doing and that is what we are doing.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
I want to clarify something for the member. 
I am asking members to assist and help us. 
I ask my colleague to look at that in a positive way.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
Does he think it is normal?  
This a global problem. 
We have delivered a policy.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have just two quick points.  
It seems to me this is what we are doing all the time. 
We did it on the ethanol case. 
We did it when they would not allow us to launch our satellite. 
Bill C-55 was another example. 
It is not a question of going hat in hand. 
We are now at a major disadvantage and people are suffering. 
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
The factor here of wages does not necessarily come into this discussion at all. 
He thought that was a happy time. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
This issue is something that affects Canada from coast to coast to coast. 
They say that our motion does not have substance. 
They are the government; they should put the substance in it.  
Mr. Speaker, all I can say is what I have said. 
When is the opposition going to come up with its own ideas?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
I believe there is too much reference to labour. 
ISO 9001 is for the aeronautical industry. 
Quebec has paid for that negligence. 
I would like to return to the manpower issue. 
All the others pay more.  
The Prime Minister did not even bother to answer the letter.  
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
It is, in short, a general motion. 
I do not think anyone opposes virtue. 
Why am I saying they are the same? 
Not everyone can compete. 
Everyone is going to have to close''. 
The only province to streamline its shipyards was Quebec. 
The Canadian Vickers shipyard in Montreal was really flourishing. 
There was Marine Industries in Sorel. 
Like my parents, I have an excellent memory. 
He lost to my colleague Francois Langlois.  
I asked him how much, and he said ``$1.2 billion''. 
The Liberals promised the world and a marine policy. 
This government has been in office since 1993. What has it done? 
What are the Liberals doing? 
I want to mention something else before my time is up. 
On the contrary, these measures were taken to promote the development of that industry.  
The Government of Quebec has shown political will.  
The Minister of Finance is not setting a good example.  
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
It is nevertheless an essential one.  
On the contrary, this motion is general enough to attract broader support. 
This does indeed put the Liberal Party in a very bad spot.  
In any case, nothing should surprise us with this government. 
So we will see what comes of this later today or next week.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
I worked there for several months as an electrical draughtsman. 
There were ships everywhere. 
Shipbuilding at the time was a flourishing business.  
They are not charitable organizations. 
The CSN workers at MIL Davie have shown some backbone. 
They put their collective agreement in order. 
They want to survive and prosper, which is quite legitimate. 
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
I remind my colleagues across the way of that.  
It is in that area that I would like to address my remarks.  
The EDC reinvests to support future growth in Canadian exports. 
As the EDC operates along commercial lines, it does not provide subsidies.  
The House should not take my word for it. 
This has happened on occasion in the past. 
Overall I am convinced that EDC financing support has been competitive.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
I wonder why the WTO is not dealing with this issue. 
I ask my hon. colleague to address that point.  
Mr. Speaker, I certainly respect my colleague's comments. 
It is my understanding that in the next round this issue will be dealt with. 
Do you have a time?  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
We have to take away some of the mystery. 
This is not, therefore, where the problem lies.  
The hon. member also refers to the EDC. 
That is all very well, but allow me to cite an example. 
The funding guarantees should have been available right from the start.  
There are, therefore, certain possibilities, but the mechanisms for evaluation operate far too slowly.  
I would like to have the hon. member's reaction to this.  
We know subsidies are being provided by other countries. 
I concur with him.  
We have to work together. 
We have to stop the kind of things that put us at a disadvantage.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I have a couple of comments and questions for my hon. colleague. 
I am left somewhat confused by his position with respect to shipbuilding. 
Maybe he can help me work it out.  
I am even more confused about a particular initiative. 
I know most Liberals sometimes get things a little mixed up or confused. 
They voted on that. 
The actual wording of the amendment we put forward today is very constructive. 
I am sure motions often get put forward at Conservative Party conventions.  
The Export Development Corporation plays a major role. 
I want you to keep that in mind.  
I am sure the hon. member was addressing his remarks to the Chair.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Can anyone imagine the kind of hodgepodge we would come up with?  
That is fair enough. 
Yes, that is good. 
However, what is our strategy? 
What is our policy? 
What is it that we are trying to accomplish as a country?  
Let is look at the records of the other countries that are involved. 
They would not be 100% correct, but they would at least be in the ballpark.  
The answer would be an embarrassing no. 
That is nothing new.  
Do we have a shipbuilding strategy? 
We do not have policies. 
That is our plan. 
It is called free trade. 
We are the free traders of the world. 
We do not like things that are limiting. 
We are a free trader. 
We are the global marketplace. 
We are the free marketplace and that is our mantra. 
We cannot have strategies. 
The market is the strategy.  
No one else believes that stuff. 
If there has ever been a collection of boy scouts, we have to be it. 
We are really nice people who like to help people around the world. 
I give my Liberal friend who just spoke a great deal of credit. 
He talked about Taiwan. 
It has huge subsidies in its shipbuilding sector. 
It has huge infrastructure subsidies. 
The banks and the governments are all involved. 
Everybody knows what the strategy is, but not so in Canada.  
This would be a natural assumption for a voter to assume.  
This is a very frustrating debate. 
They do not necessarily want subsidies, but they do want a plan.  
What would that plan look like? 
It is sort of a last gasp decision.  
Is that a five year plan?  
It is good economic policy from the American's point of view. 
It is good regional politics and good national economic development. 
We do not do that. 
Again, we are the boy scouts of the world. 
We let the Americans get away with it.  
We do not take a second place to anyone. 
If we had that, we would do exceptionally well. 
We need a level playing field for our shipbuilding sector.  
However, can we have a successful life if we do not plan it? 
Can we run a successful organization if we do not have any plan? 
Can we run a successful business if we do not have a business plan? 
It is some sort of magic that we just play by ear day each day. 
Obviously that will not work.  
People have laid out the case that we need to have a strategy. 
It makes sense for a trading nation like Canada to have one.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
Did he see the same thing?  
The collective agreements are now very flexible. 
I suspect that probably everybody in the House basically agrees with the motion. 
Yes, I agree with my friends. 
We have one, but not to your liking.  
My friend says that we have one. 
We have strategies on everything. 
I do not think we could articulate it. 
I do not think anybody at this time would say that everything is okay. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
A lot of families are breaking up. 
I am really concerned about what is happening.  
They have made concessions. 
They could take the credit for that. 
It seems to me to be a very thoughtful proposal.  
Yes, I think that is possible. 
The time is right. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
I do not think anyone disputes that.  
It is simply not there. 
This is a reality for Canada and it is something that we must face. 
That is the reality of the world in which we live today.  
That is something we can all be very proud of.  
However, it still faces very tough competition from international markets. 
That is where the world of tomorrow is at.  
I think that is important too as we move into the 21st century.  
The Government of Canada is doing this. 
That we will and must continue to do.  
I will elaborate on those four points. 
The third is a refundable tax credit for shipbuilders. 
Those are significant changes and certainly we note them in parliament.  
That is simply not the case. 
The record needs to be set straight. 
That is, after all, what Canadians want.  
The federal government already provides strong support in this area to the industry. 
The global shipbuilding marketplace is restructured. 
We see that and we know that is happening throughout the world. 
That is the route we as the government are taking. 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
Yet they are the ones with shipyards in their ridings.  
With one exception, all the members from Ontario are Liberal. 
Shipbuilding is absolutely crucial to Canada. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
This is a very serious issue. 
The member from Levis has worked very hard on advancing this particular file.  
The Americans have had a regime entitled title IX which they extended in 1985. 
Previous to 1985 they were not a player in exporting ships internationally. 
Almost overnight they started to show up on the order book in the United States.  
All it came down to was the financing. 
That is my first issue. 
Why do we not actually look at something that works and adopt it?  
I have a second question for the hon. member. 
I believe Reform speaks to this as well. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That is very important to note.  
I will read from that motion: 
The implication of that would be enormous. 
The domino effect it would have on all other industries would be outrageous. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
I would be willing to help him.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Nice try but it is not a point of order.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
I would want that to continue.  
West Nova has some of the finest shipbuilders in the world. 
We have a federal government that is indifferent to the shipbuilding industry. 
It is incumbent upon the government to look at the future. 
The Jones act has not been working. 
I suppose this goes with what my colleague from Levis said.  
Those who are speaking to shipbuilding seem to be from the opposition. 
Perhaps that has an impact on the Liberal lack of interest in shipbuilding policy.  
The shipbuilding industry has proposed four measures which would immediately stimulate the shipbuilding industry. 
I encourage all members of the House to support this very important endeavour.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
There seems to be two different concepts of democracy. 
Would the member agree?  
Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague touched on something very important. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It being 6.25 p.m. it is my duty to interrupt the proceedings. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
That was the keynote of the day. 
There would be no vote but everybody would be kept fully informed. 
They are on standby for whatever NATO may deem to request of them.  
The government places expediency before democracy. 
The vote is the key issue. 
It is very important. 
That motion was defeated.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
He was referring to the Kosovo war. 
He went on to say that, nevertheless, the alliance is fighting. 
It has acted out of respect for the rights of humanity.  
I think Canadians would like to be updated on that matter.  
I was one of the refugees who ended up coming to this country in 1957. 
So it does have a great deal of personal resonance with me.  
Others will be arriving over the next few weeks.  
Those applications involve 974 people.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sorry but I do have to interrupt. 
I do apologize but I did have to interrupt.  
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.37 p.m.)
