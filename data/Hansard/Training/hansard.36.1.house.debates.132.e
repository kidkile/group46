EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 132 
Monday, October 5, 1998 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Is that implied in the question? 
Because if it is, then there is not unanimous consent. 
If he is only requesting that it be debated, then there is.  
I was going to ask the same question.  
Mr. Speaker, with respect to the request as I heard it, we have no objection. 
Perhaps the hon. member for Roberval can clarify the situation. 
All the private members' business that comes before the House should be made votable.  
No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property''. 
There are and have been so many examples. 
Those are powerful words. 
Why are we here? 
That is what Bill C-304 is all about.  
The bill of rights only provides rather feeble protection of property rights. 
Would that not be a wonderful way to celebrate the 50th anniversary?  
I anticipate that, but I am not wrong. 
That is why we need a full debate in the House. 
Not just one hour. 
That is why we need a vote in the House on this issue.  
The people of the country do not know that. 
Article 17(2) of the UN Declaration of Human Rights states: 
No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property.  
I will use the example I know best. 
Why does the government ignore these facts?  
What proof did the government provide that these firearms were dangerous? 
The decision was completely arbitrary. 
I appreciate the show of concern that a few members are showing.  
What was the extent of the government evidence to justify the prohibition? 
That demonstrates clearly how arbitrary its decision is. 
Not once have we had an answer to that. 
We do not have property rights in this country. 
Government is force and this is how it uses it. 
Those are words of our own bureaucrats, our own Department of Justice. 
The surrender initiative was unique. 
It should be considered an amnesty, rather than an expropriation. 
Here is what the CPA letter said: 
The CPA called the minister's actions ``unwise in the extreme''.  
I am afraid the hon. member's time has expired.  
Numerous statutes regulate and protect property in Canada. 
This guiding principle is mentioned on the department's Internet site.  
This right must be weighed against society's other values. 
The Canadian bill of rights has quasi-constitutional status. 
We have and need laws to govern the use of property in the public interest. 
In each of these cases and laws there are limitations on property, ownership and use. 
Everyone recognizes the need for these restrictions. 
Hunting is under provincial jurisdiction.  
Canadians currently enjoy important protection of property rights.  
We fought the election. 
The notion of property is much broader than real property. 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
At first glance, the subject appears appealing. 
The first clause proposes the following, and I quote: 
The Act is amended by adding the following after section 2: 
I am no constitutional expert. 
Take for example environmental issues. 
Such rules limit my enjoyment of my car's performance. 
Yet, careless behaviour might see me lose the use of my car. 
Imagine how disastrous this would be.  
The Firearms Registration Act is yet another example. 
I had no intention of ascribing motives to the hon. member for Yorkton-Melville. 
This is easily illustrated. 
This is the price of living in a harmonious and responsible society.  
Canadian and Quebec society will never opt for the law of the jungle.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
I have grown accustomed to not having Liberals over there to talk to. 
There was a standing committee set up on Private Members' Business. 
That continues to be.  
The member for Wild Rose says that it would still have to meet the criteria. 
That is the point. 
Right now there are criteria. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
He has been a strong and consistent advocate of his position.  
In 1690 John Locke wrote: 
However, a new government has a mandate to take different policy directions. 
The Liberals have even introduced legislation to do that. 
This is an appropriate forum for us to do so. 
To cite the Right Hon. John Diefenbaker: 
Parliament is more than procedure. 
It is the custodian of the nation's freedom.  
I express the support of the Progressive Conservative caucus for this piece of legislation. 
Bill -304 meets those requirements. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to the bill. 
That is what property rights and a bill of rights are all about. 
That is probably a breach of their property rights. 
It is certainly agreed upon out west where this is being done. 
The bill of rights and the charter certainly do not protect the provinces. 
Here again it seems to be the government of the day.  
The member for Yorkton-Melville said it clearly before but I will reiterate. 
That should clarify precisely what Bill C-304 is about. 
These are basic democratic rights. 
They involve property rights. 
These are things that all Canadians should be entitled to in this country.  
I speak in support of Bill C-304. 
Before we can ask for protection of property rights we must define property ownership rights. 
This is not a long definition. 
Sadly, this is not the case. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
I have a couple of questions for the parliamentary secretary for justice. 
The Canadian Police Association called the actions of this government unwise in the extreme. 
I would like to emphasize this next statement. 
I have a few more quotations. 
That does not exist in this country and that is a pity.  
Without property rights, no other rights are possible. 
Let us listen to those words.  
There is not consent.  
Does the hon. member have unanimous consent for the proposal that he has put forward?  
There is not consent.  
ALLOTTED DAY-PROPOSED SOCIAL UNION 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ): moved 
-new co-operation mechanisms in order to avoid conflicts or settle them equitably.  
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral:
So, there are two goals. 
Why do we want to address what is going on in the health sector today? 
Let us be very objective. 
The figures speak volumes.  
What are they this year? 
This is a drop of close to $6 billion. 
That is a big chunk of money, and the effects are serious.  
But there is an underlying cause. 
There used to be someone here who would put it very well. 
I am referring to the former leader of the Progressive Conservative Party. 
That gentleman changed his tune when he moved from the federal to the provincial scene. 
The provinces have decided to form a united front against the federal government. 
The people who pay taxes to Ottawa want that money to be returned to them. 
This is why the provinces decided on an agreement in Saskatoon.  
What is there is this agreement on social union? 
All the provinces are calling for this. 
There is unanimous consent.  
Obviously, Ottawa will always have its own interpretation of all this. 
They are asking the federal government to show some good faith. 
That is quite odd. 
Can anyone here object to that? 
One has to wonder about the real intentions of the people across the way. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
The issue we are debating is very important to us all. 
How can we do it without the federal government demanding something of the provinces?  
Nobody has indicated a willingness to go against these fundamental objectives. 
It seems to me that there should be something in there to satisfy the member.  
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
But that is another debate.  
I come from a border riding. 
Across the lake from us is Ontario. 
This government is not very responsive. 
Imagine what it would be like with interprovincial trade. 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
My comments will deal primarily with the first part of the motion, which reads: 
Everyone knows the strategy applied by the Liberals to eliminate the deficit. 
Social transfers are at their lowest in 20 years. 
By the year 2003, cuts to cash transfers will total $42 billion. 
We are not the only ones saying that. 
Let me begin with the Canadian Medical Association. 
She refused, however, to disclose the amounts required''.  
Another French CBC report, from February 25, 1998: ``Anaesthetist shortage in New Brunswick. 
All provinces have had to review their health systems. 
Their reform was necessary.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
What is happening in Quebec? 
I would like to put a question to the member. 
We are taking this debate very seriously. 
There is a problem. 
It is not the provinces that are mismanaging health. 
Regional Health and Social Service Boards have one too. 
Citizens can tell those boards and their administrators what their needs are. 
Citizens are very well represented.  
In the long run it is Canadians who are paying the price.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Mr. Speaker, earlier the member for Drummond mentioned the Canadian Medical Association. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank you for recognizing me. 
This is a priority of the labour ministers forum. 
We also have a new employability assistance program for persons with disabilities. 
And what about this assistance to help people with disabilities readapt? 
We are modernizing the country and we are building real social partnerships. 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the minister began his speech with the old refrain. 
It all sounds the same. 
One of the things the minister mentioned was fluctuations in the EI fund. 
This is simply not right, and he knows it. 
He cleverly avoided saying anything about the Saskatoon consensus. 
I would dearly love to hear what he has to say about this.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Temiscamingue. 
I have already mentioned some of the others.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I have two questions for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
He has reneged on his commitment of that partnership. 
When is he going- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Minister of Human Resources Development, a very short answer.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
But that is typical of Reform.  
The flexibility I have described is absolutely remarkable. 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
I suggest that just is not so. 
This government is dragging its feet. 
It is looking at the old way of doing things, the old way of domination. 
It is not looking at a new progressive partnership with the provinces. 
The Liberals are not showing leadership. 
We suggested that there should be limits on federal government spending power. 
We used a figure of seven provinces having over 50% of the population. 
The premiers have agreed to a lesser mark than that. 
The provinces are being very generous in agreeing to this partnership with the federal government. 
Again we are far more stringent in our presentation than the premiers. 
The premiers have agreed to something that is more generous with the federal government. 
The government talks about partnerships. 
That is missing from the federal government. 
It does not seem to be willing to be a true partner.  
My colleagues have talked about the cuts to transfer payments and that is a fact. 
That is something the other side cannot argue. 
I do not consider that to be a fair partnership. 
Where is the commitment to that partnership, to that relationship? 
I would suggest it does not exist. 
The federal government has lost the moral right to have the controls it insists on. 
It is unbelievable what our Prime Minister has said. 
The government has to change its attitude. 
I would like to caution the Bloc members. 
The process of negotiating for the best for our citizens does work. 
The problem is the players. 
I would suggest to the Bloc that there is a process. 
Canadians can work these things out within confederation. 
We can be equal partners. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, the member spoke repeatedly about partnership and leadership. 
Madam Speaker, I think the member has it all wrong. 
That is not at all what the provinces are saying.  
That is a realistic thing to ask of the federal government. 
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am afraid that is not a point of order. 
The hon. member for Nanaimo-Cowichan.  
It seems to me that this is a case of sheer economics. 
Its own fiscal house was not in order. 
There was no other recourse for the provinces. 
They knew they had to get the money from some place. 
Could the government here in Ottawa have done something to change that?  
Madam Speaker, this is more than an economics problem. 
I appreciate what people are saying. 
This is much more than an economics issue. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
A lot is happening. 
There is the Saskatoon consensus of the premiers. 
It took them that long to bring medicare into being. 
They have completely abandoned their share of financing our health care system. 
They have no moral high ground at all. 
They are in the gutter when it comes to this.  
This is very general language. 
I am very leery about this kind of language. 
I will read from the motion: 
In Meech and Charlottetown it talked about new programs. 
My concern is about the introduction of the word ``modified'' Canada wide program. 
There is some tricky language here. 
new co-operation mechanisms in order to avoid conflicts or settle them equitably.  
However that is not what this says. 
I see nothing in the motion that reflects that particular concern either.  
I think there is opportunity here for Canadians to work together. 
The premiers have already demonstrated this. 
The opposition parties are working together on this to some degree. 
It is not so. 
These people are culpable in many respects for the current situation. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, the member for Winnipeg-Transcona is an experienced member of the House. 
Would the hon. member support a return of those tax points? 
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.  
That was the beginning of the problem we have now. 
I am sorry but they just do not have it any more. 
They gave it away as a result of successive cutbacks to the CHST.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
That by definition would be money that would go to the provinces.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
This, of course, was part of our 1997 election platform. 
That is the positive side. 
It was the same for the Calgary declaration. 
It was a small starting point. 
The provinces and territories are doing the work. 
Because Liberals are not doing their job. 
It is a causality link. 
Liberals are not doing their job, so the provinces are doing it for them. 
It is not only a money issue.  
The health issue was raised this morning by my colleagues from the Bloc. 
I share their view. 
Education also is important.  
Of course, it talks about money. 
But that co-operation is not there at the moment.  
The deadline for the social union is December 31. 
The social union project appears to be in jeopardy. 
But there is the principle of clarifying federal-provincial relations.  
In effect, Ottawa is the one behind it all. 
I know, I was a mayor long enough. 
So, it is sometimes neither black nor white, but grey.  
It is said that health care falls under provincial jurisdiction. 
And what about the granting councils? 
Do they come under federal or provincial jurisdiction?  
Maybe that is how we should look at it. 
I am not sure we really understand what it actually means. 
But it seems now that it is not quite that simple. 
This is not really opting out, except administratively. 
That is not our position. 
I do not have a problem with that.  
Should it be an administrative opting out? 
Sure, why not, as long as we abide by the rules. 
It is nonetheless important.  
Of course we do not like conflicts. 
That is why we need well established rules.  
Some people seem to have a problem with that. 
Everybody agrees on this.  
In conclusion, I would like to stress the fact that the provinces must persevere. 
Of course, she had to understand what was going on at the provincial level. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Everywhere, the consequences of this crisis have been enormous. 
That is what the Prime Minister bragged about last summer. 
They used $20 billion to pay back part of the debt.  
To understand the situation, one has to know who the Canadian debtholders are. 
What did they do? 
In August, the Canadian dollar dived to an all-time low. 
We will then have, according to the technical definition, a recession.  
We are not asking him to fall back into the same bad habits. 
What is the greatest threat? 
What could the government do to stimulate the economy? 
We are asking for three things. 
Spending on social programs can also result in economic growth.  
Nobody knows where the Bank of Canada is going anymore. 
Gordon Thiessen told us ``We are independent from the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank''. 
This does not hold true anymore. 
A better way to manage the monetary policy would have been to wait and see. 
He has put us in an uncertain situation. 
He is putting the financial markets in a situation where we expect the worst. 
Things may not be at their worst, but they could certainly be better. 
We in Canada are just keeping our heads above water.  
Why is it important to talk about debt management? 
Because the government is lying through its teeth. 
We will use the contingency reserve.  
It amounts to $3 billion a year. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, today is world teachers day. 
Once again, I thank teachers everywhere in Canada.  
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Along the way more than $260,000 was raised in support of this worthy cause.  
Often these efforts go unnoticed. 
Congratulations to the Tour de Rock as an example to us all. 
Their hard work is an inspiration in the fight against cancer.  
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
Teachers today are confronted with some of the greatest challenges they have ever faced. 
Education is an investment in the future of individuals and societies.  
I wish to commend teachers for their valuable work.  
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Fanshawe, Lib.):
Member spoke in Gaelic] 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
The memory of that terrible incident tears at our hearts. 
Mrs. Claudette Bradshaw (Moncton-Riverview-Dieppe, Lib.):
They will be building a duplex for two families to enjoy. 
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, October 5 is World Teachers Day. 
RIGHT HONOURABLE ELLEN FAIRCLOUGH 
Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):
On June 21, 1957 she became Canada's first woman cabinet minister. 
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
Pilot sales are unenforceable and unmanageable. 
They noted that aboriginal and non-aboriginal people alike are suffering.  
Native fishermen demanded that the minister put a stop to the pilot sales program. 
Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam, Lib.):
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, once again Nova Scotia has been visited by an air tragedy.  
A month ago it was Swissair Flight 111. 
They were angels of mercy. 
It is very sad. 
The CH133 helicopters are old. 
Experts say that these copters are now too risky to fly.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
We were quickly able to transform a disaster into a catalyst for economic growth. 
And that is just what the people of Quebec have done.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
This is big brother big time. 
No wonder Reformers and Conservatives like their guns. 
In their world they need them.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
In the republic of Yugoslavia both of these basic principles are being violated daily. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
We will fly only aircraft that is certified as being safe to be used.  
We will continue to provide Canadians with that service.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the minister talks about life threatening conditions. 
Obviously these helicopters do pose a life threatening situation for the crew. 
The Labradors are grounded. 
The Hercules have a limited capacity.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
There are many reasons aircraft crash. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Why wait for the subpoena? 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the commission has not asked the Prime Minister to appear. 
Let the commission do its work. 
This is what the protesters want. 
Let the hearings take place in an active and thorough atmosphere. 
Why does the hon. member not want to support that sensible approach?  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
I think the Canadian public is looking forward to that. 
I would like the Deputy Prime Minister to answer my question for a change. 
Why will the Prime Minister evade this? 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Let us allow the commission do its work. 
Let the work continue. 
Let us see what happens as a result.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I think the figures are pretty good. 
Two hundred thousand new jobs have been created since the beginning of the year. 
Our interest rates are low. 
There is no inflation. 
We have a balanced budget.  
We are in a good position to ward off the effects of the international crisis. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
We are doing very well indeed, Mr. Speaker. 
We are doing very well.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, one thing is certain. 
Immediate tax cuts would have no short term effect on the economy. 
It is nothing but bunk coming from the Bloc.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
My question is for the Acting Prime Minister. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we will certainly take that as representation from the hon. member. 
We are in the middle of a debate among Canadians. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the solicitor general. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Why did he then ignore his own advice?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
This is a tragedy.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
As soon as we can get the results, the better.  
If the family members can make that available, that could be quite helpful. 
Meanwhile, there is assistance being provided to the families. 
There are people in touch with them on a daily basis. 
We want to support them in their time of grieving.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Will this government be accepting this generous offer?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the RCMP in British Columbia is facing a financial crisis.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
That is essentially what is happening in British Columbia.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, let us talk about essential services. 
Criminals do not operate on a 37.5 hour work week. 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will soon receive the report from Statistics Canada. 
The hon. member referred to a draft of that report. 
We will have to check the accuracy of that draft.  
We are monitoring the situation very closely. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is unbelievable. 
The hon. member does not even know how the employment insurance system works.  
That system was never intended for independent workers. 
But that was understood from the start. 
This is what we have to look at.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the government should get its story straight on the economy. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the government obeys the law. 
As we said earlier, we are in the middle of a debate. 
Certainly Canadians want to see reinvestment in health care. 
They want to see personal income tax reduction. 
Canadians may want to see continued cuts to EI. 
We have cut $7 billion from EI over the years. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the only debate going on is in the member's head. 
This is absolutely incredible. 
How did that happen?  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member talks about bungling the economy. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The member for Rosemont.  
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
And they will get their own back.  
If this is not exclusion, what is it?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this government talks about a debate. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
It is about making choices.  
I will use the hon. member's terms. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
This is a province that is represented by Liberal members of parliament.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the acting Prime Minister.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is quite the contrary. 
There has been a lot of compliance with these requests for information. 
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the minister of public works.  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
I thank all members on both sides of the House for their co-operation. 
The hon. member for Souris-Moose Mountain.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the Minister of Transport.  
The CN has admitted to some of the blame. 
The CPR is partly to blame. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
It is subject to appeal. 
The hon. member for Cypress Hills-Grasslands.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
It is being destroyed especially in Saskatchewan where it is already a shambles. 
The hon. Minister of Transport.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
We will be having this debate in the coming months. 
We will see what he recommends in dealing with some of these serious issues.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Our justice system depends upon the scrupulous impartiality of the solicitor general. 
He is one of the senior law officers of the land.  
Is it a proper role for the solicitor general to cover for the Prime Minister? 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
We will get to the truth. 
The public complaints commission is doing its investigation. 
I wish hon. members would let it do its job.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. 
Why the double standard?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
We want them to be carried out thoroughly and effectively.  
Let them continue and let us see what the result will be.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
The hon. member for South Surrey-White Rock-Langley.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Only the Prime Minister and his federal Liberals oppose this initiative.  
I ask the Deputy Prime Minister why the government is doing less.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Why does not the Reform want to support- 
The hon. member for Temiscamingue.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Agriculture.  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
We had an excellent meeting with the industry on Friday morning. 
I continue to look forward to a very good resolution of this issue.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the solicitor general.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
That process has to be allowed to get to the truth. 
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the President of the Treasury Board.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
This is a rather odd question.  
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
That is contrary to our rules.  
He might explain why this election has no provision for re-election. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  
For 35 years the Volvo assembly plant has been in Halifax. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, first of all the plant is not moving to Mexico.  
Second, it has nothing to do with Bill C-11.  
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale, Lib.):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
This is a matter of utmost priority for our government.

Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
Is the hon. member for Delta-South Richmond rising on this question?  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
As yet I have not received a response to Question No. 91. 
It is of some significance and importance to me. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Sometimes people never received answers. 
We have a bureaucracy over there the size of the Titanic. 
Shall the remaining questions stand?  
REQUEST FOR EMERGENCY DEBATE 
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
The incomes of Canadian farmers are in steep and rapid decline. 
Canadian farmers do not receive subsidies like European and American farmers receive from their governments.  
ALLOTTED DAY-SOCIAL UNION PROJECT 
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
That is the old way of looking at things. 
This is not the way we are proceeding today.  
This is after all what Canadians have asked us to do. 
Perhaps I should not be surprised.  
First, what is Canada's social union? 
It means collaboration and it means solidarity. 
It distinguishes us from any other nation in the world. 
We are very proud of what this means for us as a country. 
How did we get to this social union? 
It was not by sheer luck or by happenstance. 
We built it together piece by piece. 
Look at Quebec and its innovative family policies for example. 
Programs help people get back into the labour force. 
We have a lot to share and a lot to learn one from the other.  
Building the social union then was not an easy process. 
This is true just as much today as it ever was.  
There are shared responsibilities as well. 
They cannot contest it so they simply do not discuss it.  
This is a good thing. 
This would lead to paralysis. 
We live in an increasingly interdependent world. 
Today's social and economic policies intersect like they never have before. 
This is a social and an economic issue.  
What is the Government of Canada looking for? 
Where are we in negotiations to develop a social union framework agreement?  
The Government of Canada has three objectives. 
The second is to ensure that governments are working collaboratively on the social union. 
The third is to make governments more accountable to Canadians for the results achieved.  
These principles include access to comparable basic services. 
There is the principle of flexibility. 
Our social union cannot mean uniformity. 
It cannot mean one level of government dictating to another.  
In short, this is the genius of the Canadian federation.  
Canada is the envy of the world. 
The federal government remains committed to act in the best interests of all Canadians.  
They are worried about child poverty. 
They are worried about the employment prospects facing Canadian youth in an uncertain global economy. 
They are worried about the well-being of elderly Canadians.  
The time has come to stop playing politics with these concerns. 
Quite frankly, it must stop.  
It obliges governments to always put the interests of Canadians first.  
Canadians want to know that what we are doing is working. 
They want to see evidence that our social programs and services are making a difference. 
This requires public reporting on outcomes. 
It does not have to be more complicated than that. 
The social union is not something we can cut up and divide. 
It is the very foundation of our society and we must build on it together.  
So what is the hon. member hoping to achieve by his motion? 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
He has served 15 times as a pallbearer. 
He was paid $22 each time.  
What has become of his sense of social equity?  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite for his question.  
Perhaps the hon. member is disconnected. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
There is a question I would like to ask him in terms of priorities.  
I waited for approximately four and a half weeks before I could have my operation. 
It is really hectic out there.  
I have been in the homes of grassroots natives all across the country. 
I would like to know where is the accountability for all of this. 
Why are we having all these problems? 
Why are there so many homeless on the streets of Toronto? 
Why are there so many in Calgary? 
Why is this all going on if the government is doing such a wonderful job? 
To me, it has not done anything. 
I would like this member to explain. 
Where are the priorities?  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite for his question. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
It is the Liberal government that has destroyed the social safety net in the country.  
He talked about his concern for poor children. 
I would like him to see the people who are on the street. 
I would like him to see the kids whose parents are unemployed.  
What does the member have to say about that?  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite for the question. 
I can say to her that we as a government have not destroyed. 
It really makes no sense.  
That is something we can be enormously proud of.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Let us take, for example, the student loans and bursaries program. 
It is the best in Canada. 
There will be two administration systems. 
We do not want this kind of action. 
Take the home care program for example. 
It is this leeway the provincial premiers agreed on in Saskatoon.  
Last weekend, the premiers met with the federal spokesperson. 
It would no longer hold everything up.  
There is no one solution.  
This program has been tremendously successful. 
It is now available for all three and four year olds. 
This will make good day care available.  
The consensus contains a number of dynamic, forward-looking components. 
I mentioned the right to opt out will full compensation. 
This is a fundamental issue. 
This is what cemented the consensus. 
The only thing missing now is the federal government. 
It is very clear in our minds. 
It is the goal we are pursuing. 
They will do it globally when they opt for sovereignty. 
The problem is the same throughout Canada.  
Certain decisions were made in order to fight the deficit. 
The other decision was to cut transfer payments. 
We have tests for these things.  
This EI program is a bad choice for the future. 
Those are your figures. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
They are now running into this problem. 
Each province may have its own needs and priorities. 
In conclusion, there are two issues here. 
That concludes my speech. 
I urge the Liberal majority in particular to pay attention. 
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
The truth of matter is that Canada is the envy of the world. 
What are the reasons for this envy and respect? 
The first is the exceptional quality of our social programs. 
Let us take a minute just to get back to basics. 
It sounds so simple.  
Canada is a federation. 
The importance of co-operative federalism cannot be overstated. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
Unemployment insurance quickly became employment insurance. 
You will agree with me that such behaviour certainly helps drive his point home.  
I find this totally unfair.  
It is an important debate. 
None of us would deny that. 
Therefore, I simply conclude by encouraging the hon. member to partake in this debate.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Let me assure the hon. member that those discussions are going very well. 
I was heartened by the discussion on Friday.  
Everybody needs to remember what that objective is. 
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I appreciate having the opportunity to speak to the opposition motion. 
This is fact, not partisan rhetoric.  
This is not an abstract issue. 
The federal government also made cuts in transfers to the provinces. 
There is not the option of cutting transfers to the provinces.  
What is a tax point transfer? 
In 1977 these tax points amounted to about $3 billion in revenues. 
Today they are worth about $12 billion. 
Quite simply the opposition motion does not tell the whole story. 
I would like to put it in some perspective. 
What are the priorities of provincial governments?  
Can we as a federal government balance the federal budget? 
The answer is yes. 
In fact we have already done that. 
Clearly the answer is yes, and we have already done that. 
The answer is yes. 
Can we as a federal government force the provinces to balance their budgets? 
Some have and some have not.  
The answer to these questions are quite revealing. 
The record of the federal government speaks for itself. 
In fact the opposite is true. 
Our fiscal turnaround has meant significantly lower interest rates for all governments. 
That helps business growth and tax revenues. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
That is what the Liberal government has abandoned.  
Those questions are coming from the UN and are being directed to the Canadian government. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
That is a fact. 
And the consequences can now be seen from coast to coast.  
It is time for a change.  
Madam Speaker, I would not agree. 
The provinces were not brought to their knees. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Our new Canada act introduced these concepts earlier this year. 
It balances existing powers, strengthening the federal and provincial governments in several key areas.  
Therefore I will be voting to support this motion.  
This has completely destabilized the social safety net. 
Our health care is suffering. 
Patients have even died due to lack of adequate equipment and services. 
It is important to emphasize that the Liberals balanced the budget by raising taxes. 
They did it on the backs of Canadian taxpayers. 
I warn the Liberals that Canadians will not stand for that.  
Surrey Memorial Hospital is supposed to be providing hospital services for our community. 
Surrey is probably the fastest growing city in Canada. 
We do not have a health care system in Canada. 
We have a sickness care system. 
This is completely unacceptable. 
No one is free to disagree with the Prime Minister. 
If you do, you will get fired or pepper sprayed.  
No room for pepper spray here. 
I presume the Prime Minister will not be able to support this one. 
This is a well-known legal tool used to reduce levels of conflict. 
Arbitration can protect both sides in a dispute.  
I will be happy to support this motion. 
Now the Bloc has shown some interest in us.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
I encourage him to continue in that direction.  
There are a couple of issues I think we should explore a little further. 
There seems to be a borrowing of ideas by the Liberal Party in particular. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the wonderful question.  
The new Canada act is a draft. 
It is there for public consultation. 
I do not expect that from the Prime Minister of Canada. 
Probably the prime minister of Indonesia could make that kind of comment. 
It is very arrogant and is not acceptable in our society.  
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
Does the member really understand all this?  
It affects health care and education in our provinces. 
The provincial governments and the municipal governments are under pressure.  
How long is the waiting period? 
How many hospital beds are closing? 
The member talked about balancing the budget and eliminating the deficit. 
Anyone can balance the budget. 
We are paying higher taxes than the Americans south of the border. 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
It has not been able to live up to that promise.  
Many Canadians viewed this as a fair exchange. 
This system is no longer working the way it was supposed to. 
When the first ministers get together defers to old style political bullying. 
The Prime Minister wants to call the shots without making a fair contribution.  
The problem is not finding the waste. 
Why has it once again interfered with provincial jurisdiction?  
This would be truly revolutionary in Canadian politics.  
This is very important. 
Canadians are not prepared to accept extreme regional disparity. 
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
That is $15 billion worth of cuts in social programs. 
I think the member is talking through his hat.  
If I can take a moment to clarify our position. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
I agree with him totally. 
That is what I say. 
I agree with the hon. member that it is a terrible thing.  
There still remains a problem of flexibility that comes with this argument of tax points. 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
I will make a few remarks on the federal government and its initiative.  
We have clearly shown Canadians that we are not interested in turf wars. 
Madam Speaker, I am sorry. 
Canadians are fed up with federal-provincial bickering. 
Even more important, they yield concrete results. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
I listened very carefully to what he had to say about the social union. 
He made it sound like a very positive affair. 
I presume they have consulted with their people.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I begin by observing that politicians are the representatives of the people. 
This is democracy in action.  
In fact they become even more inefficient.  
The money involved is big. 
It amounts annually for hospitals alone from government sources to $17 billion a year. 
That is a lot of money.  
There is a serious omission here.  
It is case law.  
This is a case of nepotism.  
The reason is that there are no standards. 
Hospitals do not have to issue tenders. 
They can do it however they want, and indeed this happens. 
Gifts are received by people in the business of purchasing for hospitals. 
This is all because of a lack of transparency.  
They should have been cutting the fat out of their bureaucracies. 
That would be an important first step.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I will be brief.  
This forms a whole. 
My colleague said earlier that we cannot do away with leadership. 
Madam Speaker, we are all in the same boat. 
We must work together on that boat. 
In my opinion, the federal government must show leadership in this matter.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
He does not know his history and he does not respect the constitution. 
In the constitution, we in Quebec had rights as a people. 
I would like him to think about that.  
I do not doubt that for an instant.  
However, as Canadians we must look to the entire country. 
This is federal money we are talking about. 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
I would like to reread the first paragraph: 
I will deal with those components later.  
What has the Liberal government done since it took office? 
The first cut was on needs.  
These are the people who have been hurt, and who are still hurting. 
But the motion goes further. 
-re-establishment of-contributions 
Everyone should have no problem agreeing with that wording.  
This right for a province to opt out with full compensation is absolutely fundamental. 
I mentioned that Quebec made one concession. 
This is something Quebec cannot give up.  
I also know some of them wanted to reach out to Quebec. 
We have no choice but to recognize this right. 
Some universities have been left seriously short of funds.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
If policies could be integrated, they would be more effective. 
Canadian federalism today certainly lacks clarity. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
It would be very interesting to hear the kind of discussion that has taken place.  
I would like to make a couple of observations to begin. 
There is no getting away from that reality.  
I have heard cabinet ministers say that today.  
The reality is something different. 
For example it says: 
We are all waiting to hear that answer. 
It goes on to ask another question: 
Please-explain how this unacceptable situation has been allowed to occur.  
This is not me asking the question. 
It asks another of its 81 questions of the Canadian government: 
-At what point would the government consider homelessness in Canada to constitute a national emergency?  
I know the answer to that question. 
There are people living on the street. 
They want the federal government to butt out.  
What did these groups have to say? 
To quote from their statement to that conference in Saskatoon, they said: 
The social union has already undergone significant change. 
They went on to say in their statement: 
That is a very significant statement which has come from these groups. 
We have to be very careful. 
What does that mean exactly? 
What does a modified program mean? 
In my riding people are literally on the street. 
There is no question the impact has been devastating.  
We are at a very critical point. 
We should make job creation a priority. 
We should not abandon the unemployed by cutting back on UI benefits. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
You cannot impose the same norm across the board.  
This seems great and it is for the rest of Canada, but not for Quebec. 
Our situation is different. 
These millennium scholarships deal with a problem we do not have. 
I thank the member for his thoughtful question. 
I would not agree with that opinion.  
I agree that there is huge diversity in this country. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The time allotted to debate on the motion before the House has expired.  
(The House adjourned at 6.30 p.m.)
