The House met at 11 a.m. 
RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
There is no question that change goes hand and hand with uncertainty. 
But change goes hand in hand with new opportunities.  
We have a solid foundation to build on. 
But having such assets is not enough. 
We have to mobilize our resources toward a clear objective of being the best. 
The second theme is realizing our international potential. 
The third theme is investing in innovation and knowledge. 
Part of their advice was: 
We are taking this advice to heart. 
We will increase the participation of Canadians in the new economy.  
Supporting innovative companies and building knowledge infrastucture is not enough in itself. 
The transition to the new economy is not automatic. 
Canada will prosper in the global knowledge based economy. 
We see Canadians connected to other Canadians. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
What is his government going to do? 
What is he going to do? 
I am not quite as pessimistic as he.  
Second, we have certainly experienced quite a few difficulties over a period of time. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
We support his cause.  
I would ask him to arouse our sympathy a little more. 
I have two questions for him. 
The Hon. John Manley:
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
However, I think he embellishes the picture. 
It is changing for Canada and for all other nations of the world. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
On the subject of agriculture, it is one of Canada's best export earners. 
Here again a national strategy is required. 
It began under the Tories and has been continued by the Liberals. 
We are going backwards in our quest for social justice and fairness. 
This regression is aided and abetted by the false start program of the Reform Party.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We will resume with questions and comments.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
I would like to know if they agree with that.  
Mr. Speaker, I do not think this caucus would oppose that in any way. 
I appreciate that there is a reasonable delegation from the member's party also.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Does his Party recognize the existence of a Quebec people? 
We in Quebec believe this is not enough.  
Even some federalist Liberal organizers say it is an empty shell. 
There is really no need for us to delve into that further at this time.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The amendment moved by the hon. member for Palliser is in order.  
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Maybe some time we should stop and think about how they live. 
Many of us here have never been in that situation. 
Some know what it is like to live in shelters for battered women. 
Not only does it affect workers. 
I am one who knows what it is to be a seasonal worker.  
This is from the ex MP for Beausejour, the prime minister himself.  
It gives me great pleasure to tell you all about it.  
These are the people who fought for our country during the Second World War. 
The present government shows absolutely no respect for our senior citizens.  
They even closed employment centres like the one in Bouctouche. 
We must start trying to understand the situation in which rural communities find themselves. 
In our region, jobs are not found on every street corner.  
Let us see what Sackville received from the Liberals. 
We no longer have an animal pathology lab. 
Approximately 60 employees lost their jobs at Maritime Atlantic. 
The armouries is on the way out. 
It has been absolutely ignored in every way imaginable.  
In New Brunswick we are getting job creation at $6.25 an hour. 
I have talked to those people. 
Now the Liberals are wondering why there are so many poor families.  
Liberals should be ashamed. 
We have the HST instead. 
Again it attacks low income families. 
When will it stop? 
The young people graduating from high school have lost all hope in post-secondary education.  
All the cuts came with an extremely high price. 
People are losing their jobs. 
Families cannot take that stress any longer. 
The throne speech mentioned a deep concern for aboriginal issues. 
Let us not forget we got one thing: we got a senator.  
If members do not believe me they can ask the banks.  
The pain has to stop.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
That is why I believe strongly that we should keep our country together.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
I have a very short and succinct question to ask. 
She mentioned in her speech the little phrase ``paying off the deficit''. 
That is a total misnomer. 
There is no such thing as paying off the deficit. 
The deficit is an amount of money that one borrows. 
At best one can reduce the amount that one is borrowing.  
There is a tremendous contradiction in the NDP platform. 
Did any banks pay on that deficit? 
Did any of the very wealthy pay on that deficit? 
He should check with the people who cannot feed their children any more.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
The deficit is the amount of money which is being borrowed.  
The member is confusing it with the reference to debt. 
The fact is as long as there is any deficit the debt will increase.  
Believe me, at this point no one is worried about that.  
What I am worried about- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
As such, the opportunity to participate in this Parliament is an historic occasion. 
I will spare no effort to meet the challenges it will present.  
He represented the riding from 1935 to 1945. 
The workforce in Barrie is well educated, highly skilled and diversified. 
This was what my constituents had accepted as a very real priority. 
The delivery of the Canada Health Act is vital. 
The road to that peace is through justice. 
I came to Parliament to help keep this country together.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
This is fine rhetoric, but nothing concrete is ever done. 
This is very short. 
Aboriginal peoples are recognized. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Chair apologizes to the hon. member for Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford. 
I listened carefully and found it a little meandering. 
They have been joined by our government in moving forward.  
We have to reach across those perhaps slanted views. 
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
In 1929 I was born in the Dominican Republic to British parents. 
In other words, it seems that the ``two solitudes'' of Hugh McLellen are still evident. 
We must ensure that all Canadians can benefit from this economic success. 
We must not leave anyone behind.  
The people of Oxford are taking full advantage of the CAP program. 
Oxford County has been my home for over 40 years. 
It is where I helped raise a family and where my heart is. 
Our work in this place over the next four years will be difficult. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
How can an agreement, which I feel is impossible, ever be reached? 
Simplification and oversimplification are things we have to guard against. 
He is quite right. 
It was a very narrow defeat. 
Therefore I would encourage the hon. member not to take it as the final word. 
That is what we are here to do, to work toward a solution.  
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
I would first like to congratulate you, Mr. Speaker, on your position as Acting Speaker. 
This is clearly difficult for Canadians.  
The government talks a lot about the new economy but understands little of it. 
How do we encourage these domestic and foreign workers to choose Canada? 
We know that taxes are too high in this country. 
Taxes in Canada now account for almost 40 percent of GDP. 
This mandate holds little hope for tax relief. 
Furthermore only the party to which I belong is calling for immediate tax cuts. 
We on the other hand choose to speak about priorities. 
The Speech from the Throne does little to promote growth in employment. 
This is typical of the hypocrisy of this government. 
Government programs and government money do not do this. 
The federal government however chooses to view everything in terms of revenue and expenditures.  
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
The study was done by the Boston Consulting Group. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question from my colleague.  
I think we all realise we are in a very competitive world today. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
I find interesting some of the statements the member for Markham made. 
The member for Markham indicates that sacrifices have been made to eliminate the deficit. 
He is referring to the government side.  
The member for Markham made reference to that.  
The time for questions and comments has expired. 
It is open for debate and discussion. 
What does the member for Markham really consider to be a sacrifice?  
There has been a benefit of $17 billion in taxes from free trade.  
Many people have had to cut costs. 
Corporations have had to cut costs. 
There are two things that we can do.  
I am not so sure that the government has done that.  
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
I thank the people of Burin-St. 
Their incomes will not be increased by one cent. 
I take exception to that.  
They are just not getting enough hours of home care. 
I look forward to that. 
I come from Atlantic Canada. 
I am really not sure that the prime minister received the message. 
If he did, he is ignoring the message. 
We need quick action in Atlantic Canada. 
Successive federal governments have mismanaged our most important resource in Atlantic Canada, our fishery.  
Many of them will go out of business if something is not done very soon. 
There are some very serious problems that need to be addressed. 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member for Burin-St. 
George's, a Newfoundland riding.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question.  
I remember Meech Lake very well. 
We took opposing positions in the Meech Lake debate. 
That is the question I ask myself. 
If both are the same, then why are we changing the wording? 
That is my own personal thoughts on it. 
I thank the hon. member for his question and that is my answer.  
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. member for Burin-St. 
The first was that they promised to destroy the marketing boards for the farmers. 
The second promise was to do away with the department of agriculture.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her question.  
I know her question is a serious one on agriculture. 
She has the same concern with agriculture as I have about fish. 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
I also want to congratulate our Speaker. 
I am thinking of our unemployed, our seniors, our disadvantaged families. 
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
I would like to begin by congratulating my hon. colleague on his speech. 
I look forward with great pleasure to my colleague's reply to this question.  
It is the only question they have asked since the beginning- 
You still haven't replied.  
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau: -the most obsessive. 
These people are crawling backwards across the Plains of Abraham. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I would ask hon. members to keep their questions and responses short.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Since this morning, we have been hearing all sorts of things. 
The hon. member referred to distinct realities in the case of Quebec, etc. 
Not a treaty between typical, unique or distinct societies, or whatever else. 
Later, Jean Lesage spoke of two founding peoples.  
Mr. Speaker, I am not the type of person who engages in semantics. 
People want to know what we will do for them in the future.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask our colleague a question.  
You talked about that in the past as a union organizer. 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Let us compare their record to ours. 
We will and our country's finances are currently in the best position in decades.  
We can always point to the positive results of records in the 35th Parliament. 
Exports have increased to records never before imagined. 
The people of my riding are optimistic again. 
The article continues by saying that Guelph-Wellington: 
Luiz employs more than 30 people and works hard to succeed. 
Another example is former Guelph Liberal member of Parliament, Jim Schroder. 
There are more examples. 
We have always appreciated and comprehended the present while looking forward to the future. 
We have always worked with Canadians to find solutions to our problems.  
The government will face many challenges in the 36th Parliament. 
We must still eliminate the deficit spending and we must still tackle an enormous debt. 
I look forward to those challenges. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
The merchant navy veterans have never been treated equally. 
They came to me and asked for help. 
There are only 2,100 of them left out of the 12,000.  
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question.  
We believe that we can solve the problem.  
I share the member's concern. 
But I do share the member's concerns.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
He even went on to add: ``Everyone does''.  
So there are two questions:
First and foremost they are Canadians and Quebeckers. 
They are a part of Canada.  
They enjoy the use of national defence.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
It is with great delight that I see you there.  
I am honoured to have the opportunity to serve them for another term.  
Most Canadians know that Canada is a wonderful country to live in. 
But will these resolutions make any difference? 
The Bloc Quebecois says no. 
The Parti Quebecois government also says no. 
Was the senator reflecting the mood of British Columbians? 
I believe she was.  
I will not ask the House just to believe what I think. 
The Vancouver Sun had 1,010 responses to these questions. 
The senator was just reflecting the extreme frustration that British Columbians feel. 
The task ahead does have some bright spots. 
In the Senate there are 104 senators. 
We are about to enter the 21st century. 
It is time to bring representation up to date.  
Thus British Columbia's under-representation in this House would be even more significant. 
Did they really think we were that stupid?  
It finally acknowledged that British Columbia is unique from the prairie provinces.  
B.C. is equally unrepresented in this House. 
I do not think so. 
What that means is today we have six provinces that have this constitutional protection. 
Six provinces have an average of 73,900 people per MP. 
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
I am very disheartened by her tact today.  
Colleagues, I remind all of you to please address your remarks to the Chair.  
It being almost 2 p.m., we will now proceed to Statements by Members.  
Ms. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
I would like to recognize the contribution of Hybrid Turkeys to Kitchener. 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
It was silent on conditional sentencing. 
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
Today Sir John A. Macdonald would be turning in his grave. 
Long live a strong and united Canada.  
Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne-Blainville, BQ):
Senator Carney's statements are part of a far broader movement. 
Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma-Manitoulin, Lib.):
Canada's economy is producing impressive employment growth. 
This is particularly true for rural Canada.  
Our government has demonstrated its commitment to responsible economic management. 
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
PRESENCE IN THE GALLERY 
My colleagues, you will note that Mr. Atom Egoyan is here with us today. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Democracy was under strain 
For some it was a struggle 
To keep those principles alive.  
Made it tough to co-operate 
With just one point of view heard 
The results were great.  
It really seemed a fraud.  
This session could be different 
More difficult you see 
To ram bad legislation 
Down the throats of you and me.  
Fewer attempts at closure 
To stifle honest debate 
And well thought legislation 
Wouldn't that be great!  
This 36th sitting of the House 
It really could be choice 
An opportunity once more 
To listen to the voice 
Of those who chose to send us here 
Who expect us to deliver 
More than MP trained seals 
Stop making shady deals 
Reform is pushing for improved democracy 
And we're snapping at your heels!  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
POLICE AND PEACE OFFICERS 
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Quebecers are upset by the attitude of the separatists. 
The priority of all Quebecers is to get the economy moving once again. 
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
Kevin Machell is still at large.  
Mrs. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
Philanthropy of this type is rare and greatly appreciated. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
SEARCH AND RESCUE HELICOPTERS 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Party politics have no place in the managing of our Canadian forces.  
My colleagues, I want to thank you very much for last week. 
With this I am going to recognize the hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
My question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Secession, no, no and no.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
What we are calling for is a little respect from the government.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
My question was quite clear. 
Mr. Speaker, the Calgary declaration was very well received in Quebec. 
I can see how this would concern the Bloc leader.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
We read the papers and we see- 
He badly misinterprets it.  
My question for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is this:
No, Mr. Speaker, the member has it all wrong.  
I know of no other province that does not have other demands. 
They all have demands for improvement. 
This country offers the best standard of living in the world. 
And we will continue to do so, regardless of the member.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Does the minister realize this?  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the Environment.  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
My question is for the Minister of the Environment. 
Will the environment minister commit to this today?  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
No, Mr. Speaker, I will not be committing to that today in the House.  
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the health minister.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is now for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We also have a foreign policy, and social responsibilities.  
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. minister. 
The member for Athabasca has the floor.  
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
The hon. gentleman will know that there are a number of players. 
The Government of Canada is only one of several that are participating.  
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
It is a major engine of economic growth, one we intend to promote.  
I am working with my provincial colleagues to continue that momentum.  
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the President of the Treasury Board.  
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Revenue.  
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for his question. 
We abide by that code as well.  
The hon. member for Calgary Southeast 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, frankly I am shocked at that answer. 
This is a simple question. 
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
It surprised a few on that side of the House. 
The members of the Reform did not support those items- 
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
That was not a political decision. 
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
The minister promised us a full report here in the House. 
What has he found about his officials?  
Was the word ``lied'' used in the hon. member's question? 
I did not hear it. 
Would the hon. member be kind enough to rephrase the question?  
Mr. Speaker, Health Canada officials covered up the truth.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member can use any words he chooses. 
Another example of all kinds of noise and fury.  
We will not be involved in any smear campaigns. 
We are going to work to improve medicare in this country and make sure- 
The hon. member for Macleod.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
The fact of the matter is permission must be sought of the individual. 
The minister has a choice opportunity here. 
Which will it be?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We are going to have a public consultation and we are freezing further cuts. 
That is the best way to respond.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Solicitor General.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question concerns the safety of Montreal's airports.  
My question is for the Minister of Transport. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
There are also major renovations under way at Dorval.  
The RCMP will stay at Dorval and Mirabel.  
SUPREME COURT OF CANADA 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
These comments are unheard of and ground breaking. 
The justices themselves are asking for reform.  
My question is for the Minister of Justice. 
Or will it continue on making its appointments in secret and behind closed doors?  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.  
I will take that under advisement.  
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the Environment.  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
We have received a report from the panel and are reviewing its recommendations.  
The hon. member for Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
The government's own departments have drawn concern to this.  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
We are doing everything to make sure those concerns are addressed.  
Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):
Can the Minister of Industry indicate how the government intends to go about this?  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
The hon. member for West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, one question.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
Since April 16, 1996, the federal government has been withdrawing from policing airports. 
The RCMP has been gradually pulling out everywhere in Canada, except in Quebec. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I believe I answered this question in full earlier. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the question. 
No decision has been made yet. 
We hope to have that decision- 
The hon. member for Saint John.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport. 
Ports Canada police officers are specialists in their field. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
We put this regime in place.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the justice minister. 
There was not one word about any of that stuff in the throne speech.  
What happened to all that tough talk? 
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I respond to that question.  
We have begun our consultations- 
GOODS AND SERVICES TAX 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Finance. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
In fact, Quebec did not lose money.  
Let me just quote some figures. 
PEOPLE'S TAX FORM ACT 
In fact it addresses the very issue. 
ACCESS TO INFORMATION ACT 
ACCESS TO INFORMATION ACT 
Under today's system the government does not have to do this.  
The government only releases the results of public opinion polls when it wants to. 
This is a blatant disregard for the rights of taxpayers. 
Sixty per cent of these relationships involve children. 
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton, Lib.):
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
I present this petition on behalf of my constituents.  
Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):
Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE 
RESUMPTION OF DEBATE ON ADDRESS IN REPLY 
There being none, we will resume debate.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
I am particularly honoured and proud to have been given this task.  
Their leadership will be sadly missed.  
This occasion was particularly significant to me as a newly appointed minister. 
It undermines the very quality of life in our neighbourhoods.  
We have made solid gains.  
Some offenders must be imprisoned and in some cases for lengthy periods of time. 
This is not debatable in order to protect the public. 
The Speech from the Throne speaks to the issue of alternatives. 
These include aboriginal communities. 
Another focus of our crime prevention activities involves young people. 
I spoke earlier of the need for the government to provide leadership in policing. 
As far as we are concerned it is an obligation. 
Other federal ministers will also attend. 
The deliberations will be conducted in a true spirit of partnership, federally, provincially and interprovincially. 
The Atlantic vision conference plays quite largely in making this possible.  
This will be a collaborative exercise, one which I understand very well. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
I can tell the minister, man to man, that it does not.  
I have had people visit my office who have been fearful for their lives. 
That was a condition of the sentence. 
My constituents have now been put in the position of being fearful for their lives.  
This was a case of first degree murder. 
These people are being put through a meat grinder.  
I would like the solicitor general to answer my constituents. 
Why do they have to go through this?  
I am certain the member recognizes that of all of us.  
They have been repeated often and I will repeat them again.  
Now it has to be unanimous. 
Those are just two things.  
It is really more likely to be an extremely faint hope. 
That is the position of the government to this point. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
This has happened most recently in Vancouver. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his intervention. 
I would like to speak specifically to the question of port police. 
I know members opposite are concerned about that. 
I have begun an initiative to see what might be done in that regard.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
But that is just for the time being.  
The RCMP is simply there meeting that need as requested.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Scarborough East.  
We will continue these policies.  
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Since that time Toronto has grown out over top of the riding. 
We cannot simply expect that this will happen. 
Nationhood needs to be nurtured much like children need to be nurtured.  
We will take Canada into the new century and the new millennium. 
Our citizens watch us daily and frequently they do not like what they see. 
The 27th Parliament introduced full health insurance to Canada. 
As a result, Canada now has one of the best health systems in the world. 
It is an affirmation of Canadian values.  
It was proud and it was united. 
Every community in Canada celebrated its centennial in one manner or another. 
Those parliaments did great things. 
Many Canadians have original ideas and suggestions for millennium projects. 
There was basically guerrilla theatre between the Mohawks, the English, the Americans and the French.  
I was interviewing a candidate in my office, a Tamil woman. 
I asked her how and why she came to Canada. 
She returned home and her passport was lost. 
A Tamil woman in Sri Lanka is a vulnerable person. 
She spoke with such tremendous conviction that I was absolutely astounded.  
It brings me to the point that we do not speak to each other. 
I ask that the Deputy Prime Minister explore ways in which that can be done.  
I would suggest that is a fitting way to mark our millennium.  
As well, Canada needs to develop its symbols of nationhood. 
Mr. Gerard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):
I would like to ask a question in closing. 
Mr. Speaker, I think I saw that movie last week. 
It was not very good. 
I am seeing the movie again this week. 
It has not improved. 
I expect that I will see the movie again next week. 
I am sincerely hopeful that Quebec will be part of this nation. 
I must make a comment regarding the order of speakers today. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
I want congratulate you on your appointment as an officer of the House. 
The Speech from the Throne was disappointing. 
It is a collection of empty words, cautious commitments and artful dodges.  
The same goes for foreign affairs. 
Ah when to the heart of man 
I came to you, bearing my country, 
To sow it in your garden.  
You need not be surprised 
To see it growing in your neighbour's as well.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am greatly interested in my colleague's words.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
He quoted a poem by Robert Frost. 
I can quote another poem called The Road Not Taken . 
The poet indicated of the two options that life always offers. 
To quote an internationalist you know very well, Emmerich De Vattel: 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
We are all the same. 
We are all one and we form Canada. 
I say to you, sir, that we have to realize that. 
I ask you and your party to look at that. 
The Deputy Speaker (Mr. Milliken):
If the hon. member for Beauharnois-Salaberry wishes to say something, he has the floor.  
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of the hon. member. 
I believe we have exhausted constitutional remedies in Quebec. 
We will see once again that those constitutional remedies have been exhausted. 
Then we will have to find a solution. 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
It is a privilege for me to work for the people of Charlesbourg.  
Great people have spoken in this House. 
A century later, the Bloc Quebecois has answered his call. 
We the sovereignists are the defenders of democracy in Quebec. 
The Bloc is back.  
Now, let ask ourselves if it is possible to reconcile justice and escalation. 
Let me use a practical example.  
Yet, this is precisely what this government is attempting to do. 
Is this what they call justice, Mr. Speaker? 
Some even refer to us as generation x . 
Still, there is absolutely nothing in the throne speech to solve this most urgent problem.  
Once again, the federal government is acting like a bull in a china shop. 
But there is more.  
The $30 million program to fight crime is a rehash. 
There is nothing new. 
This is further evidence of this government's total lack of imagination.  
The Liberal government is once again proving the Bloc Quebecois right.  
Let me conclude by saying it is an honour for me to be here. 
I am convinced that this 36th Parliament will go down in history. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member.  
I believe that there are some things that must be made very clear. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
I listened carefully to what he had to say. 
I acknowledge the history of that notion. 
How does he regard their democratic rights understood in that context?  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question. 
We are proud to have done so. 
We continue to extend our friendship to the aboriginal people.  
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Edmonton-Strathcona.  
I, like other members, congratulate you on your appointment to the Chair. 
I thank the people of Dauphin-Swan River for the honour. 
I would like to describe to the House the make-up of Dauphin-Swan River. 
It is as unique as the country itself. 
It is a land of lakes, mountains and prairies. 
It is multilingual and multicultural. 
The people speak English, French, Ukrainian and Saulteaux. 
On a more personal note, I am a third generation Canadian. 
My wife Lynda, nee Burelle, is ninth generation. 
They settled near Varennes, in Quebec. 
We both still have relatives in Quebec. 
I am sure that many Canadians are in the same position. 
In the 1980s the vision was through the eyes of the Right Hon. Brian Mulroney. 
I believe that the next millennium belongs to the people of Canada, without a doubt. 
Now is it the citizens' turn to address the issues of the day.  
In short it would put the town back in the unity town halls.  
In closing, the key to this process is open discussion. 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
I would like to thank my parents for their unconditional love and support. 
My family arrived in Canada in 1972. 
I saw that with hard work comes success. 
That was the opportunity Canada offered.  
That was the freedom Canada offered.  
Canada is the best place in the world to live. 
Canada does have problems. 
Canadian families and small business suffer under a heavy tax burden. 
It is this issue that I would like to address today.  
Given this choice, I too would vote sovereignist.  
These, however, are not the only choices available to Quebecers. 
There is a third choice, that of a renewed Canadian federation. 
The third choice is embodied in the political movement calling for renewed federalism. 
Our first ministers are among those who share this frustration. 
We should all look with hope at the possibilities that lie within the Calgary declaration. 
Equality is no threat to individuals of merit. 
Equality is no threat to the rich and unique culture of Quebec. 
It is said that Canada finds strength in diversity. 
Mr. Gerard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):
I understand where the hon. member is coming from. 
Claude Ryan never agreed to sign it either. 
Mr. Speaker, I too share the frustration of the hon. member who just commented. 
We have seen that frustration in every region of this country.  
We have come a long way as a united country. 
I hope there is still a long way to go. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
That will give us the base on which to build a strong country.  
Mr. Carmen Provenzano (Sault Ste. Marie, Lib.):
I have known Ron Irwin for a long time. 
Ron left some mighty big shoes for me to fill, workboots in fact. 
Still others are finding post-secondary education to be prohibitively expensive. 
Simply put, the Speech from the Throne is an example of this belief in action. 
There are aspects of the speech that provide hope for unemployed Saultites. 
Sault Ste. Marie is a vibrant border city with a significant export economy. 
Sault Ste. Marie is a leading exporter of steel, wood and paper products. 
Tourism is another precious commodity in Sault Ste. Marie. 
They come to fish, hunt, ski and snowmobile. 
This recognition is not simply based on rhetoric. 
Like government they have learned to do more with less. 
We will stay the course of balancing the nation's financial and social priorities. 
I do not think so. 
I believe my fellow Canadians are prepared to look straight ahead. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Our colleague speaks to us about national unity. 
He tells us not to look back to the past, but ahead to the future.  
I ask him whether he is looking to the future or to the past.  
It is my hope that Canadians will be forward-looking. 
I pledge to do what I indicated in my speech. 
I do not think that the federation is so broken that it cannot be fixed.  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened to the hon. member's comments with interest.  
We have aboriginal people living on reserves. 
These kinds of stories are shocking and alarming. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We are out of time. 
I would ask the hon. member for Sault Ste. Marie for a brief reply.  
Mr. Speaker, I share the concerns of the member opposite. 
Those conditions should not prevail in any civilized society. 
We must direct our attention to them and find solutions.  
Mr. John Maloney (Erie-Lincoln, Lib.):
It was an honour to serve you. 
The riding of Erie-Lincoln truly runs from lake to lake to river. 
It is a wonderfully diverse and unique riding, a virtual microcosm of Canada. 
I look forward very much to working for my constituents in the upcoming mandate.  
My family cannot be thanked enough.  
We must investigate partnerships with the private sector. 
We must break down interprovincial trade barriers. 
We must continue to cut the red tape for small businesses and entrepreneurs. 
The fiscal course is set. 
I fully support the direction the government has pursued. 
The government's values are clear: responsibility, compassion, fairness and respect.  
No level of unemployment is acceptable. 
We are all more alike than we may realize.  
Oftentimes a fresh approach is required. 
At all times an open mind is required.  
Children are our most precious resource. 
Some say they are our future, and I agree. 
I would also point out they are very much a part of our present. 
The message in what we heard rang loud and clear. 
It is a step toward the very necessary eradication of child poverty.  
Our children ask little of us. 
This is the very least we owe them.  
Canada is not only a peacekeeper. 
It is a peacemaker and a leader. 
I welcome the new members of the House of Commons to this institution. 
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
It certainly will be enlightening to have you there. 
You always had a very practical approach. 
It is a welcome and refreshing step.  
A tap on the wrist is insufficient for that type of behaviour. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
However, as you know, I am more interested in certain points than in others. 
Canada, on the other hand, is 130 years old. 
Ours is a pluralistic society. 
What does the hon. member think of this?  
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member, but his time has expired. 
We enjoy going there. 
We all have relatives there. 
However Quebec does not have the monopoly on the French culture. 
There are areas throughout Canada. 
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate you on your appointment. 
I will be splitting my time with the member for North Vancouver.  
Many of the members of this assembly can trace their heritage to a common path. 
My ancestors came to Canada in the 1850s. 
Business dynamics of cities have changed since then. 
Its cultural mosiac is a product of 350 years of enlightened immigration. 
This cultural diversity is shared by many cities and towns in Canada.  
Edmonton East is just one of those cosmopolitan communities. 
Cultural diversity is a treasured part of our community. 
Edmontonians truly do enjoy multiculturalism. 
Multiculturalism should not be about money. 
They simply do not exist in our lives.  
I truly believe in Canada's diversity. 
It was not a simple consultative referendum as we were told. 
It was a serious well orchestrated campaign for separation.  
Dozens of unity groups sprang up. 
I organized a group in Edmonton. 
I stand here as a product of the 1995 referendum. 
Then we will have something to wave a flag about. 
Then we might have unity.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
There is an important semantic distinction to be made, here. 
He is in a position to know. 
He has lived through the referendum. 
I will listen closely to what he has to say.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague. 
It is not only Quebec which is looking for changes in the federation. 
Many other parts of the country are also looking for change. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I share the concerns of the hon. member. 
Mr. Gerard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):
Seniors tell us ``The more things change, the more they stay the same''.  
I was very specific in my speech. 
I said that I was in Quebec City during the referendum. 
I was there as a concerned Canadian. 
Going through August and September I watched the polls changing. 
I was there as a Canadian wishing to experience this vote in Quebec City. 
I had visited Quebec City several times before. 
My wife and I have had very fond experiences there.  
I was there out of concern for my country. 
I was not there on a cheap flight.  
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
Before I get right into the nitty-gritty of my first speech- 
Don't flatter yourself.  
I will certainly try to do even better in the 36th.  
The entire campaign turned into a personality thing distressing a lot of people.  
As a public figure I am used to the criticism from political opponents. 
He can no longer call us the third party. 
I just have to mention that.  
Election campaigns are about power. 
They are not really about democracy. 
They are about power for political parties at any cost. 
I have heard that.  
I tend to do this throughout the year. 
All it takes is the political will. 
It was very chaotic.  
In a way it is depressing. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
I am afraid that the member is actually serious about this. 
The member continues to refer to New Zealand as a model. 
I would like to ask the member a very direct question. 
This is going to cost a phenomenal amount of money.  
More than half of the people said no to that member.  
He says he is actually afraid that I may be serious. 
I certainly am serious. 
The question is on the amendment to the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment to the amendment?  
All those in favour of the amendment to the amendment will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
I declare the subamendment lost.  
The question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the amendment, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the amendment defeated.  
(The House adjourned at 6.45 p.m.)
