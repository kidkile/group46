Wednesday, February 3, 1999 
The House met at 2 p.m. 
Members sang the national anthem ] 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):
The OAC has also produced a very well respected university. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Farmers are frustrated with the current system. 
We need to listen to them.  
Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Team Canada has scored another major international hockey victory. 
Shawn Heins of Eganville and Allan Letang of Renfrew. 
THE AGA KHAN FOUNDATION 
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Canadians will spend millions and millions of dollars, still ending up at a blind wall. 
When is this Prime Minister finally going to come clean?  
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Mr. John Maloney (Erie-Lincoln, Lib.):
Forty per cent of illicit drugs come from the Caribbean and Latin America. 
I commend the minister for this meaningful intervention.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Vote against my conscience. 
That depends on what your definition of the word ``is'' is.  
And the No. 1 reason given by Liberal flip-floppers is:
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
The Government of Canada has taken a major step. 
THE PUBLIC SERVICE OF CANADA 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF OLDER PERSONS 
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
It underscores the importance of the role- 
The member for Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle.  
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the sovereignists want to give the separation option a new look. 
Big surprise, after the poor showing in the last election.  
But how else can they put it? 
I think what they want is a new bag of tricks. 
That is a favourite Parizeau strategy. 
But Quebeckers will not fall for Mr. Parizeau's all-too-familiar sleight-of-hand. 
They know him well. 
They know the option he favours, his objectives and his views on Quebec. 
The separatists are coming up short in the imagination department these days.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I am concerned. 
Amateur sport, not corruption, is part of our heritage. 
Mr. Gary Pillitteri (Niagara Falls, Lib.):
World Future Leaders Summit to be held in Washington in March. 
Crispin feels very honoured to be representing Canada and the Niagara area. 
Today I would like to salute him and recognize his achievements and wish him Godspeed.  
Young people like Crispin Bottomley are the hope and future for Canada.  
Today is a special anniversary for us in the House of Commons.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
This is always ongoing in governments. 
Incidents like that happen from time to time. 
We do not manage the daily operations of the hospitals. 
It is the provincial governments that do that.  
We said it was to be our priority.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition is wrong. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We have always been positive.  
We have been involved all along. 
Everybody knows that I am always a positive person. 
I know that the Reform Party plans- 
The hon. member for Macleod.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have taken this issue very seriously. 
We are assured that those negotiations are under way at the present time. 
We hope to see a satisfactory conclusion in the very near future.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it gets worse. 
I will ask my question again. 
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
This right to opt out could only be exercised under certain circumstances.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Regardless of what happens, they will come up with a new traditional demand for Quebec. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
What is the government doing to correct the situation? 
Well, it is working hard to deny even more benefits.  
Will he admit that, yes or no?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Absolutely not, Mr. Speaker. 
There are no such quotas. 
But there are no such quotas.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
How does the minister justify this brutal attack on unemployed Canadians?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We have some expectations. 
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
The government has consistently pursued wasteful spending policies to the detriment of all Canadians.  
What is he going to do?  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
What this does is take the profit out of organized crime. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I certainly will not deal with the figures my hon. colleague has presented.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, things are pretty shady in Shawinigan. 
Yvon Duhaime bought the Grand-Mere Inn from the Prime Minister in 1993. 
I am sure there is a perfectly reasonable explanation for this. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
What we have is a broad package. 
The funds were transferred in the normal course. 
These are ordinary business transactions.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
A lot of those funds were public funds that came from human resources. 
These are public funds that went into a private bank account. 
Any Canadian would love that kind of deal.  
Who will investigate this? 
Obviously it needs to be checked. 
The ethics commissioner will not investigate it, so who will?  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
I do not know how much clearer I can put that. 
The debts are there. 
They are repayable to the Business Development Bank of Canada.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
There are no quotas. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
If these are not quotas, then what are they?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, these are guidelines.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is important to put this in context. 
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
Where are our environmental impact studies? 
Where are the details of the agreement? 
Where are our public consultations?  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is no MOx fuel in Canada at this point in time. 
Nobody has sent us anything. 
We are still talking about the possibility of doing the tests. 
That is a commitment to count on.  
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
We have continued to use that property. 
We expect and intend to continue to use that facility.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Charges continue to be laid and charges will be prosecuted.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
This is the situation.  
If it has to go to the supreme court, this could take years. 
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Charges will continue to be laid and prosecutions will be pursued.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Ian Murray (Lanark-Carleton, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
The hon. member is quite correct that this carnage should stop.  
These measures will not be intrusive. 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Justice is misleading Canadians.  
Just be cautious in your words.  
What is happening is that these charges will be dismissed. 
What will the minister do to ensure that does not happen?  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
The hon. member may pose her question.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Let us seriously talk about how the Reform Party cares about children in the country. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
My question is for the Minister of Human Resources. 
This is an insurance program. 
Always direct your question through the Chair.  
This is an insurance program. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
It is a support- 
Surely you want to hear the answers, my colleagues.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
This measure is aimed at financially struggling mothers in particular.  
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
The Liberal government has destroyed the effectiveness and the morale of the RCMP.  
No longer are RCMP officers being trained.  
When will the solicitor general reopen the RCMP officer training school in Regina?  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Eglinton-Lawrence, Lib.):
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or-Cape Breton, NDP):
As we all know, when there is a suspicious death we hold an autopsy. 
The management has been dealing with them as effectively as it can. 
We have now arrived at a solution.  
We are in a situation where we are trying to put forward solutions. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
According to experts, this outdated vaccine was not even fit for animals. 
It had been expired for a number of years.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
They are all fully tested. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
I therefore hasten to seek this unanimous consent now.

The first is on the abolition of the Senate. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the second petition is with regard to pay equity.  
They ask that there be no more delay, just pay. 
They want the federal government to make good on its pay equity obligations.

Question No. 163- Mr. Eric Lowther: 
The coalition has been working on this project since 1995. 
Several departments have made a contribution to the coalition. 
The Department of Justice has been co-ordinating the funding since 1997.  
(a), (b), (c), and (d):
The funders for this initiative were:
Canadian Heritage, Human Rights, $24,750 and Health Canada, Childhood and Youth, $24,750.  
The funding partners were:
Developing a Monitoring Framework''.  
This will ensure that the monitoring of the convention is truly effective and accurate. 
The funding partners included:
The report is due in 1999. 
(e), (f), (g), (h), (i), and (j):
An interim report on the project has been filed.  
A final report has been received.  
The book will fill a void in the French academic tools presently available. 
The book is due out in 1999. 
Question No. 184- Mr. Jason Kenney: 
Hon. Harbance Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
The motion is transferred for debate pursuant to Standing Order 97(1).  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
CITIZENSHIP OF CANADA ACT 
Our citizenship is the very foundation of the Canadian identity. 
It is the common denominator that unites us from coast to coast. 
It is also one of our most valuable assets. 
I would like to thank all those who were involved in this process. 
I will nonetheless take a moment to outline its key elements.  
There are three ways of obtaining citizenship by birth.  
The new act represents a strong statement in support of this commitment.  
As I said earlier, one can also choose to become Canadian. 
It was important that we also modernize the attribution of citizenship by naturalization.  
With this in mind, we have redefined the residency criteria.  
Actually, over half of business immigrants create their own jobs. 
They bring in new capital and contribute to the development of Canada's international trade. 
This represents a notable contribution to our country. 
Most applications for citizenship pose no problems. 
They can now be processed by citizenship officers.  
To mark the change in their role, we will now be calling them citizenship commissioners.  
Indeed these lie at the core of our Canadian identity.  
Every year in Canada, some 160,000 people become Canadian citizens. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
I certainly have a lot of questions for her.  
For that reason the subject matter of this piece of legislation is also very important.  
I will begin by giving a little background material to the bill. 
The government's stated purpose has been presented by the minister. 
I am very sincere about this point. 
Some pieces of legislation are very difficult to work one's way through. 
This one is not. 
It is presented in a very clear way. 
I will talk about some of those.  
It was the only committee report that has dealt in a substantial way with citizenship. 
An increase in power is given to the minister in many areas of the legislation. 
To be fair, I recognize that authority is necessary in some places. 
I will talk a bit later about one of those areas. 
I am very concerned about that.  
Clearly this was an unbelievable discriminatory aspect of the old bill. 
I would like to get into the specifics of the act. 
It was recognized by that committee as well.  
Children born in Canada to landed immigrants would assume Canadian citizenship''.  
This minister has been the minister for immigration for three years now. 
It has been four and a half years since the committee reported. 
Why on earth has the research not been done? 
I hope the minister will answer that somewhere along the way.  
She knows of the case of Mavis Baker which is before the supreme court now. 
Her deportation order by the department is being overturned by the court. 
We have not heard the results of this case yet.  
That kind of law in effect being made by a court is completely unacceptable. 
Let us have laws in this country made in the Parliament of Canada. 
There are some recommendations in this bill that look good on the surface.  
Some individuals have been found to be residing in Canada due to a court case. 
Either one of these things would indicate that they were residing in Canada.  
The minister said the right words in the bill. 
She said that we were going to plug that hole. 
That change was made. 
I also want to talk about the blatant patronage. 
It goes another step that we have not seen for some time. 
We have called for that for some time. 
That is a good move.  
That will be done within the department. 
What is the role of these commissioners? 
What is their role? 
Their role is to promote active citizenship in the community.  
It is a complete waste of taxpayers' money. 
I know of so many groups that do such a good job of that.  
Let us cut this spending entirely. 
I can sure see the Speaker is agreeing with this completely. 
That is the way the current act reads.  
Bill C-63 removes that provision. 
As a result applicants will be penalized for bureaucratic delays in the department. 
That is the way it is under the current act. 
That is the way the act is now.  
This is in response to some abuse we have seen across the country. 
Section 43 puts the regulation in place. 
There is another area of great concern in this bill. 
Clause 43(c) refers to fixed fees. 
The level of the fees could have a great impact on how this act works. 
It is left to the minister's to define what a spouse is. 
It should be made neither by the minister nor by the courts. 
I call for the minister to quickly reject this part of the act. 
All others should apply for entry through the normal selective process. 
That is what we and I think many Canadians are calling for.  
I will read both citizenship oaths. 
This is the oath under the current act: 
This is the proposed oath contained in this legislation: 
Am I objecting to the new oath? 
What I am objecting to is the way this oath was arrived at. 
That is arrogance that Canadians will not accept. 
I believe the minister will be chastised by the Canadian public for doing that.  
Clearly the minister has missed an opportunity here. 
It would be an oath supported by citizens across the country.  
The minister has once again ignored her responsibility to make a decision on this issue. 
She is going to have that made behind closed doors by her departmental officials. 
Parliament will have absolutely no say in what adequate language requirements are.  
But probably a majority do.  
I think that is too bad.  
I have kept my comments quite general. 
There are several other issues I will talk about as we get to report stage. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
We therefore congratulate the minister on this aspect of the bill.  
The auditor general also arrived at a fascinating diagnostic. 
Behind every minister, there is probably a closet sovereignist. 
This is a very positive aspect of the bill. 
I know that the Quebec government has made representations to the minister. 
You, Mr. Speaker, are a bilingual citizen and this is to your credit. 
I am sure the minister is aware of this. 
It will of course be our duty to raise these issues in committee.  
The minister is a woman of honour. 
She knows the importance of an oath in everyday life. 
There is something of an inconsistency. 
Ought there not to be some consistency here? 
Quebec's characteristics are well known. 
The minister, who has a strong background in social sciences, is aware of this. 
Mention should have been made that Canada comprises two nations. 
This is the definition given in the 19th century. 
A nation is made up of people that control a territory. 
The fourth element that defines a nation is, of course, its history. 
This is important, because this is to be found in every constitutional law treatise.  
I think we should expect amendments.  
I could make the same remarks with respect to native Canadians. 
Why did the minister not refer to them? 
She knows very well that this conference was the native peoples' conference. 
It even appears in the Constitution Act, 1982. 
There are very specific rights.  
They will be called citizenship commissioners. 
However, the description of the responsibilities of these commissioners remains rather vague. 
The bill mentions promoting civic values. 
How will they be appointed?  
But we have been given no such assurances.  
I want to really stress this point. 
Another important point is the whole issue of international adoption. 
She knows how important this issue is for the Government of Quebec. 
Table them both at the same time.  
I will read the letter, then: 
The reference here is to the minister.  
-your intention to table, in mid-December- 
We hope it will be the case. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
These items are in many ways a repeat of the old act.  
What point is there to Commonwealth citizenship? 
I am one of those who consider the minister very wise to- 
This is something sovereignists will continue to ponder. 
These are debates we will also be having.  
In the present legislative setting, amendments are certainly important. 
But citizens are no longer universal beings. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
I will be splitting my time with the member from Kamloops. 
Ministers usually read their piece and then carry on out the door. 
In my riding of Winnipeg Centre citizenship is a critical issue. 
I was overwhelmed by all the various subgroups. 
It is also a pleasure that the area is being repopulated. 
They are also keeping the schools viable because there are more children in the neighbourhood.  
I went to the consultations in Winnipeg. 
I am sure it was not the only group. 
I heard many groups making that representation.  
We do not want more barriers. 
There are many other obvious roadblocks. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
As I say, it is a highlight in my life. 
It is a great moment.  
One cannot help but be made proud again to be a citizen of Canada.  
We stand to talk about the Queen, her heirs and so on. 
Our friends in Australia are looking at this. 
However, I think back to my own parents. 
Obviously they spoke Norwegian. 
Consequently we pick up the costs and we welcome a criminal element into our country. 
We are an amalgamation of folks from every country of the world.  
It was set up as a consul office. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
They are concerned from that point of view. 
That is not good enough for me. 
It should be in the legislation.  
I see that problem with almost every proposal made in the legislation. 
There is not enough information to determine what the minister has in mind. 
Is the member not concerned about that issue? 
The second issue concerns the need to promote citizenship. 
I wonder why that is going on. 
The member had expressed his support for that concept.  
Does he have that little faith in the local community to do that?  
I know the citizenship judges who operate in my constituency. 
They are excellent individuals who are recognized in their communities as outstanding Canadians. 
They make it a habit of promoting citizenship. 
My friend might think this is a bad idea but I do not. 
Of course they all do.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am afraid the time has run out.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent?  
Madam Speaker, thank you. 
Does it mean a test, as my friend from Winnipeg indicated? 
Is it a competency level? 
What does it mean? 
My friend is right that we have to be specific about this. 
I do not believe it is an intentional barrier. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
On January 1, 1947 the first Canadian citizenship act took effect. 
In 1977 parliament initiated a new citizenship act. 
We and our people played a major role in building all of this country. 
We date back to 1783. 
I recall when the rumour was flying around here. 
I say to everyone how important this truly is. 
We put in over 250 hours in regard to one case. 
My staff and her staff worked together. 
There were rules and regulations that had to be met.  
After many months we were able to bring that family back to Canada. 
They arrived just a few days before Christmas. 
The whole community came together. 
Both the wife and husband work. 
They have contributed to society. 
They donate their time to those who are living in poverty. 
The husband is a baker. 
He bakes for them at night. 
He makes sure that they get the best of food. 
This has been a very beautiful success story but it took a long time.  
He recommended major changes to streamline it. 
I have heard here tonight about taking patronage out of it. 
I know this is difficult. 
We hear about the little families in church basements. 
I come from Canada's only official bilingual province, New Brunswick. 
Our door is open for immigrants. 
It will not cost them anything. 
They do not all have to be in Vancouver or Toronto. 
They can be in the maritime provinces as well. 
It talks about having to be a skilled worker. 
I mentioned the man who is a baker. 
Bakers are considered to be in short supply in Canada. 
There is reference to same sex families. 
There are those who will believe that that constitutes a family. 
I am one who believes in the traditional family. 
I am one who will always speak for the traditional family. 
I have some concerns about that section which is being recommended.  
Other proposals contained in the most recent report are things that need to be debated.  
We have one of the highest standards of living in the world. 
Although everything is not perfect, we are fortunate to live in this nation.  
There are no details for us to study and comment on.  
As I have stated, it takes a long time. 
This could also serve to quickly turn around those applications that will not be accepted.  
I hope all opinions will be listened to and respected.  
I want that on the record.  
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
It took about two years. 
We first applied and we were automatically turned down. 
We asked why we were turned down. 
We applied a second time. 
It took three applications to come here.  
We felt we had earned the right to come here. 
We had earned it. 
I personally see nothing wrong with having a high standard. 
I have two questions for the member. 
She does not object to requiring reasonably high standards. 
The second point has to do with criminal refugees.  
She has done absolutely nothing.  
Has the member thought about that problem in the big cities? 
That drug situation is across the nation. 
That little man lives in Saint John right now. 
He contributes to our society. 
He was not a criminal. 
He spoke out against a communist way of life. 
That is the only thing he did.  
We have to have a stronger system. 
There is no question about that.  
They all live on welfare. 
They all have free medical care. 
They acknowledge that they are illegal refugees.  
That is what the auditor general would say. 
I think we all agree to that.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I would like to get clarification regarding a comment the member made. 
No, it was not the party. 
I am not for same sex benefits. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
TAX ON FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS 
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):
There are a lot of greedy people in the world. 
They would want to help their neighbours and do not really care about money. 
We do not care about all of these other people. 
Let them suffer because they did not do X and they did not do Y''.  
That kind of world is not a good world to live in. 
It is a world where the law of the jungle prevails. 
Sometimes people say to me Liberals are soft. 
I will get back to the second point I want to make. 
Speculation starts in their own country for some people. 
They understand the rules. 
They understand the regulations. 
It is the stock brokers or the local banker who gives these tip-offs. 
They trigger these things. 
It is kind of like a BRE-X. 
The next thing we know all kinds of things happen. 
Then in come the speculators. 
The speculators become involved. 
Remember some times things like the ten commandments. 
We look at all the angles and we pry and we probe. 
We hear the concern of the hon. member, but Canada is already exercising international leadership. 
Big financial markets are not perfect institutions.  
In other words, no market is perfect.  
And so the argument goes. 
This would discourage speculation. 
Others are attracted by the tax revenue. 
We do have regimes for raising taxes. 
Those regimes are well thought out. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
He certainly provides an excellent view on this subject. 
I also enjoyed his member's statement yesterday. 
But unfortunately that is not a world we live in and it never will be. 
That is a Utopian world. 
There are some things which government simply cannot do. 
This is an irrefutable fact of economic history.  
It was a brilliant idea to soak the rich. 
They imposed this punitive tax on windows. 
To this day we still see the unintended consequences. 
It could not work. 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
That is order of magnitude we are talking about here. 
And better distribution of wealth would be achieved. 
When we refer to national interests, we are not referring to some vague concept. 
This may be seen in the document I am going to read. 
Fortunately, an awareness is developing internationally. 
That is not new. 
We all know about the acuity of the French on social issues. 
They have always been in the forefront. 
Malnutrition and famine are again raging in Indonesia. 
In Korea and Thailand, IMF suicides continue. 
This Paris-based association also has a Web site. 
I urge everyone to contact it.  
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
They said they need more jobs and better opportunities in rural Canada. 
I read several newspapers every day. 
I also look through many press clippings. 
Unfortunately, John Minard is no longer with us. 
He passed away just over a year ago. 
There are many John Minards in every community around this country. 
I do not think so. 
Lots of Canadians buy Canada Savings Bonds and lots of Canadians save for their retirement. 
Those are the people who would have to pay this new tax. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
I had the pleasure to second this bill. 
In a sense, I am a co-sponsor with my colleague.  
Everybody is against those who make their living by speculating on currency. 
I think we have been successful.  
It had nothing to do with the state of our economy. 
But it caused problems. 
It caused uncertainty in the marketplace. 
A long comes an idea. 
My friend from Regina-Qu'Appelle says: 
We do not want to do it unilaterally. 
We want to show leadership. 
The world is calling out for leadership.  
Let us look at what we are talking about. 
We are talking about a form of the Tobin tax. 
This has now been updated. 
We are talking about people who are currency speculators.  
I listened to the leader of Germany the other day. 
He is in favour of some form of a Tobin tax.  
Yet some of my friends in the Liberal Party bad-mouth this concept. 
They are bad-mouthing the leadership of Asia-Pacific. 
What are these people thinking?  
I can understand why they would not support this legislation. 
Oh, yes there would be.  
Oh, no there would not be. 
The financial elite spokespersons would say that. 
However, I know the average Calgarian well. 
My previous home was on the outskirts of Calgary. 
We are a major trading nation. 
The stability of our currency is crucial. 
As I say, it is a free country. 
We are quite enthusiastic about this initiative for two major reasons. 
First, it would have the ability to control international currency speculation. 
There is no question about that. 
There is another way. 
If you are going to participate then you buy into this concept. 
My friend should be ashamed of himself.  
For extremely good reasons we support this concept of the Tobin tax. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
We dealt with the bank merger. 
I guess it was in a difficult spot on that issue.  
There does not seem to be any doubt about that. 
One has to wonder what is going on behind this apparent irrationality.  
The proposal is a good one and one that I support.  
The Tobin tax would be a tax on individual financial transactions. 
However, unless all countries agree to such a tax it would not be workable.  
Unless all countries are in harmony with such a tax it is just not workable.  
The finance minister realizes that there are a lot of good ideas out there. 
The question is which ones are feasible and which ones would he implement. 
Let us examine a tax on financial transactions. 
Presumably such a tax would be targeted on foreign currency transactions. 
I throw out a word of caution. 
Was the movement of capital a symptom of some deeper underlying problems? 
In other words, where was the chicken and where was the egg? 
This is an important question.  
There are often some underlying reasons for the movement of capital.  
In Canada we still suffer with the prospect of another referendum in Quebec. 
This creates uncertainty in financial markets. 
I am sure this had some bearing on the fate of our Canadian dollar. 
I think it is a very important issue. 
The main thrust of the motion is that our government should show leadership. 
We are showing leadership.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to enter into this debate.  
It only makes sense to me in the kind of government we have. 
We show leadership in a lot of areas. 
We certainly could show leadership in the international community in this area.  
I recognize their positions have not changed. 
But we have to start somewhere. 
We are not talking about a big percentage tax here. 
It would be a very small percentage tax. 
I heard the member from the Conservative Party speak earlier. 
I respect what that individual did. 
I applaud what that individual did. 
I doubt that individual was a money speculator. 
He was not a financial money speculator. 
Who are these people?  
The speculators make money.  
It is even worse when we get to the financial speculators, the money speculators. 
Suddenly our dollar started to go down. 
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
I asked the Prime Minister the following question: 
-when he was Leader of the Opposition, the Prime Minister wrote- 
Instead of getting at the root of the problem, it targets the unemployed''.  
Even the UN has condemned Canada because of its changes to the employment insurance program. 
I wonder what his constituents think of him.  
In my own riding, these lost benefits total $69 million. 
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Take a piece of news and the NDP will make it bad news. 
As a Liberal, I prefer to make it good news.  
There are fewer people on employment insurance, that is true. 
I think that is good news. 
Nothing could be further from the truth.  
Nothing could be further from the truth in that case as well.  
It is obvious he does not know a great deal about the skills of management. 
Every manager has to make a prediction about the coming year. 
That is good management. 
This government is trying to follow that model.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Why does the government continue to allow these conditions to exist? 
These members deliver mail to several million householders across rural Canada. 
Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
It operates within our framework.  
The changes have been fought through committee. 
Multiple changes have been put in place. 
The rural postal services or franchisees have had absolutely no changes to their revenue. 
That has been guaranteed at the 1997-98 levels. 
I think we have done that well with this change to the postal services.  
We will meet again here sometime as dictated by the hon. Speaker. 
The hon. Speaker would not presume to dictate.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
There were 150 jobs at stake.  
Every time they use up 20 weeks of EI, their benefits go down 1%. 
It is clear that everyone wants to work. 
I await an answer from the government.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, in essence the hon. member was talking about the employment insurance fund. 
It is also about the fact that those premiums flow into consolidated revenues. 
In fact it is government that stands behind the program.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
The other employees involved were also high-ranking employees.  
Because of federal government underfunding of its Technology Partnerships Canada program. 
The government is getting criticism from both sides. 
Its strategy is the opposite of what it should be. 
The big companies pay less.  
Technology Partnerships Canada is not a funding program. 
It funds itself from the return. 
That is why we support it. 
It is not a funding program.  
Canada is facing a productivity crisis. 
This is not the way to go about resolving it. 
Let us not forget the unemployed in all this.  
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
There have already been investments in several world class aerospace projects. 
With respect to Pratt & Whitney Canada our commitment has been substantial. 
The minister recently met with Pratt & Whitney Canada executives to this end. 
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.57 p.m.)
