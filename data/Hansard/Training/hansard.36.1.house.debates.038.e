Wednesday, November 26, 1997 
The House met at 2 p.m. 
CANADA TELEVISION AND CABLE PRODUCTION FUND 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
It was written by Keith Leckie and co-produced by Marie Young-Leckie. 
This show has now been sold throughout the world.  
VICTIMS BILL OF RIGHTS 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I remember April 29 of last year so well. 
The Liberals supported the motion. 
It is easy to see why the general public has lost faith in this institution. 
The Reform Party will not forget you. 
Some day a Reform government will legislate your national victims bill of rights.  
Mr. Benoit Serre (Timiskaming-Cochrane, Lib.):
By 1998, 32 new mines are expected to open. 
I look forward to continuing our work together.  
Mr. Reginald Belair (Timmins-James Bay, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
I salute a great Canadian, Mr. Gordon Wright, an example to us all.  
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, today is Keep Mining in Canada day. 
How are Canadians going to trust a government that engages in this kind of doublespeak? 
It is time for this government to come clean on the real costs.  
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the separatists are ashamed. 
They are ashamed of the words and deeds of their members.  
I say the separatists should have the courage of conviction of their own. 
Those are the words of Lucien Bouchard.  
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
It was a summit where real things were discussed.  
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):
Another quote from Lucien Bouchard ``I admire Mr. Parizeau very much. 
THE LATE JUSTICE JOHN SOPINKA 
Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):
John Sopinka was born in Broderick, Saskatchewan in 1933. 
John Sopinka knew the importance of protecting our civil liberties. 
John Sopinka was a leader in many ways. 
We have lost a great Canadian and we mourn his passing.  
Ms. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
I have a question to ask of the PQ and the Bloc today:
When will I qualify as a full-fledged Quebecker? 
When will they dissociate themselves from this type- 
The hon. member for Vancouver East has the floor.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
Mr. Parizeau is not an ordinary citizen. 
His xenophobia is unacceptable.  
Enough is enough, Mr. Parizeau and Mr. Bouchard.  
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Mr. Bavis has progressive multiple sclerosis. 
He is totally disabled. 
He has exhausted all his resources.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
I would hope that the hon. Leader of the Opposition would do likewise.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
The government has frustrated Justice Krever every step of the way. 
It deliberately withheld cabinet documents from an earlier period from his inquiry. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
He will know, as I said a while ago, that this document is under embargo. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right to the last they frustrate it, Mr. Speaker. 
Ordinary Canadians want to have faith in the blood system. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Our government is looking forward to the report. 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
She is a leading member of the Canadian Metis community.  
The hon. member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the provincial premiers are doing a good job under the circumstances.  
However, let me give you an example of a phoney consultation. 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
But I repeat that the last referendum question was deceptive. 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
No, Mr. Speaker, it is not eroding. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
I would urge the hon. member to listen to the answer. 
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
In fact, what the Bank of Canada is doing is very responsible.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The hon. member for Skeena. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
I would ask the hon. member to work with me.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, that dog won't hunt.  
When did the minister first become aware of this document? 
Have her own departmental officials been stonewalling her?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
It is a program of great support for aboriginal people. 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
That is the most substantial answer she has ever given.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Is that not precisely what she did?  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I never said that. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have been reviewing the recommendations of the royal commission. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
The question was when did she find out about this report. 
The problem will not go away.  
When did she find out about this damning report of her own department? 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Important questions are being asked and important answers are being given. 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
My question is directed to the Minister of Industry. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr, Speaker, this is a very important question. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
When did she receive this report?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
We do not stop working while we are waiting for reports. 
We all have a responsibility in this regard. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is ordinary aboriginal people we are thinking about. 
The hon. member for Calgary Southwest.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
There we have a new relationship with the fiscal transfer. 
The changes are happening. 
We just have to speed them up, modernize them and work together.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Since then, negotiations with Quebec have been dragging on.  
The Minister of Public Works and Government Services.  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Natural Resources.  
We have made our commitments to federal regulatory streamlining. 
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
The minister would not even meet with them.  
When did the minister find out about this report? 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we received the report in 1996. 
We believe it is the conduct of Reform MPs that should be scrutinized- 
The hon. member for Crowfoot.  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Would she confirm to this House whether that is the truth? 
If it is not, then set us straight here in this House. 
When did she find out about that report?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this report has been in the department. 
There is nothing new, there is nothing exciting. 
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
The question is pretty straightforward. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
We do not know yet whether Justice Krever has- 
The issue the hon. member raises is very important. 
The hon. member for Charlotte.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I cannot believe that answer. 
Nothing to do with the Krever inquiry. 
The question is when are they going to deal with it. 
These are innocent victims, 12,000 Canadians, who deserve an answer. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
He is using those victims for his own political ends. 
He can wait 15 minutes and listen to the report.  
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We then met with restaurant owners to discuss the situation.  
By working together, we can work in the best interests of Quebeckers.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
I think he has demonstrated this in his questions.  
The fact is we have met continually with representatives of the people's summit. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
This minister denied there were any problems. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
He talks about the need for an inquiry. 
This side wants to act and get results. 
That side just wants to talk and talk and talk.  
TELEVISION AND CABLE PRODUCTION FUND 
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Can he answer the question today?  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
We have the banks before the committee four times a year. 
It is quite capable of running its affairs. 
We are the government that imposed the temporary surtax.  
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
The privacy commissioner has already started an inquiry.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I will look into the allegations of the member. 
We ask people to identify themselves for security reasons. 
We need to protect the integrity of the system.  
I will look into the hon. member's allegation. 
We want to serve Canadians well.  
QUEBEC'S CIVIL CODE 
Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):
Canada has access to Atlantic, Pacific and Arctic civilizations. 
The member for West Kootenay-Okanagan.  
Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay-Okanagan, Ref.):
The question is out of order.  
My colleagues, that would bring to a close our question period for today.  
We are proud of your work and of your cultural achievements.  
Dear colleagues, I present our Canadian stars.  
I think today will be a rather busy day. 
I have at least one point of order that I know of. 
I will handle these matters before I get to the routine proceedings of the day.  
The hon. member for Burlington.  
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of personal privilege.  
This is not a joke. 
It is a very serious harassment that needs your attention.  
The hon. member for Burlington mentioned specifically the hon. member for Yorkton-Melville. 
I am not sure this is a question of privilege. 
I want to hear what he has to say.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this is the first I hear of this. 
I know nothing about it. 
I know nothing about this.  
Mr. Speaker, I apologize. 
I have the wrong Mr. Breitkreuz. 
It is the member for Yellowhead.  
The part where I said I am sorry was an apology.  
Evidently, the hon. member in her statement has misidentified one member of Parliament for another. 
I find this just abhorrent.  
We are all involved in this, all of us.  
May I please ask for your indulgence. 
I want to get more information. 
I will reserve judgment until I get more details.  
I am going to go to a point of order.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
You have empowered me with this.  
From what I could hear, the hon. member was talking about security. 
I, as Speaker of the House, am responsible for security in the House. 
From my understanding, that is where it was going.

REQUEST FOR EMERGENCY DEBATE 
Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay-Okanagan, Ref.):
I made this application last Thursday. 
The strike has now been going on for a week. 
We are even hearing conflictions from various ministers on their position.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
CANADA PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
Accordingly, pursuant to Standing Order 76.1(5), 
they have not been selected.  
The other motions will be grouped for debate as follows: 
The Chair will remind the House of each pattern at the time of voting.  
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP) moved: 
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC) moved: 
Unless subsection (1.5) 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.) moved: 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.) moved: 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP) moved: 
``period in which the report is prepared; 
It seems wise to have an independent panel of experts. 
It makes it more independent from the government. 
It is fairer, more transparent and something that should be done. 
I hope the government across the way would be willing to consider it.  
In committee a number of amendments were moved. 
It has now had a chance to think about another whole series of amendments. 
Right now the actuary only focuses on costs. 
That has not been done. 
What will be the income of seniors in 20 years or 30 years? 
That is a very important aspect of the bill before us today. 
Those are the kinds of things I believe should be done.  
There have to be a number of changes to make the plan more progressive. 
It is important to say that at the beginning of the debate.  
It is another area which I believe we should look at.  
The contributions are going up and they are going up in a very regressive way. 
The benefits are going to drop. 
We are also going to see a drop in the survivor's benefits. 
There are more widows than widowers. 
It is going to discriminate against women in this country. 
That of course is a concern to us as well.  
We strongly believe in a public pension system in this country. 
In fact it is misnamed. 
It should really be the Canada pension and insurance plan. 
It is somewhere around that amount. 
Those questions have not been answered.  
The new investment fund is going to be a big fund. 
Those are some of the reasons why I am moving these amendments. 
I hope the government will be receptive to some of these amendments. 
Therefore, the government should take some of our advice very seriously.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
It will be playing with the financial future of thousands and thousands of Canadians.  
It does not make for sound administrative practices. 
This is clearly insufficient.  
The board must also provide the provincial ministers with a reason for that removal.  
That is why we went one step further in our amendments. 
Furthermore, the protection of shareholders is a recognized principle in Canadian law.  
This statement would state the circumstances and reasons of the resignation or removal.  
This would reflect the English wording ``has requested and received''. 
It is a matter of transparency and accountability. 
In clause (1.5), 
we make an exception to clause (1.4). 
This would avoid having too long a period without an audit being conducted.  
In clause (1.6), 
I urge all hon. members to support the motion.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
That is another story.  
Amendments are proposed to the bill for the House to vote on. 
Group No. 1 has six different amendments in it. 
I assume they are all grouped together because they deal with accountability. 
There were six amendments put forward to deal with this. 
However, it is a step in the right direction. 
It would be very useful, at least in this case, to move in that direction.  
So we do support that amendment by the NDP.  
The next amendment is one by my colleague from the PC party. 
There are two important things here. 
There is no revolving door of auditors where someone comes in cold. 
This is a huge fund. 
I think this is an excellent amendment and should be supported.  
The third amendment is by the government. 
In other words, there may be no special examination at all. 
So we support that.  
We commend the government on this amendment. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
It was headed toward an incredible deficit. 
I think this is an outcome of the work done in committee. 
The same is true of the NDP motion on conflict of interest. 
The two plans have certain identical elements. 
To a certain extent, this is automatic, which is useful.  
This is a practice that has caused problems in the past. 
It is the plan under which almost everyone is covered. 
This applies to baby boomers in particular.  
There are interesting adjustments in this regard in the bill. 
We must make sure that the bill will be the best possible.  
This is what we want to continue to do with the suggestions made today.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I think these are legitimate aspirations that everyone from all sides of the House shares. 
I want to make a point of clarification. 
I want to state again that that is not true. 
It is an arm's length board.  
The board will be working for the best interests of the plan members. 
There was the comment about how women were being treated unfairly. 
Motion No. 3 talks about appointing the auditor for a five-year term. 
Again, I want to reiterate that the board is an arm's length corporation.  
The board will keep Canadians well informed of its investment activities. 
Canadians will be fully aware of this. 
I will comment briefly on the last motion which is related to Motion No. 23. 
Therefore there really is no need for this proposed motion. 
The process is already in place. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
I would like to add a couple of notes for the benefit of all members.  
That is one of the reasons we are here today.  
The parliamentary secretary dealt with many of these points. 
That is the reason we are here.  
Its members are experts in investment. 
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
I refer specifically to Motion No. 1 in Group No. 1. 
Why would we propose these changes? 
I am absolutely petrified, apprehensive and not confident in what the Liberals are saying. 
It was the Liberal Party, Liberal governments in the past and before that Conservative governments. 
The record is very clear.  
That is unacceptable in this day and age in this country.  
Why are the Liberals not supporting such an amendment for a code of conduct? 
I think people should ask that question. 
It is not providing enough for those who do have little. 
The second amendment the NDP is putting forward is Motion No. 24. 
I am asking the government to reconsider. 
Canadians should be asking this question of themselves. 
They should be asking this question of the Liberal members of Parliament. 
Why are they not embracing all these changes?  
We have all sorts of information that we want to share. 
I certainly look forward to sharing them.  
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or, NDP):
We in Cape Breton have been very well aware of government patronage over the years. 
We have seen years of patronage. 
This is like allowing the mouse to mind the cheese.  
With respect to Motion No. 24, it is quite simple. 
Is the House ready for the question?  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC) moved: 
Second, this constraint also has the effect of reducing the competitiveness of Canadian businesses. 
He said, and I quote: 
I would even say it is significant.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
This amendment, of course, would do that.  
Only one-fifth or 20% can be invested offshore.  
This does not give us the best return and the best security.  
It does not maximize the investment return which we can hope to achieve.  
This is particularly important for poorer Canadians. 
That would indicate that we were going to get this matter taken care of. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
This change would be more appropriate in the context of a fiscal debate.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
I do not understand the rationale for this. 
I do not understand this.  
However, the Reform and the Conservatives talk about back to the future. 
I think it is outrageous what they are proposing.  
Let us just clarify this one more time. 
Who are their friends?  
Call them the reverse party.  
We know who their friends are. 
Their friends are people like Conrad Black. 
That is probably a suggestion others have as well. 
Others suggest that maybe it is the reformatories, we do not know. 
I am puzzled as to why the Reformers are proposing this. 
There are some good gold stocks in Indonesia they could probably invest in. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
It is the same rule that applies to personal RRSPs. 
There are some dynamics that occur in the marketplace. 
It would appear to me that nobody in this House can support this motion. 
I will check it. 
Motion No. 2 basically states that clause 37 be deleted. 
I will check that. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
I hope he learns to clean up his thinking. 
That will then clean up his speaking.  
There is this anti anything outside Canada bias by some people. 
We hope that is true. 
The government is thinking it can do that with taxpayer money.  
It seems to me rather arbitrary to say that we should not do this.  
There is another aspect to this that is very important. 
Why on earth would we say we do not want any American money in Canada? 
It is now going to be taxed at regular tax rates. 
The member from the NDP has some really cute statements. 
He had it wrong about the sand part and the head. 
We do want to listen to the people. 
We want to do what is best for them. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
It is a statement and a fact that I think most Canadians are aware of.  
Present rules are intended to provide a sort of balance for Canadian investors.  
So we are all moving in the same direction.  
What we are saying is that the CPP fund will follow the same limitations. 
Is the House ready for the question?  
The next question is on Group No. 3, Motion No. 8. 
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC) moved: 
I hope government members will support this amendment.  
Clause 53 also deals with the coming into effect of regulations. 
The objects of the Board are 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
I believe that in fact this agency should have a social conscience.  
In economic terms, this has a significant adverse effect. 
This is a matter of economic balance. 
It will need water sooner or later. 
Businesses and employees cannot keep on paying indefinitely.  
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Our responsibility is to invest our pensions for future generations. 
It is a human cycle. 
Here we have a chance to invest it in an underprivileged region. 
It is a cycle. 
The more we work, the more the investment fund will work.  
The investment future is a means of our purchasing the economic engine of the future. 
We can invest it strategically. 
Hopefully the investment board will do that. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
This is our retirement we are playing with here. 
What words do we hear from the socialists? 
We have to invest ``strategically''. 
We have to have a ``social conscience''. 
It would be our pensions they would be playing with.  
Now they want to use our pension plan.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
I think we have to acknowledge that this is an interesting amendment. 
This can go both ways. 
It must be looked at within the general objective of the statutory scheme. 
This is the spirit in which we will support this amendment.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Canada is a country of immigrants. 
I respect the diversity of Canada and its cultural mosaic. 
Our diversity is our asset, not a liability. 
There is no use crying over spilt milk. 
Emphasis should be on enhancing the equality of Canadians.  
The census is becoming more and more precarious. 
Hyphenation of Canadians weakens and dilutes the Canadian identity and belonging. 
Hyphenation inhibits integration and rather assists segregation of our population. 
Hyphenation of Canadians fosters barriers to equality rather than eliminating those barriers. 
Hyphenation does more harm than good. 
The current policy is promoting diversity at the expense of unity and equality. 
We have many differences among all of us. 
A person could be, for example, a woman and at the same time a mother. 
Like everyone else, I have chosen Canada as my home. 
This is the future of my children and my family. 
Canada has been generous to me and my family. 
I and my family are proud to hold a Canadian passport. 
Like everyone else, I am proud to be a Canadian. 
She is a Canadian government minister. 
When will she call herself a proud Canadian? 
When will she call a Canadian a Canadian? 
When will she have a Canada first attitude? 
Those are the questions many Canadians are asking. 
It is time to define Canadian culture for the 21st century. 
It is never too late. 
It creates different tiers of Canadians.  
Are there some Canadians who are more Canadian than others? 
What can we do? 
Surrendering a hyphen is one thing. 
The best way to draw a line is simply to withdraw that line. 
They are not called Canado Chinese, Canado French or Canado Italian.  
Should we call them Aryan Chinese Canadians? 
How about those with mixed ethnicity like Ukranian Polish French Italian Canadian? 
What should we call them? 
Motion No. 24 has raised more than just a few eyebrows. 
There are many more Canadians across this great land who feel the same way. 
My office has received many telephone calls, letters and e-mail messages. 
I have so many quotes to share but time does not permit me. 
I wanted to quote from about 60 letters.  
It will certainly bridge the gap. 
It will be a step forward toward the elimination of racial barriers. 
Let us promote, encourage and put Canada first. 
Let us work together, recognize the merit of motion 24. 
This is what the silent Canadian majority want. 
It will be a step forward toward eliminating racial barriers. 
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
Our country is not one-dimensional. 
Our collective identity is complex, as are the individuals that make it up.  
These factors enrich our identity.  
Do we deny the diversity of our landscape? 
Do we deny the many events that mark our progress in national maturity? 
Should we deny the reality of our geography, of our regions? 
Even my colleague agrees with me on this. 
He freely admits that he is not opposed to multiculturalism. 
Forty-one MPs in this House are first generation Canadians. 
One does not have to deny one's background to be welcome in Canada.  
It is my right to say who I am. 
I am made up of many different things that make me who I am. 
It does just the opposite. 
I am proud of that. 
This is what multiculturalism policy is all about. 
My colleague's motion is obviously misguided. 
However, it is also the thin end of the wedge. 
Do I tear up my birth certificate which shows that I was born in Trinidad? 
On those grounds alone it should be dismissed forthwith.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That is not a point of order.  
I would like to read it for those who are listening: 
Is its purpose to make laws on that? 
I do not know. 
I do not know, the motion does not mention that.  
Quebec has never ratified it. 
But there is section 15.(1) which states: 
I sincerely believe that this is a debate that we should not be having.  
You will have gathered from what I said that I am opposed to this motion.  
I will conclude with two comments. 
Again, both sides are showing great imagination. 
But they are not really addressing Motion M-24 before us.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Let us not be fooled by the wording of this motion. 
If the member thinks that being different means being less important, it is really sad. 
Does it mean that the only identity acceptable is the one of the majority? 
No. It means being ourselves and wanting to be accepted as such.  
Being equal does not mean to be all the same. 
This is what multiculturalism is all about.  
Multiculturalism is about recognition, acceptance and celebration of differences. 
Equality means equality of opportunities. 
To the contrary, the Reform Party wants multiculturalism to be purged from any government programs. 
Is it a shame to be different? 
Does it mean that we should all hide our roots in order to live together? 
Dangerous concepts and for many reasons.  
It means that difference is not welcome and must be hidden. 
It is normal for people to cherish their specific heritages. 
Removing descriptions does not mean removing differences. 
The names we use to identify ourselves are ways of saying ``Here I am. 
This is the way I am and I want to be respected as such''.  
In fact it is just the reverse. 
It is a strong statement strengthening the vibrant fabric of Canada.  
Let us not give away what we have accomplished. 
In times of economic harshness, intolerance is on the rise. 
This should be a concern for all of us.  
I want to thank all the members for listening to my comments. 
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on the motion. 
We get into the very idea of what it means to be a Canadian. 
I was not born in Canada. 
I came to Canada in 1957 when I was 10 years old. 
Since 1957 I have lived in Canada. 
First and foremost I am a Canadian. 
My mother came here at the same time when she was 36 years old. 
She died very recently. 
She was 76 years old. 
She died as a Canadian. 
She did not forget where she came from.  
They are living in a fascist country. 
We know the native people, our First Nations came to this country first. 
We know that the French factor came to this country. 
We know that the English factor came to this country. 
The other day we were debating the issue of land mines. 
We can recognize differences and try to build the best society that we can. 
Clearly that is not what Canada is about.  
The reality is that we are a multicultural country. 
That is one of our very real strengths.  
I cannot agree with the motion. 
It is misguided at best. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to address the motion. 
I thank my colleague for raising the issue. 
Before coming to parliament I was a teacher. 
That experience taught me a lot about society and about people. 
For almost 25 years I observed the things that happened in my classroom. 
It created a problem for me in the classroom. 
I began to have tensions within my small classroom because of the policy. 
I suggest the same thing is happening in Canada. 
One student asked me ``Are we not all special? 
When are children in classrooms the happiest? 
We have all these things. 
There are many other characteristics we could use.  
I want to give an example. 
We are important because we are people. 
Each one of us has many wonderful qualities. 
We are each special. 
It could create the problem we are actually trying to solve.  
We need to move toward equality. 
We should respect each other's background. 
We have many wonderful things to contribute. 
We need to move toward equality. 
That will do more to solve the problems.  
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Because they always talk about ethnic groups.  
I feel insulted and outraged by these extremists.  
There is no doubt that multiculturalism is an asset. 
It means being different but equal. 
It is a real asset to share with these people. 
The fact that I can speak Italian is something positive. 
Mi fa molto piacere do parlo italiano, signor .  
This is what being Canadian is all about. 
Being Canadian means to benefit from all these cultures.  
This is what makes up the people of Canada.  
I wish to commend our Secretary of State for Multiculturalism on her work. 
Now, today, they want to scrap all of that. 
I cannot understand the logic of some members of the Reform Party. 
One thing that is certain, I hope this motion will be defeated. 
It is an insult to my Canadianism. 
The hon. member for Calgary Centre on a point of order.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
The five minutes is available if no one else rises to speak.  
The hon. member for Bourassa rose to speak. 
He has 10 minutes in his speech. 
The hon. member for Bourassa may bear that in mind as he wishes.  
They have greater merit than I. They chose Canada. 
They know about Canadian values. 
They know about Canada's passion and intrinsic value.  
Ms. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
As I stated earlier in the House, I am a Canadian. 
I have many different ethnic origins coursing in my blood. 
I am very proud to be a Canadian.  
Multi-grained whole wheat bread.  
It is very good for us and full of fibre.  
As Canadians we have that fibre.  
I regret to interrupt the hon. member.  
The hon. member for Surrey Central on a point of order.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
The House has heard the proposal of the hon. member. 
Is there unanimous consent?  
There is no consent.  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
The phenomenon of climate change is the most serious environmental threat of this century. 
It is important to reflect upon why this issue is important to Canada. 
It is also important to put this reality within the global context. 
Most of the population growth occurs in developing nations. 
Developing nations are among the largest smog ridden countries in the world. 
But Kyoto is not an end in itself. 
I do not wish to downplay the importance of the Kyoto meeting. 
No, it will not be easy. 
We just do it. 
They are helping to reduce the number of cars on the road.  
Another example is in Edmonton. 
Government too is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
In so doing we can demonstrate the international leadership for which this country is renowned. 
Our children and our grandchildren deserve no less.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
I suggest that surely the time for a take note debate is long overdue. 
I will go through a few of these.  
They usually begin by reminding us that interstellar space is a cold place. 
Its average temperature is -250C. 
Similar increases of other greenhouse gases have occurred.  
It is commonly referred to as the IPCC report. 
This was a scientific report, prepared and reviewed by scientists.  
He is a Canadian scientist, working for the Canadian government.  
That was all that was said.  
All hon. members have heard that said at one time or another.  
I wonder what scientific study led to that conclusion?  
I am heading into new scientific ground.  
Allow me to make one observation. 
We should re-examine whether such institutions are in fact required. 
I saw this neglected in the minister's presentation. 
Let me talk for a minute about balancing environmental and economic interests. 
It is a great fundamental principle, economic in one dimension and ecological in another.  
That equation should guide both our economic and environmental policies.  
When I do that I try not to give long speeches like this one. 
I try to get young people themselves to talk.  
I often ask them what kind of country they want to live in. 
That would not surprise me at all.  
The government fails to provide an economic impact assessment. 
It fails to provide sectoral impact assessments. 
It fails to provide regional impact assessments. 
It fails to provide a tax impact assessment.  
Where is the assessment from the transportation minister? 
Where is the assessment of the trade minister on the trade impacts? 
We are talking about regional impacts, not gross economic impacts. 
These interests will concentrate on one side of the story. 
Perhaps some of them will exaggerate the impacts. 
There is another interest I want to touch on. 
I refer to that long suffering, oft forgotten interest, the interest of the Canadian taxpayer.  
Canadians know that Liberals have an instinct. 
It must be bred into them. 
We do not know where it comes from. 
This would perhaps be a good subject for a scientific study. 
Most of it was through an increase in tax revenues. 
We are, after all, a federal state.  
Under our constitution responsibility for environmental protection is a shared responsibility. 
That was eight days after the firm commitment was made in Regina.  
It is a classic case of getting the cart before the horse.  
The government has put the cart before the horse. 
It is a classic case of putting the cart before the horse.  
Our alternative process is simply this. 
It is always the last thing to be considered in this House. 
It ought to be the first. 
Number five, if no such agreement is reached, do not sign. 
This is our alternative. 
I have one final word for the Prime Minister. 
He needs to be reminded that 24 Sussex Drive is not on the Equator. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
How should we react to this major challenge? 
But first of all, let us take a brief look at history. 
Society took a long time to realize basic things concerning the environment. 
The environment quickly became a major concern for the whole of society. 
Today, five years later, we are faced with the same potential disasters. 
There are numerous examples. 
However, nothing could be further from the truth. 
Quebec is in a position to meet the objectives set in Rio. 
Unfortunately, the government's failure to act in this issue extends beyond that. 
That is some leadership when hiding one's own position seems to be the objective.  
No reduction objective was discussed.  
That meeting is an unfortunate setback for the environmental cause in Canada. 
That meeting showed the ministers giving in to the demands of the oil lobby.  
Today, it is putting its 1992 commitments off for ten years.  
This would seem to be the government's position.  
In short, the consequences of failing to act now could be disastrous.  
Our era has been marked by frenetic, even aggressive development. 
There must be clear and concrete objectives in order to avoid backsliding. 
We must do better than the Americans' timid objective. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
What we get instead is a total absence of leadership.  
I want to quote directly and I hope I got the exact words. 
That is not reality. 
This is a phenomenon which also needs to be understood in the Canadian context. 
This is precisely why we desperately need leadership from the federal government. 
No uniform formula laid across the nation is going to do it. 
The impacts are going to be different. 
The measures are going to be different.  
No wonder they are not able to just sign on. 
I am not in the habit of rushing to the defence of the Conservative caucus. 
Think about the absurdity of it.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
Ten points for honesty.  
I did not hear the comment of my hon. colleague, Mr. Speaker. 
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
Ten points for honesty.  
The Conservative leader has said that at least you get some points for honesty.  
Canadians want to see honesty in this debate. 
Canadians want to see integrity in this debate. 
Yes, we have a lot of work to do to catch up. 
We talk in terms of meeting our commitments in Rio in 1992. 
Let me say that I absolutely agree with that. 
Of course we need to know the cost. 
Make no mistake about it, there are significant costs. 
It means investing in new technologies like solar and wind power that create jobs.  
Let me give one example. 
Building retrofit programs that conserve energy. 
Some members scoff at that and say it sounds like Mickey Mouse stuff. 
There are additional economic benefits to reducing the effects of global warming. 
Direct savings in energy costs are a direct benefit. 
Some will say that surely that goal is no longer realistic. 
These targets could not be described as totally irresponsible and irrational. 
Surely it cannot be said that these are completely irresponsible, irrational targets to put forward.  
That is simply not true. 
We talked briefly about Germany. 
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
He is not alone. 
He was well remembered by his colleagues. 
He is one of those who has made a lasting contribution to this debate.  
A number of people have taken a keen interest in this issue. 
He would have some intimate knowledge of what happened in Rio. 
There are a few reasons for this. 
First is because we have this great land mass. 
We have the second biggest country in the world in terms of land mass. 
We have three oceans that surround us. 
We have a very fragile northern environment. 
That is of all the developed countries. 
We can easily understand why.  
Think of what our economy is made of. 
It is the forestry sector with pulp and paper and softwood lumber. 
The mining industry is very prominent in this country. 
Of course fishing on both coasts, even in the north, is very important. 
The list goes on and on.  
We live off our environment.  
Their standard of living will depend on how we manage this environment today. 
For that reason alone this is an extremely important issue for Canada. 
There is another twist to this. 
We are also now one of the countries in the world most dependent on trade. 
That is how significant it is.  
Let me finally try to tie this together. 
Our land mass is very vulnerable. 
We live off our environment. 
We are dependent on trade. 
Do not take my word for it. 
Ask those in the pulp and paper industry. 
Why was it asking for the regulations? 
Let us be under no illusion here. 
That is the bottom line.  
As many Canadians, they may see these issues as insurmountable problems. 
There is reason to feel that way at the outset. 
The same is true for a number of environmental issues.  
I want to share this good news with those Canadians listening tonight. 
One of them is the Montreal protocol of 1987. 
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
The smoking gun, the member for Davenport says as an example. 
They wanted the smoking gun. 
That is what was done, and done successfully.  
In fact, there are no pollution free products. 
They do not exist. 
Real progress was marked and we were able to move from there.  
The science is well established. 
It happened maybe a little too late. 
I am talking about acid rain.  
Again I want to be cautious. 
Yet it was not described as that from the beginning.  
There is a real example.  
The problem of acid rain is not solved, far from it. 
We certainly met our objective at the time. 
We made progress since then. 
We were proud of what we were able to accomplish.  
Being at the cabinet table I will take his word for it.  
Yet we had to persevere. 
Yes, we did and we were able to come to an agreement.  
I want to speak on the science aspect. 
Let me be very clear that I am not a scientist. 
It is very challenging.  
We certainly have the best public servants in the world.  
That was a real advantage for me.  
We have in excess of 150 countries involved in the agreement signed in Rio. 
Again Canada was intimately involved.  
There was a conference here in 1988 on the changing atmosphere in Canada. 
Rarely is the science on anything ironclad and absolute. 
To pretend or imply that is the case is to deliberately mislead. 
That should never be allowed to happen.  
I hear members of the Reform Party laughing.  
What do you know about science, Jean?  
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
The member asks what I know about science. 
I wonder what he knows about science. 
I know what international science knows. 
That is why the international panel was put together.  
We even involved municipal governments. 
There was a second convention proposed on protecting biodiversity. 
As well, these people were directly accountable to them.  
Every morning at Rio, there was a meeting of the Canadian delegation. 
For us, and for Canada, this was an extraordinary experience.  
It is completely false to make this kind of insinuation. 
The members who were there know that it was a very open process.  
This Parliament was the first Parliament to ratify it.  
I am sorry today to have to say the opposite. 
I do not know why. 
They should have been though. 
The same applies to the private sector and environmental groups. 
However, that is not what we feel. 
I do not know about the environmental groups. 
But the provincial governments were not involved from the start.  
They do not tend to involve the provinces. 
It does not come naturally to them. 
It must be tough in cabinet. 
I can see them around the table. 
They raise their hands, and the Prime Minister gives them each a turn. 
And the Prime Minister replied ``Next item on the agenda. 
This is very serious. 
I am being very honest tonight as we try to assess ourselves. 
That is very ambitious. 
I would beg to disagree with the leader of the NDP on that. 
The leader of the Reform Party has shied away. 
There is a real test of absolute rigour. 
I hope no one from any other country is listening. 
Everyone will remember Meech Lake.  
I guess that is new science also.  
We need to recognize that in Canada there has to be regional variances. 
The second one has to do with joint implementation. 
Here Canada should really lead the way. 
Canada takes great pride in the role it plays in developing countries. 
The third principle should be some flexibility also in the commitments we make. 
This is a little more complicated and it is new. 
That is the use of economic instruments. 
Here we have to be clear. 
We are opposed to the use of carbon taxes. 
Let me take a second to explain why.  
We already use energy in our country for the purposes of taxation. 
In Canada it is. 
In this respect we could argue that we already have a carbon tax. 
This is something rather difficult to understand for the public. 
Our American neighbours are using it. 
We live in a market based economy. 
Tradable permits could very well and should be part of the initiatives that Canada embraces. 
The paper that was produced was quite weak. 
The government should be encouraged since others have taken up the cause. 
Fifth, the government should get some recognition for the management of our carbon sink. 
Canada's land mass contains 10% of the world's forests. 
There is a lot of enlightened self-interest involved here also. 
Others have spoken about measures to get more economy out of the use of energy. 
Efforts in that area will be spoken of. 
Our environment critic, the member for Fundy-Royal, will speak on this issue. 
He will detail some of the work we have done. 
We wish the delegation well in Kyoto. 
We did well in Rio. 
I hope our overall discussion this evening will be useful, constructive and realistic.  
Our government has been participating throughout.  
I hope that spirit can prevail in this House as well.  
We do not need histrionics and hyperbole. 
We cannot shrink from the challenge or shirk the responsibility.  
Forty per cent of our gross domestic product is derived from exports. 
Eighty per cent of our trade is with the United States.  
We cannot say ``Stop the world, I want to get off''. 
We need to make a solid, comprehensive team Canada effort. 
We must all strive to be part of the solution. 
We must all work very closely together as partners. 
That is the provincial attitude overall and it is helpful.  
They have not buried their heads in the sand. 
They have not tried to deny reality. 
We are interested in the use of joint implementation schemes with other nations. 
These and perhaps other measures are likely to be part of the overall package. 
We want a deal that works. 
We want a deal that makes sense both environmentally and economically. 
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
That program is called Green Saver. 
It shows the impact on climate change and emissions. 
They have documented the progress that individuals have been able to make.  
Hon. Ralph E. Goodale:
The hon. member referred to one very useful example. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Hon. Ralph E. Goodale:
It demands real and serious attention. 
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
This should have happened a year and a half ago.  
It is too late. 
This is not the way to go to an international event.  
She withdrew her comments within a day. 
Obviously some people in her caucus got to her.  
Canada is a different country. 
It has a smaller population and wide expanse. 
It is a cold country. 
Yet, with Canada's expanse, we are trying to that. 
For example, Canada has done a pretty good job in many areas. 
Other countries, particularly the European bloc, are at the beginning. 
There needs to be a balancing. 
What I am suggesting is a level playing field.  
That formula has not been addressed by the government. 
I do not believe it will be addressed at Kyoto. 
I think that is correct.  
This is a global problem which requires a global solution. 
That commitment to my knowledge is not being asked for. 
There has to be some agreement that gets all of us into the arena together.  
We keep hearing that Canada's problems are huge. 
The provinces were consulted in the last couple of months. 
We are going to Kyoto. 
What happened two weeks ago in Regina? 
The Minister of Natural Resources just commented on what a good deal that was. 
Where is the commitment? 
Where is the economic analysis? 
We can take various scenarios. 
The government has dropped the ball. 
That is not the way to do it.  
I hope this can be avoided in the future.  
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I would ask the hon. member for Nanaimo-Alberni the following question.  
There is a vast difference of opinion in the climate change report.  
If we pick selective sentences from that summary, they can be exceedingly misleading.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Madam Speaker, I have a couple of questions for my hon. colleague. 
I find a couple of points to be a bit confusing.  
The hon. member said that this was a global problem which required a global solution. 
I do not understand. 
I find rather confusing. 
This is the time to question the science.  
We did not question the science in the cod fishery. 
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Then the flag of possible potential taxes is waved. 
This is totally absurd in this political debate tonight.  
Enough said about the pathetic performance by the leader of the Reform Party. 
This issue is posing to us a number of interesting conclusions. 
This convergence is unique. 
It is efficient in use and available in large quantities, particularly in our western provinces.  
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
That is precisely what has happened. 
Every major indicator shows a deterioration in natural systems. 
The stratospheric ozone layer continues to thin. 
Greenhouse gases are accumulating. 
The number of plant and animal species is diminishing. 
We simply cannot survive the pathway''.  
Madam Speaker, the short answer is yes. 
We have noticed in a variety of ways the deterioration of natural systems. 
Evidently it is not an easy matter. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The anticipated effects for Canada as a whole are disastrous. 
Such short-sighted vision does not serve the interests of anyone in Canada. 
This is the Bloc Quebecois' position.  
What will the Liberal government do, just days before the deadline? 
Cabinet ministers are very divided on the issue.  
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I have a comment to which the member can respond. 
The member for Sherbrooke mentioned that in his speech. 
Often we do not try to put a number on that. 
This is the problem with industrial structure. 
We do not have a cost of pollution. 
Some interesting things have happened recently in the United States. 
These credits are now traded on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
Environmental groups like Greenpeace are buying them. 
They are removing these credits which limits the ability of these companies to pollute. 
What does the member think about that kind of concept?  
I truly believe that this can be achieved.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Madam Speaker, we have a big problem. 
This keeps us very comfortable on our planet.  
With industrialization, we have doubled the number of parts per million. 
We are going to get fried if we are not careful.  
Do we have much time left to take action? 
Our contribution is important, but it is not the only one. 
It will not be easy. 
There are considerable variations within Canada. 
Quebec produces around 9 tonnes of gas per inhabitant. 
The worst occurs when the prairies can no longer produce wheat. 
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Natural laws are immutable. 
We must learn our lesson from climate change. 
We must legislate and govern as if the Earth mattered.  
Not paper reductions but real reductions that can be measured by nature's account balance.  
We have a duty. 
The private sector must be encouraged to increase energy efficiencies. 
A number of initiatives currently exist and must be expanded. 
The Ontario Green Communities program is a community success story. 
Energy efficiency activities are job creators. 
This a win-win agenda. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
The media went to sleep on it. 
The government has barely taken any leadership on it. 
That is the political rhetoric of it.  
As an individual and as an aboriginal person, my learnings and my world view- 
Member spoke in Cree ] 
We will never know these children. 
We will never know them but they are ours. 
Collectively all our children are coming.  
This is what the draft agreement includes. 
We have not put money toward this.  
Here in Canada we do not have an investment within our own domestic efforts. 
There is also the tradable permits. 
Tradable permits are putting a carbon value. 
However, it is a negative value, but it is going to be a polluter pays. 
When we talk about sinks, it is a carbon reservoir. 
Three as presently in the agreement or a total of six? 
There are six gases that should be discussed, not just three.  
We never heard about it. 
The media plays an important part. 
We spend about $600 million as a tax incentive for the oil sands industry. 
Let us challenge ourselves. 
Let us challenge our intellectual and engineering communities. 
On the issue of preserving our forests, there are forests in the province of Manitoba. 
There is no dollar value on the northern boreal forests. 
It is releasing carbon as it happens.  
Transitional funding is a major issue. 
There is going to be transitional funding for industry.  
The Minister of the Environment raised the issue of the coal industry. 
It is not wholehearted.  
We look at the international negotiations like a bubble. 
Canada is a bubble in itself. 
We have to do it as a collective effort for humankind.  
I would like to call it the term of greed, which in my language is- 
Member spoke in Cree ] 
When we are greedy, when we want something so much, that is sinful. 
That is a major disruption. 
We just have to look at it and take on the challenge.  
It started in Rio. 
It does not start next month.  
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Does the hon. member have the consent of the House to split his time?  
Thank you for the consent. 
I need no further proof that we have an impending problem. 
I am not saying growth is bad. 
The challenge we collectively face as politicians is this. 
Addressing these issues is going to involve leadership. 
It is going to involve increased levels of co-operation. 
And if not now, when?  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
All of this I find most worrisome, as do all Canadians.  
We have the second highest rate of greenhouse gas emissions per person. 
Since 1990 these emissions have increased by 13%.  
The science of climate change is sound and it is compelling. 
The global climate is warming at a more rapid rate. 
We must do this because Canada must be part of the international solution. 
To do otherwise would be untenable and irresponsible.  
All Canadians must be engaged in this debate. 
The challenge of climate change does not have to be a crisis. 
We must take this opportunity to make Canada a more efficient and innovative nation. 
We need to work very hard to ensure that this will not happen. 
All Canadians need to work hard on this issue. 
We owe it to the generations that follow.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
It is really just a way of getting this little story on the record. 
I remember reading this about 20 years ago. 
These people say that the sky is falling. 
They want us to take unnecessary measures''. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member opposite for that wonderful story. 
I think that is important and certainly that is the position of this government. 
We will continue to do so. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
The Kyoto conference on climate change is less than one week away. 
The issue of climate change is real and it is complex. 
I think it is because it still lives in the ice age.  
Global warming from a Canadian perspective is indeed a national problem. 
This government's made in the U.S.A. approach is not leadership. 
The science and technology that addresses climate change is evolving. 
The environment minister should heed her own advice. 
Today over 150 countries have ratified this protocol.  
Even the finance minister is trying to get in on the act. 
For this government the environment has not been a priority.  
A global problem like climate change requires global solutions. 
New taxes are not part of a constructive solution.  
The implementation gap must be closed on public education as well. 
A modern transportation policy must be developed for the 21st century. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Is the hon. member asking a question or making a comment on this speech?  
He has less than that, in fact.  
Mr. Speaker, I want to ask the hon. member his perception of something.  
A premature view is evident among countries. 
The member talked about a made in Canada solution. 
Or, should Canada hold back and follow other nations? 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
He raises a very important issue.  
It is possible that the result in Kyoto could be no deal. 
At a minimum we have to try to engage the developing nations. 
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
I feel very strongly that we have to listen to the scientists on this issue. 
That is an absolute outrage. 
I think that is reprehensible. 
To do nothing is irresponsible.  
It refused to embrace the challenges of fisheries management. 
That is what Canadians expect of us.  
I would like to point out some other examples of actions which are providing solutions. 
Carbon dioxide emissions will be reduced at this facility by more than 350,000 tonnes.  
What we have to do is act. 
That is exactly what we intend to do.  
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for allowing me to participate in this debate. 
Let us start doing it.  
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
I am on the standing committee of environment and sustainable development. 
Over the last while we have had numerous scientists come to us as witnesses. 
One of the people who came to us was a scientist from Newfoundland, an oceanographer. 
He had quite a different view of what was going on. 
Would you be able to be more accurate?  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
There are trucks on the highways that look like trains, for God's sake. 
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
That could not be further from the truth. 
I think it would be truly tragic to end up in a situation like that. 
The data is there and is indisputable.  
Quite frankly, I think it is unethical and dishonest.  
There must be a broad public debate and discussion in this country. 
Governments have engaged industry in the dialogue. 
Industry has presented a strong position. 
However, industry is only one-third of the problem. 
It was the Liberal responsibility to achieve that. 
I do not think that really serves us well.  
Based on that, it is important that we get this whole issue into perspective.  
I think it would be quite foolish to do that.  
They could not afford to buy groceries. 
People called me from reserves in northern Alberta. 
They could not afford to buy heating fuel for their homes.  
It is in serious trouble all around the world from a number of sources.  
We heard the Conservatives talk about the wonderful things they had achieved. 
We just urge caution.  
Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
The problem has been that all Canadians have not been engaged in this debate. 
There are both points of view out there.  
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
The process provides justification for the description of substantial scientific consensus''.  
Mr. Speaker, pure greenhouse gas. 
I think that is a valid position for them to take.  
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is totally false. 
John Balling, Jr. represents Western Fuels and British Coal Mining Association. 
That is who pays him. 
He was not part of the IPCC. 
He told us about the tidal waves that had started to visit his islands. 
The first time the waves caused significant damage. 
If it was something in between, my island-state would disappear under the sea completely. 
I ask is it right and fair? 
Is it acceptable to Canadians who believe so strongly in equity and justice? 
Meanwhile, the leader of the opposition speaks like the dinosaur he is.  
On the contrary, they have increased substantially.  
We can and must do better.  
I will describe one last example. 
Why should these turbines not be Canadian?  
Let us be bold rather than timid. 
Let us lead rather than follow. 
Let us bet squarely on energies of the 21st century, renewable energies, clean energies. 
Let us bet on a clean and sustainable future for our children.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Of course he was referring to the 1966 report.  
I would like to quote a few select lines from the report. 
It is a theory. 
It is an interesting theory. 
I find it very interesting, but I do not swallow it holus-bolus. 
I want to see more evidence.  
Mr. Speaker, it is very interesting that the member quoted Frederick Seitz.  
I am going to refer to the book entitled ``The Heat is On''. 
The quote is from an article in the Wall Street Journal . 
Frederick Selz is a director of the Marshall institute. 
So much for Selz. 
It was purely an opinion. 
He admits himself that it did not represent scientific fact.  
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Does the House grant unanimous consent?  
Without being alarmists, these researchers foresee disastrous consequences.  
Yet only a rare few have made an effort to keep that promise. 
The Bloc Quebecois is asking the government to shoulder its responsibilities.  
It is vital that the industrialized countries adopt very stringent objectives at Kyoto. 
Greenhouse gases are a threat to humanity. 
Is it too late for the government to do its homework? 
We cannot accept mere wishful thinking. 
Too many young people are expecting us to preserve their planet.  
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
The problem of greenhouse gases is not a new one. 
In fact, Canada's performance is disastrous. 
What we see is the exact opposite.  
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Rail transportation is a low emitter. 
Our country was built on rail. 
Bullet trains are used elsewhere in the world. 
These trains could be used from Quebec City to Toronto. 
So, there is one side of the issue that does not sound right.  
We cannot rely on ethanol to save our environment. 
We have a technology, the electric car, that is currently under development. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
The risk of inaction is just too great. 
We really cannot put this problem off into the future. 
We have to deal with it now. 
It involves matters of public policy. 
It involves matters of scientific and technical research. 
It is a very politically charged issue as well.  
Are there winners and losers? 
Is it a win-win or is it a lose-lose situation?  
If we deal with climate change we will create a large movement in technology development.  
We will be able to sell and license these environmental technologies abroad.  
I have oversimplified the argument but basically that is the essence of it. 
We need to have a fallback position. 
The agreements we reach in Kyoto must be achievable. 
We know from the Rio experience that targets must be realistic and achievable. 
To do this in Canada we need to do a few things.  
First, we need to agree on realistic targets. 
One plant is allocated 500 units and the other plant another 500 units of emissions. 
There is a consideration. 
One plant pays the other to buy its unused emissions target. 
The United States has some. 
We really do not have a lot of experience to draw on. 
There are voluntary measures.  
We waste a lot of heat.  
Twenty-seven per cent of greenhouse gases originate in the transportation sector.  
In fact, that is not the case. 
It just becomes in my view unmanageable. 
How would the member see that system working?  
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question from the member opposite. 
With emissions trading, the experience we have as I mentioned is quite limited. 
The market pressures are reasonable. 
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member makes an interesting point. 
Does he see cogeneration as a commercially viable option?  
Mr. Speaker, I welcome the question.  
I did not have a chance to deal at any length on cogeneration. 
It also has a huge environmental impact.  
You are selling electricity at the margin.  
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
This government is hypocritical in its approach to environmental strategies. 
However, Canadians still do not know what form these costs will take.  
Canadians deserved answers months and months ago. 
Weeks ago President Bill Clinton put the American position out for all to see. 
But the government's silence continues.  
Has this government even got support from its own cabinet? 
This government refuses to co-operate with Canadians on all fronts. 
It has refused to engage in an open and meaningful democratic dialogue.  
Unfortunately Canadians will likely pay the price for this government's lack of democratic consultation.  
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
So let us take that out of the loop. 
I am curious as to what the hon. member thinks independent of that process. 
So let us take that out of the way.  
Canada puts out 2% of the world's emissions. 
Since 1990 that has grown only by 8%. 
It was thought it would be 13% but it has been reduced. 
There have been programs implemented and voluntary moves by industry.  
We only have to look at what we are doing with recycling. 
Everybody in this country recycles because we trained our children. 
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
My hon. colleague who is a medical doctor spoke earlier in the House. 
I am not sure where that figure comes from.  
Those are costs that cannot be quantified. 
What are the types of programs we are going to have in place? 
What is the government proposing to be done to meet these emissions reductions?  
Any voluntary action that can be made to reduce emissions would be tremendous. 
It was not right. 
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
Let us look at one particular aspect of the problem, transportation. 
How do we do this?  
This includes $1,200 in direct costs and $512 in tax exemptions.  
Surely this policy area needs re-examination.  
I sincerely hope the department gives this more than a cursory examination.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
These are real measurements, real science, not computer models. 
Is the hon. member familiar with the program and could he comment on it?  
The government is certainly attempting to do that. 
We can expect a lot of very beneficial things coming out of Kyoto.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
That indicates a certain weakness in their arguments. 
Such is the state of scholarship near the end of the 20th century.  
Climate is a cyclical phenomenon. 
It always has been and always will be. 
That is in the last 150 years. 
I submit that is normal, predictable and reasonable in a cyclical system. 
They are not local data. 
They are data for the whole planet. 
These satellites are in different positions every second and the measurements are being taken constantly. 
This is true science. 
I spoke about the cycles of climate. 
These things have been going on forever. 
That would be 950 AD or thereabouts.  
Now these areas are deserts. 
They have been deep deserts for hundreds and hundreds of years. 
It did not happen due to any human activity. 
There were not large numbers of humans on earth in those days. 
Yet there were these drastic climatic changes.  
They are an archaeological treasure.  
It did not work for him and it will not work for us. 
This is not science. 
It has very large divergences of opinion within the body.  
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question to the hon. member is very simple. 
Does he believe that the Chinese are part of his conspiracy theory?  
Mr. Speaker, I am afraid the hon. member lost me. 
The northern parts of China may be warming. 
The world is warming. 
We have already said that most people will agree on that. 
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
I really take exception to that. 
That is all we get.  
We are adults here, at least some of us.  
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question will be short.  
Are all world governments operating with incorrect or faulty scientific information. 
Is it only the Reform Party that has the straight facts on this one?  
Mr. Speaker, science is not determined by a show of hands. 
I would answer the hon. member's question with an analogy. 
Yes, but the Bloc Quebecois member was not present. 
Consequently, the hon. member for Lotbiniere has the floor.  
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
My speech will deal with two important issues. 
I would ask the Prime Minister who is responsible for environmental issues in his government. 
The Minister of the Environment or the Reform Party?  
This study indicated as well that the average temperature would rise by 4 degrees Celsius.  
The Minister of Finance claims to be concerned by the greenhouse effect. 
He said that the question should be managed by several departments. 
Here again we can see where the Liberal government stands.  
The commitments of the Liberal government with respect to the environment are clearly inadequate. 
And he went on to say that we all know that we can do more.  
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join this debate on global climate change. 
Like other members, I regret the 10 minute time limit. 
The great forests of the earth are disappearing rapidly. 
Perhaps I should say that the great forest of the earth is disappearing rapidly. 
Some of them have become deserts. 
Automobiles and factories with their emissions are still multiplying and so on.  
Some of the direct effects on the atmosphere of such changes are already well established. 
It is not a matter of conjecture.  
Carbon dioxide, CO2, has been increasing in the atmosphere for generations. 
The changes which we have measured are bad enough in themselves. 
Ground-level ozone affects our lungs. 
It makes breathing difficult for those with lung problems. 
It decreases athletic performance. 
It also has a significant impact on agricultural production. 
Who wants to live in a poisonous greenhouse, whether it be warm or cold?  
We should never consume energy unnecessarily. 
It is inefficient, uneconomical and unhealthy to do so. 
As I have said, we are dealing with a huge system: our atmosphere. 
By the time we can detect effects, it is often too late. 
Let's take the lead in this matter in Kyoto and beyond.  
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member on his speech.  
It is my understanding that the hon. member used to teach at a university. 
I have listened carefully to the Reform Party. 
The peer review process is quite simple. 
It is when a scientist submits an article to a journal. 
I mentioned three papers of my own. 
The other is not refereed. 
I think it is important to distinguish between those two.  
I have mainly worked on glaciers and on lake ice. 
It is in fact a trend that we are talking about.  
The member opposite was talking about the fluctuations of climate. 
The climate of the globe continually fluctuates. 
There is also the matter of physics. 
It is true those gases have increased in the atmosphere.  
We do not just have to depend on figures and trends. 
That is in fact what the scientific community is doing at the present time.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
The protection of our environment is logical for several reasons. 
I will give you an example. 
They show a total lack of respect for our planet. 
These speeches should not even be tolerated. 
It is all fine and well to talk about scientists and experts. 
Because the company was profitable. 
Please excuse my language, Mr. Speaker. 
In fact, they have increased over the last five years.  
I just do not believe in voluntary participation.  
They talk of the costs involved if we adopt a responsible position. 
But we are already paying the price for failing to act.  
In fact, the government has conducted a study on the impact of climate change. 
The costs are very high when there are floods. 
When fish stocks disappear, communities suffer. 
We must act and act now. 
There are alternatives that can create jobs while protecting our environment. 
I was speaking with CN officials this week. 
I asked them how many trucks on the road three locomotives would replace. 
They told me they would replace 250 tractor trailers. 
What will happen to these tires later on? 
Most likely they will be another source of pollution. 
Now, six locomotives would do the same job as 500 trucks on the road. 
We are already behind Europe on these issues. 
We must act now to remain competitive in the energy sector.  
We have this reputation, because we are the leaders in a number of areas. 
We show the world that assuming our responsibilities means creating a better world.  
They want their government to act responsibly and fairly. 
They want us to be brave now. 
Now we no longer have any fish and entire communities are suffering.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
When the debate started yesterday, we ended up with 10 days to Kyoto. 
Let me explain what the Reform position is. 
It is one of very questionable science. 
I quote the consensus of 2,500 scientists that these members have been referring to. 
Many climatologists feared the world was headed for a mini ice age. 
This was referred to by my Reform colleague earlier. 
There are all sorts of impacts on our climate that are natural impacts. 
Let us take a look at Kyoto. 
The countries that are going to Kyoto are countries like Canada. 
They are not going to Kyoto.  
The possibility of climate change is a global issue and must be addressed collectively. 
Therein lies the problem with the agreement from Brazil.  
The problem there was that the goals were not realistic. 
They were not achievable. 
As we have clearly demonstrated they were not based on sound scientific evidence. 
Who are the negotiators and what is the position the negotiators will take? 
We have no idea. 
Who is going to be giving them direction?  
What is at stake for people in my constituency of Kootenay-Columbia? 
What does that mean? 
This reminds me so much of lemmings. 
In conclusion, a UN panel report stated: 
The appropriate portfolio will differ for each country. 
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
There are connections the member seems to ignore.  
This is a very clear piece of information.  
The member opposite does not seem to believe in any of this. 
There may be a relationship but we simply do not know. 
We are not just talking about CO2 emissions. 
She says we must do something significant on climate change. 
This would be a quantum leap. 
In the case of CO2 it would reduce worldwide CO2 emissions by .2%.  
Once again the position of the Liberals is one of do good, feel good.  
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
I am referring to the scientific method.  
These would be the results. 
The real disturbing thing is what the Liberals are proposing. 
This concerns me deeply.  
For as long as they have kept records, it was never colder. 
This will hurt ordinary average Canadians.  
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to raise an issue with the hon. member. 
He was discussing taxes in his speech. 
All of a sudden the petroleum industry raises prices without warning. 
They finally recognize that there is an environmental problem. 
That is where their policy seems to be. 
Those gases are trapped inside the atmosphere.  
We live and breathe as a species, collectively. 
That is what we have to realize.  
His children and grandchildren will be the voters of the future. 
They will be the ones to decide who will lead.  
I would like to see taxes scaled back.  
That would kill even more jobs in this country.  
Payroll taxes will increase. 
The cost to employers will increase. 
We are crippled by taxes. 
I cannot even comment on what the man said. 
It made no sense. 
Pursuant to order made Tuesday, November 25, the motion is deemed adopted.  
(The House adjourned at 1.50 a.m.)
