EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 35 
Friday, November 21, 1997 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the request for unanimous consent. 
Is there unanimous consent?  
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Canadian telecom service providers and Canadian telecom manufacturers are the best in the world. 
After two years of negotiations an agreement was reached on February 15, 1997. 
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on behalf of this bill. 
Those worthy objectives warrant support of this bill.  
Many steps have been taken. 
The legislation before us implements the terms and the provisions of those agreements.  
I met recently with the the economic development officer for the town of Markham. 
The critical mass is some 700 companies.  
They have established a centre where old computers are refurbished. 
Canada is at the forefront. 
We are leaders in this technology. 
The way to do that is through open competition. 
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Perhaps overall it will improve the system. 
I would like the hon. member to comment on this, please.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I listened to the comments from the hon. member from the Liberal party. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond to the member. 
I believe that Canada and Canadians will benefit. 
We will benefit in two very specific ways. 
That will mean more jobs and better jobs for people right across this country. 
I believe that is what competition will do. 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Telecommunications in Canada are in constant evolution. 
The standard communication networks are giving way to new technologies. 
In 1993, international communications traffic reached 47.7 billion minutes. 
This bill therefore has two objectives.  
As for section 46.6, 
What does the ``affordability'' of a basic service mean? 
Thus this becomes a control over individuals and society. 
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Our party supports free enterprise.  
The other comment I have is on the financial fund that is being set up. 
This is another opportunity for the government to expand its patronage program.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
All the questions she raised on this bill are topical. 
In this area, we are in a good position. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
When I hear the word liberalizing, I hear steroids for the CRTC. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, on a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the proposal of the chief government whip. 
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is there unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
There is not unanimous consent.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. 
I do give unanimous consent.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the chief government whip.  
Is there unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. chief government whip on a point of order.  
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to move a technical amendment. 
Essentially we are making sure that both the French and the English versions are consistent. 
``flore, ainsi que les ressources naturelles exceptionnel '' 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
For the first time, Quebec will maintain ownership of the seabed.  
This is a good step and a good result.  
In that sense, this is very desirable.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
This award is given to individuals who have undergone great suffering in a heroic manner. 
You have truly lived up to the Scout promise and the Scout law.  
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
I also had the pleasure of welcoming them in the House of Commons.  
Your compassion and devotion are a big help in times of trouble.  
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
The future belongs to the bold.  
The people of the Matapedia valley are taking the challenge.  
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
I rise in the House today to tell of a success story. 
That is a 6% cent reduction.  
The hon. member for Abitibi.  
Mr. Guy Saint-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
For reservations, dial 996-6740.  
Come see the new bingo reform.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the government is downloading small regional airports throughout the country. 
The population is only 4,500, a small town with a big heart. 
WYE MARSH WILDLIFE CENTRE 
Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
It will open up multimillion dollar investment opportunities for Canadian and Chinese entrepreneurs. 
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
The number of hits this year increased by 238%.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
An apology is due.  
Aboriginal youth were torn from their families and communities. 
Their language, culture, customs and values were suppressed. 
An apology from this government would be one small remedy that would begin the healing. 
Anything less is unconscionable, unforgivable and unacceptable.  
ROYAL COMMISSION ON ABORIGINAL PEOPLES 
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
Member spoke in Inuktitut ] 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, where have all the scarecrows gone?  
This fall, however, our scarecrows have stayed out of sight, strangely enough. 
It is true that there is a lot of good news.  
This has sent our economic scarecrows into hiding.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, this is restorative justice week. 
True justice cultivates strength rather than perpetuating failure. 
INTEGRATED MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGIES INSTITUTE 
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
They can be proud of their work with the United Nations.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Canadians want to get out their holiday parcels. 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Let the system work. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, charities are being hurt the worst. 
Take, for example, the Old Brewery Mission in Montreal, a homeless shelter. 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Shame on the opposition.  
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, small and medium size businesses are the engine of this economy. 
For weeks the effects of a mail strike have been looming over their heads. 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, under the collective bargaining system the parties have the right to strike. 
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
Four strikes in ten years. 
There have been seven months of failed negotiations.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
In the seven months of this year, there have been fewer days lost than that.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the acting Prime Minister.  
The bad odour surrounding the Option Canada affair is getting worse. 
Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):
This party has never been able to accept that verdict. 
They continue to fight a battle of two years ago. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  
He calls on the federal government to honour its earlier agreements.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
This is what we will do at the conference in a few weeks.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
This gentleman is meeting with the provinces, the fishermen, the associations and the communities. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.  
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
There are no other operations for Marine Atlantic.  
Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
It will be 1990 levels by the year 2007.  
We cannot get the government's position in this House. 
Who is going to pay for this?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
That is their whole goal over there.  
Again, who is going to pay for this position?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We are consulting with all stakeholders.  
The provinces are very much involved in this process. 
That is what we are going to do.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Solicitor General.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
We will be acting on those recommendations shortly.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is profoundly wrong. 
We were found to be right. 
The hon. member is wrong.  
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, forgive me for my scepticism on this matter. 
Randy Conners and a number of others have died. 
These are precious people who have died while this minister obstructed Justice Krever.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We did anything but obstruct the Krever commission.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the prime minister has showed that he has finally had enough. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
We appreciate its support.  
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
The prime minister claims the right of appointing senators. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my hon. friend is asking for an amendment to the Constitution. 
It is a very interesting suggestion. 
That is the Reform position on everything.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I met the Minister of Finance several times this week.  
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
The economy is creating jobs at twice its normal rate. 
Yet not all Canadians are participating in this economic recovery. 
The unemployment rate remains stubbornly high at 9.1% 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
This represents a tax cut of $1.4 billion.  
The hon. member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
This issue has been swept under the red carpet.  
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
They can have a face to face dialogue with him, firm but non-confrontational''.  
I would submit that is an indication of what we are trying to do.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
My question is clear. 
Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.  
The report is not on the shelf. 
Rather it is one of the most important tools we have at our disposal. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Will the Liberal government acknowledge support of this recommendation?  
Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
We want to table the right response. 
We are working with the provincial governments and the aboriginal peoples.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of International Trade.  
What will the government do to address the issue?  
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of International Trade.  
All the products do not always get reloaded.  
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would dearly love to. 
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, yesterday was National Child Day. 
Upon reflection this may explain some of the actions in the House yesterday.  
When are you going to stop taxing them?  
The hon. Minister of Health.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is no question that early intervention is critical to children. 
As chair of the national children's agenda- 
It is difficult for the Chair to hear the answer.  
I invite the hon. Minister of Health to resume his answer.  
It is called community action program for children. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the answer is that we are not doing such a thing.  
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
It has happened not only in relation to TAGS but across Canada. 
This is the way it works.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
My question is for the Minister of Finance. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is not the auditor general's position. 
In any event, the auditor general's position will be clarified.  
Mr. Ian Murray (Lanark-Carleton, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry.  
Canadians have become alarmed at the victimization of vulnerable people by fraudulent telemarketers. 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the minister in charge of CIDA is mismanaging her department. 
The hon. member is asking us to put in another layer of bureaucracy. 
EXPORTS OF DEFENCE GOODS 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this has to do with the tabling of a report.  
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is addressed to the Minister of Natural Resources. 
Devco's chairman, Mr. Joe Shannon, pretends to be working hard to modernize Devco.  
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
I am pleased with the work they are doing under difficult circumstances.  
Facing an international environment for these types of markets is a difficult process. 
They are doing a very good job. 
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Let me repeat it.  
That will bring to a close the question period for today.  
I want to congratulate all my colleagues on this very happy anniversary occasion.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, on a point of order.  
I was just wondering about your comment. 
I am sure the hon. member would not to confuse the issue.  
I have notice of a question of privilege.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Reform did not introduce an amendment that would protect these employees. 
That is the test of a question of privilege.  
I will consider the matter closed.  
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, on a point of order.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
How can we do that?  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, on the same point of order. 
I do not know how we can actually stand up in this House- 
I do not think this is a point of order. 
Hon. members are free to stand, or sit in their seats, as they wish. 
There is no obligation on members to stand or do whatever. 
I think the matter is closed. 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Vaughan-King-Aurora, Lib.):
The hon. member for Calgary West on a point of privilege.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
There is no question of privilege.  
Sadly, all too often marriages in Canada end in divorce. 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.) moved: 
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I move: 
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
The first three petitions call for the Prime Minister to declare Canada indivisible. 
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or, NDP):
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, today we will answer Question No. 12. .[Text] 
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver): 
Mr. Speaker, I move that the other questions stand.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Thank you, Mr. Speaker- 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I think we are getting into a debate here. 
I invite him to raise the matter with the minister. 
If he is unable to resolve it satisfactorily he may come back. 
The hon. member for Calgary East on debate.  
The hon. chief government whip on a point of order.  
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
Is the House ready for the question?  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
The hon. chief government whip on a point of order.  
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
The question is on the motion for concurrence in Bill C-7. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The House heard the proposal of the chief government whip. 
When shall the bill be read the third time? 
They have examined Bill C-7 and gone through an examination clause by clause. 
All Canadians can be proud as stewards of their marine environment. 
In this case particularly in terms of the beluga whale.  
As I mentioned earlier, we are seeing this with this legislation.  
As members know, a big part of the mandate of Parks Canada is stewardship. 
We are developing a system of marine conservation areas across Canada. 
Together we will all strive to ensure the sustainability of these critical marine ecosystems.  
I am pleased to see that type of support. 
We all feel our own places are special. 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
The legislative process that we entered into in this House is very important. 
All steps in the process are very important. 
The committee members unanimously defeated the call for witnesses. 
The committee did not do its job. 
It did not do due diligence. 
The rubber stamp was unanimous by all other parties.  
Today we now have the committee acting like a rubber stamp.  
What are the implications for other users of the river? 
What are the implications because of the overlay of the park regulations? 
Parks cannot be established in isolation or in a vacuum. 
Consultation is required in order to ensure that they work well.  
This was not realized.  
Parks are an important issue to the Reform Party. 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
On June 5, 1997, Quebec's National Assembly passed Bill 86.  
I am delighted to see that the process is about to be completed.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Burin-St. 
George's would like to speak on the bill. 
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank members for their consent. 
It must be Friday.  
Congratulations on making the park a success.  
This party believes that the project goes a long in doing just that. 
I am happy to state that we will continue to do that.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
We have waited a long time for this bill. 
The idea of a marine park was first introduced twelve years ago. 
Better late than ever, we could all say. 
There has to be a balance.  
Four billion years; it gives one pause for reflection. 
Mankind is pretty insignificant, when all is said and done.  
This underwater vegetation provide a habitat for many kinds of fish.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
All Canadians will benefit from the preservation of this unique marine ecosystem.  
Aboriginal participation was ensured and input from all stakeholders was accepted.  
Nor do I call for an amendment. 
I thank the House for the opportunity to speak on these matters. 
Mr. Guy Saint-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
On December 12, 1996, both governments tabled their respective bills. 
However, the Quebec National Assembly adopted Bill 86 on June 5, 1997. 
The provincial legislation will come into force when the federal legislation is promulgated. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the motion. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or, NDP) moved: 
Their wages come from coal and their wages fuel the economy.  
Over 73,000 men and women are employed in the coal industry in Canada today. 
Coal mining today is not the industry it used to be. 
Today, mining is highly mechanized and heavily regulated. 
One machine now does what many men used to. 
Technology cannot solve all of our problems, but it can certainly help. 
In the 1930s there were 400 small coal mines. 
I can say with pride that Devco employs the best miners in the world. 
Those Cape Breton miners are today looking to their crown corporation. 
They want to do their fair share.  
It would take thousands and thousands of jobs with it. 
I will provide the House with a background of Devco's history. 
Realizing the chaos this would cause, the government stepped in.  
Despite this, Devco has become more efficient and more effective. 
The contingency is the Donkin mine.  
Donkin is the future of Devco and Devco remains the future of Cape Breton.  
Donkin is a huge coal reserve beneath the Atlantic. 
The mine itself has already been built, at taxpayer expense. 
The geology looks good and the quality looks even better.  
That could be expanded once it is clear that a profit can be made.  
Donkin is the gold mine of coal mines. 
Canadian taxpayers have already spent $88 million on Donkin.  
Here is a quote from the report ``The Donkin-Morien Mine:
I repeat that it is the gold mine of coal mines. 
In time of war and crisis- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
The Government of Canada has set a clear and reasonable goal for Devco. 
The need for Devco to succeed cannot be overemphasized. 
I would like to briefly outline some of the progress that has indeed been made.  
Their achievements to date have been meaningful and important.  
At the same time, it is important to acknowledge that more needs to be done. 
Devco is forecasting that it will achieve positive cash flows in the year 1999-2000.  
This is not an easy task. 
This update will be submitted to government in early 1998. 
This government is committed to keeping an open channel to any and all new options.  
Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):
Natural resources, including mines, forests and energy, belong to the provinces.  
Let us now look at the particular issue of Donkin. 
The federal government never took any action.  
Take the example of the Societe quebecoise d'exploration miniere. 
But it is not the case.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
The motion speaks to the economic future of many of these same communities. 
It is shocking to think that this could happen. 
The government is being very short-sighted if it is contemplating such a move.  
The situation appears to be moving rather rapidly. 
What remains for Devco? 
If both of these mines will not be operating Devco is a dead duck. 
The answer is nothing.  
This is economic business reality but the government has a responsibility. 
The government must see that the Donkin situation is handled with great care.  
That responsibility must be assumed by the Government of Canada.  
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the motion before us today reads: 
Let us take a look at what is happening with regard to Devco.  
It is currently being reviewed by the Senate. 
These are questions that have to be asked.  
This is a serious question. 
The taxpayers of this country have put hundreds of millions of dollars into these projects. 
Let us look at this reasonably. 
Does anyone think a private company would shut down its export markets? 
But what does the government body do? 
It shuts down the export market and creates a problem. 
It has no business sense.  
It has no business sense and it never has had any. 
I find that rather amusing coming from the Conservatives. 
We come back to the same thing. 
We know that mining is extremely important to Canada. 
All businesses have to make a profit in order to survive. 
It is that simple.  
When we have to compete in the world marketplace we have to understand that. 
I do not think I am the only one to question the sanity. 
I think the taxpayers question it.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Yes, crown corporations like Devco have been inefficient. 
It is not because of the workers. 
The problem is not the crown corporations. 
The problem is the people who ride the gravy train.  
He deserves the kudos from the New Democratic Party and all Canadians.  
The other day I was in Cape Breton and I met three absolutely wonderful people. 
According to the Reformers that is three strikes against her, get out of there. 
I find that hard to believe. 
Government is no good, we can't help you. 
I get really mad when I get on this subject.  
I would really like an answer before we recess today. 
Is the Liberal Party in favour of this motion or not? 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
In order to do this Devco must become commercially viable. 
As hon. members have been informed, the corporation is continuing to lose money. 
It is pronounced Phalen.  
There is a difference of opinion on the pronunciation of Phalen. 
I am from the upper Ottawa valley and I believe it is pronounced Phalen. 
You are digging yourself in pretty deep.  
We are on the government side, are we not?  
Yes, we are on the leadership side.  
We expect projects to go forward on the basis of commercial viability. 
The word true has a certain air of quality about it in this hallowed Chamber. 
It is a versatile word. 
Canadians recognize and appreciate that progress has been made in this regard. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or, NDP):
He talked about the agencies which have approved this funding, ACOA and ECBC. 
They were not asked.  
Where else could this situation exist? 
I ask the member, where? 
Under this Liberal government that is how it happened.  
It accomplished it on the backs of the people of Cape Breton Island.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House adjourned at 2.06 p.m.)
