Subamendment to Motion in Amendment 
Thursday, November 6, 1997 
The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
In this place, the walls truly whisper with their sacrifice.  
The nation wept at the news of his death. 
Tributes poured in from across the then Dominion of Canada. 
In this special chamber, we look around. 
We remember them, and we hear their voices and their words. 
Hon. Orville H. Phillips :
As parliamentarians, it is appropriate that we never lose sight of our war history. 
They carried those scars with them throughout their lives.  
Never can we belittle the significance of the world wars. 
How quickly we have forgotten. 
Many of our universities do not observe Remembrance Day. 
November 11 is a sacred day and it must always remain that way. 
They shall grow not old, as we who are left grow old; 
Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.  
At the going down of the sun and in the morning 
We will remember them.  
Hon. Richard J. Doyle :
That the first year was the worst year 
Then we got used to it.  
"Got used to it?" 
The final line read: 
The Armistice was signed by the German representatives at midnight. 
We are told that "Eaton's big wildcat siren awakened the whole city."  
High o'er head the wildest note of war, 
And seraph voices, wafted from afar, 
Fill heaven with music and the Earth with peace.  
Jokes and another poem about buying bonds were on the editorial page. 
The leader, the End of Autocracy, carries this prophesy: 
The German Empire is gone but the German people remains. 
It is with them the allies must make a final settlement. 
And this quote from Lloyd George: 
The recklessness that placed the world in such awful agony must expect stern reckoning.  
The headline read "this is Victory," spelled out in what the printers call Jesus type. 
That is the way the headline was. 
With long silk stockings and arms of chalk, 
Butterfly shirts and white breasts bare, 
And shadows of dead men watching 'em there.  
"What did you think we should find," said a shade 
"When the last shot echoed and peace was made" 
"Christ," laughed the fleshless jaws of his friend, 
"I thought they'd be praying for worlds to mend."  
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
I served in the navy, my enlistment number being B-3372. 
Yet they were some of our best soldiers, as was proven time and time again. 
They are among our most decorated soldiers.  
We have a huge apology to make. 
That motion was passed and the government has now established a scholarship committee.  
I became the chairman of the Aboriginal War Veterans Monument committee. 
We have paid for a design. 
It will be roughly three stories high. 
A bank account has been established. 
I will set an example.  
We will build a monument. 
They got out there and got the job done.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators then stood in silent tribute.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
We also welcome the Cuban ambassador, His Excellency Bienvenido Garcia Negrin.  
On behalf of all honourable senators, I bid you welcome to the Senate.  
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
The article also says: 
It would be pretty simple arithmetic. 
I would applaud for one side and perhaps weep for the other. 
There is the wound that did not quite heal. 
This is not true in my case. 
I remember the time and the events very clearly. 
Andre Laurendeau had died. 
Louis J. Robichaud had just been re-elected for a third term. 
You do not forget that quickly!  
I followed the course of the etats generaux on CBC television. 
The outcome had been decided in advance. 
However, we are still standing and we are getting stronger.  
I have had my ups and downs. 
Of course, my remarks are bitter.  
I walk with my head held high, however. 
I am a first-class citizen who has rights. 
I expect mutual respect.  
What can I say, I lived through those days. 
I remember, but I still have hope.  
Hon. Philippe Deane Gigantes :
He said it was because Quebecers spoke French.  
They want the region to join France and leave Belgium. 
French President Jacques Chirac was asked to comment on this. 
My reply to Mr. Domljan will help clarify in part a question asked previously. 
We prefer the notion of sovereignty. 
We are not a federal state. 
The issue of regional languages is addressed in different terms here. 
Inuit Land Claims Agreement 
This agreement will be the continuation of that tradition.  
There was much emotion yesterday for two reasons:
The Hon. the Speaker :
I again thank all honourable senators who participated.  
First Report of Standing Joint Committee Presented- 
Hon. Celine Hervieux-Payette :
( For text of report, see Journals of the Senate of this day .)  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
It is moved by Senator Hervieux-Payette that the report be considered immediately. 
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Senate respectfully requests an explanation, Senator Hervieux-Payette.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Oppsoition) :
Was a request made to deviate from that?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Senator Hervieux-Payette asked for leave. 
I said it in French: 
Then we are now into the debate?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I move the adjournment of the debate.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
On motion of Senator Kinsella, debate adjourned.  
Parliament of Canada Act 
Bill to Amend-Report of Committee 
Thursday, November 6, 1997 
The Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has the honour to present its 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read a third time?  
Privileges, Standing Rules and Orders 
Usher of the Senate-Report of Committee Presented 
Thursday, November 6, 1997 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Then I must call for the "yeas" and "nay."  
Will those in favour of the motion please say "yea."  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those opposed to the motion please say "nay."  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The report will be placed on the Order Paper for consideration later this day.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
Hon. M. Lorne Bonnell :
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Tuesday, November 18, 1997, I will move: 
Hon. John B. Stewart :
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Wednesday, November 19, 1997, I will move: 
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Tuesday, November 18, 1997, I will move: 
That the Committee present its report no later than December 15, 1998. 
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Tuesday, November 18, 1997, I will move: 
That the Committee present its report no later than December 15, 1998. 
Notice of Motion to Authorize Committee to Engage Services and Travel 
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Tuesday, November 18, 1997, I will move: 
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Tuesday, November 18, 1997, I will move: 
Protection of Conscience in Medical Procedures-Presentation of Petitions 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Is it continuing still and, if so, at what stage is it? 
For instance, have any search warrants been requested? 
Are charges about ready to be laid? 
What is the status of the Airbus investigation at this time?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
It took credit for the investigation. 
It commented on the search warrants. 
Both involve RCMP investigations. 
In this case, there is absolute silence. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Are you trying to hide something that we do not know about?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Now he is ahead of the government. 
Perhaps Senator Forrestall is sitting on the wrong side. 
As to the precise time or week, I cannot pin that down. 
We can only speculate together. 
No decision has been made yet on the replacement helicopter.  
A full examination will be made at that particular time.  
Study of Health Effects of Gasoline Additive MTBE- Government Position 
Hon. Erminie J. Cohen :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I do not know if a guarantee will be given. 
It is an important matter, and I shall attempt to get an answer very soon.  
Hon. Erminie J. Cohen :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I will have to take that question as notice, honourable senators.  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
How many Canadians must pay the price for the planned increase in premiums?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I am not aware that any jobs will be lost, honourable senators. 
Did the Leader in the Government say that he would table studies?  
I said that I was not aware that any - 
The nature of the answer deserves a whisper.  
Perhaps the Honourable Lynch-Staunton would like to speak.  
I am not aware that any jobs will be lost. 
It relates to the proposed sale of CANDU reactors to Turkey.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the CANDU reactor technology is safe. 
It is the finest reactor and the most efficient in the world. 
We should be proud of it.  
The question was addressed to the minister.  
Not having been in Romania, I do not feel I can make the comparison. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
If that is so, why are we conducting an environmental assessment of it?  
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
In other words, we have absolutely no assurances that there will be environmental assessments. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
May we see the results?  
If they are available, yes.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the answer to that question is yes.  
I want to emphasize that we want to avoid a "made in Ottawa" solution. 
This will be a "made in Canada" solution. 
Hopefully, all the provinces as well as the stakeholders will be involved. 
With the greatest of respect, that answer does not make sense. 
It is putting the cart before the horse. 
It would be presumptuous of me to do so. 
I regard this to be a very serious issue for Canada.  
My answer to the question of my honourable friend is in the affirmative.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, there have been ongoing discussions in that respect. 
I do not know if I can respond before the decision is made. 
As soon as I have the information, I shall bring it to the chamber.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I will have to take that question as notice.  
In other words, we have had two floods. 
Winter has set in again early in Manitoba for the third year in a row.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Questions may not be asked of others.  
Perhaps I will address my question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
North Dakota has had at least as much precipitation. 
Is the government monitoring the situation in any way?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the answer is yes.  
I appreciate the comments of the honourable leader. 
Is the government monitoring the progress of the joint commission? 
Many people are waiting until a report comes down. 
Honourable senators, the government is monitoring the work of the joint commission. 
I am not aware as to when the report will be completed. 
I will be happy to do that for the honourable senator. 
I will attempt to have an answer when we return after the break.  
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
I do not think that was in anyone's mind.  
Surely we owe them a response after all these years. 
At some point in time the paintings may well start pealing and falling apart.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
However, by way of information, this matter was brought to my attention last year. 
They declared that the paintings were in satisfactory condition.  
You will notice black lines on the paintings. 
We are told that that is from the lighting. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, my understanding is slightly different. 
The paintings are in need of refurbishing. 
Removing them is very difficult. 
They may have to be refurbished while remaining on the walls. 
Perhaps His Honour could shed more light on this subject.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
We will get a full report for you, honourable senators.  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Delayed Answer to Oral Question 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
(Response to question raised by Hon. Mira Spivak on October 21, 1997) 
Issues such as career development, recognition and training are addressed.  
There is no consideration of the GSC gaining special status at this time.  
Energy-National Revenue-Conformity with Alternative Fuels Act 
Energy-Fisheries and Oceans-Conformity with Alternative Fuels Act 
First Report of Standing Joint Committee Adopted 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Privileges, Standing Rules and Orders 
Thursday, November 6, 1997 
The Hon. the Speaker :
It is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
I believe it is our duty to ask that question. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
We do not always use the term, "de la Verge noire." 
That is so fatuous.  
The item is referred to many times but there is no reference to "Black Rod." 
They use the term "Huissier." 
I for one am not prepared to go back. 
We should use "Usher of the Senate."  
The Senate is autonomous. 
That is why the report reads as it does.  
Does Senator Corbin wish more information on the subject?  
Honourable senators, I thank my colleague for her explanations. 
I believe there is some hypocrisy in this designation. 
A "verge" is a "verge." 
To go back into history and refer to dates - 
I have the impression I am missing some joke. 
I hear lots of chuckles, but this is not a chuckling matter. 
I see you all smiling. 
I wish Senator Gigantes were here. 
In Roman times, an executioner - 
As for the Robert , the first meaning it gives for "verge" is: 
We never questioned it. 
Some people have twisted minds. 
They see a word and they think of something else. 
They see the word "verge" and think of something else. 
They do not think of the stick. 
It is too bad.  
We will no doubt have the opportunity to pay tribute to him in suitable circumstances.  
This, in my opinion, is an unnecessary circumlocution. 
I will not go so far as to block this new designation. 
The hypocrisy is the fear of the real meaning of words.  
I find that totally regrettable. 
This is the work of small minds, and I find it regrettable.  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Senator Cools, you may only address a question to the last speaker. 
Perhaps I can put my question to the last speaker. 
First, this issue takes me totally by surprise. 
I wish to speak in the debate, but I seek a clarification.  
We have heard reference to Senator Lang's speech. 
Usually committee reports begin with words like "The committee, in obedience to a reference."  
If there was a reference from this chamber, that is a surprise to me. 
This matter has taken me totally by surprise in the last hour or two. 
Was there a reference? 
Was it referred to committee previously? 
Perhaps I could raise this as a point of order.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I am sorry, Honourable Senator Cools. 
I was looking at my rules. 
Honourable senators, perhaps I should raise this as a point of order. 
I was trying to avoid that. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Senator Maheu, the Chairman of the committee, can answer that question.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, reflection is underway. 
The Order in Council to which the report is referring is dated October 17, colleagues. 
Senator Corbin has put his finger right on the pulse of what is going on.  
Over a three-day period, attempts have been made to change a longstanding tradition.  
That seems to me an issue to be left to translators.  
Could I be allowed a question of Senator Kinsella?  
Senator Kinsella obviously had access to a document which I have not seen. 
Can he inform me whether Her Majesty was consulted on this matter? 
The Gentlemen Usher of the Black Rod is one of her servants in Canada. 
I thank the honourable senator for his question. 
I am afraid that I do not know the technical answer. 
It is not a field in which I have any expertise. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted to table these Orders in Council?  
Honourable senators, it seems to me that we have two questions before us this afternoon. 
Let me speak to the second question first. 
That is what the Rules Committee was attempting to address this morning. 
(iii) to consider the orders and customs of the Senate...  
I have a question for the Deputy Leader of the Government. 
So the object remains but the name disappears. 
What have we gained? 
What have we lost? 
I say that politely. 
Senator Corbin, I agree that there has been, in my view, some inappropriate action here. 
I have a question to the honourable deputy leader. 
It is an interesting suggestion that we have from the honourable senator. 
Of course, we got no answer to that question.  
They are the ones who issued the commission and two Orders in Council. 
Surely they had a reason for doing what they did. 
How do we determine that?  
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
Honourable senators, I will just take a moment. 
I think one can bend over backwards trying to modernize language. 
That, however, was not the part I wanted to question here. 
It should be done by the Senate itself. 
For instance, let us consider the title of "speaker." 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Will those honourable senators in favour of the motion please say "yea."  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those honourable senators opposed to the motion pleas say "nay."  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I rise on a point of order. 
The report only arrived a short while ago. 
I find that highly irregular. 
If this is allowed, it is a form of closure. 
When the debate is concluded, a vote is taken.  
I insist that this is highly irregular. 
It goes against the customs of this place. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, I rise in support of Senator Lynch-Staunton's point of order. 
I should like to add a few thoughts. 
However, I should like to add a few thoughts for consideration by honourable senators today.  
A number of questions have been raised. 
Senator Carstairs, with great zeal, is attempting to do a good job, I do believe. 
Honourable senators, we should think long and hard on these issues. 
I think Senator Lynch-Staunton's point of order is valid.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Do any other honourable senators wish to speak to the point of order?  
Honourable senators, I suppose Mr. Kinsella or myself could clear up the matter. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
That is the point of order before us. 
It is strictly a question of refusing or accepting the adjournment of the debate.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
What we find in the rules is how committees operate. 
That is where the problem started. 
This is what has happened here.  
The committee report was introduced. 
We are now at this juncture.  
There was a series of irregularities associated with this particular motion to adjourn. 
It was not the deputy leader who denied the adjournment of the debate. 
I felt that I should make that correction.  
Point of Order-Speaker's Ruling 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Honourable Senator Lynch-Staunton has said that surely I would sympathize with him. 
It can always be taken. 
Therefore, I am in the hands of the Senate.  
The rules do not address that matter. 
Perhaps it is something that the Rules Committee should look at. 
This may well be something that has been missed. 
At the moment, however, the rules are silent. 
Therefore, an acceptance or refusal of a request for adjournment is within the rules. 
I cannot rule otherwise.  
I should like to address the point raised by the Honourable Senator Cools. 
The staff are here to check, as I am. 
In my opinion, I cannot accept the point of order. 
The debate may continue.  
Hon. John B. Stewart :
Honourable senators, I wonder if we are looking at the correct question. 
That is not a question to be decided by the Senate.  
Historically, various palace officials had different symbols of office. 
It is sad to see our past being jettisoned.  
We may be horrified at the designation "Usher of the Senate." 
What does that mean? 
Surely, it is a very inexact designation. 
The official does much more than "usher" on behalf of the Senate. 
Nevertheless, I believe that this title was designated by the proper process. 
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
May I have permission to do so? 
The Hon. the Speaker :
If the honourable senators wishes to receive a question, yes.  
I should think that right covers the case in point.  
I am a member of the Standing Committee on Privileges, Standing Rules and Orders. 
What did the committee do? 
The solution was presented this afternoon by Senator Maheu.  
Today it has an entirely different meaning. 
Over the years, it has assumed an entirely different connotation. 
Honourable senators, what has happened today? 
What did the Deputy Leader of the Government ask today? 
I think that is a reasonable approach.  
I appeal to Senator Lynch-Staunton to try to understand the situation. 
There is no malice behind what has happened today. 
We are merely coming to grips with a difficult situation that has just developed. 
I beg the Honourable Leader of the Opposition to go along with this.  
I had no idea what this special meeting was about.  
We have acted in good faith. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I find that exchange not only incredible but surreal. 
I do not understand this.  
There are two dictionaries here, senator, if you would like to check them. 
Why not go even further? 
How far are we to go with this ludicrous exchange?  
Honourable senators, I maintain we should be quite happy with the present title. 
It is appropriate and representative of a long tradition.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton :
Therefore, along those lines, I wish to move an amendment, seconded by Senator Kinsella: 
"under that title as the officer", 
and replacing them with: 
"under the title of Usher of the Black Rod".  
The committee report would then read: 
In French, the report would read: 
This would respect the traditions and get us out of this conundrum.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion in amendment?  
Hon. John B. Stewart :
We have an Order in Council, by the Governor General in Council.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I now have a point of order as to whether the motion is in order. 
I have been reading it as carefully as I can. 
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
We will resume at five o'clock.  
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.  
Upon resuming at 5:06 p.m. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I therefore declare that the amendment is in order. 
I shall entertain further debate.  
Hon. Philippe Deane Gigantes :
Honourable senators, I should like to add to Senator Lynch-Staunton's amendment. 
Subamendment to Motion in Amendment 
Hon. Philippe Deane Gigantes :
That the motion in amendment be amended, in the French text, by deleting the words: 
"Huissier de la Verge noire" 
and replacing them with: 
"Hussier du Baton noir".  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the amendment to the amendment?  
Is it your wish that I read the amendment again?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to accept the amendment?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I shall read it.  
Honourable senators, does that mean that we leave the word "gentleman" as it stands?  
I shall read the motion to ensure that it is clear. 
The operative motion as amended and amended again would read: 
And in French, it would read: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion as amended?  
Honourable senators, I would like the record to show that I abstained from these decisions.  
Honourable senators, I would like my abstention recorded as well.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I am not objecting. 
There is a big difference. 
I say this for the record, that is all.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Then perhaps I should not hear you, for the record.  
Motion agreed to and report, as amended, adopted, on division.  
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, November 18, 1997, at two o'clock p.m.
