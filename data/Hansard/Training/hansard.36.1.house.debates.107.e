BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1998 
Bill C-36-Notice of Time Allocation Motion 
EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 107 
Friday, May 15, 1998 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour, Lib.):
There were numerous written and oral submissions made to the Sims task force. 
I would like to say that the minister is a real gentleman.  
The first has to do with dispute resolution mechanisms. 
We beg to disagree. 
It would certainly be a departure from the practice of all Canadian jurisdictions. 
Unfortunately this bill has been tough because of the Reform. 
The system works very well at least 95% of the time. 
The first deputy minister of labour was a very wise man. 
No group should be allowed to do so. 
The Sims task force agreed. 
It examined the issue of essential services. 
It is hard to understand. 
Parliament cannot be consistently required to resolve labour disputes. 
Debate centred around two fundamental rights. 
The first is the right to know. 
The bottom line is that we live in an open society. 
People have the right to communicate with each other. 
They have a right to be informed. 
Others wanted no restrictions on their use.  
The time has come to deal with the question. 
The provision now reflects the carefully crafted words of the Sims report. 
That would constitute an unfair labour practice and will not be tolerated by the government.  
Employers should not get the result they seek as a consequence of violating the code. 
That seems only fair.  
In fact many witnesses appearing before the committee wanted fast action.  
The time has come to put our words into action.  
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
There is no consent.  
I have not been recruiting. 
This is our last shot at the bill.  
Right now the government has a slim majority. 
It has a new mandate. 
It has no intention of calling an election. 
This is an important piece of legislation. 
It was the very first piece of business listed.  
This piece of legislation languished on the order paper for months. 
The minister is correct in his assessment that this is an important piece of legislation. 
That is precisely why many of my colleagues want to speak to the bill. 
That is where we disagree with the Liberals.  
Of course we are coming up to a log jam.  
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the House leader of the government. 
I really think that is the case.  
Seeking a balance is a great approach to labour relations. 
Let us examine the bill to see if it attains a balance. 
I begin with a little history. 
The code has not been altered in any significant way for the last 25 years. 
It was indeed an important piece of legislation and it is time to update it.  
That is rather weird logic.  
Federal jurisdiction in labour matters is interprovincial and international in scope. 
In a lot of cases they are simply not available at all.  
We have seen that time and time again. 
Later on I will endeavour to explain again. 
Stable labour relations will promote investment and reinvestment.  
How does it work? 
For disputed issues each party would be required to submit their final offer for settlement. 
There is no compromise position. 
The arbitrator's decision would be binding on both parties. 
Is this government intervention? 
What does it solve? 
What does it resolve? 
How is that ever going to be resolved?  
Then they are still faced with the dilemma of having to settle this contract. 
The risk to Canadian jobs should be minimized as well. 
The costly interruption of government business should not be allowed to occur. 
I would like to cite the Manitoba case. 
This is a perfect example of final offer selection.  
Nowadays you have to pay attention to the marketing of those crops. 
But there are a lot of unions between the farm gate and the port. 
It is absolutely worthless.  
Our products are important too''. 
It is altogether possible.  
Does this bill actually improve anything? 
Why not make some real progress? 
I would like to talk a little about replacement workers. 
This is how the replacement worker issue should be addressed. 
That is all very well. 
That is a tried and true process. 
I do not know what all the protest is about a secret ballot vote. 
Perhaps some day that will be addressed in this House.  
We talk about certifying the union without a majority. 
It is an inconvenience but it is not a catastrophe. 
That is the basis on which I base my remarks today. 
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
This is absolutely unbelievable. 
Today, however, I would like to concentrate on something else. 
This is such an important issue in my riding. 
This double standard is really puzzling.  
What about its products? 
What will happen to mining products in the event of a strike or a lockout? 
Has that question been addressed? 
The question that needs to be asked is why one and not the other.  
Such action is typical of this government. 
What does that amount to? 
Another important industry in my riding is the alfalfa dehydrating industry. 
Obviously the government did not listen.  
The alfalfa dehydration industry represents about $100 million in exports. 
I would think not. 
All products and commodities should be offered protection from arbitrary shipping disruption.  
It is time we start protecting the economy of this country. 
For this reason we proposed to extend this provision of protection. 
This government, in its lack of wisdom, refuses such action. 
How much help would that be?  
Some strikes cripple entire sectors of the economy. 
The indirect costs suffered by third parties is twice that. 
It is estimated to be over $250 million. 
Unfortunately our government did not see things in that light.  
That is their right as well.  
We find that unacceptable as well.  
Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):
I am referring to all the graduating students throughout our nation.  
Our students are much like flowers. 
First we prepare the soil as a food rich base. 
For our students the soil is their educational institutions. 
May all their colours shine through as they enter the labour force.  
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
Few are accountable to the provinces they are supposed to represent. 
One notable senator in my home province of British Columbia is Senator Pat Carney. 
I want to take this opportunity to wish Senator Carney a speedy recovery. 
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
Mr. Speaker, National Police Week ends tomorrow. 
But police officers do much more than fight criminals.  
INTERNATIONAL DAY OF FAMILIES 
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Despite our greatly changing social institutions, the family survives, and its role continues to grow. 
It is a vital and influential element of society.  
SPEECH AND HEARING AWARENESS MONTH 
Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga Centre, Lib.):
An estimated one in ten Canadians is deaf or has some degree of hearing loss. 
Those most likely to be affected are seniors.  
These organizations are planning special activities for the month of May.  
OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):
This year's theme is ``Occupational, Safety and Health:
OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY 
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
The hon. member for Perth-Middlesex.  
NORTH AMERICAN AEROSPACE DEFENCE COMMAND 
Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Middlesex, Lib.):
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, today is International Day of Families. 
The family plays a vital role in the well-being of humankind. 
For these people, the family is their society and their strength.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
It is too bad that- 
The hon. member for Oakville.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville, Lib.):
There are now over 200,000 nurses practising in Canada. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
The BCNI, the Business Council on National Issues.  
Guess who as at the dinner? 
Guess what they were doing? 
Guess who this bank wants to merge with? 
It wants to merge with the Toronto-Dominion Bank. 
Who was on the board of the TD bank a few years ago? 
Matthew Barrett, the president of the Bank of Montreal. 
The hon. member for Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle.  
SOMMET DE LA FRANCOPHONIE 
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Congratulations to the St. F.X. graduates, the latest riches of our country's treasure.  
Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):
Ontarians clearly support this declaration. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
``The military has abandoned us'', she reported. 
Some home care would be nice, she said.  
Instead she has been given a duty driver who is expensive and unwanted.  
ASSOCIATION CANADIENNE-FRANCAISE POUR L'AVANCEMENT DES SCIENCES 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Research and development are the pillars of the knowledge economy. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the meeting yesterday produced progress. 
Unilateral action is not the answer. 
We will continue to work in the public interest.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Is this not taking the politics of stubbornness to its newest low?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
They are willing to follow this minister and every Liberal this summer. 
They are going to go to every ribbon cutting. 
They are going to go to every celebration. 
The hepatitis C signs will be there. 
When will they get it?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
He is the ambulance chaser of Canadian politics.  
He lowers the level of debate.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will tell you about the commitment of the member for Macleod. 
He has had to help people who have been in ambulances. 
This health minister has failed dismally every step of the way. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
The governments ought not to act unilaterally. 
That is the responsible way to proceed in these circumstances.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
He has but one duty left. 
Will he perform it? 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Where was the Reform Party last year? 
Where was the Reform Party last winter when that work was going on? 
It is this government which led that effort.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is also for the Minister of Health.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is mistaken. 
That is this government's objective.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We have finally persuaded them to join us. 
It was the Government of Canada that set this process in motion.  
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
This is the objective of all governments. 
We are trying to come up with a collective approach.  
We share this responsibility annually.  
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
He has lost all credibility. 
Why does he not resign?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I reflect cabinet's, the caucus' viewpoint. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
He failed and he failed miserably. 
He claimed he would be going to the table with an open mind. 
The truth is that he went to the table with a closed wallet.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Health has lost sight of reality. 
The Minister of Health has no heart. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
This is the process we are committed to.>  
This is the responsible approach.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
In the meantime, the municipality is now charging other people to use the wharf.  
That is not fair.  
Maybe the minister could try to explain how he can get away with this.  
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
We would be happy to provide more information for the hon. member. 
I would be happy to provide more information for him.  
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
The hon. member for Okanagan-Coquihalla.  
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
The government's position lacks compassion and is extreme.  
The person to blame is the Prime Minister of Canada. 
What is the government doing? 
What kind of twisted game is being played?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I can tell the member what we are doing. 
Doing that together is the answer. 
Yesterday was an important milestone on the road- 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
What, exactly, is the government position?  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
That is the role of the hospital board.  
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
The health minister was simply obeying his master in all this. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, that is what is needed, more complete answers.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health.  
We were not there so we have to take his word for it.  
The Ontario health minister says: 
The hon. Minister of Health.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
The governments of the country deplored the kind of unilateral action taken by Ontario. 
On a supplementary question, the member for Edmonton-Strathcona.  
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
Its mandate is to determine whether or not there can be compensation. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
So have other representatives of affected groups.  
That is the purpose. 
Those options are constructive and they will all be examined.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the Environment.  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
As a department we are very engaged in research. 
Science is the basis of the department. 
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is also for the Minister of the Environment.  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have had this exchange before in the House. 
It accepted responsibility for that.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Yet the government delivered nothing.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
That is why we are having this discussion.  
That is why this working group is taking place. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
The Canadian consensus is clear, fair compensation for all. 
What other options are left for the minister to consider?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
That is what Canadians would want responsible governments and ministers to do.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
We have all heard those promises of jobs, jobs, job. 
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, jobs have been the preoccupation of the government.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Our children, our future, are leaving our rural areas in droves.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
We have been able to do this in spite of incredible budget difficulties.  
What will the government do to make sure that these hundreds of people- 
The hon. Secretary of State for International Financial Institutions.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
I assure the member we have been listening. 
We will continue to consult. 
We will continue to work with her. 
The merger has not yet been approved.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
We are trying to avert any danger in this situation. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, there is a witch hunt going on in the national capital. 
Indeed, it violates the charter of rights and freedoms.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
We know the RCMP has investigated illegal influence peddling. 
That inquiry has taken place at the request of the government. 
That inquiry is concluded. 
There has been one person charged. 
That person has pleaded guilty and has been convicted.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and Youth), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question. 
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew:
I know they do not care about families over there. 
They do not care about anything, actually.  
We will have made an investment of $1.7 billion by the year 2000. 
We have made provisions in EI for low income family supplement. 
There is much more that can be said.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
He is a lawyer. 
I say no more. 
There is only one thing left to do. 
Will the health minister resign?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I think we struck a nerve. 
We have identified exactly what the member has been doing these last few weeks. 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the Environment.  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
I am very pleased to report significant progress is being made by this group.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. 
Universality is a principle strongly supported the Canadian people.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
That is why we will continue to consult and to work on this package. 
I thank the member for his question.

Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
DFO reportedly did not receive copies of the auditor's management letters. 
The numerical continuity of the landing slips should also be reviewed. 
No contribution fisheries were conducted in 1995 or 1996. 
4.12 A complete analysis of a particular individual's transaction should be performed. 
The analysis should address such questions as: 
What is the likelihood that the receivable from the individual will be collected? 
Further, the individual has not had any further involvement with projects of this nature.  
If necessary, progress reports should be revised for any accounting errors.  
Insurance coverage is now only on vessels operated by the SFA.  
Managers within Sto:lo Fisheries are now provided a budget to work within. 
The authorization for this payment is the minutes of meetings. 
Minutes are provided by the independent chairman of the planning committee.

QUESTIONS PASSED AS ORDERS FOR RETURNS 
Mr. Guy St-Julien: 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
The question is fairly simple. 
I have been very careful to avoid that term. 
I may well have used the term ``in due time''. 
Is the hon. parliamentary secretary recommending a disposition for the remaining questions?  
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the other questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
The highlights are as follows: 
( b ) streamlining of the conciliation process; 
Of course it is representative of employer and labour organizations.  
I am thinking of the flour mill workers. 
This is a big step.  
We condemn the government for not being more receptive to these representations.  
This refers to the Canada Labour Code as a whole.  
We cannot, consequently-put your motions on the order paper.  
We tried to table the amendments. 
They were rejected with this explanation provided very honourably by the deputy principal clerk. 
They cannot negotiate anything about their work conditions.  
How far can racism be pushed? 
This even goes as far as the right to arbitration. 
As far as we know, in the public service, arbitration decisions are final. 
The right to grieve is affected as well.  
It is very disappointing. 
We used to boast about job creation. 
One should wonder about growth. 
We must wonder about a concept such as growth. 
It might be negative growth.  
Otherwise, profits and money become our only values.  
This is a significant shortcoming in this bill. 
Once again, Quebec seems to be further advanced in this area. 
Why not take a page from our book when it is something worthwhile?  
That part is highly questionable and we are opposed to it.  
We are dead set against this kind of intrusion.  
The letter reads in part as follows: 
-the American giant Archer Daniels Midland (ADM). 
Incidentally, this was alluded to earlier. 
That is what tacit, or automatic, renewal means.  
This reputation for quality is surely the best guarantee of our jobs. 
They had contributed to the UI plan during all these years. 
``Have a look at things in Quebec and draw your own conclusions''. 
Workers do not enjoy being on strike. 
It now reads ``for the demonstrated purpose of undermining a trade union's representational capacity''. 
There are three types of workers in Quebec. 
We have non-unionized workers, which is unfortunate for them. 
This was under a government led by a great democrat, Rene Levesque. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Some of the amendments put forward by the Reform Party were very worrisome. 
Thinking that through, it is kind of scary.  
It is yesterday's news. 
In actual fact, the right to work means the right to work for less. 
That is a good thing.  
It is kind of frightening.  
The whole rise of the right wing is worrisome to working people.  
I could not help but think there were parallels here. 
It took a lot of courage to do that. 
That kind of depression spawns right wing extremism.  
I keep hearing the word misused. 
Is that not a frightening thing? 
Some people actually believe there is a surplus of democracy. 
They lock up the trade unionists. 
It is a real trend and a real theme. 
It is a pattern that we see developing in the Reform Party. 
That is exactly what Bill C-19 does.  
The extreme right wing wants to deny the existence of labour. 
It wants to keep labour away from the table. 
It wants to stamp labour out. 
It holds us back. 
We all move forward when we move forward together. 
We do not only see an anti-worker sentiment, we see an anti-farmer sentiment. 
It seems like a real contradiction to me. 
I do not understand it.  
We heard some things at committee stage that would make people roll their eyes. 
Labour had always complained. 
There are other changes which we think are very positive. 
There is a terrible backlog, especially in applications for certification. 
Some 90 applications for certification are currently pending. 
We are critical in one respect. 
Unfortunately, some of them are no longer with us.  
I have made this point before. 
They want a mandatory vote.  
To make them vote twice is undemocratic. 
How many times will they make them vote? 
Until they get the answer they want? 
Over and over and over again? 
How democratic is that?  
You don't like that, so you shouldn't like this either.  
It is fundamentally wrong. 
It is put to bed now once and for all. 
Successor rights are a very important aspect. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I think he is probably doing us a lot of good.  
I am afraid there is not consent.  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
It is a very important private members' bill. 
What does Bill C-284 do that is so important? 
Let me talk about the genesis of this. 
It has to do with a story about Bobby Oatway.  
He chose to move to Prince George and then Toronto. 
That means he would be released back into the community and no one would know. 
They just do not have that authority.  
It is this kind of possibility that this bill would stop.  
They would have the possibility of checking on that person's criminal records.  
Are our children at risk? 
Is this kind of protection really needed?  
The answer of course is yes.  
That is what Bill C-284 would do.  
What do the critics say to this proposal? 
It does however propose the following.  
Right now you do not know. 
BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1998 
BILL C-36-NOTICE OF TIME ALLOCATION MOTION 
Hon. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Protecting children is the ultimate responsibility. 
They must be allowed to grow up free from abuse and free from molestation.  
Pedophiles are at greater risk than rapists. 
Bill C-284 is specific in its intent. 
The responsibility now falls upon them. 
Essentially it sends a message. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Unauthorized disclosure by them would be an offence as we understand the motion before us.  
We are in support of it.  
The bill could prevent future tragedies in our communities. 
How have we done this? 
There is a system in place at the moment.  
The purpose of Bill C-284 is commendable. 
There is also the issue of records being destroyed. 
For that reason this government does not support this bill.  
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
I think he is much more antiquated than I. 
I am thinking of King Zeus. 
However that is food for thought for another time.  
Let us rush on to the system of pardoning. 
When I speak about pardoning I am talking- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I think we are about to hear now how that relates.  
Mr. Speaker, I am rushing on. 
There was a lead up to Bill C-284.  
We are talking about pardoning. 
One person was a man in Stonecliffe, Ontario by the name of Wild Willie Buckshot. 
This is a true story. 
He believed that he should have received a pardon.  
He happened to also have a chicken farm. 
As a result of that there was a possibility that he would be charged. 
He wanted an outlet into his property because it was hurting his place of business.  
Would that person be an offensive person to the community? 
I do not think he would be. 
I do not believe that he would. 
Perhaps the members opposite would think so. 
He became the vice-president of the Canadian Association of Mayors.  
He was a criminal lawyer of note. 
He went into the court system. 
As a result of that the judge dispensed justice in the appropriate manner. 
Apparently one in ten Canadians have a criminal record. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Where is the understanding? 
Where is the government taking care of our people, the people in need? 
Where oh where is the compassion and understanding for them? 
I will speak to the cameras again. 
It is a sad commentary.  
We are not asking for the abuse of the rights of Canadian citizens. 
I say yes, I agree with that screening manual. 
I agree with all the education. 
This bill is that simple. 
It is a small step but it is a very important one.  
I would like to talk for just a minute about who commits these offences. 
Certainly the term pedophiles has been mentioned. 
It is not the kind of crime where they do it once. 
That is what is so serious about this.  
I have come out strongly in favour of this bill. 
It is definitely right for my grandchild's protection. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Indeed this is an important bill. 
This is why we are here. 
This is why we hear different points of view.  
That bill proposed electronic monitoring. 
What the member for Calgary Centre proposes does have merit.  
This is not unreasonable. 
The member for Calgary Centre has raised an issue that does concern us. 
The government is listening. 
The government does care about it.  
I think the member for Calgary Centre has accomplished something very important. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
I say that for the record.  
Furthermore, sexually abused children are reluctant to report these crimes. 
They feel intense shame, and secrecy is often the result.  
Any inappropriate disclosure of information by these individuals would be subject to criminal sanctions.  
This amendment is the next logical step in Bill C-284. 
I share the view of those who believe that rehabilitation is a laudable goal. 
This in turn helps protect public safety.  
Let us support our many volunteer driven organizations that deal with children. 
Let us support our families. 
Let us support the safety of our children.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
I am very pleased to see it here again.  
Surely we can all support that. 
Is this bill necessary? 
It sends a message that the protection of our children is paramount. 
Crimes against children have impacted the lives of hundreds of people in the community. 
(The House adjourned at 2.17 p.m.)
