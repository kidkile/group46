Business of the Senate 
Agreement to Consider Quebec Constitutional Amendment in Committee of the Whole 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
That is my understanding.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
These were received at the following hours. 
Therefore, I call on the Honourable Senator Doyle.  
Safety of Blood System 
Hon. Richard J. Doyle :
Honourable senators, I rise to speak on a matter of urgent public importance. 
Many had already died. 
Honourable senators, take careful note of the plain language the judge uses. 
The fifth word in the report is "calamity." 
Words like "infectious, "contaminated" and "death" tumble afterwards. 
The evidence points out how we ignored the cautions taken in the United States.  
The minister said, "The government will be providing a very full response." 
There should be no postponement of this phase of treating the calamity.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
He has made an enormous contribution to the health and safety of Canadians.  
No one could help but be moved by the plight of those affected, the victims. 
We accept those conclusions without reservation. 
We accept them in their entirety. 
The federal government also accepts its share of responsibility for past shortcomings in the system. 
Rule 60(1) states: 
That has been done. 
Having said that, rule 60(1)( a ) states that it: 
must relate to a genuine emergency, calling for urgent consideration by the Senate; 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
I know how tragic that event was.  
Once again, it is a matter of money, money, money. 
Federal ministers are not accepting reality. 
That is the name formerly given to hepatitis C. 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
I do not think anyone has that evidence, senator. 
A tremendous doubt out there has left people afraid to have transfusions. 
I personally do not believe we have an answer to that.  
Hon. Philippe Deane Gigantes :
If there is no answer, what is the debate about?  
I strongly support Senator Doyle's motion. 
The Government of Canada has undertaken to assure the blood supply. 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
He must prove that it requires urgent consideration. 
Honourable senators, it has not been proven that this in fact is the case.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I regret I must interrupt the debate. 
I am convinced of that. 
I challenge the ruling.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
My ruling is being challenged. 
How long shall the bells ring?  
Under the Rules of the Senate of Canada , they will ring for one hour.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Is that our agreement?  
That is our agreement.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The rules clearly state that I must take my instructions from the whips.  
Senator Carstairs is the acting whip on our side at the present time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Yes, and he has been since yesterday, and doing an excellent job.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Linguistic School Boards-Motion to Amend Section 93 of Constitution 
AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF CANADA 
Paragraphs (1) to (4) of section 93 do not apply to Quebec." 
2. This Amendment may be cited as the Constitution Amendment, year of proclamation (Quebec).  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I move that we resolve into Committee of the Whole.  
Consideration in Committee of the Whole 
Honourable senators, I present to the Senate the Honourable Stephane Dion. 
There is no doubt that such an amendment can be made bilaterally. 
I am open to discussion, but I think this was clearly stated.  
Is this change required by January 1? 
Section 93 as drafted offers very limited protection. 
Whatever protection it offers has been weakened by one judgement after another. 
This was clearly demonstrated in committee. 
I could continue to provide similar examples. 
We also have a letter from an Anglican bishop who does not oppose the change.  
The notwithstanding clause is currently in effect. 
It is provided in the legislation. 
Court rulings cannot be predicted. 
It should always be a last resort. 
That is a possibility. 
The debate is one that will have to be held within Quebec society. 
We have to trust that they will hold a public debate. 
The majority will decide. 
If that is the case, what will happen to Protestant francophones?  
In their brief, they say they do not support the amendment. 
They have, if I am not mistaken, 15,000 children in the schools. 
That is a fair number. 
This is nitpicking, Minister. 
They were not just there for the majority. 
There was a very specific group, Protestant francophones, that opposed it. 
I was trained in traditional politics. 
I have a terrible time ignoring anyone. 
If that is not what constitutions are for, why do they exist?  
I cannot tell you that the francophone Protestants are in favour of the amendment. 
There are certainly some elements of society that are not in agreement. 
Overall, however, there is a strong consensus in favour of this change in Quebec. 
The overall package must be taken in context. 
Minister Dion, I have two questions for you:
The French language needs protection in Quebec. 
We hope that this debate will occur in Quebec society. 
However, we hope that this time will come. 
We hope that this situation will improve. 
We welcome a debate in Quebec on this issue.  
What we are discussing today is another debate. 
We do not think it is good to mix the two issues. 
I have a petition which I will submit today containing 245,000 signatures.  
These people are obviously upset. 
Section 93 is a poor protection anyway.  
As Senator Bolduc said, the debate will come. 
Are you saying the debate will take place in 1999, then?  
You have a committee which will soon release its report. 
However, this will not end the story.  
Minister, thank you for coming. 
Unanimity being impossible, at a certain point you have to stop. 
Are there no other solutions? 
I am not arguing for or against religion in the schools. 
Is that what we want, or are my concerns unjustified?  
However, it provides for bilateral amendment. 
It is not a fundamental right. 
We are not talking of freedom of religion. 
Not every democracy in the world provides this. 
Most do not have such rights. 
We should look to see if we can. 
We do not consider the minorities to be an element of the minorities. 
We are talking about all minorities. 
There is reasonable support among the Protestants, clearly.  
Minister Brassard has said it could be renewed as a last resort. 
So that is another possibility. 
It was seen as such.  
Other political forces will speak out. 
They are from the official spokespersons of the two religious communities.  
I think they are very important. 
Quebec bishops are not opposed to the amendment. 
It is difficult to speak in their name, unless you are the pope. 
I believe this is their line of thinking.  
This is a hypothetical question, but it would have been more complicated to do so. 
We have to look at a whole set of factors. 
I cannot compare Quebec's resolution with Term 17.  
The two resolutions cannot be compared. 
We must look at the merits of each case. 
I am referring only to the bishops.  
That was a very important element. 
Not the decisive one, but a very important one. 
We need to know whether there is also support among the public.  
There was a referendum in another province. 
In Quebec there was none. 
It was very important to know if there was support. 
It was very important for us to know what the bishops thought. 
They were not just one of many pressure groups. 
You will recall that the Prime Minister himself had called for it on two occasions. 
The spokesman for the bishops seemed a bit annoyed. 
You will recall that I required a letter, which I tabled in committee. 
That is your testimony, that it weighed heavy, that it was an important factor? 
There were others but this was an important one?  
However, the bishops are not alone. 
A lot of associations, Catholic and others, support the change. 
I have a full list here. 
We can be assured that this is an up-front, reasonable expectation?  
There is certainly an expectation that debate will occur on that point. 
We do not know if they will need to use it.  
What is written is this: 
They do not object. 
It would be different to use that point of view in order to object. 
They do not object in Quebec. 
This is part of a context. 
In another province, the context is different. 
The assessment must be adapted to the other context.  
The last paragraph in the letter from Bishop Morrisette states: 
Could you explain that paragraph?  
They had not changed their position. 
I suggest that it was practicable. 
It has never been proven otherwise. 
The Government of Quebec asked that this kind of formula be used. 
You could have said: "Yes, we are prepared to accommodate you." 
There may be a formula that does not affect minority rights. 
Many testimonies were made to that effect. 
There is almost complete unanimity as regards the establishment of school boards. 
As for using the Constitution to achieve this result, there is a consensus. 
It is not quite as broad, but it is still a consensus. 
The Quebec government was forced by the stakeholders to opt for the constitutional solution. 
I want to come back to a subject that has been raised several times. 
There is neither consensus nor unanimity in the Protestant francophone community. 
Educators, dissentient school boards and parents came to tell us so. 
They have worked very hard to get them. 
Now we are all but turning our backs on them.  
The term Protestant francophone does not appear in the Constitution.  
It is the Protestants who are protected. 
There is very clear support among Protestants for the amendment.  
For the creation of linguistic school boards, I grant you. 
They were not in favour either. 
I could name other groups. 
One must be careful about claiming any broad unanimity among anglophones.  
There is no unanimity.  
There is no consensus either.  
Honourable senators, the minister has to leave us now. 
On your behalf, I thank him.  
Is that agreed, honourable senators?  
Honourable senators, I have one question. 
It is not for me to answer that question.  
Does the Honourable Senator Carstairs wish to respond to that concern?  
He has now appeared once before the Senate. 
Honourable senators, is there agreement that I report to the Senate?  
Honourable senators, I want to know what happened. 
There are 104 senators. 
That does not leave a whole lot of time.  
They were fluid and flexible. 
They changed things in a number of ways. 
Is it your wish, honourable senators, that I report that we have completed our deliberations?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, the sitting of the Senate is resumed.  
Report of Committee of the Whole 
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
The sitting of the Senate was suspended.  
The sitting of the Senate was resumed.  
Safety of Blood System 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Speaker's ruling sustained on the following division: 
Hon. Noel Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
If he was not, then his vote should not be counted.  
Hon. Noel Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Government) :
It is important that all honourable senators realize what the rules are. 
To get around this one, perhaps we could have the vote taken again.  
Perhaps other honourable senators have a better solution.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
If that were the case, I would, but that is not the case. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
That is the decision. 
I believe the vote was 46 to 31. 
Would it be agreeable to declare that the vote was 45 to 31?  
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
In October 1993, a farmer in Wilkie, Saskatchewan killed his daughter - 
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
Honourable senators, I rise on a point of order.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, order, please! 
The Honourable Senator Nolin has the floor!  
It goes on to state: 
- shall be received at any one sitting.  
It was not a motion to adjourn.  
I am saying that you cannot do that more than once in a day.  
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Honourable senators, I wish to speak to you of an important and urgent matter. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
A point of order has been raised. 
Do any other honourable senators wish to speak on the point of order?  
Hon. William M. Kelly :
If I may, I think the reason for that is that they have priority. 
It is usually done in the order that the Speaker receives them. 
Whichever notice is brought in earliest would be the motion to be considered. 
It is quite clear when you read rule 61(6) on page 70.  
The operative words are "shall be received."  
In other words, it must simply be introduced on the floor. 
Otherwise, the parliamentary process obviously would fall apart. 
We have had one debate today on an emergency. 
I am certainly not holding up other debates. 
They could go on tomorrow, the day after and the day after and next month. 
However, there is only one motion per sitting.  
That is precisely what His Honour is doing.  
Hon. Noel Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. Orville H. Phillips :
Hon. Wilfred P. Moore :
Honourable senators, Senator Tkachuk made reference to rule 60(4). 
It is not just the notice of emergency debate. 
I do not know the answer. 
I would like to have guidance and a ruling from the Chair.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Could we continue the discussion on this? 
I would like to know where we are. 
I thought we were beginning the second emergency debate. 
It is as if we were in limbo in a sense. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, all I have to work with is the rule book. 
You ask where we are in our business. 
At this point, we have not reached the daily Routine of Business. 
The motion must be on an urgent matter.  
I rule that it is in order for the Honourable Senator Nolin to proceed.  
The reason we need to hold an emergency debate is a very simple one. 
There is a legal vacuum around this matter. 
In February 1997, the Supreme Court ordered a new trial. 
If you are sure the accused has committed a crime, you must find him guilty.  
Not everyone was pleased at the outcome.  
The Constitution precludes such discrimination. 
This describes the Latimer case.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, this recommendation was given great consideration in committee. 
Senator Nolin chose to wait until December 11 to introduce such a motion.  
I do not know where the deputy leader finds those notions.  
"Explain" has a very different meaning from the word "proof." 
He must explain why the matter should be given urgent consideration. 
Where is the burden of proof?  
This is not a controversial adversarial process as in a court of law. 
There is no such thing as proof in this case. 
Please forget about the date on which judgment was delivered.  
We are close to the Christmas adjournment. 
Is this not the time to discuss this situation? 
Senator Nolin must merely explain the situation according to our rules.  
Hon. Philippe Deane Gigantes :
Honourable senators, Senator Cogger said that these are not adversarial proceedings. 
The adversarial nature of a parliament gives it its essential democratic character.  
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
That is not what she said. 
That is taking out of context what she said.  
We must hear the facts. 
The proponent must propose those facts. 
I did not hear that.  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
That is all he said. 
Hon. John G. Bryden :
Honourable senators have received notice of eight urgent matters. 
Is it really payback time? 
Do honourable senators really want to go back to those days?  
I do not really believe he meant to speak the way he did. 
There is nothing frivolous in talking about the blood supply. 
There is nothing frivolous in talking about the helicopters. 
There is something very frivolous in the process that is being used here.  
I was speaking of the subject-matter.  
Who has the most decency? 
We on this side of the Chamber or you on the other side? 
It is much more important than that.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I agree that this is an important matter. 
This matter could be debated at another time. 
I therefore declare the motion out of order. 
I see only one honourable senator standing. 
Do the whips agree on how long the bells should ring?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I have to know first if the vote will be instantly. 
The whips advise me that the bells will ring for one hour.  
Here is what I would propose. 
Honourable senators, could I make another point of order?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The point of order is on the time limit on the vote.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will you please resume your seat.  
Honourable senators, I wish all honourable senators to understand clearly the proposition from His Honour. 
The bells will commence to ring shortly. 
If so, pursuant to what rule is that the case?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, let us be clear. 
Those are the rules.  
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
Honourable senators, His Honour made the allocation of 15 minutes. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Continued 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Sub-amendment negatived on the following division: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Are honourable senators not prepared to proceed with this matter?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
We cannot proceed with the Order Paper. 
We have to go back to where we were before Routine Proceedings, I believe.  
Hon. Mabel M. DeWare :
That will bring us to 6:05 p.m. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The bells will ring for 30 minutes. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Speaker's ruling sustained on the following division: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The sitting of the Senate was suspended.  
The sitting of the Senate was resumed.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
I will not be moving my time allocation motion this evening. 
I further understand we will move now to Orders of the Day.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
The Deputy Leader of the Government shall not be moving her closure motion. 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Honourable senators, I request further clarification. 
A number of urgent matters have been brought to the attention of the Senate. 
They are not on the Order Paper. 
They have been filed. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
The reason for the impasse is well known. 
Discussions to solve the impasse are going well. 
We have not yet reached Routine Proceedings. 
We are at the stage of dealing with the motions for emergency debate. 
I concur with that.  
Honourable senators, some of us wish to go through Routine Proceedings. 
Honourable senators, I was trying to be cooperative with the government side. 
We have no objection to beginning with Routine Proceedings.  
That is, as long as the other portion of that particular agreement stands.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Shall we now proceed to Orders of the Day or should I call Routine Proceedings?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?

Delayed Answers to Oral Questions 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
(Response to question raised by Hon. Donald H. Oliver on November 26, 1997) 
This is normal practice for an arm's-length pension board. 
make its investment policies, standards and procedures public; and 
However, this concern is unwarranted. 
The 1996 budget required this notification. 
Status of Partnership on Social Programs with Government of Ontario 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Norman K. Atkins on October 8, 1997) 
Ontario has taken a leadership role in this process.  
The Government of Canada is allocating additional funding to resolve an outstanding funding issue. 
New agreements with the provinces will be in place for April 1, 1998. 
( Response to question raised by Hon. Terry Stratton on October 30, 1997 ) 
Canadian Human Rights Act 
Bill to Amend-Third Reading 
Senator Watt has carefully analyzed this bill. 
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
He spoke with me this afternoon at about three o'clock. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Our business and our calendar sometimes accommodates the possibility of a symbolic gesture. 
The bill is part of a long process which speaks to persons with disabilities. 
Bill S-5 is an important initiative in law reform. 
I commend the government and the minister for it. 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
If that is inappropriate, possibly Senator Kinsella can answer my question.  
Does anyone know what Senator Watt's concern is? 
Is it appropriate for me to ask the question now? 
If I could have leave, I will answer the question.  
The question was asked of me, and it is my time to speak.  
That was explained by the minister in her letter.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.

In my opinion, the "nays" have it.  
I declare the amendment lost.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Depository Bills and Notes Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
There was a time when institutions held and exchanged such instruments directly. 
The documents actually changed hands.  
Yet, the legislation governing financial institutions does not reflect this established practice.  
Passage of this bill will authorize it to do so. 
This initiative also has the support of all stakeholders in the financial community.  
I invite you to adopt without delay this constructive technical bill. 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :

Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?
