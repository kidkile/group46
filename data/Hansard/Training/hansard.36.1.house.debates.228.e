The House met at 10 a.m. 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
The bill was passed unanimously.  
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise to present another petition. 
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale, Lib.):
Mr. Charles Hubbard (Miramichi, Lib.):
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-East York, Lib.):
Question No. 203- Mr. Paul Forseth: 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
My constituents and I have now been waiting 169 days. 
When can I expect an answer to Question No. 169.  
I assure the member I will follow up on Question No. 169.  
The government is really interfering with my ability to do my job. 
When can I expect an answer to Question No. 185? 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Shall the remaining questions stand?  
PUBLIC SECTOR PENSION INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
BILL C-78-TIME ALLOCATION 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I move: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the said motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I declare the motion carried.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Citation 698 found on page 207 of the same work states: 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The royal recommendation was in place. 
The error rests with the Speaker. 
We will now proceed to debate.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Of course, now the heat has been really turned up. 
What is happening is absolutely shameful. 
It does not bear the support of the members most affected by this. 
Sure, we can talk about it here, but those blinking Liberals over there- 
I just called them blinking Liberals, that is all I said. 
There is nothing bad about that. 
It is as bad as I can get under the rules of the House.  
I know why they do not want anyone to talk about it too much. 
That is absolutely shameful.  
I am not surprised that the Liberals are doing it. 
I remember a bank robbery in Edmonton not long ago. 
It is absolutely ridiculous what the Liberals are doing. 
Instead of calling it a surviving spouse, the government has subtly changed it to survivor. 
I will give members an example. 
He could say that they were in a conjugal relationship. 
How would anyone be able to prove otherwise? 
This is so ridiculous and offensive. 
Furthermore, it is in opposition to what almost every MP in the House voted against.  
They are told how to vote and they simply comply.  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
It is allowing through the back door changes affecting same sex marriages and so on. 
It is becoming a term that is used in society every day.  
However, in the eyes of the government that no longer matters.  
We have a serious problem with single parent families in the country. 
A large percentage of them are poor and rely on some form of government assistance. 
We are now being pressured by same sex couples to adopt children. 
We now have same sex couples demanding the right of marriage. 
We see the definition here saying that they want the same rights as everybody else.  
We are talking about survivor benefits under pension plans for the civil service. 
However, we are now questioning the definition of a survivor. 
I do not know. 
I put forth the scenario of a retiree whose health is gone. 
One has to assume there is also no conjugal relationship. 
I posed that point to the lawyers. 
They told me that the courts would probably be lenient and recognize it. 
Under the above circumstance, that couple would have no protection at all. 
The government knows it, we know it and the lawyers know it.  
It wants the courts to figure it out. 
I think the bill is absolutely terrible.  
They have prospered and lived together in the sanctity of marriage. 
They have raised families. 
They did a wonderful job of building the country from nothing. 
That is why we are opposed to it.  
In closing, I hope the government would withdraw the bill and rethink the whole issue.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
I would like to defend the definitions of marriage, spouse and the traditional family. 
Unfortunately the Liberal government says one thing and does the opposite. 
I have listened to what government members have said. 
Who makes the laws in the country? 
That is at the root of this problem. 
I say that facetiously because they say one thing and do another.  
That is what the legislation clearly says. 
What has happened in the last 20 or 30 years?  
Reform policy defines marriage as: 
That is what we stand for and that is what we believe in. 
What will the survivor do? 
Now it will do away with that and go to anyone's definition of it. 
It will be a dream world for lawyers. 
Another person will say ``so did I'', and so on. 
It is absolutely ridiculous what the legislation does and what it creates. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The recorded division on the motion stands deferred. 
We will now proceed to Group No. 3.  
``set out in an Act of Parliament in respect of that portion.  
In subsection (1.2) 
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ) moved: 
(1) The Governor in Council shall, for'' 
In subsection (1.01), 
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ) moved: 
(1) The Governor in Council shall, for'' 
``contributions rates set out in an Act of Parliament in respect of that portion.  
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ) moved: 
(1) The Governor in Council shall, for'' 
That will still leave $100 billion in the plan.  
I think of Barings Bank, one of the great venerable banks of London, England. 
It had been around for the better part of 200 years, perhaps longer. 
That bank expanded around the world. 
They bet the wrong way and it just about broke them.  
A lot of money could be lost in six years. 
What did the government say? 
What can I say? 
We have abdicated our responsibility.  
I would like to be able to debate this all day. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
I have the bill here. 
It is clearly a huge document.  
This affects 275,000 contributors. 
Of course, those who contributed in the past are now benefiting from the plan. 
I agree that this would not be a smart thing to do. 
I have seen how it treated the hourly workers of this country in its reform. 
Its track record is not good.  
This is the message this government is sending the private sector.  
This is the sort of government we have.  
Gangway, he is coming through. 
It will probably argue that it invested it to reduce our collective debt. 
This is what we call a double standard.  
Who will manage the board? 
The appointment process will be very similar to that used for the Senate. 
The President of the Treasury Board will establish an advisory committee of eight persons. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
This is getting to be a real pattern. 
We are dealing with the amendments in Group No. 3. 
Where are we going to invest this money? 
What firm are we going to use to convey these transactions? 
The conflict of interest possibilities are enormous. 
This is something that the House of Commons used to do. 
It used to have to be tabled here and be debated here.  
It is also a breach of trust. 
I do not think it is unparliamentary to say it is a breach of trust. 
The Liberals said they would not do it. 
There is a historical record with this labour pact that this would not happen.  
They are incorporating it into Bill C-78. 
It will be another dent in the morale of the public sector.  
Productivity is the big buzzword these days. 
They had a pretty good idea that some job security was associated with it. 
They probably had some comfort there. 
There were 50,000 employees out on the street with no job security anymore. 
That protective umbrella is a thing of the past. 
They did not have the job security but they were making an okay wage. 
Then there were six years of wage freezes. 
If they started out on par, they fell way behind.  
The work does not go away. 
They are working harder and their wages are frozen. 
That gets used against them at the bargaining table. 
The deal has been broken. 
It has been violated. 
There are no stipulations about what kind of investments will be acceptable. 
We do not need to take less money to have an ethical investment fund. 
We had a couple of stipulations. 
Most Canadians would agree with that. 
No Canadian has any appetite for the economic exploitation of children. 
Why do we not have an ethical plan that stipulates these things? 
The plan falls short in any stipulation of ethical investments. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
I want to talk about same sex survivor benefits. 
It is important to note that there is no radical agenda at work here. 
The amendments do not redefine marriage, for example. 
Nor do they legalize same sex marriage. 
That is not what is at play here. 
It is not and it is important that we speak on the record accordingly.  
The courts are not setting the agenda. 
That too is important to understand. 
The cost has been estimated at approximately $5 million per year.  
The courts have been very clear on the issue of discrimination based on sexual orientation. 
They have indicated that discriminatory language must be removed. 
I elaborate further on the use of the word spouse. 
Generally speaking legislation does not refer to a common law relationship. 
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
It is a beautiful day in Ottawa. 
Groups of school children and people from all over come here.  
What did we do an hour ago? 
That goes against everything that the country stands for.  
Today is the 52nd time the government has moved closure. 
They need to be recognized for the work they have done. 
They should be able to retire in some form of security. 
Has it told us what it will do with the money? 
Will it pay down the debt? 
It will establish a public sector pension investment board. 
That needs some looking at as well. 
I believe that is a very good motion. 
All of these issues need to be addressed. 
That comes into this whole issue.  
What does it want it for? 
Why is it so eager to get its hands on it? 
Let us consider our health care system. 
Why are some of these things not being done? 
People who want information from this government will not receive it. 
Therein lies the problem.  
Sadness, because all the Liberal members voted in favour of this closure.  
It is a means of expression.  
I would ask your permission to finish my minute of silence. 
It had lasted barely some 15 seconds.  
This is not usual practice. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
This is not the first time this has happened. 
There have been at least 50 other such occasions.  
We are told that we have ten minutes in which to express our views.  
That is one form of expression.  
The point of a speech in the House is to express an opinion.  
One cannot, for example, ask for 10 minutes in which to say nothing. 
The member must speak.  
I therefore invite him to continue. 
I have already made a ruling on this issue.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
Did my colleague use language that was in contempt of parliament? 
No. Did my colleague use props to illustrate what he was saying? 
No. Did my colleague use unparliamentary language which could offend the institution? 
No. Does my colleague have a right to express himself? 
I am here to rule on points of order.  
On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
On the same point of order?  
I have made my ruling on this and that is that.  
Mr. Speaker, I am sorry for all the kerfuffle I have caused. 
I have too much respect for the people here to do that.  
Let us turn now to Bill C-78. 
I would like to provide a bit of background. 
This committee carried on consultations for four years. 
Everyone contributed effectively to this committee. 
The President of the Treasury Board recognized the committee's effectiveness. 
These words speak reams.  
It totally changed its position. 
I have achieved a zero deficit. 
Look how great it is''. 
The government has made a habit of doing that. 
Remember the siphoning of money from the employment insurance fund. 
But we will be the ones investing your money''. 
The government siphoned off $20 billion and is now reinvesting $11 billion.  
Let us now take a look at what Bill C-78 does.  
This money is being managed by people who are not accountable. 
It is a disgrace.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
I am sad to say that again the government has resorted to closure. 
Imagine the following situation.  
This will have two major impacts for employees and pensioners.  
How will it be able to buy and sell companies without disrupting the markets? 
Imagine the effects of a fund worth over $100 billion.  
Another problem not addressed in this legislation is that of the RCMP. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
I thought it was a very good tribute. 
I stand and applaud the Bloc for that. 
It is the death of democracy in the House of Commons.  
It just has to have it.  
That is the difference between the New Democratic Party and the Liberal Party. 
It is as clear as night.  
Then we would have some solid democracy.  
It will come back to haunt them in spades. 
The Right Hon. Prime Minister will step down. 
His finance minister may win the nomination to be the Liberal leader. 
If they need a road, it will be done. 
If they need another prison, it will be done. 
If they need tax breaks, it will be done. 
That was the money of employers and employees. 
This money does not belong to them. 
It belongs to the workers who worked hard for it.  
Our military men and women throughout the world work hard on behalf of Canada. 
What has been their answer to them for their efforts over the years? 
I am not sure on that. 
They are treating them with absolutely no regard at all. 
A classic example was the recent pay equity decision. 
They will fight pay equity tooth and nail. 
They went back on their word. 
They went back on their word.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The facts are still the facts. 
This is precisely what the Liberals are doing. 
This will come back to haunt the Liberals big time. 
They are the ones to whom the Liberals should be talking.  
It goes on and on and on. 
Bill C-78 is just a classic example.  
Mark my words, the Liberals will invoke closure on that one as well. 
There were over 800 amendments to that bill. 
I will not take up much more time of the House. 
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
We heard quotes from the member for Waterloo-Wellington and his quote was- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It had nothing to do with the government.  
Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for clarifying that.  
He indicated that parliament was merely keeping pace with court actions. 
That was quite a statement. 
On this side of the House we would call that judicial activism. 
It is back door democracy.  
I will refer to some comments made on Tuesday by the member for Mississauga West. 
That is a real oxymoron when it comes to government generated returns on anything.  
We know it will not go there.  
There may be merit in doing that, but what is the government doing instead? 
Who owns any pension surplus? 
The federal government says no. 
We see the finance minister raid the so-called EI fund. 
That is not fair because he will run out of unguarded accounts to claim. 
That is not prudent or responsible. 
The fundamentals are not right.  
Let us be clear on this. 
Our amendments would bring accountability to the process.  
It sounds like a simple business procedure. 
We also have a problem with the vague and unnecessary interference with personal relationships. 
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
We are no longer in a parliament where we can speak freely. 
When we want to talk, we are denied the right to do so. 
The minister will appear, but will not be able to testify for very long. 
This is what I call the tyranny of the majority. 
I am referring again to what I call the tyranny of the majority.  
If I may, I will take a minute to calm down.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
One is not allowed to do indirectly what one cannot do directly. 
I would like us to continue, because I want to hear the speeches.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Saint-Jean has 10 minutes of debate. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank you for your solicitude. 
Unlike the member for Bourassa, you can understand.  
I have calmed down now. 
I thank you for your decision.  
Today, we have two motions before us. 
When is he going to stop talking?  
When opposition members are speaking, we are continually being interrupted.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
They are preventing me from speaking. 
I too can speak while he does. 
I am simply following his logic- 
No, you do not have the floor.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It forgets to say that this has been done at the expense of unemployed workers. 
It forgets to say quite a bit.  
We want to take it as it is. 
I would like to conclude with a motion. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I think a review of House procedure is in order.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
These concerns are being brought forward as we discuss the amendments to the bill.  
We know this is not the case. 
The facts of the case are quite simple.  
This fund belongs to the members of the plan. 
This would be a very desirable use for the surplus. 
This is really a democratic principle. 
We have seen it happen over and over again. 
Who are we affecting with this legislation? 
We are affecting the Canadian military, the people who are fighting over in Kosovo. 
While they are protecting society, who is protecting their pension fund? 
It is certainly not the government.  
Caught with its hand in the cookie jar.  
A hand in the cookie jar, that is exactly what is happening.  
We have a lot of concerns about this particular legislation.  
The government has set the precedent by doing exactly that.  
The government is again failing to come to an agreement to settle those issues. 
This is just a continuation of that pattern. 
Why not improve the pension benefits for those who are receiving benefits?  
We know that $9,600 goes nowhere today. 
What is the government doing? 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
However, I will save that matter for another day.  
Canadians do not have to believe me. 
All they have to do is listen to the words of a pension plan expert. 
It's a sad commentary on democracy. 
I agree with the actuary from William Mercer. 
It stinks to high heaven. 
I notice there are smiles and grins across the way. 
This is a serious situation for the people involved.  
It has hidden it. 
The government is not disclosing what it is doing with it.  
This bill is unprecedented. 
It is limiting debate.  
Is this the tip of the iceberg? 
Is this just the beginning? 
Why is this so worrying? 
Why does the government need this unprecedented power? 
It enables the government to bypass parliament and put to regulation whatever it wishes.  
It is getting worse not better since I put that out.  
In essence, it gives them the power to tax employees.  
Do members want to see the hypocrisy of the government? 
Section 9.2(1) states: 
(a) the employer establishes that 
I have to ask why there is this double standard. 
Because it has the absolute power to do anything it wants. 
And we all know that absolute power corrupts absolutely. 
A couple of hours ago I asked the government some questions. 
They are on the record. 
I do not think I have to repeat them. 
In fact I do not have time to repeat them. 
It is refusing to answer these questions. 
I have just asked another series of questions. 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
I do not understand what the fuss is all about. 
If there is a problem tomorrow, who is going to make up for the shortfall? 
Is the opposition going to write a cheque to pay for the shortfall?  
After all, whose money is it anyway? 
Who has contributed to the pension fund in the first place? 
There is one thing for sure. 
That is in theory if that is the case.  
Here we have something completely different. 
That is sound, good economics. 
As a result of that, everyone will know what his or her responsibilities are. 
Everyone will know what his or her rights are. 
We will move forward.  
It is totally uncalled for. 
There have been a number of improvements.  
It belongs to us collectively as taxpayers. 
It also belongs to the public servants.  
As individuals they are entitled to their pensions no matter what. 
The President of the Treasury Board is doing the absolutely responsible and right thing. 
I commend him for that. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We have a few minutes. 
Otherwise we could get started on Statements by Members just a little bit early.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
It is a camouflage bill. 
It totally distorts something which is true and historic to Canada.  
I want to use an analogy. 
I always hate to interrupt these lively debates. 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
They make our communities a better place in which to live.  
I urge all Canadians to support their community service clubs. 
We wish it many more years of success.  
CANADIAN CENTRE FOR MINERAL AND ENERGY TECHNOLOGY 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
Canada is a world leader in the field of mining. 
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
Today those members resume their seats to begin the business of governing the new territory. 
May they govern wisely and govern well.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
DRUMMONDVILLE'S LEGENDES FANTASTIQUES 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
My congratulations to its directors, and best wishes for a good summer.  
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, today I would like to wish Canada's next astronaut a successful voyage.  
Julie, a native Montrealer, is a most outstanding individual. 
I say good luck and bon voyage.  
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE 
Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, once again the Reformer on the opposite side has his facts all wrong.  
I have a suggestion for the member for Dewdney-Alouette. 
He should be the founding member of the huff and puff party.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
They are professionals, dedicated and committed to the well-being of human kind.  
Is it any wonder we are facing a nursing shortage?  
THE LATE MARCEL PEPIN 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Marcel Pepin was passionately interested in politics and an independent soul. 
Marcel Pepin, you will be greatly missed.  
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
He is the first Canadian of Asian origins to be elected to that post. 
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Thousands more are injured. 
Yet the government is introducing only half measures to deal with this tragedy.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
When I receive that report I will review it and I will respond.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, studying and reports will not save lives. 
There is no time for political delay. 
We need tougher laws now. 
We have studied and we have reported long enough.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
I understand members of the official opposition have been working on this report. 
I look forward to receiving it.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
I dare say that would be worth it.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
I will take very seriously that which is recommended by the standing committee.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to hear the minister. 
She said three times that she anticipates the report, that she awaits the report.  
The minister's staff has seen the report. 
They know we have a unanimous report of the committee. 
A half a loaf is better than no loaf at all. 
We want the report to be in the House.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
In fact I have not seen the report. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
The minister knows her staff has told people. 
They have been involved in this. 
We did not leak the report. 
This is about drunk driving. 
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
I know it has worked very hard on this report. 
Hon. members of the opposition have worked very hard. 
When the report is tabled in the House, I will respond.  
MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am satisfied with the explanation the minister gave yesterday.  
Responding to all these requests takes time and staff. 
Unfortunately, there was a delay. 
It was not caused by the minister. 
Nothing can therefore be held against the minister.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, this is an all too convenient excuse.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, first of all, this is completely inaccurate.  
I categorically deny it.  
This is a tempest in a teapot. 
The whole thing is absolutely clear and transparent. 
The files were given to the journalists as requested. 
The opposition is saying my office held them up. 
The files were in my office for 12 working days.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the commissioner never said that I violated the act. 
This is totally absurd.  
The word ``defy'' was used in reference to my office. 
There is some confusion in the letter between my department and my office. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the information commissioner is not a Quebecker. 
He is a person mandated by the federal government to do a job.  
He violated the act for a political gain.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The fact that the National Post wrote this does not mean it is true. 
This is a tempest in a teapot. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
We are in a situation right now of an emergency evacuation. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
I am really disappointed by what is going on right now. 
We are working for these people. 
Canada is one of the most generous countries of the world.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
The government has already cut the military from 80,000 to 60,000. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
At this stage it is only a proposal. 
There has been no decision made about it. 
I am happy to look at this proposal and other proposals.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
I am so pleased to hear that. 
He is not going to cut the reserves whatsoever. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
SUPREME COURT OF CANADA 
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Supreme Court Justice Cory is retiring. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I do not want to import an American system that would not work as well.  
The hon. member for Calgary Centre.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
The official opposition quotes numbers from various studies. 
MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
This is completely unacceptable''.  
The hon. minister may reply if he wishes.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
It remained there for 12 working days.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
If he does not know that, there is a problem.  
This has never happened before.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
My department has received 50% more access requests. 
We are taking steps to correct the situation. 
The delay is decidedly regrettable, but it was not intentional. 
We have already taken steps to address the situation.  
They are much more- 
The hon. member for Fraser Valley.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Will the minister accept responsibility for this decision? 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have not seen either of the films in question.  
MINISTER OF HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
How can he explain to us that his department received the request on January 28? 
The department has nothing to do with me''. 
He says that, even if they got the request on January 28. 
He is the one responsible for his department. 
How is it that he did not answer?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I am totally responsible for my department. 
I have 25,000 employees under my responsibility, moreover.  
What the leader of the Bloc Quebecois referred to was my office. 
He brought my office into question. 
I am responsible for my department. 
I have already said the delay was regrettable. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
This seems to me to be pretty clear.  
The Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, no investigator ever came to my office. 
There is a distinction between my office and my department, that is clear.  
We are going to improve the situation. 
The member for Calgary Northeast.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the government is sending 800 Canadian troops over to Macedonia. 
The trouble is it will take two months to get there and guess what? 
The defence minister can see for himself the problem. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
The Reform Party of course knows how to waste taxpayers' money.  
We are spending the money in the best way for the taxpayer.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Instead it resorts to rent a ship to get our equipment over there.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
On some routes, carriers report no more than five passengers on average.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my colleague opposite is mistaken.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Labour.  
Hon. Claudette Bradshaw (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
I can inform the House that new regulations are being drafted. 
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
That's the basis of the treaty''.  
The Nisga'a are Canadians and the charter applies to all Canadians.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
The charter applies to the federal and provincial governments. 
It is silent on the proposed Nisga'a government. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
How does the minister justify that decision?  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member accuses us of sitting on the report. 
If we had moved any faster we would have been accused of ramming this through.  
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
That is in the constitution.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Mr. Speaker, let me remind the minister that a constitutional amendment would be needed.  
The Minister of National Defence talks about elimination. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am not proposing any constitutional amendments. 
The member is talking about a very hypothetical situation.  
They contribute in great numbers to both the regulars and the reserves. 
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Since that time, we have consulted with Canadian industry to register their concerns. 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
We have been working on this for two years. 
This testing range has been in operation since 1965. 
It is vital that we continue to use that seabed.  
Mr. Gerard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
The hon. member is mistaken. 
Our aim is to improve the situation.  
The report by the Standing Committee on Transport contained recommendations in this regard. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Is the minister really serious about considering such a drastic move?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
It does not necessarily mean amalgamation. 
Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, Lib.):
Canadians question, why will the Europeans not accept our beef?  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
If we do not get that, we will retaliate.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
That will result in a number of votes at 5.30 p.m., or thereabouts.  
Next week is a constituency week. 
The hours that day will be those usually followed on a Monday. 
PUBLIC SECTOR PENSION INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
He has eight minutes remaining for his remarks.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
We will call this building the government building.  
I want to show the House what has happened. 
That is what the government is saying at the front door. 
There are many questions that have to be answered. 
The government cannot even ask this question. 
This bill will destroy our heritage. 
This bill will destroy the terminology of marriage. 
This is not a laughing matter. 
What is the relationship? 
The question has been asked, but it has not been answered. 
How will the individual prove that the relationship is indeed a true relationship? 
Who is going to prove that? 
We have come through a great era in the building of this country. 
The government has destroyed it through the back door.  
Shame on the government.  
No one on the other side will answer the question. 
Those members do not care. 
Shame on the government.  
That will take place.  
Hundreds of acts will be modified by this bill through the back door. 
The government knows that, so it brought in closure.  
That question has to be answered before we can proceed with this bill.  
I beg the government to pull this bill before tonight. 
It is wrong for Canada. 
It is wrong for the people living in this century. 
Canadians, I am afraid, will learn that only too late.  
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
This is exactly what Bill C-78 addresses.  
The current plan contains a contingency reserve of $3 billion a year. 
I am surprised that the Reform Party does not support the bill. 
There is support for the bill. 
The Toronto Star wrote: 
Even Mr. Rex Guy, national president of the Federal Superannuates National Association, stated: 
There are provisions in the bill to address these concerns.  
Rather they can be debited over a period of up to 15 years.  
The federal government has always been committed to the pension plan. 
It has done so on many occasions in the past. 
Again Bill C-78 is adding such a provision to the public sector plan.  
It represents a strong commitment to taking Canada out of debt. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I would be delighted if you came to visit my riding. 
I am very pleased to speak to the motions in Group No. 3. 
Right now, they have the worst of both worlds. 
The federal government took this money. 
I think the arguments made by my colleague on the majority side are inadequate. 
It is taking money from the employment insurance and the pension funds. 
The funds were not collected for this purpose. 
The intent of our amendment is to correct this situation.  
The government opposite was highly criticized. 
These are decisions involving billions of dollars. 
Individual members are being denied an opportunity to speak. 
The Liberal majority is contradicting itself. 
This is a rather frustrating debate. 
It is also one that will surely lead people to pass judgement on this government. 
These two amendments would go a long way to making this bill more acceptable. 
I am asking the government majority to adot them.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
It means, of course, an election. 
We are not complaining about health spending. 
If I am rather cynical about it, I think it is understandable.  
Goodness knows whether the planned increases in premiums will make enough of a difference.  
Now it is turning to the public service pension plan.  
Despite all of this the debt is still far too high. 
Taxes are far too high. 
That is just one of the ways they have been able to balance the books. 
Yet the government attempts to justify its actions in the name of deficit reduction. 
Taxpayers own the surpluses in the public service pension plans. 
The Liberals should just take their hands off it. 
The central issue surrounds the definition of spouse. 
The government has rightly affirmed the traditional definitions of spouse and marriage. 
It is important that we begin with the proper definitions. 
As the House knows there is a cost incurred through child rearing. 
Within Bill C-78 is the intent to extend benefits to same sex couples. 
Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne-Blainville, BQ):
Madam Speaker, errare humanum est, persevere diabolicum, said the Romans. 
To err is human, but to persist is diabolical. 
One could not describe any better the bill before us.  
We have to face the facts. 
That is certainly as bold, shameless and cynical as can be.  
It is time to recall the history of the social union.  
But, it is an ill wind that blows no good. 
I would now like to introduce a motion. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
You haven't been listening.  
It is nothing more than fearmongering and trying to get people upset. 
I want to give an example.  
I received an e-mail from Mr. Greg Jones, a constituent of mine. 
The government is guaranteeing their retirement benefits in this plan. 
The pension plan is not being threatened in any way whatsoever.  
It is a very secure bill. 
We are dealing with amendments in Group No. 3. 
The pension plan is secured and primarily funded by the taxpayer. 
They know that is not true. 
I do not have a problem with that.  
It is putting out information that is not based on fact or truth. 
It is a serious bit of unfair propaganda being put before the retired people.  
That is probably one of the most distasteful things about this. 
Those people are relying on their pensions. 
Maybe they are a little bit worried about their economic situation. 
They should not feel that they are under siege.  
It is an unfair tactic that they are using in getting these folks upset.  
I represent retired federal workers. 
We know that and we it is appropriate. 
To do it the way the hon. member is suggesting would create a gridlock. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
That is a terrible false assumption. 
It cannot be true.  
What the Liberal government is missing entirely is the unfairness of what it is doing. 
That may be true. 
However, they fail to recognize what a surplus means. 
That is totally obvious. 
If it were not the case, there would not be a surplus. 
To whom does that money belong?  
We have all of these different questions being asked. 
This bill also addresses the plan for members of parliament.  
I remember when I was a little itty-bitty kid. 
That was a long time ago. 
His looking after himself turned out to be a disadvantage. 
That was a case where a person put money away. 
Many Canadians have a mixture. 
It represents money that I put in, but also money that my employer put in. 
I hope that money will be there, according to the contract.  
That is not the question. 
The surplus exists because the people have paid too much.  
Indirectly he has divested himself of these interests, temporarily, while he is a cabinet minister. 
I believe he must have done that. 
That is no different from the issue we have here. 
All of the money does not belong to it. 
The proportion has to be worked out. 
Why do we not do that? 
Let us be fair. 
That is what is missing.  
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
That revolts me, to start with.  
This government deliberately attacked the unemployed a few years ago. 
That is their specialty.  
They are very honest. 
We know what they are up to.  
More and more, the government is shirking its responsibilities. 
I will ask the agency. 
I cannot interfere, because it is an independent agency''.  
It is not an independent agency.The 
But this board will not be independent.  
Now, all agencies are controlled by the Privy Council. 
This is where the real power lies. 
It is not in this House. 
The government is trying to tell us that this is an honest proposal. 
I have a lot of trouble with this word. 
It is a bit like a swindle. 
I would like to go back to the very democratic incident of this morning. 
This bill affects many people, some of them retired. 
All the countries focused on their products. 
Canada's image in Paris especially was something else. 
There were so many Canadian flags that it was hard to see the products. 
Members can imagine the kind of image we are projecting on the international level. 
The maple leaf propaganda of the Liberals.  
To conclude, I would like to ask for unanimous consent to move the following motion: 
Is the House ready for the question?  
The question is on Motion No. 16. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The recorded division on Motion No. 16 stands deferred. 
The recorded division will also apply to Motions Nos. 39 and 47.  
The next question is on Motion No. 38. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The recorded division on the motion stands deferred.  
The deferred vote will also apply to motions Nos. 46 and 54.  
We will now proceed to the motions in Group No. 4. 
The mover for Motion No. 33 is not present. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP) moved: 
Again the mover for Motion No. 35 is not here.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP) moved: 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ) moved: 
That Bill C-78 be amended by deleting Clause 151.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP) moved: 
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ) moved: 
That Bill C-78 be amended by deleting Clause 198.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP) moved: 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Is there unanimous consent that we proceed in this fashion?  
We will finish this motion first.  
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ) moved: 
Mr. Ken Epp (for Mr. John Williams) moved: 
That Bill C-78 be amended by deleting Clause 95.  
That Bill C-78 be amended by deleting Clause 96.  
That Bill C-78 be amended by deleting Clause 152.  
That Bill C-78 be amended by deleting Clause 199.  
That completes the list of motions in Group No. 4. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I can clear this up very quickly. 
I wanted once again to start by making this point.  
The government has used closure 53 times since in this parliament, since 1997. 
Basically, I think there are two types of members of parliament. 
Moreover, the government's attitude is utterly arrogant. 
I find that attitude highly despicable.  
That is not what the government did. 
The fund had accumulated $20 billion to $25 billion. 
I would remind him, women public servants are also voters. 
They are in every riding.  
These are not people who are earning a fortune. 
They earn about $30,000 a year. 
These are the people who keep the regional economy running. 
The federal government will get some of the money back in income and other taxes.  
The government is doing this deliberately. 
It says ``See what good administrators we are. 
Look at our public management, here is our report card''. 
Who resolved the deficit? 
But they do not answer the question. 
Suppose they take it and things do not work out, then what? 
There are basic problems. 
Up to now we have talked of rip-off, abduction, control and raiding. 
So, the example has already been given. 
We did nothing wrong''.  
They all thought ``Some day, we will get our hands on that surplus''. 
Yes they listen to their parliamentary leader when the time comes to gag the opposition. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
I thank the House for that indulgence.  
As I have said, there are several solutions to this. 
One of them is to just leave the money where it is. 
It puts a bit of a security blanket on the fund. 
The motions put forward by the Reform Party will do just that. 
It is just wrong. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
That of course is the whole goal of the bill.  
That is a quote, Mr. Speaker. 
This is where we started from.  
It is part of the pay package and wage package.  
That is certainly what we are being told by the minister's actions.  
Now we are being told it is something completely separate.  
It has been shattered. 
It has been broken. 
It gives unprecedented powers to the minister that way.  
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
We are opposed to the bill now being debated for several reasons. 
There are 160,000 retirees and 52,000 surviving spouses.  
There was even a decision pending in the private sector. 
People are still waiting. 
The workers are getting older, some are already retired. 
My hon. colleagues have talked about the government using and abusing closure. 
A lot of my constituents work for the government. 
This cynical government rises and says ``The debate is over''. 
This is what gagging the opposition is all about.  
We have something to say on each of these amendments.  
There is no end to this. 
Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House to move his motion?  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
This sadness hangs over the opposition members.  
This government's management style is unacceptable. 
This government uses it to muzzle the opposition. 
Why muzzle the opposition? 
I come from an extremely proud and a highly industrialized community. 
There is a tax data centre there. 
What did they do recently to the Department of National Revenue? 
They set up another agency. 
I think they are trying to see how many agencies they can set up. 
Why is this government doing that? 
Because they have a whole lot of friends to thank.  
I have always been in active politics. 
What is this government doing? 
Taking care of all its friends. 
Why must these people be compensated? 
Because the government has nothing to give the people. 
It has to look after its friends first of all.  
What is going on right now with Bill C-78 is unacceptable. 
The government is doing the same thing it did with the EI fund. 
Too much is not enough, as they say, and so is too little. 
This government has no common sense.  
On weekends I visit my riding. 
We will show them a thing or two''.  
They did not go to the same school as we did. 
They are insulted by his unwillingness to recognized pay equity.  
In most cases, these women have sacrificed their health.  
The workload has increased. 
They have children under their care. 
It is high time workers put the government in its place. 
On top of that, it likes to reward its friends.  
I am not proud today. 
It is May 13. Usually, 13 is my lucky number. 
The government has other ideas. 
Instead of increasing this decent income, it takes money from these people. 
Then it says that it is for their own good. 
One of these days, the Liberals will be judged. 
We will be able to say that we told them not to do that. 
They will be condemned, and I will be there to applaud.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
PUBLIC SECTOR PENSION INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
It is estimated that there is a surplus of about $30 billion.  
From time to time we should draw wisdom from the media. 
What, for example, is the nature of the federal employees' plan? 
What is the amount they contribute from their earnings? 
They contribute a maximum of 7.5% of their earnings to this plan. 
What is the duty of the federal government to this plan?  
How can you stand there?  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:
You do not believe in democracy or you would not have shut down debate.  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:
What is the issue before us? 
Two weeks ago Ottawa introduced legislation....  
I hope the Reform Party would agree with that. 
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
He talked about democracy and what this House is all about. 
I agree that presumably the House is all about democracy. 
However, this is now the 53rd or 54th time- 
Bring out the brown shirts. 
He limits debate time and time again in the House.  
I have to interrupt the hon. member.  
The question is on Motion No. 33. 
Is it the pleasure of the House adopt the motion?

The question is on Motion No. 1. 
(The House divided on Motion No. 1, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare Motion No. 1 defeated. 
Is there agreement to proceed in such a fashion?  
(The House divided on Motion No. 9, which was negatived on the following division:)

Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas-Charlottenburgh, Lib.):
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
This bill could be put through quickly with all-party support.  
What does Bill C-260 do? 
As I said, it is very simple and straightforward. 
Those conditions, once imposed, are meant to be respected. 
Nothing else would change.  
This is the third hour of a votable private member's bill. 
We keep hearing rumours that the government is going to prorogue parliament in June. 
Legislation on the Order Paper will die. 
In our estimation there is some need to push this forward. 
It is already in the legislation.  
The reality is that the bill as it is presently constituted will accomplish that. 
Mr. Gar Knutson (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister, Lib.):
The Reform Party member for Surrey North should take some credit for that inclusion.  
Let me first look at the current situation under the Young Offenders Act. 
The question is on the amendment.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
I acknowledge the ongoing efforts of the member for Surrey North in this regard. 
Unfortunately the new bill is a disappointment. 
That is not to say that commendable changes have not come about. 
That would be seen in a positive light.  
However other offences have been excluded for some reason from consideration. 
They simply do not have those resources. 
It is nothing short of lip service. 
There is an absolutely hypocritical nature to the bill.  
Consulted is one thing but being actually listened to is another. 
It demonstrates to me that it is another example of broken promises. 
This is certainly the intention of the provinces today. 
No where have we ever seen the commitment of the federal government to do so. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Maybe they think that is a good idea. 
The parliamentary secretary said that it has not been killed. 
That is what they did on the other side. 
That is a shame. 
Democracy is really great on the other side. 
The Liberals have killed this bill. 
They have killed this young offenders section. 
They will pay the price for that. 
What is even worse is that young people will pay the price. 
They are going to kill Bill C-68.  
That is why we incorporated it.  
This bill could have passed. 
That is what a hoist means. 
If the hon. member for Surrey North speaks now, he will close the debate.  
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, there is not much to say. 
I think most members can attest to that.  
This piece of legislation was an idea that was prompted by some personal experience. 
It would have been good legislation for the country. 
That is part of the deal here. 
Judging by what I have seen, I do not anticipate that will happen.  
There is not an awful lot more I can say on this other than- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
And the bells having rung: 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
The Nuremberg Code of 1947 clearly states that in terms of following orders: 
The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential.  
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Our maritime and air personnel did an excellent job.  
The dangers faced by the approximately 360 Canadians in the gulf were very real. 
They included the possibility that biological weapons could be used against our personnel.  
Part of this protection was inoculating them against anthrax. 
We had to protect Canadian personnel against the use of such biological weapons. 
To do otherwise would be both irresponsible and unconscionable.  
However, cohesion and discipline are fundamental elements in an effective armed force. 
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 7.07 p.m.)
