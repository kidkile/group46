EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 97 
Friday, May 1, 1998 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
MI'KMAQ EDUCATION ACT 
Bill C-30 is neither a lengthy nor a technical bill. 
It deals with a very specific issue for a distinct group of people. 
Why is this bill so important? 
We are hopeful it will lead to many more undertakings.  
This is not a new concept. 
The bill is an important step toward this objective.  
Funding levels will be reviewed after five years.  
This will be affirmed through separate provincial legislation.  
Today, I am asking members of parliament to take that resolution into account.  
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
They came with the purpose of promoting the bill.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
We would support this legislation if our amendments can be incorporated.  
We also want them to be an equal part of this Canadian mosaic.  
However, our concern is that in past experience this has not been the case.  
This raises the concern of how this board will be run. 
Why should that principle not apply here? 
We do not see that happening here. 
That is our first major concern. 
How will the band member be part and parcel in directing school policy?  
Canadians should not be separated. 
Canadians should not be compartmentalized.  
Where will they understand brotherhood? 
Where will they understand comradeship? 
We should be together.  
I have reservations to this bill. 
Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):
The Mi'kmaq have been calling for full authority over education during all this time. 
That obstacle came from the federal government of the day. 
But surprises were still to come, particularly where capital assets were concerned. 
They should therefore enjoy greater autonomy. 
The bill before us today is a fine example of this.  
The consultations that led up to the bill took a long time. 
I wonder about the definition of that word in the bill. 
Also, in French, do the words ''collectivite'' and ``communaute'' mean the same thing? 
But rationalization is the new watchword, and school boards have bowed to government demands. 
The distance between cities is enormous in some cases. 
The Fermont school board, for instance, has been merged with that of Sept-Iles. 
The only means of transportation between these two cities is by air.  
Nothing can be built on ignorance.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
However, the Mi'kmaq of Nova Scotia have been working on this since January 1991. 
This bill is the first of its kind. 
I will speak later on this from that point of view.  
There are four groups which so far have not supported the legislation. 
The hon. member does not need consent to share his time. 
He is entitled to divide his time because we are now into 20 minute speeches. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
I appreciate the explanation.  
This legislation has not been supported by all 13 reserves. 
My colleague, you will of course have the floor when we resume debate. 
As it is almost 11 o'clock we will now go to Statements by Members.  
Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, Lib.):
May all participants have a safe and enjoyable weekend.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Expediency is their mantra, not compassion.  
Blood transfusions and 12 major surgeries saved her, sort of. 
Sara received tainted blood through the transfusions. 
She is now a victim, not a file.  
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
They will also be raising money for the Canadian Cancer Society.  
Congratulations to everyone involved in the Unity Peak initiative. 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):
The church was constructed from 1944 to 1946 to support a growing Ukrainian population. 
The first Ukrainian settlers had come to St. Catharines in the early 1900s. 
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Let us pause for a moment to congratulate ourselves for the strides we have made. 
Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard-La Prairie, Lib.):
Workers will therefore be called on to play a larger part. with 
Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
We get only doublespeak from Liberals on this subject. 
In 1993 the Prime Minister promised ``We will have an elected Senate. 
As Prime Minister I can make this happen.'' 
Now in power, he does just the opposite. 
What about Liberal Senator Nick Taylor? 
What an insult to candidates. 
What an insult to Albertans. 
What an insult to people with mental disabilities. 
He should be ashamed of himself. 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):
I salute our Canadian workers.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
On May Day, Canadian trade unionists remember our own history of struggle. 
We all move forward when we move forward together.  
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
They will be institutionalized and their quality of life will be lost.  
Charles and his parents did not choose for him to be disabled. 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
SOUTH SURREY EAGLES HOCKEY TEAM 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Speaking of being petty, we are not being petty. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
They have been bad mouthed in this House with respect to their role. 
They are the ones that are paying the medical bills for the victims. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Now another attack of crocodile tears.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, real leadership would do three things for these victims. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
I was the one who was at the table. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Does the Prime Minister at least plan to hold discussions with the provinces to- 
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member. 
I now recognize the hon. Minister of Health.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
This week, it changed its position with respect to what the appropriate period should be.  
This was a cynical and meaningless move. 
It is politics at its worst. 
That is cynical, inappropriate and cruel for the victims.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, a discredited minister, a discredited answer.  
The provinces have simply said ``We are now willing to discuss''. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the position adopted this week by the Quebec government is unacceptable. 
But this would not be appropriate.  
The public knows full well that this is cynical and unacceptable. 
They do not add to the debate. 
The hon. member for Rimouski-Mitis.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Minister Rochon has often told me that health is an exclusive provincial jurisdiction. 
This is not true. 
This is cynical and totally unacceptable.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the government has already agreed to share responsibility with the provinces. 
It is too late to say that the provinces are not responsible. 
The provinces, especially the province of Quebec, have already admitted and accepted this responsibility.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
The federal government has no business interfering. 
Mr. Rock's only business is to see that standards are met.  
This speaks volumes about the provinces' responsibility in this issue.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is mistaken. 
He should read the replies by Lucien Bouchard and Jean Rochon. 
That is what Lucien Bouchard and Jean Rochon said this week.  
They changed their position- 
The hon. member for Qu'Appelle.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, it is not about saving face, it is about showing leadership, Mr. Minister. 
The file is open. 
I repeat, the file is open, Mr. Minister. 
My colleague, please address your questions through the Chair. 
I would ask the member to go directly to his question.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
The Canadian people will see that for what it is. 
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
He has the final authority on compensation. 
The minister has only two choices. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
I shall do the right thing.  
That, at the end of the day, is our most fundamental obligation.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
I will tell the House what is cynical and callous. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
They do not even understand the package. 
They do not even know what we offering. 
Yet, they stand to call names- 
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will tell the House what is edifying. 
Why should we listen to the repeat of these arguments?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
They are still there. 
They are accepting responsibility. 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the President of Treasury Board.  
Pay equity is not negotiable, it is a matter of justice. 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
It has not acknowledged that it was not the fault of the provinces. 
The federal regulators were at fault and this federal government. 
The hon. Minister of Health.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
That is an important principle.  
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
The provinces had no statutory authority in this matter. 
It is irresponsible for this Prime Minister to now blame the provinces. 
It is juvenile and petty to use that kind of hostile rhetoric. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
The hon. member's arguments simply do not add up.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Natural Resources.  
Some of those sources are still in the realm of scientific development. 
The one the hon. gentleman refers to is one of those. 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
That is what is at issue here. 
The hon. member for Fraser Valley.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Justice Krever wrote four volumes of the report. 
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
But we still do not know what he has to propose.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Discussions will continue, and he will take their views into account.  
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Secretary of State (Children and Youth).  
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and Youth), Lib.):
The hon. member for Calgary Southeast.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
I think that would help matters a bit for all of us.  
The last time we checked there were three volumes. 
I wonder if he has actually read them, because the provinces certainly have.  
Now the provinces have opened it up again.  
This minister does not have a clue what is going on. 
The hon. Minister of Health.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, now we see what the source of the problem is. 
The Reform Party has not read the fourth volume of the report.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
The province are not now. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
It is the money.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Was there no lack of principle there? 
I do not say that, but he does.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I think Canadians deserve a better answer than that. 
I asked a legitimate question.  
We all know the money is there. 
If you will not open the old deal, negotiate- 
Address your questions to the Chair, please.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
It is an important principle. 
Surely payment should be for those where there is fault. 
That is the principle on which we have proceeded.  
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, this matter has been dealt with. 
It was a member of the government who indicated these allegations to the RCMP. 
A full inquiry has been made. 
All the facts were in front of the inquiry. 
One charge was put forward and the person has pleaded guilty. 
That is the end of it.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
To suggest otherwise is mendacious.  
What steps has the minister taken to assure the Canadian- 
Mr. Speaker, I withdraw that word.  
The way the question is put is quite borderline. 
I will permit the hon. minister to answer.  
In this case the investigation has been done. 
All the facts were in front of the RCMP and the matter is closed.  
Mrs. Judi Longfield (Whitby-Ajax, Lib.):
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
The hon. member for Crowfoot.  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Why will he not do it? 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, first of all, there is no question there were tests available before 1986. 
Some American states had them, some parts of Europe as well. 
Before that it was speculation, it was uncertainty. 
January 1986 was the turning point.  
The hon. member for Charlesbourg.

Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health. 
Second, if the government has only so much money, so be it. 
We still have an obligation- 
The hon. Minister of Health.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
As a result governments, provincial and federal, have offered cash payments.  
The hon. member for Calgary Centre.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, provincial health ministers are showing some leadership. 
But what are they getting from across the way? 
Now is the time for action. 
We are asking the Prime Minister to show some real leadership on this issue. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
He thinks that is leadership.  
If he does not realize it, that is exactly what this government is doing.  
That would bring to a close our question period.

Mr. Guy St-Julien:

QUESTIONS PASSED AS ORDERS FOR RETURNS 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
MI'KMAQ EDUCATION ACT 
I invite him now to resume the floor.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
I personally very much enjoy the culture of aboriginal people. 
We know Phil Fontaine supports the bill. 
I would like an answer to that question.  
Specifically my question is what level of accounting will be required? 
How will the auditor be chosen? 
That question must be answered.  
It is an important question.  
About 70 people were aboriginal and I would think 40 of them were status Indians. 
What exactly is self-government? 
Do grassroots aboriginals support it? 
Certainly the people we have heard from do not. 
This fourth point is a comment. 
This was expressed very clearly. 
I really do not feel that I have that assurance right now. 
I also ask that the government answer my questions.  
In closing, there are too many unanswered questions. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not wish to address the technical details of this bill. 
This has been done by other members. 
However, he was not a senior member of the government at that time. 
I would like to speak about the much maligned residential schools. 
They had formally completed what was then referred to as a grade eight education. 
I know some of these residential schools were tough. 
The one that my friends went to was apparently tough. 
In the days they were there all schools were tough. 
I attended a school where corporal punishment was the norm. 
There were some terrible events. 
These people are for all intents and purposes integrated into general society. 
This government is proposing what I would call a policy of dis-integration.  
They thought this was wonderful and went home and did the same.  
We still have the apartheid system. 
We still have the reserves. 
Thank heavens they are now a little more benign, but at what cost? 
We have created this gigantic bureaucracy both in Ottawa and in and about the reserves. 
Therefore I cannot in conscience support this type of legislation. 
It is wrong to divide people. 
This is the old colonial system. 
This is the way it was done in colonial times. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
I think interface was a word that was used.  
It is time for a change, to face the reality of today's situation.  
I emphasize that the chiefs represent their communities. 
Bill C-30 would allow for the transfer to occur.  
This development is not a new idea. 
In Eskasoni we do have language instruction going on in the school. 
And those have many kinds of positive outcomes.  
Bill C-30 will give effect to that final agreement. 
Mi'kmaq educator Marie Battiste said: 
The language is the cement and the bonds. 
It provides the moral communion, if you will, of the community. 
This is a tremendous loss the people feel- 
One of the recommendations of the royal commission report calls for: 
This bill is a significant first step in that direction. 
They were very wise in their years. 
They were self-educated and self-taught.  
Many aboriginal people did not have that opportunity. 
So many people are afraid to move to something different and allow people to change.  
It is the principle and the heart of the bill which are important. 
The bill will enable people to take charge of their own lives. 
They will once again have pride in their heritage. 
They will have control over their own destiny and their own affairs. 
There is nothing for people to fear about that concept.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
If he did attend such an institution, did he think that was a good idea?  
Mr. Speaker, I would applaud you for referring to my riding correctly as Halifax West. 
It is not St. John's East, as my hon. colleague has indicated. 
By that very terminology we are excluding aboriginal people. 
Aboriginal people are a part of the general society. 
There is nothing wrong with that.  
There are many systems of education today which are quite different. 
There are public schools and private schools. 
The two do not conflict.  
I fail to see the point the hon. member is getting at. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
It has been in the public eye for seven years. 
This is not the first time the public has heard of it. 
Nine of the Mi'kmaq first nations signed the final agreement on February 14, 1997. 
The reverse may also occur. 
Both these procedures would be effective as of April 1 the following year.  
It encompasses all Mi'kmaq first nations.  
The advantage of the legislation is therefore minimal for this group. 
Twenty-seven Mi'kmaq first nations currently exist in Canada. 
They have a long history and a strong culture. 
The Indian Act gives the federal government this authority. 
Each community will first have to develop a constitution before it makes up its laws.  
This is an area of great importance to the first nations and its students. 
This is a historic piece of legislation. 
I look forward to examining it in greater detail as the process continues in committee.  
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
MI'KMAQ EDUCATION ACT 
Is the House ready for the question?  
The question is on the motion. 
Is it the pleasure to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The minimum penalty always applies for even the most prolific killers.  
We do not have concurrent sentencing for parking tickets. 
If one parks illegally 10 times, one pays 10 tickets. 
One does not get a volume discount.  
Clearly, concurrent sentencing runs counter to each of these principles.  
Wendy Carroll wrote to me, after narrowly surviving these predators. 
What are they thinking? 
Bill C-251 does not ask the parole board to be any less irresponsible. 
It does not increase the penalty for any crime. 
This way, the lawyer indicated, Olson could take full advantage of concurrent sentencing. 
Olson mocked in the court ``They can't do nothing. 
They can only give me a concurrent sentence''.  
Concurrent sentencing will still be available to all but our most vicious criminals.  
I ask members of this House to place their compassion where it is deserved. 
I am not kidding. 
That sadly is what has been argued in this House.  
Canadians are gradually catching on to the deception of life imprisonment. 
Sickeningly, Denis Lortie was not an exception. 
But the quality of mercy is not strained.  
We know that each convicted serial predator is capable of more horrific crimes. 
If a children's toy had that record, it would be banned.  
I never saw you as a threat to me. 
My main concern was more for your safety than for my own''. 
They consulted you for advice. 
You gave them advice. 
You helped them prepare documents and by the peer group, you were well thought of''.  
One is you are well read. 
You kept me informed of what was going on''.  
This sort of hyperbole is common in the predator protection industry. 
Life imprisonment is not some form of revenge.  
In short, he wanted to preserve the silence of the lambs.  
Instead it is the predator protection industry that is supported. 
Let me summarize the arguments to defend volume discounts for rapists and murderers. 
Most importantly, we do not want to create a victim's industry.  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
They were just encouraged in secret. 
In 1996 the hon. member was also quoted in the Hill Times as saying: 
Mrs. Mahaffy went to state: 
It is headed ``A Justice Minister with a Lower Profile than a Groundhog in Winter''. 
Nevertheless, it did happen. 
I quote from that article: 
Ottawa was a bust for [the member for Surrey North]. 
``I spoke maybe five minutes total,'' he said. 
I shouldn't have even bothered going.'' 
The meeting was poorly chaired, he charged.  
Everything else was geared to the rights of offenders [the member for Surrey North] said. 
None have become law. 
This very necessary bill did not become law. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
There are two main parts to this private members' bill. 
Sentencing in Canada is a relatively complex matter. 
Degrees of punishment are set out in section 718.3.  
Concurrent is when the time runs together. 
Consecutive is when the sentences are cumulative. 
This is a common law principle and is well entrenched in law. 
Consequently we find we cannot support the bill in its present form.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
The bill was then labelled Bill C-321, the ancestor to the present bill: 
I congratulate her on her work. 
These are very collective and substantive suggestions the hon. member has made. 
Bill C-251 provides for truth in sentencing, something we must see. 
The principles of sentencing are set out in the Criminal Code of Canada. 
Try to explain that to victims. 
We have to revisit the principles of sentencing. 
The suggestion by the hon. member is a good one.  
No one should be getting a free ride in our justice system. 
Sadly, that is precisely what happens on occasion. 
It is absolutely absurd.  
He should be serving 11 life sentences. 
Common sense has to apply at some level. 
Conditional sentences are another subject, but that is another matter that has to be revisited. 
Bill C-251 addresses that. 
It does so in a substantial and common sense fashion. 
Therefore I support the member and I support her bill. 
I support truth in sentencing. 
That would give the offender and society the belief in their justice system.  
It is a very good motion on the part of the hon. member.  
A person capable of serious violence and sexual aggression is a risk. 
It has to be a priority. 
It has to be something that we are prepared to address. 
This bill is worthy of our support.  
We must do more. 
We must continue to work toward this important goal.  
Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
They were consulted in all cases. 
We are living in times of tremendous change, as hon. colleagues are well aware. 
Is our justice system working? 
Is it protecting our most vulnerable citizens? 
These are all valid questions.  
We must, however, take account of the change in the landscape. 
I encourage the hon. member to put forth her recommendations under that exhaustive review. 
I will work with her on that committee.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
I cannot use the words because they are unparliamentary. 
Empathy is feeling with.  
Recently I went to Saskatchewan to visit my parents. 
That person was Eugene Martens.  
It was not because of drunken driving. 
It was an accident.  
I cannot understand how that can be. 
All one has to do is try to put oneself into the same situation.  
We are dealing with the question of changing the rules for sentencing. 
It is unconscionable that we allow that to happen.  
It should at least mean 25 years.  
(The House adjourned at 1.55 p.m.)
