Wednesday, March 3, 1999 
The House met at 2 p.m. 
Members sang the national anthem ] 
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
Kristin is not your average teen. 
At just 15 she is an inspiration to us all. 
That is one very good reason to be optimistic about our future.  
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
This government must work together with provinces and landowners. 
It is protected when all members of society work together. 
INTERNATIONAL WOMEN'S DAY 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
THE LATE JACK WEBSTER 
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, British Columbia broadcasting legend Jack Webster passed away. 
Jack Webster was born in Glasgow, Scotland in 1918 and immigrated to Canada in 1947. 
He spent his life in reporting and broadcast journalism. 
There is now a journalism award in his honour. 
Canada will miss him. 
His irascible voice of courage defined him as a great Canadian.  
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
The hon. member for Jonquiere. 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
My congratulations to the organizers, and wishes for continuing success for many years to come.  
Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):
Farmers in my riding of Brome-Missisquoi are very pleased about this news. 
The Quebec Minister of Agriculture has joined the national program. 
BRITISH COLUMBIA FRUIT GROWERS 
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
Growers, who have nothing to lose, will cut down their apple trees.  
SUCH A LONG JOURNEY 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Eglinton-Lawrence, Lib.):
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
How are visible minorities reflected in the number of judges appointed by this federal government? 
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
I support pay equity. 
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
They voted against increasing funding for the prenatal nutrition program. 
They wanted to dismantle CPP and employment- 
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have known the secretary of state for a long time. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
It is not only speeches. 
It is action that this government has provided.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, if only it were so easy as to try to explain this. 
Maybe he did give the government's position yesterday.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
This was never my intention. 
This is not what I meant and this has never been my belief.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, that is great. 
He cannot just explain it away.  
I ask the member to go to her question.  
Yes, I surely will, Mr. Speaker. 
Who is going to admit it?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have a progressive tax system in Canada. 
We have introduced legislation to help the family. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, first we must look at what this government has done.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Will he return to a deficit situation? 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Deficit and recession were mentioned. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
This is how we need to do advance calculations. 
This is the proof of a dynamic economy.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
What is the scheme? 
Government raids the surplus and then raises contributions. 
Why should these workers have to pay twice for these pensions?  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the surplus in the employment insurance fund has disappeared. 
One-third of the federal employees' pension fund has been spent. 
The surplus in the Canada pension plan is going up. 
From whom will the government take money next, after the workers?  
Is the government now going to tell retirees that it's ``Goodbye, Charlie Brown''?  
All the risks are assumed by the government, and hence by the taxpayers. 
The surplus therefore belongs to the taxpayers.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I would ask all hon. members to be very judicious in their choice of words.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, if my word was unparliamentary, I apologize. 
It is very hard to figure out what to say about them.  
In essence we have a progressive tax system. 
That is what the government has worked on. 
That is why we brought in the child tax credit. 
That is why we brought in the other measures.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
The senior minister is not blameless in this whole episode either. 
It actually got worse in the last budget.  
What is the minister's excuse? 
He cannot blame this simply on a slip of the tongue.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
What is their agenda?  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
What is the matter with that? 
In budget after budget the government has chosen to discriminate against those families. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The Prime Minister gave a list. 
Why do they want to cut equalization payments?  
The hon. member for Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
But it does not mean it is the only solution.  
The hon. member for Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
It was not just a slip of the tongue. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We have had no answer. 
I have asked the hon. member whether they are against individual taxation. 
We have had no answer.  
We know that the Reform Party opposed it.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we are for progressive taxation. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I think the minister is a bit tired.  
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the finance minister is in full damage control mode. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the premise of the hon. member's question is simply wrong. 
For five years it has been against children. 
For five years it has talked only about the deficit.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, these are the facts. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Does he believe that somebody who is earning $25,000 a year- 
The hon. member for Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert.  
FEDERAL EMPLOYEES' PENSION FUND 
Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
These pensions are guaranteed by the government.  
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We want to help.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
I will permit the hon. House leader to answer the question.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
I think we are going down a path here that is getting a little slippery. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Yet it is demanding $3 million more. 
That type of ransom is out of line.  
I judge the question to be out of order. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
They never take a very long view of things, like earlier today. 
Now they have changed their minds. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the finance minister. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That is why as a government we brought in the child tax benefit. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
The safety of our pilots is of utmost importance to us.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Mr. Speaker, this does not have anything to do with the crash itself. 
It is the family.  
I think we owe his family.  
Let us do it right for a change. 
Please, yes or no?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Will the minister consider proceeding now to ratification of the convention?  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
There are people who are dying. 
MR. JUSTICE ROBERT FLAHIFF 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
The complaint is still before it. 
The case of the judge is in appeal.  
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
His response ought to be simple.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is a bit late. 
I myself have also responded.  
DECORUM IN THE CHAMBER 
Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert, BQ):
The member has raised two points. 
The hon. member is not here, at least I do not see him. 
We could ask the member if he used the word ``dishonest''. 
I did not hear it myself.  
He is here, Mr. Speaker. 
Now, If the hon. minister wishes to add something, he has the floor.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
May I say that the hon. minister withdraws the word?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
Yes, Mr. Speaker, I withdraw the word dishonest.  
If this committee were to be struck again, I would be very pleased.  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
FIRST NATIONS OMBUDSMAN ACT 
Leona Freed and Rita Galloway were in town yesterday. 
They were talking to us about the problems they are facing on the reserves. 
They have asked for an ombudsman. 
This bill will do that. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
I am very proud to present this petition at this time.  
Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):
It calls upon parliament to undertake measures aimed at the abolition of the Senate.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
They want to modernize parliamentary institutions. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
It is my pleasure to support them.  
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia, Lib.):
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, a perfect sequel. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
I ask, Mr. Speaker, that all questions be allowed to stand.  
FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF MINISTER OF FINANCE 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
It is also a statement of what the government is to spend our money on.  
Here we are today with no deficit. 
In fact we have a healthy and growing surplus. 
Why do these continue?  
The government is taking $2,000 more from each taxpayer's pocket. 
That is a lot of money to most Canadians.  
There has not been a tax cut at all. 
There is less of an increase than there might have been. 
That is how much $1 billion is. 
They slashed over $33 billion in this 10 year period. 
Guess what it is now under the Liberal government. 
The child tax benefit system is a program which the official opposition supports. 
It represents the best of co-operation between federal and provincial agreements. 
It is targeted to those families that have modest incomes from work. 
Regrettably it is not as generous as it first appears. 
Too many announcements; too little action. 
This is simply not the case.  
For that reason I will vote against this budget. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
There were no increases in tax rates. 
We introduced the RESP, government grants worth up to $400 a year for parents. 
I therefore do not accept bracket creep as the explanation. 
I want to know the real explanation from the member.  
It is taking in more revenue next year than this year. 
Its own budget figures say that. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
A motion was put and there was a debate. 
What is truly the position of the Reform Party on health care?  
First I will discuss 1993. This is verifiable. 
The member can look at our campaign literature. 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
It is about brainwashing, not budgeting.  
There is no doubt that we had to eliminate the deficit. 
Before the 1995 budget a wave of protest ran across this country. 
The finance minister appeared to hear these concerns. 
However, appearances can be deceiving. 
The government claims its hands were tied on real tax relief. 
It claims it had to make tough decisions so it could balance the budget. 
The credit goes entirely to Canadians- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
If that is the case, I would ask that the member withdraw that remark.  
Perhaps the hon. member can clarify the position. 
I know he would not want to suggest such a thing.  
What does this budget offer them? 
It comes as no surprise that Canadian families are not grateful. 
Does this budget put an end to this inequity? 
This budget reminds me of George Orwell's 1984 . 
There was a second announcement the next day. 
Canadian society is not so easily fooled. 
I guarantee Canadians will not have to wait that long. 
No, Canadians need only have to wait a year or two. 
Soon Canadians will take matters into their own hands in the next election. 
They will toss out big brother and his big taxes. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
It goes down and down. 
There will be more and more deductions. 
They will see there is no real tax relief. 
Those are the facts. 
They are not there. 
It is a shell game. 
It is empty government rhetoric. 
The numbers will not add up on the paycheque stubs. 
I challenge the member to that.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
That is what they voted for. 
Where does his party stand on user fees? 
It has led to a two tier health care system. 
That is what we have from NDP governance.  
I do not think it adds up.  
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time. 
It invests in community, the community of Canada.  
It is the Canadian way, it is the Liberal way. 
This budget does not abandon sound fiscal principles. 
We will balance the books through to the year 2001. 
We have not returned to the old ways of the old days. 
It is impossible to cover everything contained in the budget in this 10 minute speech. 
Our economy is in excellent shape. 
Our unemployment rates are at all time lows. 
Interest rates are down. 
The deficit has been paid off. 
This budget does just that.  
Of course we must pay down our debt. 
We will not borrow to buy the groceries. 
This government will not put all our resources into debt reduction alone. 
This scenario does not strike a balance. 
They said it should be a priority. 
As a matter of fact, we will eliminate the debt. 
But it will be by continually acting in a prudent fashion. 
The tax policy of the federal government is based on three fundamental principles. 
I would like to take a moment to outline these. 
The first is that our tax system must be fair. 
This is good news. 
We have removed 600,000 Canadians from the tax rolls. 
The second theme to be addressed is framework. 
Canadians are tired of different levels of government pointing fingers at each other. 
There are fundamental issues of health care delivery that must be addressed. 
Our investments in research will help develop these important research measures.  
We have invested according to the priorities of Canadians.  
This represents the largest single new investment the government has ever made. 
For my province of Ontario this is good news. 
I would like to address my third theme, framework. 
This is the lowest level since 1950. 
It is about fairness. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's question. 
This federal budget is very good news for the people of Ontario. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I have enjoyed working on the finance committee with the hon. member.  
I took note of one thing she said with respect to debt. 
The amount of money that would be available for programs would be immense.  
She said she was sure the debt would be repaid.  
I did a quick calculation. 
Madam Speaker, there are two halves to the equation. 
I do not see this government having a single focus on merely paying down debt. 
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia, Lib.):
I am pleased to make a couple of observations during the budget debate.  
First of all, they are very happy with our health care initiative. 
What about where I come from?  
It is also one of my passions. 
That is what Manitobans are saying.  
She said: ``This budget is a victory for nurses''. 
This budget is a victory for nurses.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
Did you talk to the nurses on the ward?  
Hospital and home care services in Manitoba have deteriorated too far''. 
Dr. George Kelly, president of the Manitoba Medical Association.  
I notice that the New Democratic member for Winnipeg North Centre has suddenly fallen silent. 
I hear nothing but silence from that side. 
The testimony hurts does it not?  
Most people in my province of Manitoba are very pleased. 
It is up to the provincial government to spend that money wisely. 
Again we had some good news regarding taxes. 
Relief last year, more relief this year. 
By the way, he is a constituent. 
How do you like those apples? 
These are not bad comments from opponents.  
Perhaps I will quote one more individual. 
This is certainly not from a normal Liberal flag waver. 
The fellow's name is Victor Vrsnik of the Manitoba taxpayers association. 
They are usually very critical of anything that Ottawa does. 
I think that is pretty good testimony. 
But we are not going to stop at that. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
I noted that the hon. member spoke about health care and he spoke about taxes. 
The government seems to take a great deal of comfort in throwing out that statement. 
I think we do have an arrangement. 
It is called twinning. 
I am not going to watch him very closely. 
That is what twinning is all about. 
It has nothing to do with shadowing.  
No. There is always work to be done.  
Keep on raising those questions. 
In fact we are into the pre-budget consultations for 2000 right now. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
If we look at what the budget is, it is an annual budget. 
Which is the right answer?  
Madam Speaker, the way I read the budget, it is pretty simple. 
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
It is time to set things straight.  
I will elaborate on these two points.  
First, let us talk about the unemployed. 
These three issues are important to regions such as ours. 
I see that some Liberal members are listening carefully. 
Why is it so important? 
This means that 300 jobs will be lost. 
The Liberals did not say much about that. 
I would like him to respond to this.  
The public will not be fooled.  
That brings me to the following point. 
The sectors I have just mentioned come under provincial jurisdiction. 
But what about the fishery and the catch, which really do come under federal jurisdiction? 
What about the people approaching retirement age? 
What kind of hope could this budget deliver to the fishing worker? 
We are trying to stay calm, but this is becoming increasingly hard to do. 
In mid-January I was present at four or five different demonstrations. 
This is what they want the government to know. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
These people still exist. 
These people are still there. 
They are human beings.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Our collective wealth is not really improved.  
That is the drama. 
That is the real tragedy.  
Madam Speaker, the member for Portneuf is absolutely right. 
The government's behaviour makes no sense.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
I will merely point out a few items that strike me as important.  
Fortunately, he did not scrap it.  
This is certainly high on his wish list. 
Let us look at the situation a bit more closely. 
Such a fine thing. 
People everywhere forget that there are two official languages. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We are talking about an organization for parliamentarians. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
This is not a point of order.  
Madam Speaker, I am very glad to hear this event will be held. 
Naturally, I am aware that people decided to come back.  
That should be common knowledge by now. 
While this government is tooting its own horn, francophone communities are in decline. 
This is not the Bloc Quebecois saying this, but Mr. Lachapelle.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
The children are poor because their parents are poor. 
Basically, the government has surpluses. 
Why was that not allocated to poor children? 
How can children learn anything on an empty stomach?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I listened to the remarks by the member for Rimouski-Mitis. 
The member for Rimouski-Mitis talks about breakfasts for children. 
I must also point out that this is provincial and not federal jurisdiction.  
What does she consider wastage in all that?  
A little more than he usually does.  
It needed the money and there was a fund. 
We do not even know why, we are unable to find out.  
That is his ministerial responsibility. 
Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Fanshawe, Lib.):
This is the kind of finance minister that I am very proud to serve with. 
What has been the reaction to the budget? 
That is an interesting reaction. 
I have heard them calling for more tax cuts. 
Low income families in my riding know that is nonsense. 
How about Mike Harris, the Premier of Ontario? 
He is now going around talking about ``The Harris-Martin tax cuts''. 
It is interesting to see the reaction of these two premiers.  
The reaction to the budget is fascinating. 
How about my constituents in London, Ontario? 
Those ideas are directly reported back to the Minister of Finance. 
The reaction in London, Ontario, to the budget is quite positive.  
I will take that report card any day.  
Mr. Pat O'Brien:
I know they may not like these truths. 
To my knowledge, Mr. Smith is not a Liberal member of parliament. 
He is a highly respected international figure in the medical community.  
Why is there such a positive response? 
We recently met with a wide cross-section of labour leaders in London, Ontario. 
They had a concern about unemployment, as I do. 
Youth unemployment is decreasing. 
They are low and middle income Canadians. 
It is very interesting to hear the champions of these issues. 
Let them come to London-Fanshawe. 
I welcome them to come to London, Ontario. 
I welcome them to a debate any time. 
In conclusion, I say that we have had an excellent budget from an excellent minister. 
It has been very well received in London, Ontario. 
It has been very well received in my riding of London-Fanshawe. 
Yes, there are suggestions for future budgets. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
The federal government has decided not to shirk responsibility in the province of Ontario. 
If it was okay in Ontario, why was it not okay somewhere else?  
Mr. Pat O'Brien:
Madam Speaker, I would be happy to answer the member's questions. 
It is fascinating to hear an NDP member talk about ``trust broken''. 
Mr. Pat O'Brien:
I guess she cannot resist the heckling. 
It is fascinating to hear.  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The CAW has come out very vocally that there is no rift- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
That is not a point of order.  
Mr. Pat O'Brien:
Maybe that would please her, I do not know.  
She speaks about the problem with EI. 
Let me address that. 
We on this side share them as well. 
They know we have those concerns. 
They know we are fighting for them on those issues. 
We have no lessons to learn from the NDP on that score.  
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
How can these things be reconciled?  
Mr. Pat O'Brien:
Madam Speaker, it is really quite simple for the member. 
We are not the Reform Party. 
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
This party, unlike others in this chamber, learned the lessons of history. 
We have put Canada's fiscal house in order. 
We delivered on our promise. 
The facts speak for themselves. 
So true, so true.  
Yes, budget '99 focuses on health. 
This is recognized by people who are close to the issue. 
The mayor of Ottawa, Jim Watson, was even more optimistic. 
This is something that Canadians have not enjoyed since 1965. 
The government understands the tax burden on lower income Canadians. 
That is why we have removed 200,000 taxpayers from the tax roll this year. 
That is good news again for every Canadian.  
To say that they are enjoying explosive growth is almost an understatement.  
Once again this budget is good for Canada. 
This is responsible budget making, future oriented budget making and affordable budget making.  
This is the leadership that has made Canada a leader among nations.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
These people had not changed their minds. 
There is absolutely no doubt in my mind about that.  
I am in touch with people in the medical community on a fairly regular basis. 
This is something that obviously has to be corrected.  
It will have great benefits for the future.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
I am sure we are all grateful for that.  
That is b as in billions, b as in big booboo.  
It is more like 50:50. 
By the year 2000 it will again be spending less than it did last year. 
That, in turn, is much less than it spent in 1993. 
It is time for Ottawa to put money back into agriculture. 
We in this party believe that Canadian farmers need sustainable incomes. 
There is new money for health care. 
However, in both cases we are just beginning to recover from years of devastating cuts. 
At best we are running to stand still.  
Those hurt most were those most at risk.  
The committee says that homelessness in Canada is an area of grave concern. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
The sum of those two equals the total entitlement of a province.  
The Golden report in Toronto identified that 17% of the homeless in Toronto were aboriginals. 
He is there virtually every morning. 
He said ``Not at all''.  
The taxpayer is feeling the burden enormously.  
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I just want to ask the member a quick question. 
He talked about the need for sustainable incomes in farming. 
The Americans would like to see it done away with. 
Not a bloody chance.  
I hope you are right, Mr. Minister, but we will wait and see.  
I know hon. members always want to address the Speaker when they speak.  
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
Now the figure is no more than one third. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
It just goes on and on.  
I would first like to talk about the hallowed budget surplus. 
The facts are the facts. 
My question, which I have asked time and time again, is:
Where is the money? 
This government has no right to that money. 
It belongs to employers and employees. 
That is the first fact.  
It does absolutely nothing.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am very confident the hon. member knows that.  
The government talks about job creation. 
What about the Volvo workers of Halifax who have lost their jobs? 
There was not a single mention from the Liberals about those workers. 
All they talk about is tax breaks and health care concerns. 
It is an absolute disgrace.  
They were Saskatchewan's gift to Canada. 
My hon. friend from Palliser is absolutely correct. 
An incredible amount of small business absolutely despises the budget. 
I love the heckling. 
I have got them going. 
The GST-HST was shoved down the throats of Atlantic Canadians. 
The government did not address that problem in the budget.  
It is absolute disgrace. 
They sound like a broken record.  
The government has completely ignored the future of our nation.  
Statistics Canada released information on family incomes today. 
This is dated March 3 at 4.40 this afternoon. 
Hardest hit are families with a single female parent. 
This information is from Statistics Canada. 
I took it off Internet about an hour and a half ago. 
Those people are seriously affected by what is not in the budget. 
It is a sin.  
What does our government do? 
It is an absolute disgrace.  
I am sorry, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the question. 
He knows very well that the provinces claw back some of that money. 
He knows darn well that is exactly what happens. 
He is shaking his head but those are the facts. 
That is exactly what it does.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am intrigued with the member's speech. 
We share one thing. 
The Liberals want us to believe that they are putting in $11.5 billion. 
I look at that as simply a very small amount. 
It is a $2 billion increase per year. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his statement. 
One of my favourite pastimes is ripping into the Liberal government. 
The member is absolutely correct. 
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Today I will use my time to speak briefly to three themes in the budget. 
Budget '99 is not an end in itself. 
I was pleased to share that with my constituents. 
This is what all of us in the House want our government to do.  
The state of Canada's fiscal house was in poor shape. 
My constituents were concerned. 
As we head into that next century the fiscal outlook of Canada is positive.  
In budget '99 the federal government will again balance our books. 
Again, this pleased my constituents. 
We know that the prosperity of any nation depends on the health of its citizens. 
This health budget is welcome news for the people of Etobicoke-Lakeshore. 
Ontario will also be receiving other moneys. 
Budget '99 takes action on many fronts. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have a comment.  
It is finally putting something back in. 
Of course we are going to be happy.  
It is as if there has been a war going on. 
This is a war. 
We are going to make darn sure we keep fighting for what is right.  
Mr. Speaker, I think I will comment on the comment.  
Budget '99 has indeed moved the agenda forward.  
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for Etobicoke-Lakeshore.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
The first one has to do with personal income taxes. 
The federal 3% surtax has been totally eliminated for all Canadians. 
It is a savings in taxes to Canadians.  
It is not the number the members are saying.  
In addition there are non-taxable benefits that Canadians have received. 
These are very important.  
The employment insurance premiums were reduced. 
I am very proud of the government's budget. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to ask the member whether he would answer one question. 
There is one minute for that. 
Could I do that?  
The answer is no, the time is up.  
Is the House ready for the question?  
The question is on the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
How many jobs were created? 
What long term projects were crafted and developed?  
Will the military keep the shoreline property? 
How many jobs will be lost? 
That is what the minister said in the House.  
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
The transfer of the surplus property has begun.  
Information on the transaction will, however, be released when an agreement has been signed.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
He wanted to know why he had to be discharged that first day. 
In fact, he abdicated full responsibility for those critical situations. 
That was before the budget. 
That was on February 8. 
It would seem to me that the answer to all these questions is essentially no.  
Every day now we see the results of those health care cutbacks. 
Emergency room line-ups still exist today. 
We see delayed surgical procedures and we see growing privatization of medical services. 
Will the health budget undo the damage? 
It does not appear so. 
That says it all.  
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
What is needed is more than money. 
What is needed is a more accountable, more integrated way of delivering services. 
Each province has done it differently and that is appropriate.  
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.59 p.m.)
