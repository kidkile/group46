Use of Children as Protagonists in War in Uganda-Government Position 
Hon. Norman K. Atkins :
My question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I thank the honourable senator for his question. 
The events in Uganda are obviously shocking. 
The situation is reprehensible. 
The Minister of Foreign Affairs is now more aware of the situation. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, this is an interesting and complicated question.  
Honourable senators, I have a supplementary question:
However, in the case of veterans, the income exclusions are set through regulation.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Future Use of Shearwater Base as Free Trade Zone-Government Position 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Results of Yesterday's Provincial Election-Government Position 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it the wish of the Senate that I ask for silence now? 
Are you asking for a recount?  
I believe it is a result that mirrors the concerns of voters. 
You will notice the restraint being practised on this side of the chamber.  
What considerations led the government to this policy decision?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
It is certainly a valid question. 
I shall attempt to bring forward an answer to her question.  
How can the government justify this restriction in the millennium scholarships?  
On what basis might it participate in this project?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Goods and Services Tax 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, my question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Pages Exchange Program with House of Commons 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Yesterday I introduced the first page.  
We wish you welcome to the Senate.  
Business of the Senate 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I believe all of you have received invitations. 
I hope to see you at 5:30 in the lobby.  
Tobacco Industry Responsibility Bill 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Do any other honourable senators wish to speak to the point of order? 
If no one wishes to speak, then perhaps I can speak now. 
As honourable senators know, the question is still before the Senate. 
However, I can only do that with agreement of the Senate. 
Is that agreeable, honourable senators?  
Small Business Loans Act 
Bill to Amend-Second Reading 
After serious reflection, I have decided to vote in favour of this bill. 
Honourable senators, small business plays a vital role in the Canadian economy. 
In 1995-96, for example, over 30,000 businesses turned to the program. 
The program would then wind up in a disorderly manner. 
Like many other insurance programs, it pools risks across thousands of users. 
I want to go back to the Auditor General's report. 
There are three points that should be repeated here.  
If the program needs to be changed, we make the changes during detailed examination. 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
I do not chair the committee examining these questions. 
We are just back from consultations on the new agency managing pension funds.  
Hon. Duncan J. Jessiman :
However, I will speak to that later.  
This legislation was introduced in 1961 by the Diefenbaker government. 
The loans from 1961 through 1980 were modest. 
The historical experience has been exceptional. 
The exceptions are for farms and for organizations of a charitable or religious nature. 
There are two areas of concern in relation to this program. 
That is a large figure. 
However, the maximum amount of a loan still remained at $250,000.  
That is an important figure, because it hits right at the borrower. 
Therefore, $4,400 million creates 30,800 jobs. 
There is no question that there are other things the government could do. 
That would be an incentive to small business.  
We have received this bill today; it will go to committee tomorrow. 
In a mere six days, on March 31, this lending expires. 
That is just not good enough.  
There is a study ongoing. 
The Auditor General has suggested that we should look at many things. 
This is an important bill. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
The Estimates, 1997-98 
Report of National Finance Committee on Supplementary Estimates (B) Adopted 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the report?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Appropriation Bill No. 3, 1997-98 
The government has shown sound fiscal management and clearly deserves credit for it. 
I thank him on behalf of all senators here.  
The government must first obtain Parliament's approval for such transfers. 
The government is requesting approval to transfer $328 million in this way.  
The operating budget includes salaries, operating expenses and minor capital expenditures.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
When shall this bill be read the third time?  
That may be overstating the case. 
The last point is critical. 
We must not make the same mistake in the Yukon. 
Whether that formula is just, only time will tell. 
I have one other point to raise on this bill. 
Many Canadians would agree with that. 
This raises two points which are questions, really:
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Tobacco Industry Responsibility Bill 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
"Bill" means a draft Act of Parliament and includes a private and a public bill; 
That clearly would be a matter for a private bill. 
Private bills are not uncommon in this chamber. 
To that extent, all private legislation has some public purpose. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Do any other honourable senators wish to participate?  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, I find the subject-matter interesting, but I find the procedure unusual. 
If senators will allow me, I would be happy to adjourn this debate. 
As this situation is unusual, perhaps we can be doubly unusual.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I do not think I can accept an adjournment, Honourable Senator Cools. 
The matter is standing in my name for a ruling. 
However, the Senate agreed today to hear further representations. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I draw your attention to some distinguished visitors in the gallery. 
On behalf of all honourable senators, I wish you welcome to the Senate.  
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2:00 p.m.
