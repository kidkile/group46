Members sang the national anthem ] 
COMPLEX REGIONAL PAIN SYNDROME 
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
RSD or complex regional pain syndrome is a puzzling disorder. 
It can occur after an injury, even a minor one. 
The injury appears to be healing but the pain intensifies. 
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
THE LATE BILL STEWART 
Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam, Lib.):
Bill Stewart died suddenly in hospital on Sunday, May 16. 
He is survived by his wife, Alma, a son and a daughter. 
Bill Stewart served the public well. 
He will be missed.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Fredericton, Lib.):
To Jim, Jeff, teachers and students I say congratulations in 1999. 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
LIBERAL PARTY OF CANADA 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Here are the top 10 phrases overheard at their meetings last week.  
Remember the national energy program''.  
Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
We do not have to concern ourselves with the families that pay the highest taxes. 
Affordable housing and adequacy of income are basic determinants- 
The hon. member for Terrebonne-Blainville.  
Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne-Blainville, BQ):
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
We was tried, convicted and sentenced. 
SUMMIT OF THE AMERICAS 
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
What does all this talk and no action mean for Canadians? 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Farmers are especially hit hard by the flooding. 
June 15 is the crop insurance deadline. 
The livelihood of farmers and other businesses in the area is at stake. 
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):
There is no cure or effective treatment. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
This is going to mean millions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies.  
Just like Bubbles Galore , this is going to cost taxpayers dollars galore. 
Just how many dollars would that be?  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
The minister lost and Canadians lost, and we all know it. 
Taxpayers now get to buy magazines whether they like them or not.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
The fact is that Canada won today. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I bet those Americans are just trembling in their boots today. 
Oh yes, they must be.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, better a dog than a pig.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is a real class act over there. 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, Canadians will protect Canadian culture. 
They do not need this incompetent minister to do it, frankly. 
How many strikes does it take before this minister is out of there?  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
The agreement provides compensation for Canadian publishers.  
Can the minister tell the House how much this agreement will cost?  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
That is what we are working on now. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
I think this would show some accountability.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
That in itself is a step forward.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, let me now turn to the Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The Minister of Canadian Heritage was successful in protecting Canadian culture.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
We must not back down to threats by the Americans''.  
Why did the government back down?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have a better deal than we ever expected to have. 
The minister did a great job. 
This is a very good deal and I am very proud of it.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
We must not back down to threats by the Americans''. 
The minister has backed down. 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we did not back down. 
We have an agreement. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the Minister of Canadian Heritage has failed. 
In light of these failures, is the Prime Minister prepared to demand her resignation?  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
There was not a single law in place to protect Canada. 
It is a win for the government. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is factually incorrect. 
I was a director of the Canada Development Corporation. 
Each of the companies had their own independent boards of directors.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the question remains:
That is the first question.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The Minister of Finance has said that he does not recall anything. 
He has explained the file. 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to respond.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
My question is very simple. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we know that the government does not have a plan. 
It is continually following on the tails of the Americans.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
He called our people first teamers. 
Do members know why are they first teamers? 
They are amongst his first teams.  
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
FRASER RIVER PORT AUTHORITY 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
The question is out of order. 
If the hon. minister wants to answer he may.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
We will use virtual elimination to get rid of the most toxic substances.  
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Natural Resources.  
Mr. Speaker, Canada has the best forestry practices in all the world. 
We owe apologies to no one.  
Where we can do better we will. 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, thanks for that infomercial.  
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, in this country we follow the rule of law. 
We also respect our international obligations according to the Geneva convention. 
This is exactly what we are doing in this case.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
We have all these tools. 
Now it is asking us to act. 
It is clear that we will act.  
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
The hon. Minister of Canadian Heritage.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I trust that question was not directed to the hard on crime minister.  
The hon. member for Dartmouth.  
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
Thank you for that answer. 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
That was an unprecedented pill for the Americans to swallow. 
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I can understand that the Progressive Conservative members are a bit embarrassed.  
Now they are here to support it.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Otherwise, she should kiss her cabinet colleagues goodbye.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
The hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine.  
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Twice the minister told us that only one job was transferred. 
Is that not a lot of returns for only one person?  
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is incredible that members of the Reform Party bring this issue up. 
Why is it only in Shawinigan?  
Obviously they are not interested in efficiency. 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Hundreds of fishers and plant workers are affected. 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
The fishery did open in late April.  
The fishery certainly appears to be down. 
There are fluctuations in fisheries which occur for natural reasons. 
We will be following this closely as we go along. 
We obviously are concerned about it, as is the hon. member. 
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
I understand that he was recently in Pakistan where he met with his counterpart. 
Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are very concerned about religious persecution in Pakistan. 
We expressed our serious concern and asked them to look into the matter.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the heritage minister.  
Why did she not protect Canadian filmmakers' rights to freedom of expression?  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, again the Reform Party has to make up its mind. 
I do not think politicians should be deciding what is art.  
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
As I have made perfectly clear, we intend to act soon. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
My question is for the fisheries minister. 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, in response to the first question, absolutely. 
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
The questions mount, but the Prime Minister's non-answers persist. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is nothing shady about this transaction.  
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, obviously the member does not listen very well.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
I know the Chair will agree that any- 
It is out of order to ask the Speaker any questions. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
The business of the House is to consider how public money is spent. 
By what criteria did you shut me down?  
I refer the hon. member to citation 410, subsection (17).  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
I would refer him to the rule. 
I consider the matter closed.  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE 
Ms. Colleen Beaumier (Brampton West-Mississauga, Lib.):
JUSTICE AND HUMAN RIGHTS 
Mr. John Maloney (Erie-Lincoln, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would ask the indulgence of the House. 
Since that time over 18,000 conditional sentences have been handed down. 
Most of these sentences are for petty crimes. 
My bill does exactly that. 
It lists the offences to be excluded from any possibility of receiving a conditional sentence. 
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions to present. 
The first bears 26 signatures.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
The second petition, Mr. Speaker, bears 750 signatures. 
It deals with suicide or euthanasia.  
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
The Inuit find the housing conditions in Nunavik extremely distressing. 
They consider the situation totally intolerable. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I wish to present another petition from petitioners from British Columbia.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I wish to present a petition concerning trade. 
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
They would like to see it stopped. 
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Question No. 121- Mr. Mike Scott: 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Nothern Development, Lib.):
Question No. 123- Mr. Mike Scott: 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Question No. 189- Mr. John Cummins: 
This allocation can also be taken as spawn-on-kelp. 
The estimated equivalent weight for spawn-on-kelp is approximately 200,000 pounds of product. 
The total registered population for the Heiltsuk First Nation is 2,014. 
There is, however, ongoing enforcement in all fisheries.  
Mr. Speaker, I would ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
I think that is unreasonable.  
I would like to see those answers.  
However, I assure the member that I am looking after his remaining questions.  
Shall the remaining questions stand?  
I therefore request that the hon. member withdraw his motion.  
I see that the hon. member for Skeena is not here. 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
When shall the bill be read a third time? 
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
The idea is to increase competition in our banking sector. 
The proposed system is the result of extensive consultations. 
These three groups supported the bill.  
We tabled this bill on February 11 in the House. 
There are five I want to talk about.  
These deposits of $150,000 and more are not insured. 
We had a de-minimus provision of 1% in place. 
The second amendment related to the funding options for lending branches. 
That is the period allowed for Canadian branches of foreign insurers.  
The fourth amendment related to taxes. 
The fifth change was also a tax change. 
Why did we grant this? 
We have changed that. 
These will have to wait for our response to the MacKay task force. 
We will be getting more competition here. 
I urge the House to move quickly to pass this important legislation.  
I also want to thank the Canadian banks. 
We look forward to its early passage.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Let us look into the current banking environment in Canada. 
The presence of foreign banks in Canada has been steadily declining. 
Foreign banks cannot currently operate branches directly in Canada. 
I would like to briefly explain why we support Bill C-67. 
The Liberals' introduction of Bill C-67 is two years overdue. 
The government has been sitting on its hands for two years.  
That is pretty good.  
The opportunity is also lost.  
This increased investment will translate into more employment for Canadians.  
They did the same with changes to the equalization program. 
This is a government that lacks vision. 
I can count a number of instances like this. 
It just wants to study them. 
The government is using incremental policy when it comes to our financial sector. 
Our economy could grow. 
Jobs could have been created in the country. 
We have seen 52 motions for closure or time allocation in the House. 
The list continues to grow and it goes on and on. 
It should be ashamed.  
Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I am particularly pleased to speak today. 
I gladly accepted to do so. 
This bill will allow the establishment of foreign banks.  
Is he really aware of the impact of this review? 
However, there have been a number of changes in smaller institutions.  
One has to wonder what the future will hold. 
The decisions we will be making will greatly influence events for decades to come.  
Let us examine the banking system used elsewhere in the world. 
In short, they have a relatively regulated system with a number of players.  
Was the president of the Mouvement Desjardins, Claude Beland, consulted? 
Let us now take a look at the main amendments found in Bill C-67. 
The same is true of the bill before us today.  
The government is acting irresponsibly. 
This situation is unfair to Quebec insurers.  
All players should be able to start at the same time.  
Enhancing competition is one of the concerns of the Bloc Quebecois.  
Our third concern is that these changes be made equitably. 
The Bloc Quebecois also advocated greater democratization of the banks. 
We share the concerns of Yves Michaud in this regard.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
I will provide a little background on Bill C-67. 
He never said it was permanently off the table.  
They will not even have any bricks or mortar here. 
That is one of the elements of Bill C-67. 
In the end that pressure will filter down to Canadians.  
I found that to be absolutely unacceptable. 
It would allow businesses to develop and grow in these small communities.  
That would promote economic growth in the country that we would not believe. 
It is worth noting that in England the post office has banking services. 
Credit unions are a democratic alternative to the big banks. 
That is the big problem. 
These people are generally elderly people. 
A white paper is expected later this year. 
These are the kinds of policy measures that the NDP would like to see forthcoming.  
Unfortunately it does not go nearly far enough. 
It does not protect our institutions. 
In the end, all of us believe in competition. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Technological advancements are having an immense effect, particularly on the banking sector.  
For instance, let us look at one element, bank machines. 
They are in many grocery stores. 
That technological shift and advancement has improved banking services immeasurably for Canadians. 
Globalization has played a very important role. 
That is what we are talking about today. 
In the brokerage industry we have seen Merrill Lynch purchase Midland Walwyn. 
We have seen Charles Schwab, a discount brokerage, grow in Canada. 
These companies are real and these banks and this competition is real.  
This agreement will provide further access for foreign banks to the Canadian market.  
Both are actual banks. 
The Bank of Loganville has been there for 150 years.  
It was very difficult for a small business person to get the money. 
Wisely the government changed this. 
Domestic banks in Canada are subject to federal regulations. 
That is a complication we would like to see addressed.  
The MacKay report made 131 recommendations. 
These were very positive commitments the banks were willing to make.  
We had an opportunity to negotiate with the banks. 
We had some leverage. 
Canadians really need a government that is focused on the challenges of the next century.  
What has been the impact? 
We have had a few months to see the short term impact. 
Its capital is more expensive. 
It is very important that the government become much more careful in developing public policy.  
The government has a role to lead and to develop public policy. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the question from my colleague from Sackville-Eastern Shore. 
In answer to his question, absolutely yes.  
This is not just my opinion. 
It then went on to list those initiatives.  
Deficit reduction began back in 1984. 
Tax reform has considerable political risk and the GST was an example of that. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
I would like to have an answer to that.  
I do not believe he would.  
That is $12 billion of underground activity.  
Where the member and I live we are compounded with the HST. 
It is a burden on Canadians and results in an underground economy. 
I would like the member to respond to this.  
They opposed the GST when it was introduced and they continue to oppose it. 
At one point they opposed free trade and they continue to oppose it. 
I would argue that it is not the consumption taxes in a global environment. 
Productivity levels are very closely related to investment. 
It is not the GST.  
I pay my GST.  
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
That was hard to take.  
That is the record no matter what the member says. 
We are here to talk about Bill C-67. 
My party supports Bill C-67. 
We think it is a good bill. 
It will certainly add to the financial landscape of the country. 
I say once again that we support the bill. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, certainly we support the bill. 
Mr. Richard M. Harris:
The finance minister would not be well served to make a trade off deal. 
It is important to Canada's economy that we have very strong world banks.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
There would eventually be virtual banking. 
Mr. Richard M. Harris:
Therefore our position was stated in my report. 
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Out of 10 former prime ministers, Mr. Mulroney ranks second.  
Interest rates were at their lowest levels in 20 years. 
The growth rate was higher than the International Monetary Fund had predicted.  
Mr. Richard M. Harris:
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
However, there is no mention of such reciprocity. 
That is putting the cart before the horse. 
The financial sector has to be strengthened. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Division on this motion stands deferred until tomorrow following Government Orders.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I shall now propose Motions Nos. 1 to 3 to the House.  
Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering-Ajax-Uxbridge, Lib.) moved: 
(i) the supplier's own cost of marketing at retail, and 
We are obviously entering new territory as it relates to private members' bills.  
The process that got us here was a very interesting one. 
I am pleased the House has seen fit to passing the bill at second reading. 
Mr. Speaker, you are correct. 
It is a tough but very complex issue. 
I am not talking through my hat. 
I encourage members to read it. 
He suggests that the Clayton Act should be more appropriate.  
It applies to every commercial line in the country.  
This issue is not something that is confined strictly to one area of our economy. 
Legislation exists in other countries. 
The Americans and British have effective legislation to combat this particular problem. 
I believe my country includes businesses that will compete on a level playing field. 
That is exactly what this bill is for. 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
I applaud the efforts of the hon. member for Pickering-Ajax-Uxbridge. 
He is a passionate and tireless champion for what he believes is right. 
That takes both integrity and courage.  
The impact of this legislation therefore would extend the intended scope. 
Predatory pricing, below cost selling, is an attempt to drive competitors out of business. 
It is an extremely rare and unsustainable practice.  
This is an unwise business approach with no long term viability. 
Consequently it is rarely practised.  
Small businesses have always struggled to survive against large businesses. 
The Competition Act instead must serve consumers.  
The key to competition is free trade. 
We must work to create contestable markets. 
Competition and free trade are interconnected. 
The Reform Party is committed to small business. 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
We know that he fought a hard fight.  
That is the problem what is the solution? 
The outcome is still pending.  
There are other questions as well, however. 
We should look at this aspect.  
A product may come from the United States and be sold here. 
One can think of several sectors.  
I am sure this is not what the hon. member had in mind. 
Another way must be found.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, that is great co-operation. 
That is just not going to benefit Canadians.  
People would get together and fill up their tanks. 
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I strongly support Bill C-235. 
That is completely false and misleading.  
This bill is not an attack on big business. 
Bill C-235 seeks to protect free, open and true competition. 
That Motion No. 2 be amended 
(a) by replacing paragraph 50.1(2)(a) with the following: 
(b) by deleting subsection 50.1(3).  
The question is on the amendment.  
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
To refer to somebody by some other name, he knows, is contrary to the rules. 
Mr. Speaker, I am sorry about that. 
Both companies have their head offices in Markham.  
There may be a need for amendments to the Competition Act. 
At present Bill C-235 is premature. 
To me this demonstrates one of the clear differences between a Conservative and a Liberal. 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
The independents provide a useful alternative distribution channel for excess production. 
This steering committee has representations from all sides of the debate.  
Bill C-235 does not deal just with gasoline retailers. 
This may look like a reasonable proposition at first, but it has some odd ramifications. 
Here are some examples.  
We have heard from representatives of Canadian businesses across the country. 
We have heard voices on both sides of the question. 
The time provided for the consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Over time anything is possible but what is impossible is accepting this so-called response.  
The Liberal government's policy is tough luck, you lose.  
Fancy words but empty words. 
Jargon at a bargain.  
I await the response to this challenge. 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak to this question.  
The Canadian forces are an important national organization. 
Most of Canada's military housing was built in the 1950s. 
We started repairs to military married quarters in fiscal year 1996-97. 
We recognize that additional measures need to be taken with respect to housing. 
That is why we are developing a comprehensive policy this year.  
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.37 p.m.)
