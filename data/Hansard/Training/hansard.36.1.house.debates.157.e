EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 157 
Monday, November 23, 1998 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
That is becoming a common crime in our bigger cities. 
It is one that is starting to make everybody sit up and pay attention. 
Where is this going to stop?  
The government and the media like to claim that crime is decreasing. 
The police are just too busy.  
That is another part of the crime story. 
We need a victims bill of rights. 
We need, as my bill provides, tough penalties for the criminal misuse of firearms. 
But that is another matter not directly addressed today. 
The stats used to support its passage have since been shown to be grossly inaccurate. 
It gives cabinet excessive powers. 
It provides police with the excessive powers of search and seizure. 
When I was a child the only underground economy was mining. 
That sad fact has become the source of many jokes. 
They look at them as tools and an essential part of their everyday lives. 
It is a solemn obligation of elected members of government to nourish that tree.  
First it was presented in parliament under false pretences. 
That is not at question at all.  
Of course they find this very funny. 
Seventy-two per cent of rural Canadians approve of registration. 
There is strong support for the universal registration of firearms across Canada. 
We were elected on the second mandate because of that piece of legislation. 
On and on we have debated the issue in the House of Commons. 
It has gone to committee. 
Canadians have had a chance to bring forth their opinions. 
Opposition members may wish to consult the Criminal Code in this respect. 
The licensing of firearms users is one of the central features of this legislation. 
Registration is an important component of the act. 
People who sell guns should know to whom they are selling. 
Opponents of the legislation contend that criminals will not register guns. 
Illegal shipments will be easier to stop. 
Obviously the opposition finds this very funny. 
This is not a funny subject as far as we are concerned.  
It ignores the benefits of registration. 
It ignores the cherry picking that members opposite are suggesting in terms of the legislation. 
It is simply regressive legislation. 
Above all it is not responsive to Canadian people.  
We were re-elected on that point. 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
The importance of that right cannot be overemphasized. 
The protection of right of ownership is nothing new.  
Living in society requires limitations on the exercise of our rights. 
These limitations are justified when public interest is at stake. 
Combating crime is certainly a collective concern. 
That is not insignificant. 
That is the position in which I find myself.  
Repeal is not the same as improvement.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Before going directly to the bill I think we should pass out some warnings.  
On December 1 Bill C-68 will come into effect. 
We want to send a warning to all smugglers. 
Bill C-68 is coming in, so all smugglers beware. 
But wait a minute. 
And according to their statistics that was totally false. 
I imagine smugglers are having a good time laughing about that one. 
They said ``We watch from the bridge. 
They do not have any manpower. 
Two people were shot with shotguns in my riding. 
The people who did that are really going to be in trouble. 
They are going to face the Liberal law. 
I think that is mandatory. 
Yet we are getting tough with Bill C-68. 
That is Liberal justice. 
And they wonder why people laugh.  
It is almost 1999 and nothing has happened. 
Of course she is having a difficult time doing anything about it. 
After all, it is a wonderful old Liberal document. 
It was enacted in 1984. 
There are cries all across Canada. 
There is a member yapping off on the other side of the House. 
Since 1993 the Liberals have done absolutely nothing. 
But we have Bill C-68. 
That is the auditor general's figure. 
We have already spent several hundreds of millions of dollars.  
Let us look at another thing. 
That will make the victims feel much better. 
And the government wonders why people laugh at what it says. 
Liberal justice is a joke and people laugh at jokes.  
He died in the field from a heart attack. 
They picked the shotgun up and rightfully so. 
That is what those things bring in.  
That is the final result. 
That is the purpose of it.  
All the criminals must think this is funny. 
Sixty years of registration of handguns and we do not see much change. 
In fact it has gotten worse. 
It did not solve any problems. 
She had a great statement. 
People across this land are not happy at all with Canada's justice system. 
They want it changed. 
I have carefully gone through the present Criminal Code. 
All those things are covered. 
It spent over a billion dollars, according to the auditor general.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to take part in the debate today.  
The reality is that the legislation focuses on law-abiding citizens. 
How much does it cost in human life? 
That is simply not the case.  
There have been statistics from the Canadian Police Association. 
The Canadian Chiefs of Police have spoken in favour of it. 
It will become an overbureaucratic, time consuming exercise. 
One questions the priorities. 
They were grossly exaggerated 10 or 100 times. 
If that happens, why would we spend more money? 
It is interesting to note the absence of members of the NDP from this debate. 
One can always find statistics to support a position. 
That is not a difficult thing to do. 
The spin doctoring that has gone on is remarkable. 
The government has become very good at it. 
The benefits of Bill C-68 are very negligible. 
One only has to look again at the government's use of statistics. 
Is that not what it is all about? 
Bill C-68 does not measure up. 
It does not meet those requirements. 
Bill C-68 certainly does not deliver justice. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
The Alberta Court of Appeal ruled after September 21. 
The Reform opposition party members could not wait. 
Never mind uniting the right. 
The case is going to the Supreme Court of Canada. 
It will not be decided here. 
I was not in the House at that time. 
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
That is quite typical.  
Even that was sold as a guise to the Canadian public.  
While we are doing this I remind the government of its responsibility. 
It said that we had no funds. 
I have to ask where the government's priorities are.  
I have to wonder where the government's priorities are. 
CANADA SMALL BUSINESS FINANCING ACT 
BILL C-53-TIME ALLOCATION MOTION 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.) moved: 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
What the government never hears about are the disastrous effects of ill-conceived loans. 
This is not a rare occurrence. 
I would like to draw the attention of the House to a couple of instances. 
There were four eating establishments in a small town. 
I might add that one of them is now closed. 
There is a long list of names. 
Hundreds of thousands of dollars have been paid out.  
Did that happen once? 
What are we doing? 
I am not just talking about the banks which guarantee the loans. 
I wish the government would consider this motion which I will be supporting.  
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
These amendments will do two things. 
We are using taxpayer money as a poor investment. 
The taxpayers will receive zero dollars on their investment. 
We are throwing money at bad business plans.  
The federal government cannot be let off the hook. 
The mills are suffering incredibly.  
He tells me that their wood costs in 1994 were $43 a metre. 
Today their wood costs are $83 a metre. 
This has almost doubled. 
I am a big defender of small businesses. 
They are the economic backbone of this country. 
If we are to have successful businesses, let us not do it with government subsidies. 
We have the government saying here is $1.5 billion available for small businesses.  
Again, only the highest risk business plans are going to get access to this. 
We may never recover this money. 
I would argue very little we will recover.  
The EI premiums are billions of dollars higher than what they should be. 
The list goes on and on.  
Some of them are provincial but the list goes on and on. 
How can they possibly survive?  
What kind of taxes are these companies paying? 
Can they be competitive? 
Because of the economic climate in this country. 
Because of the taxes they pay.  
People pay double the taxes to our friends to the south. 
These are the things the government should be focusing on.  
It thinks things are just fine. 
The point I am trying to make is that government subsidies are not the answer. 
It has been proven time and time again.  
It has not looked at the root problems. 
It has not focused on anything.  
It accepted the status quo. 
That is not good enough. 
It is the same thing with the small business plan. 
That analogy can be drawn with small business people. 
We are not doing that. 
We have our heads buried in the sand. 
We are not looking at it. 
Now the government has forced time allocation. 
It will shut the debate off on this.  
Again I plead with the government to look at the real problem. 
Go up to Prince George and see what is happening. 
It will just be a high risk. 
Some will argue I am against the small business programs. 
I will stand up and fight for small businesses. 
But I would do it differently. 
I would ensure that they have a strong economic climate. 
I would ensure that they are not being taxed to death on payroll taxes. 
It can be done without government subsidies. 
It is our job to create the economic climate where they can survive.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
We believe that small and medium size businesses are an integral part of successful communities. 
I go there sometimes in the morning for breakfast. 
A lot of the local people come to that restaurant. 
They sit there and talk over the affairs of their community. 
They relate one on one with their neighbours. 
But it is also very noticeable that the owner of this business works very hard. 
In 1997-98 small firms with fewer than 49 employees created 56,516 new jobs. 
This is a testament of the endurance of these small businesses.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Full marks for that lady and full marks for the business. 
The small businesses that remain are hanging on by their fingernails. 
That type of interference with the marketplace is not good for society. 
I am not here to get into a long ideological harangue about the free market. 
We can debate that at another time and in another place. 
I have talked to some of them and they appear to be very reasonable folks. 
That is not the way to run a country. 
We are now debating with a gun at our heads. 
He said that was disrespectful of the country and its traditions. 
And I was right. 
I am not alone in my views. 
This view is widely held outside this place. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
What we have here today is a government which is totally abdicating its democratic responsibility. 
Both of these are rather insulting.  
I am really nonplussed by it. 
I will say something and my son will say something else. 
Eventually we have to come to an agreement. 
That is what the process of debate is about. 
These are good amendments. 
Is it because the government members are cowards? 
That is asked as a question so I hope the Speaker does not stop me. 
It is just a question. 
Why are the government members afraid to defend their position on this debate?  
We saw it big time when we were discussing the wheat board issue. 
I wish that would actually occur. 
It is very depressing.  
It is time for me to say a few things about the actual amendments. 
We should recognize a couple of things.  
I believe quite strongly in the principle of free enterprise. 
There seems to be a correlation there. 
This has become a way of thinking.  
We will make sure they do not suffer. 
However there are many people who are able bodied. 
Am I opposed to small business loans? 
I have had experience with loans. 
Maybe it is because there are too many flaws. 
Maybe it is because the individual has not demonstrated a record of financial accountability. 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
This shows that the legislation has serious flaws.  
I will expand upon that concept. 
They have committed a substantial number of dollars solely to funding small businesses. 
It allowed them a considerable amount of support. 
We have to question why the government feels it is necessary to amend the legislation. 
That is all I will say on the bill and amendments. 
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
I also want to speak briefly to Motion No. 3. 
Several groups appeared before the committee. 
We asked the opposition for witnesses. 
Motion No. 4 is pretty straightforward. 
We want to be there for them as a government. 
The government knows that it is small business that is creating jobs. 
We know the potential that exists in Canada. 
We want to ensure that all small businesses have access to financing. 
It is a little disappointing that we are discussing loan limits. 
There are many, many success stories. 
They would not have had that opportunity.  
They put up a lot of their own dollars. 
We know that different areas go through different times. 
We know there is difficulty in financing from time to time. 
They are paying a fee. 
It is not a freebie. 
The majority of these loans will be paid over time. 
Many of these businesses will go on to hire people and will continue to develop.  
I think it is important that we all participate in the debate today. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I think you will find unanimous consent for the following motion: 
Does the hon. member have permission to put the motion?  
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Do members wish to proceed in this way?  
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):
Osteoporosis is an insidious chronic disease characterized by bone loss.  
Younger women and men can also develop osteoporosis.  
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE 
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
It appears that history is about to repeat itself. 
Once again an RCMP officer has been singled out as a possible scapegoat. 
This time ``Hughie'' will take the fall.  
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
Oxford County is a leader in rural connectiveness. 
Now we are building an integrated network across Oxford County.  
The visit was a success due to the hard work- 
The hon. member for Bourassa.  
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):

Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the referendum race is on again with the PQ.  
He does want a referendum. 
On the weekend, the social union was all but forgotten.

Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):

We want the truth to be known completely as soon as possible.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We want the commission to do its work absolutely.  
The RCMP has done its job and always did its job.

Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
My question is very simple. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
It wants to postpone it. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):

Mr. Speaker, my question is for the new solicitor general.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this question is a repetition of all the other questions.  
It has already started its work. 
I want it to finish it as quickly as possible.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Will the solicitor general admit that a mistake is there? 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
He can say it until he is blue in the face. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the solicitor general has been the solicitor general for an hour. 
He has taken over the job and has to be briefed on everything.

CANADA SMALL BUSINESS FINANCING ACT 
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
It helps to create jobs through small businesses. 
Two kinds of businesses face especially difficult problems in securing financing. 
These are very small and very young firms. 
On the question of the age of firms, the difference is even more striking. 
Small and medium businesses are the anchor of our national economy. 
This is an important reason why we should be supporting the bill.  
They account for approximately 40% of the gross national product. 
The loan guarantee program is more than an investment in small businesses. 
It is an investment in jobs and an investment in job opportunities. 
We have to do more than talk about it. 
We have to provide those opportunities. 
We have to be able to act. 
That represents more than 2.5 jobs per loan in just one year.  
During the last five years borrowers anticipated creating over 480,000 jobs. 
This is a remarkably cost effective way of expanding the nation's economy.  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I would like to point out some key provisions the member was asking about. 
Small business is the engine of the country. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
Some of the amendments, if I am not mistaking, are enacting amendments or enabling amendments. 
Bill C-53 contains no changes to the basic program parameters. 
Small and medium size businesses are the cornerstone of our economy. 
Their contribution is vital to our economic welfare. 
The key provisions are as follows.  
Third, we are also proposing to replace the current sunset clause. 
This potential liability would be renewed automatically every five years. 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I will not be using all the time available to me. 
Businesses sometimes modernize to keep jobs. 
This bill should have been improved. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The House will now proceed to the debate on the motions in Group No. 3.  
This group contains Motions Nos. 6 and 11. 
``(a) 50%, or any prescribed lesser percent-'' 
(1) The Minister will routinely conduct an audit or examination of the'' 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
We had an agreement that we were going to move to Group No. 3. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
We are getting into debate now. 
I would ask the hon. member to please focus his remarks on the debate.  
We have more speakers. 
I was sitting here waiting for my turn. 
More speakers are coming up and they will be disappointed.  
I addressed this bill at the first stage. 
These amendments are put forward by the official opposition. 
I am very delighted to speak on them and I will support them.  
Clause 8 deals with the liability of the minister. 
In fact the risk would be equally shared.  
This bill does not provide an adequate review of risk analysis. 
There is no provision for losses. 
If bad decisions are made by the financial institutions, they are guaranteed.  
This practice are contrary to the intent of the act. 
The government needs to address that issue more rigorously in the bill.  
I am delighted to support Motion No. 6. 
It should audit files that need to be audited.  
This change would allow officials to conduct an audit routinely. 
Moreover, they could do so whenever they desired. 
It would ensure federal accountability in the process.  
The amendments would make the process more accountable. 
The auditor general's recommendations would be in place. 
Small businesses would be getting the advantage, not the large businesses.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
I would like to say something very obliquely about the whole issue of closure. 
The government uses that technique in order to stop the debate. 
This is very important to us. 
It is important for that point of view to be stressed.  
We would not have a long debate. 
It would not take a whole week of debate to come to a conclusion.  
That is not an accurate assessment of the government's abilities. 
This group of amendments has two very important components. 
One is Motion No. 6 put forward by one of my colleagues. 
How much money would you like to give them?''  
I trust this person. 
When the tax man comes, it is not a voluntary donation that we make. 
Hence they come to the government, to the taxpayer.  
This has two effects.  
The first one is very important. 
This is the premise here. 
The administrators of the loan system are spending someone else's money. 
We will end up being covered. 
Spread out over all the taxpayers, it does not make that much difference''.  
I appeal to the Liberal members, all the green Liberals over there. 
The taxpayer is footing the bill.  
The second reason this is a good amendment is that it saves the taxpayers money. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member would like to have an extra 10 minutes. 
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
This $250,000 strikes home. 
I had some producers who wanted to borrow money to produce organic grain. 
We handle more grain in one town than in any other place in Canada. 
There is hardly a butchering plant left in western Canada. 
Most of them have closed out. 
At one time the city of Winnipeg had four plants. 
Would they be able to get a loan? 
Not on their life. 
That is the policy of the government.  
I will not support it.  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
I return to the remarks of the member for Elk Island. 
I must say that it was not perfect. 
We supported the government and in fact- 
If you put it through, why are we doing it again?  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
This is the nature of this place. 
We are constantly amending, updating and refining laws. 
This is the Small Business Loans Act. 
In the end the bill will go through. 
Yet here we are today and Reform Party members are almost being obstructionists. 
We should put the bill through with a snap of our fingers.  
They are wondering whether or not small business deserves the legislation. 
There is nothing further from reality than that assertion. 
We have all been in unison. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there unanimous consent of the House to let the member ask a question?  
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
Let us see what the motion is, and I shall then address the main points.  
(a) 50%, or any prescribed lesser per cent.  
What does that mean? 
It is quite simple.  
There are two types of businesses that run into particular difficulties in obtaining financing. 
These are the very small businesses and the very new businesses. 
The current legislation helps remedy this double shortcoming. 
That is one very important point.  
The right number is 1,300 borrowers using 13,000 service points.  
These have been in existence for less than one year. 
These are people starting small, and often very small, businesses.  
The same would hold for businesses run by women.  
As for the second motion, I frankly find it a bit confusing. 
It asks, and I quote: 
The minister will routinely conduct an audit or examination- 
What does routine basis mean?  
I am not an accountant, but I have taken accounting classes. 
I also studied fiscal law when I was in law school. 
Only such circumstances would justify routine audits without notice. 
The lenders who deliver the program originally asked for a notice period of 45 days.  
This was a commitment negotiated by all parties represented on the industry committee. 
The member obviously has a short memory.  
The proposed amendments are simply unacceptable. 
I do not understand the member. 
These two motions simply cannot be supported. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
I could not have said it better myself. 
That is not paraphrasing, that is distorting it.  
The hon. member says I am distorting it. 
I would invite him to check Hansard when he gets home.  
These are small business loans. 
These are small loans, period. 
That is the simple, very easily traced path of what we are talking about.  
The hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine became very emotional about this. 
What is going on? 
Taxpayer money is being put up to guarantee these loans. 
She has not heard of accountability.  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
It happens all the time.  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
You guys are just stalling.  
The hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood says I am stalling. 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
That is the objective of this bill. 
This motion would take away from that. 
Borrowers do pay a higher interest when they obtain these loans.  
Motion No. 11 was debated in committee. 
It was agreed on by all parties. 
The industry committee is made up of all parties. 
It would be easier to have 21 days notice. 
These motions water it down and should not be approved. 
Therefore, I ask that members not vote for these two amendments.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Reformers very much support small business. 
It is taxpayer money.  
That is a very logical move to make.  
They just won't make the loan.  
The member opposite says that maybe they won't make the loan. 
It does not work that way.  
They have to earn that right. 
They have to go to school and get the marks. 
The banks must know the business has the ability to survive.  
I suggest the number of loans written off would probably decrease.  
I think Motion No. 6 is reasonable and logical. 
I hope everybody will support these motions.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I would like to first of all set the record straight. 
I think it is very important. 
We believe very strongly in small businesses and are a great defender of them. 
I think we would just go about it differently. 
I think there are other ways that would be more beneficial.  
We could look at capital gains tax. 
Small business is the economic engine which drives this country. 
We in the Reform Party believe that. 
We believe very strong in that. 
But government subsidies are not the answer.  
They are buried in it from all levels of government. 
I would argue that is not going to happen. 
They would be laughed at. 
The banks would absolutely laugh at them anywhere else in the private sector.  
The default rate is very high with taxpayer money. 
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
She was involved in a government sponsored loans act. 
This lady went to the organization and asked to borrow some money. 
She had declared bankruptcy. 
They had foreclosed on absolutely everything she had. 
Now she is basically a charity case. 
The short answer was that I could do very little if anything to help. 
Likely I could do nothing. 
At the time she came to see me this case was before the courts. 
She is being sued for outstanding debt.  
She admits quite freely that she was not cautious enough. 
She should have read all the fine print. 
She definitely made some mistakes.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
We support this amendment.  
They are the masters of this. 
Business is about calculated risk. 
That is something which unfortunately some of my Liberal friends across the way forget about.  
Under these circumstances, of course, the government picks up the liability.  
They are trying to up the ante for the government to pick up the cost. 
Is that not the solution?  
No, they do not want any of that.  
They want lower taxes. 
Nobody does it better than the Liberals.  
Nobody gives out jobs to their political friends better than Liberals. 
I do not think that is the solution. 
I have never heard them say that yet.  
The changes that the government wants to make will make it even worse. 
That is not what they are asking for. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The parliamentary secretary makes a cogent point.  
I invite the hon. member for Calgary West to return to his dissertation.  
The Liberals talk about the Small Business Loans Act. 
The government will be left holding the bag. 
The default rates are going to continue to increase because of Liberal policies. 
This whole philosophy is wrong-headed. 
It is Liberal wrong-headed thinking. 
It is not talking about allowing greater competition.  
That is the way banks operate. 
Where did they go? 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Resuming debate, the hon. member for Markham.  
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
I have heard a lot of inaccurate information coming from members of the Reform Party. 
That is not true. 
It is about double. 
I cannot see how that is 10 times higher.  
There is also the 50% proposal. 
I have trouble understanding their logic.  
Motion No. 11 concerns the 21 day notice period. 
A financial institution may have many loans across many of its branches. 
My party will not be supporting these two motions.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That Bill C-53 be amended by deleting Clause 13. 
Ms. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ) moved: 
That Bill C-53, in Clause 13, be amended 
(a) by replacing line 32 on page 6 with the following: 
(b) by replacing line 4 on page 7 with the following: 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
The volunteer sector is made up of not for profit organizations. 
They keep the economy running. 
The Liberal government promotes bigger and larger businesses. 
Recently the government gave a $25 million tax free loan to Bombardier. 
The government is taking care of big business, not small business.  
The intent of the act is therefore defeated. 
Based on that our position is very clear. 
The system has already been abused. 
The auditor general has made some clear observations in that regard.  
The government always gets things wrong. 
It has been supporting larger businesses. 
I gave an example the other day of being on the verge of an storm. 
The government should look at employment records to see who creates the jobs. 
Many times the government pats itself on the back because it has created jobs. 
I have been an entrepreneur. 
I have been involved with small businesses from time to time. 
I understand as many other small business entrepreneurs understand. 
Small businesses are independent organizations. 
The small business organization, the CFIB, has 90,000 members. 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
They have enormous difficulty in obtaining credit. 
This is a serious problem.  
This holds true even more in the rest of Canada than in Quebec. 
The number of yes responses was astronomical, because this is their experience.  
It is the governments' responsibility to be aware of this.  
The rate of bankruptcies is too high, but there is no need for that. 
It could be different. 
The market will allow the big businesses to come through.  
Right now, public companies can get financing by selling stocks. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
I certainly appreciate her passion.  
The parts of the bill that we do not like are not about small entrepreneurs. 
These are of benefit to the lender. 
It is probably the only thing in the world on which we agree.  
We do not have to make the world safe for Matthew Barrett. 
This is exactly what we are doing. 
What does this have to do with economic growth? 
Liberals have to have friends too. 
I have spoken as much on this piece of obscene legislation as I care to. 
I will leave it to my colleagues if they wish to continue the debate. 
Perhaps my colleague from Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre will say a few words.  
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
That could be a typical pilot project.  
For that reason I cannot support Motion No. 7. 
Motion No. 8 would include working capital as one of the pilot projects. 
Lending for working capital purposes is a very different game''.  
I would like to thank her for her work on behalf of small business.  
She brings forward a very good suggestion. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
That is the way this place works.  
There were 32 time allocation motions and three closure motions. 
There have been 41 time allocation motions and three closure motions.  
They have raised payroll taxes.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I have heard this member a number of times go far away from the motions.  
I thank the hon. member for St. Catharines for raising this point. 
I am sure the hon. member was zeroing in on it.  
Mr. Speaker, focus we shall have. 
I shall focus on Group No. 4. 
The government across the way knows only too well about expansion. 
People are on the hook for millions of taxpayer dollars there. 
Jobs have gone belly up. 
They went ahead and supported the Charlottetown accord. 
That is the reason we cannot have political interference. 
That is the reason the opposition is talking about amending it.  
This group contains Motions Nos. 9 and 10. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
I will talk about these back door regulations that the government can bring in. 
I think we should have a more open and transparent government. 
The people across the way do not want to listen to these things. 
Why do we want a more open process? 
It is because small business owners want some sort of degree of predictability. 
They do not need that type of intervention.  
I spoke with respect to political interference. 
They are very practical. 
It is not the only example.  
They went ahead and gave out over $2 million of federal taxpayer money. 
Now everybody is holding the bag for about $10 million.  
With a million here and a million there, pretty soon we are talking real money. 
That is the problem when we allow tinkering behind the scenes by bureaucrats. 
They go ahead and they put taxpayers dollars at risk.  
I look around and see the pages in the House. 
They are the ones who will have to pay for the mistakes. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I believe that if there is a ruling concerning- 
The hon. member intervenes again. 
That is what the Reform Party is trying to do. 
We are trying to make the regulatory process more open. 
I hope the member across the way has his ears open. 
We are trying to make it more open and make it more accountable.  
That is as straightforward as it gets. 
I am reading it straight up.  
We are opposed to this practice and are attempting to remedy the problem. 
Fool me once and shame on the Liberals. 
I am sorry I cannot put my faith in them on this one.  
I want to see it printed in black and white. 
That is what they would prefer to do. 
They do not like the business of governing. 
It will be some nameless, faceless bureaucrat they can fire and blame the problem on. 
That is not good enough. 
They are the stewards of taxpayers money. 
They are the ones who vote for the increase in taxes.  
If they do that, the onus is on them. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Motion No. 9 reads: 
This is a housekeeping amendment that I am delighted to put in order.  
Motion No. 10 reads: 
Let me give our rationale for this amendment. 
We need the process to be more open, transparent and credible.  
This is wholly inadequate. 
There is no similar requirement in the Liberal amendment. 
That is why this amendment becomes important.  
We do not want to fool anyone here. 
We want the legislation to be transparent, open and accountable. 
We do not want a back door open to introduce these regulations. 
Reform is opposed to this practice, and this motion attempts to remedy that.  
The Liberals voted against our motion and passed their watered down version. 
The hon. member knows very well. 
It merely has the power to recommend a disallowance. 
There is the recent example of aboriginal-only fisheries. 
We do not get the opportunity to debate. 
That is the point I am trying to make here.  
Only 10% of the equation is provided by the House. 
That is what we are trying to stop. 
Witnesses can add their concerns or bring about improvements. 
They can do so in more of a public forum. 
As it is now the publication period merely allows for the opportunity to comment. 
Comments are reviewed by officials within the department. 
In many cases they are the same people who drafted those regulations. 
So where is the justification? 
As such they must be seen to be in a conflict of interest position.  
I will be supporting the motions put forward by the hon. member for Saskatoon-Humboldt.  
The intent of this amendment is contained in the existing clause. 
Therefore this amendment is redundant.  
The proposed amendment is contrary to the established process for making regulations. 
Furthermore, it appears to contradict clause 14(1). 
These items were discussed very thoroughly in the committee meetings. 
There have not been any valid points brought forward. 
I propose that both these amendments be defeated.  
That Bill C-53, in Clause 16, be amended 
(a) by replacing line 38 on page 10 with the following: 
``liable to a fine of not less than $500,000 or to'' 
(b) by replacing lines 42 and 43 on page 10 with the following: 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I care deeply about Bill C-53.  
We want to see changes. 
Members across the way like to see change. 
That is what I am going to talk about. 
They want to see changes.  
This is taxpayer money. 
Let me boil down what the Reform Party is trying to do. 
The government talks about a maximum sentence if someone makes a false- 
Also, all remaining motions are deemed moved.  
And the bells having rung: 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.

Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
They are worse off than they were in 1984.  
The question is still before us. 
We have not yet had an answer. 
It really begs the question- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am afraid that the time has run out.  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The benefit will help low income parents to improve their circumstances.  
Statistics Canada has stated that its low income cutoff, a measure used by many- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am sorry but I must interrupt the parliamentary secretary.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
This obviously contributes to the rise in crime in Canada.  
Something needs to be done.  
How can we as Canadians rectify this problem?  
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
In light of this, I can certainly understand the hon. member's concern. 
This is a priority. 
Fighting organized crime is the solicitor general's top priority.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
All such devices have the same leaky valves that cannot hold water. 
They grow algae and fungi like a dirty aquarium.  
We have raised this suggestion on numerous occasions since last spring. 
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the member opposite for her question.  
I repeat, credibility with the public. 
He will then have to consider three important issues.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 7.21 p.m.)
