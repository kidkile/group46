EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 147 
Monday, November 2, 1998 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
The House resumed from September 28 consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
There is the key issue of transparency. 
Governments need to make more of an effort to become transparent. 
In addressing this motion it is important to talk about the issue of transparency.  
The second issue is federal-provincial relations. 
In the House we have heard many different points of view on federal-provincial relations. 
The third issue is how this will impact unity. 
There are many issues right now. 
The Quebec election is taking place. 
There is nothing wrong with that. 
We can especially point to the issue of the Calgary declaration. 
The public is skeptical. 
Obviously it was a provincial effort. 
It is very important to make what its role is public. 
I believe that is the crux of this issue.  
The second thing I want to address is the issue of federal-provincial relations. 
We seen that most recently in the case of Alberta with its Senate elections. 
They have been thwarted in that process. 
We have also seen that on other issues concerning parliamentary reform. 
The final point I want to address is the impact on unity. 
We encourage debate on that. 
We encourage people's feedback on that. 
That should be encouraged.  
All of us in the House should support the motion.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
It is an important motion that reads: 
We know of the remarkable historic result. 
We started this process once more with the Calgary declaration. 
They encouraged their various legislatures to engage in an exhaustive process of consultation.  
Unfortunately no similar effort was undertaken by the federal government. 
We as the official opposition assumed the responsibility to consult with Quebecers. 
This is why we have put the motion before the House. 
It includes elements of deep concern to many Canadians. 
This should not just be regarded as some sleepy motion. 
It is not just a partisan opinion that I express. 
This is an important principle. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sorry but the member's time has expired. 
I have been trying to get the member's eye for the last two minutes.  
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased the motion has come back on the order paper. 
I am in my 11th year as an elected person. 
Having said that, I am a little surprised by this motion. 
I find that extremely distasteful. 
What is the government's response to this motion? 
It will produce all the papers. 
There is no secrecy here. 
There is no attempt to hide anything.  
A member opposite asks where are they? 
One has to wonder why members came into the House to do this. 
Members want to run against that.  
I would argue frankly that it is the latter. 
What is the official response of the government to this motion? 
This comes from the speech of the member for Simcoe North. 
The government agrees to follow up on this initiative. 
Why are these polls being held back? 
Why are we not being apprised of the situation? 
The member says to give them to him. 
We have agreed to do that.  
I expect that tonight.  
It takes a few days to pull it together. 
When it comes before the House all documents have to be put together. 
All of that information will be produced.  
It highlights our country's diversity''.  
I do not know how that assists the process.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
It is a very serious matter which needs to be addressed by this House.  
It needs to be forthcoming. 
The government pretends it is but it is not.  
I cannot understand why it does not share this information. 
The government is supposed to answer within 45 days. 
We sometimes have to wait a year, even longer. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
That is what this motion fundamentally speaks to.  
There is a will for change in this country. 
One of my other colleagues mentioned that. 
The Reform Party obviously has a will for Senate elections. 
The NDP wishes to abolish the Senate. 
It is one of the reasons we wanted to see these papers.  
It would be a first.  
That is right, it would be a first.  
I will touch on a couple of other things just to wrap up this debate. 
The member for Wentworth-Burlington brought up that issue. 
I think we all want to see that.  
I want to touch on the whole idea of co-operation. 
The government said it had the documents. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
An amendment to a motion cannot be raised on a point of order. 
When we got into the right of reply the debate was ended. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the wisdom you have given me. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
There is not unanimous consent. 
The question is on the main motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I declare the motion carried.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The sitting of the House was suspended at 11.50 a.m.) 
The House resumed at 12 p.m. 
PERSONAL INFORMATION AND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENTS ACT 
This code is mentioned in the preamble to the schedule. 
We gave an example that is worth repeating today. 
The British Columbia commissioner made similar comments.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am sorry but your time is up.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
The consensus was on harmonization.  
It chose to not give Canadians equivalent protection. 
This code, which businesses have agreed to apply, is a good one. 
However, the code is unclear. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
Bill C-54 contains a number of shortcomings. 
What is more, the commissioner has no real power. 
But it did no such thing.  
Privacy is a fundamental right. 
Privacy is also protected in Canada, although only partially. 
Section 8 provides as follows: 
``Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure''.  
Quebec. Like Pauline Julien, he was jailed.  
They want to see this legislation passed. 
Why do they not tell us the truth this afternoon? 
Again, he mocked us.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Fortunately, that was not how things went. 
The bill we have before us now, however, unfortunately lacks muscle. 
People can opt out. 
Where e-commerce is concerned, merely having a few obligations is really very weak.  
That is not the worse thing, however. 
The bill is a serious step backwards.  
I will give a few examples. 
This is the legislation governing the public sector, federal institutions. 
Now, this government is going to treat the private sector differently.  
Clause 4.2.5 of the schedule provides that: 
What kind of legislation is this? 
However, there is worse. 
Section 17 of the Quebec legislation provides for this.  
Today, and for a week now, what have we been doing? 
This makes no sense, but I have no choice. 
However, when we get here, we feel much better.  
There are some things that we in Quebec do very well. 
The protection of personal information is ensured in a very adequate manner. 
The same is true regarding the rehabilitation of our young offenders. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
It has an impact beyond this chamber. 
Most provinces have already passed such legislation. 
The federal government must go back to the drawing board as soon as possible. 
This bill is full of loopholes. 
It leaves many sectors without any protection. 
This bill is filled with ifs and whens and shoulds. 
This situation is unacceptable. 
5. Every person has a right to the respect of his or her privacy.  
Every person has a right to the respect of his reputation and privacy. 
It would have achieved two objectives at once. 
This, however, is totally false.  
Instead, it serves commercial interests.  
In conclusion, one simply needs to compare the titles of the two acts. 
It is for these reasons that we categorically reject Bill C-54.  
Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Quebec East, BQ):
For those watching us on TV, I am the member for Quebec East. 
We are living at a time when communications are very quick. 
This is not the only problem. 
For instance, Loblaws is in the process of buying Provigo, a Quebec company. 
There are also the proposed bank mergers. 
We wish the federal government were aware of its responsibilities. 
These are good descriptions''.  
This is what the commissioner had to say. 
Basically, he wants the government to respect the individual. 
For instance, our elections act is among the best in the world. 
We have passed farming legislation.  
Quebec passed this law in 1994. 
It is just one of many examples.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
There are a number of important issues that are attached to this legislation. 
Let us first look at the implications of electronic commerce itself. 
Let us look at some of the larger Canadian firms. 
That is actually a euphemism for wiping it out. 
This will take place very quickly.  
We acknowledge that e-commerce is with us. 
I do not think that we appreciate the impact which electronic commerce will have.  
Just the other day I walked into a store in the city of Ottawa. 
I asked why I was signing the screen. 
I did not think that sounded like a good idea. 
Obviously our concern about privacy is very serious.  
I could go on and on to make the point. 
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Even the hon. member from northern Ontario agrees. 
But where does it come from? 
Following these two commitments, documents were drafted. 
Building Canada's Information Economy and Society''.  
In total, the working group created to examine the issue received 90 briefs. 
The protection of privacy is recognised as a fundamental right. 
Section 8 protects Canadians against unreasonable search.  
Its references are not indirect. 
I repeat: ``Every person has a right to respect for his private life''.  
The federal government and all provinces all passed legislation in this regard. 
What are theses weaknesses? 
I will mention a few.  
Clause 4.2.5 reads: 
Persons collecting personal information should able to explain- 
Clause 4.5.2 reads: 
Clause 4.5.3 reads: 
However, the voluntary code says that that consent can be obtained by default.  
That is what is called default consent.  
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Protection of privacy has always been a major concern of mine. 
I was involved in the labour movement for many years before going into politics. 
I saw police officers open books and carelessly search everywhere. 
They searched our offices, our work spaces.  
In my view, there are in fact a lot of enforcement problems.  
The title of the federal act is: 
The difference is quite apparent just in the two titles. 
I remind the House of what happened recently with the APEC. 
It has been in the news a lot, lately. 
As my colleagues before me pointed out, this bill is flawed. 
Too much is written in the conditional. 
Very often, lawyers are the first ones praising this approach.  
I do not deny this.  
It is inappropriate for the government. 
We can see on which side the government will be. 
Who is lobbying the government? 
Then, who is lobbying the federal government? 
Then they will ask the government to change the regulations. 
And we know what will happen.  
Our hands are not tied unlike the government in front of us.  
What will the government do? 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The question is on the motion that the question be now put. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
MARINE CONSERVATION AREAS ACT 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
This piece of legislation has a laudable purpose. 
It supports the environmental approach underlying this bill. 
However, the Bloc wants to forcefully state its disagreement with the means used.  
We hope very much that it will be withdrawn and reworked. 
This bill contains other major problems. 
They could also look into other matters, there are lots to choose from.  
There are three federal bodies. 
Finally, there is Heritage Canada, which has marine conservation areas and its own regulations.  
More importantly, these people do not know if they will have resources to live on. 
That is what a study revealed two weeks ago. 
This government sang the praises of renewed federalism. 
We cannot do that because this government could decide otherwise. 
What matters is the text.  
However, it took some reporters to understood it the same way we did.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, it is only recently that I have become interested in this bill. 
And in a way expropriate from Quebec. 
I believe this is unconstitutional. 
I believe that the federal government has no right to do so. 
I would like my colleague to shed some light on this for me.  
What I understand is what I read.  
This issue of expropriation is not mentioned. 
There is something in that logic that does not ring true. 
Quebec does not have the right to transfer these titles to the Canadian government.  
Mrs. Claudette Bradshaw (Moncton-Riverview-Dieppe, Lib.):
Mr. Gaudet has greatly contributed to the economic growth of Moncton-Riverview-Dieppe. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH 
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the National Art Centre's production of The Bush Ladies:
Catherine Parr Traill, a writer and botanist, is the most famous of them. 
The contributions to our country of these four special women were most worthy.  
Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West, Lib.):
GALA DE L'ADISQ 
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
The prizes awarded these artists is undeniable proof of the public's appreciation.  
Congratulations to Kevin Parent and Bruno Pelletier, who each won three Felix awards.  
And congratulations to all the others who, for lack of time, I cannot name.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
I salute Mothers Against Drunk Drivers for their tireless work.  
It is incumbent on every member of parliament to join this fight. 
ELECTION CAMPAIGN IN QUEBEC 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
It is only tyrants who fear the labour movement. 
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
The situation in other Canadian cities is also serious. 
It has been described by municipal leaders as ``a national disaster''.  
Evidently this is an issue requiring urgent and immediate attention. 
TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF ADISQ 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
The minimum carapace size would be increased to 3 8/32 inches. 
We now learn that this is not to be the case. 
The hon. member for Lambton-Kent-Middlesex.  
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
This disorder causes delays in physical and intellectual development. 
The actual cause of Down's syndrome is still unknown.  
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
What does this mean?  
Will the computer programs be ready for January 1, 2000? 
It will affect our daily lives. 
The question now is how will we be affected? 
Is the government too far behind to catch up? 
When will we know?  
The government has done too little too late in addressing this urgent situation. 
So much is at risk, the government should be ashamed of itself.  
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
God bless you all.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Why this hush-hush meeting to change EI? 
Is the Prime Minister actually ashamed, as he should be, of what he is doing?  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will tell you who will not welcome this announcement. 
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we would have done one better. 
It does not make any sense. 
These people are being gouged by the Prime Minister and the government.  
In all seriousness, why is the Prime Minister punishing the working poor?  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, workers and employers should be paying lower premiums. 
Four years ago the finance minister said: 
Four years ago the Liberals had an excuse, that they were running a huge deficit. 
That was great then. 
What is their excuse today?  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the excuse is very simple. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We have already started re-investing and we intend to continue.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, cuts re-occur every year.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
What is the minister waiting for to show some leadership? 
Is he waiting for the victims' lives to be at risk?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
A year ago, we initiated a process with the provinces. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Not one victim of tainted blood has received one red cent of compensation. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
The board also includes a defeated Liberal MP.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, every one of the directors was selected by a joint federal board. 
They were not appointed unless they had provincial approval.  
If the member has a difficulty, maybe he should take it up with the provinces.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, maybe they were smoking a joint. 
Maybe that was the problem.  
I know the hon. member is going to ask his question now. 
In fact the government at this point is $4 billion over budget.  
The others were expenditures that were already announced in the previous estimates.  
I would like to know what the hon. member is against. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, let me tell the minister what we are offended about. 
I am sure that is what Canadians want to hear.  
Is that what the minister thinks?  
I will repeat my comment.  
Are these the payments my hon. colleague would like to see decreased?  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister for Industry.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I said to journalists that this is a very important program. 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
What is the Minister waiting for to take action?  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Why does the health minister not take his responsibilities seriously? 
Look after the victims.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Progress is being made. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Former governments have done that. 
It does not take into account the needs of people.  
That is the way we think we should do business.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Coming out of that discussion are four things the provinces put on the table. 
First, they want a flexible regime. 
Second, they want additional resources. 
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Let us let the parties work it out. 
They have been making progress.  
What we can do is let that process continue. 
It is in the interests of the victims.  
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
That is the truth.  
If the hon. minister wishes to address that question he may.  
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
What course of action is the minister pursuing to prevent Mr. Faulder's execution?  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member is quite right. 
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
What does the commissioner of the RCMP do about all this? 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
RCMP positions are going unfilled because of these funding cuts. 
Detachments are being called on to stretch their resources to the breaking point. 
That type of response is totally unacceptable. 
What kind of message is this sending to rank and file police officers?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
What kind of message is that sending to Canada?  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
It is a good process.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
I intend to seek a replacement for him in due course. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
In fact, for the last year there have been two CEOs.  
Mr. Fewchuk has resigned. 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
Are our banks themselves fully prepared for the year 2000?  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is a very important question.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Those signs cost $540,000.  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
These sports are sponsored by the Government of Canada. 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  
A study by HRDC has proven that urban poverty is increasing. 
They all point to a critical need for government action.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this government is very concerned about the issue of poverty. 
It is devoting another $850 million to further fight poverty.  
It is not just talk like the hon. member is doing. 
It is action that Canadians want and they are getting positive action from this government. 
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
There are meetings happening in the next few weeks.  
We have already announced that decision.  
Mr. Raymond Bonin (Nickel Belt, Lib.):
My question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Nickel Belt for his question.  
This will foster a better knowledge of our heritage.  
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Why can he not understand that?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert, BQ):
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
My question is to the Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food. 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
There is $2.5 billion allotted to that system.  
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
That is the unfortunate explanation for some accidents.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
What does the minister suggest be done to rectify this situation?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We have the transitional jobs fund- 
That will bring to a close our question period for today.  
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Joe McGuire (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
I agree with the petition.  
The hon. member knows he cannot say that. 
I would invite him to comply with the rules at all times. 
I know he would want to do that.  
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
The first one is signed by 83 constituents from the surrounding area. 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
The hon. member has surely heard my rebuke to his colleague already. 
I would hope he would comply with the rules in all respects.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
We consider this as discrimination against most women. 
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
They are suggesting that it should be revised from top to bottom.  
It is a pleasure to present the petition on their behalf.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
They point out a number of offences against animals.  
They do not elaborate.  
Mr. John O'Reilly (Haliburton-Victoria-Brock, Lib.):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Question No. 125- Mr. Ted White: 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
MARINE CONSERVATION AREAS ACT 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
The year 1998 was designated the International Year of the Ocean by the United Nations. 
Of course the Bloc Quebecois is in favour of measures to protect the environment. 
At this stage, I would like to elaborate on our objections to this bill. 
Both governments will continue to fulfil their respective responsibilities. 
The legislation also states that the park is made up entirely of marine areas. 
Another model it could have followed is Phase III of the St. Lawrence action plan. 
This land, let it not be forgotten, belongs to Quebec. 
A highly complicated way of putting it.  
There is a kind of contradiction here. 
I am not making this up. 
10. Navigation and Shipping.  
11. Quarantine and the Establishment and Maintenance of Marine Hospitals.  
12. Sea Coast and Inland Fisheries.  
13. Property and Civil Rights in the Province; 
Generally all Matters of a merely local or private Nature in the Province.  
Section 92A(1) is also interesting.  
(1) In each province, the legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to 
(a) exploration for non-renewable natural resources in the province; 
Section 2 reads as follows: 
Under Quebec's legislation, the minister also has authority to appoint conservation officers.  
Bill C-48 creates overlap within the federal administration itself. 
This means that a single site could find itself protected under more than one category.  
Welcome, folks, to the complex world of Government of Canada bureaucracy.  
As we can see there is confusion but there is more. 
Briefly, I would like to add this. 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
This is like shooting one's self in the foot. 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye:
Does Fisheries and Oceans have jurisdiction? 
Is this a heritage issue? 
All this is done on Quebec's territory.  
Is my lawn in good condition? 
Am I taking good care of the environment? 
What we have here an invasion of territory through legislation. 
There is no physical invasion, just legislative invasion. 
This is not the first occurrence. 
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Mr. Pierre de Savoye:
Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for this excellent question. 
He has given an example of exactly the right kind of situation.  
It does not want to copy what has been done in the past. 
We have a good model, but they will not follow it anymore. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
My constituency of Fundy-Royal straddles the beautiful and scenic Bay of Fundy. 
The Bay of Fundy has the largest tides in the world. 
The Bay of Fundy is home to many different species of marine life. 
Only the lucrative lobster fishery remains. 
This is also threatened. 
We support Bill C-48. 
Some people believe that piece of legislation is rather complex. 
It comes down to a number of points.  
First, when it comes to endangered species we do not kill them. 
Many of my constituents depend on the ocean for their livelihoods.  
Fish were an important staple in their everyday diets. 
They recognized the importance of this natural resource for their survival. 
In this park we have an opportunity to view the Bay of Fundy.  
Recently our coastal regions have been facing another menacing attack. 
The Progressive Conservative Party has long been concerned with preserving our ecosystem. 
In 1986 the PC government approved the national marine park policy. 
I must say that this is an incredible region and a great park.  
It is important that aboriginal peoples be involved in the negotiations. 
There are restrictions on non-renewable resource extraction. 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his comments. 
But the ocean floor comes under the sovereign right of the provinces.  
The federal government is once again showing its bad faith. 
There can be no better proof. 
It is a beautiful park co-managed by Canada and Quebec. 
This country was actually formed from an act of will. 
It is one of the most picturesque areas of the world. 
There are very few fiords where people actually have access. 
The federal government on occasion has interfered in areas where it should not have. 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Those islands are all frequented by daily ferry service. 
This legislation has all kinds of problems with it. 
We have a hollow piece of legislation.  
There is absolutely nothing in it. 
Furthermore it does not bring in other groups such as the provinces. 
Members opposite do not agree with what I am saying. 
I ask members to get out their legislation. 
Schedules I and II describe the areas that we are thinking about.  
They are not there. 
The government will decide this later.  
I emphasize the problem I have with the legislation. 
I am a strong advocate of conserving our marine life. 
That is not what we have. 
We have no idea what we are getting ourselves into.  
I have watched the example set by the government. 
However what happens when the actual practices come down? 
For example there is the Makaw whale hunt that is happening outside my riding. 
The minister supports the Makaw whale hunt. 
He is supporting the slaughter of whales in Canadian waters.  
We have no idea. 
What we have is a dictatorship.  
I could go on. 
We have no idea what is happening. 
There are broad, sweeping powers for the minister. 
It enlarges the minister's jurisdiction. 
They raise flags with me in discussions. 
Whales will be floating up on the beaches of Victoria in his riding. 
He has taken absolutely no initiative to stop it. 
It is absolutely unacceptable. 
However the legislation is not the vehicle that will do that. 
We have a hollow, empty piece of legislation.  
I question why it is there. 
I question what the government is doing. 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to comment a bit and then ask the member a question.  
Let us not get carried away by inventing motives that do not exist.  
The member started his speech by parrying for more consultation. 
He rightfully requests more consultation. 
Of course not, because they have not been selected.  
Should we decide there should be no consultation and make these decisions unilaterally? 
We cannot possibly list them in the annexes. 
Does he want consultation or does he want us to go ahead and pick unilaterally? 
Mr. Speaker, we have to go back to the government's record. 
The legislation contains numerous Henry VIII clauses. 
That is an absolute given.  
I do not have confidence in the government at all. 
We have seen that dwindling among Canadians over the past month. 
The Liberals are going down and down and down and they know it.  
That is why I say the legislation is hollow. 
Those whales could potentially wash up on the beaches of Victoria. 
The government's record is dismal in this area. 
We have had a dictatorship. 
We have seen it over and over again.  
I can give them all kinds of examples. 
We could look at the EI fund. 
There are a hundred examples. 
The record speaks for itself. 
Their performance has been absolutely dismal.  
They are sighing over there because they have nothing better to say. 
It is a fact. 
The legislation is very clear. 
It gives broad sweeping powers to the minister. 
There is the fishery which the government has destroyed. 
The Liberals can talk to their own member from Gander-Grand Falls in Newfoundland. 
It has been an absolute dismal failure. 
The auditor general has confirmed this in numerous reports. 
It does not add up.  
This legislation clearly does not do that.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, that is a very good question. 
She makes a valid point. 
I think it is open for debate. 
That, without question, I would agree is provincial jurisdiction. 
That could be open to interpretation.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
The Bloc Quebecois supports measures to protect the environment. 
This resulted in the creation of Canada's first marine conservation area.  
Both governments will continue to fulfil their respective responsibilities.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Hon. members are always using the word ``consultation''. 
It is a word that we hear all the time in the House. 
I received a very shocking answer. 
That control is being concentrated in the hands of a very few.  
As we look at this bill we see the same thing happening. 
It actually does not do anything like that.  
This bill gives the people behind the scenes more control over the agenda. 
I am wondering if the member does not have a concern about this. 
We have the power to do this. 
What are you complaining about?''  
As legislators, we should also be able to represent them well.  
This is why we think these consultations are a sham.  
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
I remember it well. 
We have, in fact, several objections. 
Allow me to explain the main features of the legislation.  
This is what they did with the millennium scholarships. 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
First, a motion may be moved that it be postponed for six months. 
This is the approach the Reform Party has taken. 
Why did it not sign? 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
These are provincial jurisdictions. 
They always have been. 
I do a lot of hiking in the back country. 
I spend a great deal of my recreational time in the great outdoors. 
That certainly waved a red flag in front of me. 
People have been forced out of work. 
There are no economic opportunities left for them any more. 
The Queen Charlotte Islands are an archipelago comprised of two major islands. 
South Moresby is the large island on the south part of archipelago. 
People were told that there was going to be- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would like to hear what my colleague from the Reform Party has to say. 
If they want to shout, they should go there. 
There is a member there, all by himself. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Rimouski-Mitis is quite correct in bringing this to our attention.  
It limits the number of Canadians who can go into that park every year. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I mentioned earlier that we should be tempered in our language. 
I remind and ask all hon. members to be temperate in their language. 
Mr. Speaker, I apologize. 
I too have heard words that raised my level of anger. 
We have to have it. 
Everything feeds on each other; it is a domino effect. 
They are not considering what the impact is going to be on ordinary Canadians.  
This has been forced down their throats.  
Just consider that for a minute.  
We can put a name and a face to that. 
Let me give the House more examples. 
If anyone thinks I am being ridiculous, let me assure them I am not. 
Prince Rupert is not alone. 
They are looking for alternatives. 
They are looking for ways to offset some of the downturns that have taken place. 
I am not making this up. 
That is the truth.  
The radical environmental agenda is becoming clearer as time goes on. 
These people are profoundly anti-human. 
These people think we are nothing better than pestilence. 
Some of these people have even voiced that thought.  
Can we believe that? 
I am not making that up.  
Their agenda is becoming clearer as time goes on. 
Can we imagine that? 
There would be no power. 
But that is what these people see. 
That is their vision for the future.  
I say that this legislation is driven by that kind of mentality. 
These people want to limit economic activity with the eventual goal of eradicating it altogether.  
They went on a controlled burn. 
I say this bill should be defeated on its face for those very reasons.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his remarks. 
In Ontario the provincial government is retreating from environmental issues in every way. 
I could cite examples right across Canada.  
If the member says that provincial governments are retreating, so be it. 
That is their right. 
The provincial governments in this country have jurisdiction over the environment. 
Beyond that there is not. 
The provincial governments have jurisdiction. 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that question is easy to answer. 
Do you want us to consult?  
Mr. Speaker, the member across asked me something. 
I want him to butt out. 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for our colleague from the Reform Party.  
The government never agreed to recognize the rights that were being claimed.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for her question. 
I will try to explain what happened. 
The federal government decided it wanted to create a national park. 
The federal government has not kept its word on any of that. 
It has not kept the bargain. 
I see that blowhard from Vancouver- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Let us not get into that again. 
The hon. member for Wentworth-Burlington.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
I love the island and I feel it is very much a part of me. 
It is of interest to me. 
We on this side do care.  
The member is quite right. 
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
I would like them to be honest. 
Let us look at what it has done on northern native reserves.  
The environment committee visited these reserves. 
What has the government done? 
It can all be found in the committee's proceedings. 
What we see today is the result of this approach. 
We are in favour of measures aimed at protecting the environment.  
It is very simple, really. 
At the same time, Fisheries and Oceans Canada had marine protection areas. 
It was quite a consultation.  
At the same time, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans was holding consultations in Quebec. 
Of 650 requests, they received 30 answers. 
We want to protect the environment. 
This bill should be withdrawn.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
I am not at all surprised. 
I ask the member- 
Mr. Pierre de Savoye:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We are doing our duty as any other member.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, it is astounding. 
I said I respected the fact that Bloc members were being honest. 
We know what their agenda is.  
I would suggest the Bloc at least has an agenda.  
So we are not so bad after all.  
Even though we did not sign it, we can read it to him. 
His culture is lacking, so we will improve it a bit. 
I will quote for him some parts of section 91.  
Section 91 states that: 
10. Navigation and Shipping; 
11. Quarantine and the Establishment and Maintenance of Marine Hospitals; 
12. Sea Coast and Inland Fisheries; 
-between a Province and any British or Foreign Country or between Two Provinces.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Reform member is absolutely right. 
Well, they will have to go back to the drawing board. 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
This is what they said. 
What is the motivation across the aisle? 
What is the motivation of all those hypocrites?  
That is what they are. 
Mr. Speaker, yes, indeed, I am ready to withdraw that word. 
I wish, however, to specify that I called no one in particular a hypocrite. 
If some thought the remark was aimed at them, that is their problem.  
We see this repeatedly in intergovernmental affair issues. 
We have seen it with the millennium scholarship fund.  
I know that the government has an important financial leeway. 
This debate is about marine areas. 
Is an agreement respecting both parties' areas of jurisdiction no longer possible?  
They could not care less. 
We heard earlier what this government really thinks. 
When they think something may benefit them, they could not care less about jurisdictions.  
Nobody is against this. 
Can anybody be against virtue? 
There are important things to do in this regard. 
Everybody agrees with the objectives. 
However, the approach used by the government to achieve these objectives is not working.  
Two or three departments in Ottawa have seen this. 
All of a sudden, every one of them wants to take care of this. 
It also wants to take credit for the bill.  
And the list goes on. 
Of course, that has the Department of Environment a bit concerned. 
It also wants to get involved.  
Everyone has its own name for it and everyone will have its own regulations. 
There is a problem.  
Let us examine those words. 
What is their meaning?  
In the end, they do not want citizens to put pressure on their provincial governments. 
They feel somewhat powerless, inferior, diminished. 
They do not want decentralization. 
Those people want a centralized state. 
They should take a stand, and we will see what comes of it.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
The same holds true for municipal representatives. 
I respect this type of approach.  
They really do love squabbles. 
They are always looking for more of them.  
They even fight with their allies.  
Then they accuse us of provocation. 
They are the masters in that game.  
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
They are not big bad wolves. 
How can he explain that?  
Mr. Speaker, it is very easy to explain. 
There is en excellent example right now in Quebec. 
But in some cases, it is easier than in others to distinguish the political stripes. 
Let us get back to the subject.  
What is the problem? 
Why can we not do the same thing for the other marine areas? 
I would like an explanation.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Wentworth-Burlington.  
I think the Canadian people should hear what is in the bill. 
That would be a very unusual approach to take in a debate.  
There is quite a distinction.  
That is the message, and the member would actually unite with these guys.  
Unite the right apparently is in some difficulty. 
There appear to be some good reasons we are hearing about today.  
I was a provincial politician for eight years in the Ontario legislature. 
I fully understand the constitutional relationship between the federal government and provincial governments. 
We provide transfer grants. 
Those grants go for health care. 
That is the responsibility of provincial governments.  
The system does not work.  
A member of the Reform Party says the system does not work. 
That is what we are hearing those members say. 
They know what is best.  
I have many dear friends in Victoria. 
We have a former long time mayor who now represents his community in this place. 
Should we turn that decision over to the province of Ontario? 
Should we abdicate our national responsibility? 
I heard one member talk about Tweedledee and Tweedledum. 
Would that not be interesting?  
I also served 10 years as a municipal councillor. 
I understand the role and I appreciate the role. 
My wife currently serves as a councillor. 
I do not think I want to see that. 
If the official opposition wants to criticize the federal government that is fine. 
That is its job. 
If it wants to dismantle it, it should have the courage. 
At least the Bloc says it like it is from its perspective. 
It wants to dismantle the country.  
If that is what Reformers want to do, they should say that.  
It would not surprise me at all. 
No. He is one of us.  
The Conservatives should be a little nervous. 
I wonder if they were serving arsenic or whatever. 
We have some federal legislation. 
Should we turn it over to the provinces? 
It is our responsibility and the responsibility of Reformers to stand and defend the nation. 
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
I will now try to ask a different question to the Liberal member. 
I remind him that this has nothing to do with the big bad separatists.  
Second, clause 5(2) of Bill C-48 reads as follows: 
Perhaps it is close to what was said.  
That is very simple. 
The member opposite continues to chirp. 
Perhaps he has a particular amendment that he wants to make to the bill. 
Is he saying he does not? 
Why not bring it to committee? 
Why not bring it to committee and take a look at some amendments? 
The hon. member might be surprised. 
We could discuss it. 
It could be possible.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
If the federal government does not do that, we will lose Canada.  
Mr. Speaker, the bill establishes a procedure. 
It is not a short term proposition. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am someone who very much likes to travel in North Africa. 
It is a beautiful part of the world, particularly Egypt. 
I am very fond of the desert.  
The Red Sea is famous for its underwater marine environment. 
I arrived there and went swimming. 
There is a reef just offshore. 
There is life everywhere competing. 
The water was beautiful and perfectly clear.  
That was in one little cove that the local guides took us to. 
Everything was totally dead. 
It was a sand coated globule of oil.  
Egypt did not apply those standards because it needs the money. 
It is as simple as that.  
I was there the summer before last. 
It is an absolutely splendid situation. 
It is a bird sanctuary. 
The drop is about 300 feet. 
Tens of thousands of birds swarm around that pinnacle. 
That is their breeding ground.  
There is wild life and biodivisity in incredible quantities.  
Would they be affected? 
I would say every Canadian would care. 
I move to Lake Ontario. 
They are called the Hamilton and the Scourge . 
We can walk along the shore and find shells of every diversity. 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
It is normal for these people to support a centralizing bill.  
The situation in Canada is very complex. 
This fisherman asks the province for a fishing licence. 
To launch his boat, he has to register with the federal government. 
However, the bottom of the river is provincial. 
But as if that were not good enough, we also have federal fishing quotas. 
The bill before us is completely flawed. 
It is creating problems where there were none.  
We know how this works. 
This makes absolutely no sense.  
The often valid objections that the Bloc Quebecois brings up should be debated in committee. 
When we agree with something in principle, we should support it in principle.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Is it agreed that we call it 6.30 p.m.?  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
The Prime Minister and the solicitor general in particular are entrusted with very heavy responsibilities.  
These are the fundamental questions that have remained unanswered throughout.  
The commission is left with the tantamount task of deciding its own fate. 
This has gone from the sublime to the ridiculous.  
This matter has completely lost the faith of the Canadian people. 
This entire affair has a stench around it now that Canadians will not tolerate.  
I am very interested to see how the parliamentary secretary will respond to these allegations.  
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
My colleague across the way used the expression ``from the sublime to the ridiculous''. 
Let us have a clear understanding of what the problem is: there are incidents. 
The case is referred to it.  
It is alleged that the Prime Minister got involved. 
It is alleged that the commission is a lame-duck commission. 
The allegations keep coming. 
Allegations about what happened on a plane. 
Members of opposition parties. 
Why are they making these allegations? 
To defend purely political and partisan causes. 
And what does this have to do with reality? 
They are not at all interested in the truth. 
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.30 p.m.)
