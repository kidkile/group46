Speech from the Throne 
Constitutional Error-Letter to Governor General 
The passage from the Speech from the Throne reads as follows: 
...I have examined the Speech from the Throne including the following: 
Senators are parliamentarians too, just like members of Parliament.  
Here at home, he was somewhat akin to Oliver or Smiley in English Canada. 
Thank you, Leon, for having led the way.  
Speech from the Throne 
Comments Concerning Constitutional Error 
Hon. Louis J. Robichaud :
Someone should have pointed out this error before we did.  
I have spoken my mind, honourable senators.  
Assistance Given During Spring Flooding of Red River 
The morale boost that you gave us was tremendous.  
The job that they did during that time was simply unbelievable. 
They were just tremendous.  
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration 
Speech from the Throne 
Address in Reply-Termination of Debate on Eighth Sitting Day-Notice of Motion 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I give notice that tomorrow, Thursday, October 2, 1997, I will move: 
Cape Breton Development Corporation 
Notice of Motion to Reconstitute Special Committee 
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Tuesday next, October 7, 1997, I will move: 
Notice of Motion to Establish Special Committee 
Hon. William M. Kelly :
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Thursday next, October 2, 1997, I will move: 
That the Committee present its final report no later than April 15, 1998. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson :
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the answer is a very definitive "Yes." 
I am not familiar with the situation. 
Obviously, I read about it in the newspapers, as did other honourable senators. 
Honourable senators, I have a supplementary question. 
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
Honourable senators, my question is also to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Just how much more has not been determined. 
How much will they have to pay? 
Is the government planning to increase the registry fees as a result? 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Is the government planning to increase the registration fees? 
Not that I am aware of. 
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
Honourable senators, I have a supplementary question on this matter. 
Does the leader have an answer to that question, please?  
I shall seek the information he is requesting.  
Shortfall of Funds in Armed Forces Budget- Government Position 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Senator Forrestall talked about a cut and a shortfall. 
The shortfall is the money. 
I asked this question in March of this year, but received no answer. 
Only eight fishermen out of 200 are still being trained.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I will attempt to get that answer as quickly as possible. 
I do not understand. 
I asked a specific question and therefore naturally expect a specific answer.  
Cost and Purpose of Producing Material- Government Position 
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
I am concerned about the cost of this material. 
Who had the contract to produce it, and for what purpose? 
How broad was the circulation, and what was the cost?  
These kinds of things do not help anyone involved in government.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I am pretty strong.  
Perhaps that is part of the ammunition.  
Failure of Finance Minister to Reduce Premiums-Government Position 
Hon. Michael A. Meighen :
My question relates to Employment Insurance premiums. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, this is the key part: 
I assume we want to act responsibly in this respect.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
I move the adjournment of the debate.  
Liberal Party of Canada 
Methods of Party Funding-Inquiry by Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Honourable senators, I wish to congratulate the minister on his appointment. 
Could you inform this house of any developments in this inquiry?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The honourable senator is shaking his head. 
May we have a verbal answer, please?  
It is a hypothetical question. 
The honourable senator knows darn well that the government would not interfere.

Speech From the Throne 
Hon. Jean B. Forest , seconded by the Honourable Senator Mercier, moved: 
MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY: 
Government itself was not immune. 
Everyone had to tighten their belts. 
Few survived without sacrifice.  
The deficit is down and almost out. 
The economy on the whole is robust. 
Inflation remains low, as do interest rates. 
As the Finance Minister so aptly put it: 
It is a government able to exercise its obligations.  
Allow me the opportunity to speak to a few of these priorities. 
First on my list is building a stronger Canada. 
It is a project in which I have been engaged all my life. 
It is good that the government is committed to investing in these children. 
Allow me in conclusion just to read it: 
An old man, going a lone highway, 
Came at the evening, cold and gray 
To a chasm, vast and deep and wide, 
Through which was flowing a sullen tide.  
The old man crossed in the twilight dim - 
That sullen stream had no fears for him; 
But he turned, when he reached the other side, 
And built a bridge to span the tide.  
"Old man," said a fellow pilgrim near, 
"You are wasting your strength in building here.  
Your journey will end with the ending day; 
You never again must pass this way.  
You have crossed the chasm, deep and wide, 
Why build you the bridge at the eventide?"  
The builder lifted his old grey head.  
"Good friend, in the path I have come," he said, 
"There followeth after me today 
A youth whose feet must pass this way.  
This chasm that has been naught to me 
To that fair-haired youth may a pitfall be.  
He, too, must cross in the twilight dim; 
Good friend, I am building the bridge for him."  
Honourable senators, we can do it if we try.  
On motion of Senator Mercier, debate adjourned.  
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
