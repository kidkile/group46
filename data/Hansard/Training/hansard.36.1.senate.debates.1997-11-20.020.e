Thursday, November 20, 1997 
The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
I should like to add that children also need safe homes.  
Today is National Child Day. 
What other resource do we treat in this fashion?  
Hon. Therese Lavoie-Roux :
That is not intrinsically bad. 
The family will always be the cornerstone of a child's development. 
These children are identifiable by their lack of concentration and slow learning. 
The problem goes much deeper. 
Honourable senators, I second Senator Carstairs' motion. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
We are at the Senators' Statements stage. 
At this stage, there is no debate.  
That is easier said than done. 
It is not that we lack the necessary knowledge. 
Woman Entrepreneur of the Year Award 
Congratulations to Recipient Jo-Anne Schurman 
Today, women own and lead almost one-third of Canadian companies. 
The Late Robert Norman Thompson 
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
Dr. Bob, as he was known, was a member of the Order of Canada. 
Education was an integral part of Dr. Bob's life. 
Aside from education, his other great passion in life was politics. 
Robert, or Dr. Bob, was not one of those. 
Robert Thompson, the person, can be defined in two words: integrity and compassion. 
He was a man of values. 
Moncton, New Brunswick to Host Summit in 1999 
Hon. Rose-Marie Losier-Cool :
The Acadians have many reasons to be proud. 
In the Globe and Mail of this past Tuesday, November 18, journalist Jeffrey Simpson noted: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
They are accompanied by Her Excellency the Deputy Commissioner of the Bahamas.  
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration

Legal and Constitutional Affairs 
Notice of Motion to Authorize Committee to Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Tuesday next, November 25, 1997, I will move: 
Notice of Motion to Authorize Committee to Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
Hon. M. Lorne Bonnell :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable Senator Kinsella, did you wish to take the floor?  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Why did you not do it yesterday? 
This is not a debate.  
I am answering a question that was asked by a member. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Nevertheless, I will take his question and look at it.  
However, the honourable senator may have a point, and I shall look into it.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition :
Honourable senators, my question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I thank the leader for his response.  
Statement of Prime Minister on Presumption of Innocence-Government Position 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Corporal Niebudek is quoted as follows: 
However it was leaked doesn't matter. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
It is a member of the RCMP who is making these serious charges.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The government would not ask the RCMP to cut short an investigation.  
It would ask them to extend it.  
That is not the honourable senator's question.  
This would amount to political interference in an active criminal investigation.  
Is that the policy of the Canadian government?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I said that it would be finalized prior to the conference. 
They issued a joint statement to which my honourable friend has referred. 
The final position of the Government of Canada has not yet been arrived at.  
Quebec said you were not going far enough.  
Do I take it that this press release is incorrect, then?  
Do not confuse them before. 
Wait for Bill Clinton.  
The government will have a final position before it goes to Kyoto.  
And who is to pay for it?  
The precise compliance mechanisms are still an open issue. 
You can use the flying Taj Mahal to get there.  
Is that the policy of the Government of Canada?  
May I have a definitive answer to that question?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I do not know if that is even achievable. 
However, it is my understanding that that would be a goal, and a worthwhile one.  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver:
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the legislation will come to this chamber, of course. 
At the appropriate time, honourable senators will be entitled to move their own amendments.  
I could never guarantee that honourable senators would not be subject to time allocation. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
To man these ships, some 19 Sea King detachments are required. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I am not aware of that. 
The honourable senator has raised a very important question. 
That certainly includes Sea King helicopters.  
Honourable senators, I would be happy to determine that number. 
I regard this as a very serious matter. 
I will make the appropriate representations.  
As soon as possible? 
That is a major retreat, honourable senators. 
"In the very near future" means 44 days. 
What does "as soon as possible" mean?  
You will remember our former colleague Senator Frith. 
Well, today is day 46! 
Get on with the answer!  
How about next week?  
Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II 
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate:
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Failure of Finance Minister to Reduce Premiums-Request for Answer 
I will quote Senator Meighen, who said: 
It has been 51 days!  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
I have not yet received an answer. 
Is there a possibility that I will receive an answer to that question soon? 
The regulations are now being reviewed in committee in the other place. 
This information would be valuable at this point in time.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Demolition of Government Laboratories-Possibility of Restoration of Funding-Government Position 
They have done such things as install fibre optic cable to enhance their operations. 
Now we are spending another $500,000 to knock the buildings down.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Perhaps a miracle is in the works.  
Delayed Answers to Oral Questions 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Formal Treasury Board submissions for this program will be made in the very near future. 
The Reserve Force Compensation Get Well Program proposes that: 
b. Specialist Pay be introduced for Non-Commissioned Members. 
It will be based on equivalent regular force pay scales in specialist fields. 
Approximately 500 reservists in 19 trades will be affected; 
The majority of reservists are paid through the RPSR. 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Eric Arthur Berntson on October 28, 1997)

Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, I rise on a point of order. 
They are inherent and necessary to the functions of Parliament.  
Honourable senators, a bill is not just a particular form of procedure. 
Honourable senators, Bill C-16 has been presented under threat. 
I do not know the total number for the country. 
Feeney was convicted of second degree murder by a judge and jury. 
This judicial activism is a political power seeking dominion and sovereignty. 
They overturned the law that law enforcement personnel have obeyed loyally. 
That was May 1997. 
The most evident of these powers is the legislative powers and functions. 
In this Donahoe decision, Justice Beverley McLachlin ruled that: 
In concurring, Chief Justice Antonio Lamer wrote: 
Chief Justice Lamer continued in Donahoe that: 
Chief Justice Lamer added: 
Honourable senators, now to the Senate's position in the Donahoe case. 
Senator Charbonneau wrote in his factum: 
Senator Charbonneau insisted that: 
Mills v. The Queen, [1986] ... per McIntyre J. ... 
In Regina v. Feeney , his opinion has now prevailed. 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Therefore, an extension was reasonable at that time.  
Those translations were, in fact, done. 
However, time was required.  
That is what has been given by the Supreme Court of Canada in this case. 
They have not forced the Parliament of Canada to do something. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
It is a serious issue and a serious point of order. 
I am sorry, Your Honour, that I cannot be more helpful. 
In our system, what is sovereign is the Constitution. 
Who interprets the Constitution? 
The Canadian Parliament is also sovereign in its field. 
It cannot be prevented from passing legislation. 
This is very clear, there is absolutely no debate about it.  
There are precedents for this. 
I believe that the Court has remained within the limits of its powers.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Do any other honourable senators wish to speak to the point of order?  
Senator Carstairs mentioned that the Supreme Court has declared a law invalid. 
Senator Cools is quite right. 
I should have said, "a practice of police forces throughout the country."  
Honourable senators, there are no precedents for what has happened here. 
It is quite a different state of affairs. 
I have all the documents here if anyone is interested in them.  
Let me make it abundantly clear. 
The dissenting judgment of Madam L'Heureux-Dube should be read by all senators.  
That is beyond my comprehension.  
Hon. Philippe Deane Gigantes :
It has declared that a certain practice is unconstitutional. 
It cannot force Parliament to pass a law. 
It says, "We are giving some time for this practice to be changed. 
If you do not want to change it, that is okay. 
This is perfectly clear. 
I do not see any point of order.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I have listened carefully, honourable senators, to the arguments presented. 
I have listened because that is one of my main obligations.  
That is totally outside my field of jurisdiction.  
My responsibility is to deal with the rules of the Senate. 
I have looked over the bill carefully. 
The procedure followed has been the normal procedure according to our rules.  
It is not for me to go behind this matter. 
I confess that I see no threat here. 
There is no threat in the way in which it has come to us. 
I find that no rule has been broken. 
What has been said behind it is not for me to judge.  
Therefore, I ask Honourable Senator Moore to proceed with his speech on second reading.  
Hon. Wilfred P. Moore :
Since May 22, things have been happening. 
Responses to these proposals were requested before September.  
The court granted a six-month stay, which will expire on November 22, 1997. 
Such sentiments were expressed in the other place. 
Nevertheless, the bill was passed in one week in the other place. 
On motion of Senator DeWare, for Senator Nolin, debate adjourned.

Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
