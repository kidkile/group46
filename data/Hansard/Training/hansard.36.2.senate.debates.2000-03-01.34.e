The Senate met at 1:30 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
The Estimates, 2000-01 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I give notice that tomorrow, Thursday, March 2, I will move: 
That a message be sent to the House of Commons to acquaint that House accordingly.  
Notice of Motion to Extend Term of Appointment 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I give notice that tomorrow, Thursday, March 2, I will move: 
Agriculture and Agri-Food 
Farm Crisis in Prairie Provinces-Response of Government 
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
With present commodity prices, there will be a tremendous fallout for farmers. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
This imbalance is not a recent development. 
Our farmers have been competing against it and have done so successfully in most cases. 
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
Honourable senators, a number of options are available. 
In agricultural circles, we used to use a five-year income average. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I have done that and will continue to do so. 
Long-Term Benefits to Taxpayers 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Therefore, I have asked for further information. 
I should be able to provide it by this time tomorrow.  
The information I received was for 12 months forward from the date of the budget. 
I do not know whether the honourable senator was referring to the next calendar year.  
I should be able to have that information for the senator tomorrow.  
As my son said, "I can't keep my feet from dancing." 
He is so happy about that.  
Very few people pay income tax that way. 
Most people pay on a calendar basis. 
I am sure I can get the information for the senator.  
Increase in Fuel Prices 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, increased oil and gasoline prices are a matter of concern to the government. 
I will certainly pass along the honourable senator's suggestion. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
That must be taken into account when calculating the gross amount of reductions.  
Over the next little while, we will try to clarify the situation.  
It is not a tax." 
I have not seen the detailed breakdown.  
Those premium reductions will be welcomed wherever they are found.  
Level of Emergency Preparedness forCrisis Situations Around the World 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, today is a special day. 
I am celebrating the fourteenth birthday of my great nephew. 
The continent that appears always to be the worst hit is Africa.  
That country has only a few helicopters. 
However, if there was a war in that country, the response would be different.  
Honourable senators may remember hours of debate on the war in Iraq. 
Honourable senators, why is it so difficult to mobilize the world? 
I am not being partisan when I say that. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
In many ways, we have a similar situation. 
Mozambique-Effect of Floods on Political Situation 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Honourable senators, I believe Senator Prud'homme's point is very timely. 
I think we can help in a more constructive way. 
We do not help by asking if there will be a flood in Mozambique. 
I am pleased to see CIDA doing just that. 
Mozambique came into its new state of democracy from a bloody civil war. 
It has been one of the bright spots in Africa but a very tenuous one. 
That is a very good suggestion.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Transitional Jobs Fund-Grants to PLI Environment Ltd. 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
The documents do not reveal why the additional $846,000 was awarded. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
However, I do not have at hand the details that he seeks. 
They have done that, but I am not sure to what extent.  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the RCMP is investigating that particular file. 
I already know that. 
What is the documentation involved in the study? 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I will have members of my staff check on that matter.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I was afraid that that would be the answer. 
I am only one senator here initiating debate. 
Everyone will then take it seriously.  
Allocation for Canada Health and Social Transfer Program 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
In the upcoming fiscal year, they will reach an all-time high.  
The tax points will increase in value, as will the total major transfers. 
They continue to rise in 2001-02, in 2002-03, and in 2003-04. 
Let us try a new option.  
Honourable senators, that is a good question. 
Whose side are you on?  
That view is held by some, but definitely not held by others. 
That in itself is illustrative of the value of those tax points.  
That debate is likely to continue for some time. 
Not before the next election, anyway.  
Delayed Answer to Oral Question 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
I should like now, honourable senators, to table a corrected version of that response.  
Clarity Bill-Divisibility of Provinces 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Lowell Murray on February 23, 2000) 
Leave having been given to revert to Notices of Motions: 
Hon. Peter A. Stollery :
Honourable senators, I give notice that, on Thursday March 2, 2000, I will move: 
Business of the Senate 
Point of Order-Speaker's Ruling 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I thank all those senators who took part in this most interesting debate. 
I come back to the points that were raised. 
I will read directly from the Debates of the Senate . 
...after Minister Stewart had been caught with her hand in the cookie jar.  
On page 672, Senator Angus said: 
I should like to refer honourable senators to Beauchesne's. 
I refer honourable senators to paragraph 486(1), which states: 
I remind honourable senators again as to the custom and practices of this house. 
We treat each other with respect. 
It may not be the best wording that could be used. 
It is not necessarily dishonest. 
I think there are different ways of interpreting that phrase.  
The cover-up is not working, honourable senators.  
Under that paragraph, we find the words "misleading" and "misled". 
There is no clear rule.  
That should not affect the way in which we function in this chamber.  
If I did take that authority, I would have no means of enforcing it. 
It is up to the chamber.  
The Speaker replied, "Order, please. 
Not only was it unparliamentary, but it was not nice." 
You really hit me in a soft spot."  
I leave it to Senator Angus.  
International Search or Seizure Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
This private bill was sponsored by Senator Pierre Claude Nolin.  
In Canada, Canadians are protected by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
It was not unreasonable to demand that they respect it. 
However, honourable senators, clearly, each case is different. 
On motion of Senator Hays, for Senator Cools, debate adjourned.  
Financing of Post-Secondary Education 
Hon. Lois M. Wilson :
Currently, the lack of funding is being felt in the classroom. 
This creates an accessibility issue with poorer students being disadvantaged.  
Let us look at Lakehead University in Thunder Bay. 
This includes 5,308 full-time graduate and undergraduate students. 
Lakehead University represents a strong economic engine for that part of Ontario. 
It boasts a forestry program unique to Canada. 
The last adjustment to corridors was done a decade ago. 
To date, this has not happened. 
Lakehead University, therefore, finds itself in an impossible situation. 
Further, there is the matter of research and development. 
The crisis will not automatically disappear in the near future. 
Indeed it will worsen. 
The time to act is now.  
On motion of Senator Hays, debate adjourned.  
Energy, the Environment and Natural Resources 
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
Honourable senators, this item has been on the Order Paper for some time. 
The minister was commencing that process as of that date. 
Consequently, this item is redundant. 
It was not mischievous. 
Otherwise, why would we put it on the Order Paper? 
That is not the case here. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I support what Senator Taylor has said. 
We had talked about it. 
She may wish another opportunity to speak to the matter.  
On motion of Senator Kinsella, debate adjourned.  
The highest court in the land dealt with this section in a few cases.  
Professor Magnet wrote the following about section 27 of the Charter: 
I had the good fortune to examine this issue in Cameroon. 
They, therefore, take precedence over collective, non-individual, responsibility. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Can my honourable friend comment on that? 
The constitutional amendment was adopted. 
A treaty does not change the law of the land in our country. 
We have administrative arrangements with the provinces. 
There is no doubt that we can adopt the treaty. 
Perhaps the honourable senator had something else in mind in his question. 
I am not sure. 
How can we have a treaty that encroaches on another jurisdiction? 
To implement the treaty, we follow the division of powers.  
If the Senate agrees to the treaty, it becomes the law of the land. 
In the past, these rights could be interpreted as coming under provincial jurisdiction. 
I am excluding civil property rights, which come under provincial jurisdiction.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I am sorry to interrupt. 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
It is difficult to answer that question briefly. 
Signing an international treaty leaves us with a moral obligation to legislate.  
Let us take the example of denominational rights. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Clerk Authorized to Pay Witness Travel Expenses 
Committee Authorized to Engage Services 
Hon. Jack Austin , pursuant to notice of February 29, 2000, moved: 
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
