The House met at 10 a.m. 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
I do not believe there is any need for leave. 
(Motion agreed to and bill read the first time) 
BILL C-410 AND BILL C-411 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have the pleasure to introduce a motion. 
That bill deals with changes to the names of 19 federal electoral districts.  
I thank the hon. member for the explanation.  
I can answer the question. 
The bills are not normally read. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
Do we have unanimous consent to revert to petitions?  
Mr. Speaker, I will try to pay closer attention in the future.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have three petitions to present today.  
I will leave it with the House for comment.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
The motions will be grouped for debate as follows: 
Motions Nos. 1 to 5. 
Motions Nos. 7 and 8. 
The Chair will remind the House of each pattern at the time of voting.  
I will now put Motions Nos. 1 to 5 to the House.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ) moved: 
Hon. Martin Cauchon (for the Secretary of State (Parks)) moved: 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ) moved: 
That Bill C-29, in Clause 9, be amended 
( a ) by replacing line 1 on page 7 with the following: 
(1) Notwithstanding section 9 of the Depart-'' 
( b ) by adding after line 8 on page 7 the following: 
Hon. Martin Cauchon (for the Secretary of State (Parks)) moved: 
``(4) The Chief Executive Officer may dele-'' 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ) moved: 
Motion No. 1 reads as follows: 
It was this point in particular that people raised.  
9.(1) Notwithstanding section 9 of the Depart- 
The difference can be fairly significant, but sometimes a response can be a while coming. 
I think this is important. 
Mr. John Godfrey (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
I begin with the first motion that was just proposed. 
We oppose this amendment, because we feel it is redundant. 
Contracting limits and procedures are clearly set out in these regulations.  
This section replaces former subsection 12(4). 
It provides certainty that a round table will occur at least every two years. 
It also says that the recommendations will be responded to in a timely fashion. 
That takes me to Motion No. 4 in which we are proposing: 
``(4) The Chief Executive Officer may dele-'' 
That simply makes it possible.  
I think that covers the group.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
It is different from what I am used to. 
I find it quite interesting so please bear with me.  
I support Motion No. 1 put forth by my hon. colleague from Rimouski-Mitis. 
For this reason I support the motion.  
Consultation is only one aspect of it. 
Therefore I agree with Motion No. 2. 
Therefore I support this motion as well.  
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Motions Nos. 2 and 4 have been grouped together. 
That is not wise. 
The remaining motion in Group No. 1 is Motion No. 3. 
I support the intent of Motion No. 5. 
There is no existing requirement in the bill to do that.  
I have covered all the motions in Group No. 1.  
Is the House ready for the question?  
The question is on Motion No. 1. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The recorded division on Motion No. 1 stands deferred.  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
The next question is on Motion No. 3. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The recorded division on Motion No. 3 stands deferred.  
Mr. Speaker, I would just like a clarification because everything is going so quickly. 
That is what he did.  
Our document refers to Motion No. 5. 
The document has been changed. 
Mr. Speaker, we do not have the same documents. 
Yet, these are documents supplied by the Table. 
Perhaps we could settle the matter this way. 
Will that solve the problem for everybody?  
I think that will solve the problem.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ) moved: 
(4) The Governor in Council may, by regulation, define the expression ``local residents''.''  
Clause 23 reads as follows: 
We would therefore like the following added as a third paragraph: 
(4) The Governor in Council may, by regulation, define the expression ``local residents''.  
A number of us are really very concerned. 
They used to get in for free. 
Mr. John Godfrey (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are against this amendment. 
We certainly have nothing against local communities.  
Such incentives usually benefit local people the most.  
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
My first job was with Parks Canada. 
I am in a good position to talk about entrance fees. 
My job at the Kouchibouguac National Park was at the park entrance. 
These people used to live in the park.  
We know it was not the money. 
Money clearly was not what would make people leave. 
Today it costs a fortune to get into a park. 
One must wonder for whom the parks were created. 
I have seen people doing just that when I worked at the entrance. 
Nature and conservation are therefore suffering.  
We must step back and look at what is going on. 
Why are jobs guaranteed for only two years? 
There is no reason to make our employees feel insecure.  
The work has to be done. 
People expropriated to make room for the parks can no longer afford to go there. 
Hundreds of thousands of people come to visit our parks. 
Who has access to parks these days? 
We must give back to these people the access that they enjoyed before. 
The problem is one of lost access. 
Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay-Okanagan, Ref.):
We always like to keep a challenge for the Chair.  
This is the way this place works. 
We have already seen this. 
That is one of the ironies of debate in this House.  
That is really unfortunate. 
I hope they try to recognize that something should be done. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
I think it is only fair that these people have access to the place. 
Government members have already stated they would vote against this motion. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
That is good enough for me. 
Often this takes place in a national or provincial park.  
I think that is an unwise motion and I would vote against it.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The recorded division on Motion No. 6 stands deferred.  
We will now proceed to the motions in Group No. 3.  
Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard-La Prairie, Lib.) moved: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I assure you that my hon. colleague is quite correct. 
However, it was put into the bill anyway.  
My daughter and her family ranch right up against it.  
I have often gone through state and national parks in the United States. 
With the drought situation in that area right now, that may well become a factor.  
They would be eliminated because this has been injected into this bill.  
Why do we do this? 
It is absolute nonsense.  
Where it is necessary, let us follow the example. 
Not many roads are being built anywhere in Saskatchewan right now. 
What would they do? 
I suppose they would import one. 
This is why I strongly support my colleague's motion.  
I think the government itself knows this is wrong. 
Where it is necessary, use it. 
Please do not let this motion die. 
I certainly look forward to supporting it.  
Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard-La Prairie, Lib.):
I am sorry, but this is not the way this country was built. 
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
I was part of that debate when the amendment was put forward regarding the parks.  
I also sit on the official languages committee. 
It means the same thing for the francophone and bilingual positions.  
They are trying to gain points with it. 
It is unfortunate that Reformers do that but they do. 
Today it is on language. 
I certainly do not support the motion. 
That is all we did. 
We have enough problems already, we do not want to add to them.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Nothing is compromised by doing so.  
It was pointed out, for instance, that all the proceedings in Nagano were in English. 
I was told the same thing everywhere I went. 
This is merely a precaution. 
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, these are the simple facts of the matter. 
There were four and a half pages explaining the reasons why.  
How much more plain and simple can it be?  
She makes about five points there. 
I will summarize the effect of what she is saying.  
There is no arguing that and there is no denying it.  
Subjecting contractors and subcontractors to it does not make any sense.  
Clearly the hammer from the justice minister came down. 
She said that we were not going to go through with this. 
What did they do? 
It is poor legal draftsmanship. 
That is the type of leadership we are getting.  
We are going to have a bill with absolutely useless wording in it. 
The Liberals are doing it because they are in a jam. 
It means that if you do not have to say it, do not say it. 
We do not have to be excessively redundant. 
It is just political wrangling.  
Canadians deserve better than that. 
They cannot even accept that. 
I certainly hope that Canadians see it for what it is.  
Mr. John Godfrey (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
The amendment concerns services which are involved in direct contact with the public. 
That is all it does. 
It provides greater certainty. 
Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay-Okanagan, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, it is an interesting debate. 
I hope the Bloc will listen to this. 
It is English and it is Russian. 
We have a very large number of Russian Doukhobor people whose heritage we celebrate. 
It does not create division. 
It makes our area richer because we work together.  
It would apply to everybody. 
There is a clause in the bill that is unacceptable. 
Now we have two amendments. 
I will read for the hon. member the government's motion. 
Maybe he has not read it clearly enough.  
The Official Languages Act is already there.  
Now we are getting down to that grey area. 
We have somebody painting the fence. 
Is that communication with the public? 
The fact is that it could be interpreted that way. 
Maybe the member who is chuckling over there thinks that would not happen. 
Realistically, how should it be dealt with? 
Keep it as simple as possible. 
We support taking it out. 
That is not knocking the people of Quebec. 
They can only hire a fully bilingual person to do it. 
Maybe it is so when you curse that you are an equal opportunity curser. 
We are not saying that they cannot speak French. 
Did the government even stop to think of what the costs would be?  
It should not have been in there in the first place. 
The minister even said that. 
Simply do what the minister said in the first place. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, to continue on the general trend, in fact it is worse than that.  
The member who just spoke actually summarized it very well.  
That is what we are debating today. 
There was a royal botch-up. 
It should not have happened. 
The amendment should never have been brought in. 
It is a waste of time. 
The chairman of the official languages committee, Patrick Gagnon, was defeated in the last election. 
It is not the job of the committee to look at that. 
That was another silly, frivolous type of investigation. 
Are we going to bring the language police on to Sparks Street?  
They do not like it but that can be taken for what it is worth. 
There is an anomaly that points out a bit of hypocrisy on their part. 
That is why we have translators. 
That is why we have interpreters. 
That is why motions are put in both languages and so on. 
This is typical of a place that should be and is bilingual. 
But a strange thing happened. 
When we did that we made some subtle and some not so subtle changes. 
There were other changes, not least of which was an attitudinal change. 
When the Reform Party was there the signs on all our doors were bilingual. 
Why did they do that? 
Why would they try to put one language only? 
I would not do that in this institution. 
This is a bilingual institution. 
But they did it.  
Bloc members are in favour of this Liberal amendment. 
I have seen that we provide services in many languages as need requires. 
I have seen tour guides speaking Japanese and Chinese. 
We host the nation in these parts. 
I hope they will but I will not hold my breath. 
This tries to fix it in a poor management style in terms of legislation. 
I am worried they are setting a precedent. 
What are we going to have? 
It should never have been there. 
The government would be wiser to cut its losses and to cut this clause. 
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
It very clearly expresses the concerns that we have on this issue. 
Agency normally requires that the agent represent the principal. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
I support the province of Manitoba and its bilingual policies. 
Canadians want straightforward discussions. 
They want straightforward action from parliament. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
A recorded division on Motion No. 7 stands deferred.  
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The vote is deferred until the end of the day on Monday.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
When shall the bill be read the third time? 
Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
First, there was overwhelming support for the proposed legislation in the North. 
Virtually everyone commended the bill for being balanced and thorough.  
Second, time is of essence. 
Nunavut draws not on the past but on the future. 
He had this to say about his vision of Nunavut: 
That is the will and the desire of Inuit in Nunavut.  
Bill C-39 also clarifies some existing provisions of the Nunavut Act. 
Bill C-39 accomplishes this. 
Bill C-39 also introduces consequential amendments to other acts. 
This must happen for Nunavut to succeed''.  
It now falls to this House to respond accordingly. 
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
We certainly wish them well in their endeavours.  
There were errors in the description even of the boundaries. 
There were gores and overlaps all along the boundaries. 
There is one glaring oversight which the Leader of the Official Opposition spoke about. 
That is the matter of how the senator for the territory is to be selected.  
Is that not the way it should be?  
This type of thing will only increase in frequency and will spread to other provinces.  
I believe the Prime Minister and the government really have only two options. 
The first is really twofold. 
Hope springs eternal in the human heart. 
The Chair finds the amendment to be in order. 
Debate is on the amendment.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this is a great amendment and very timely.  
They have given up on the place. 
I accept the principle that the larger provinces have the larger sway in this place. 
There are 103 members from Ontario. 
That is as it should be. 
What about the more sparsely populated regions of the country? 
Who looks after their interests in this place? 
That is his or her job. 
It used to be an exalted place. 
That is really unfortunate.  
Now is the perfect time to initiate change. 
Nunavut by and large is inhabited by aboriginal people. 
Would that not be a good and healthy step toward democratizing the other place? 
I think it would be a grand and wonderful step.  
It is actually building the structures there right now. 
This would allow those people to say let us see if it makes a difference. 
Here is a tiny first step. 
There is only one but there is one. 
Mr. Waters went to the Senate. 
He was a very self-disciplined man. 
He gave the keep on marching orders as he went into the Senate. 
Other things can be done with the Senate. 
The ex-senator, past senator or whatever he is should move on.  
His offices are available. 
In fact, they are doing their job representing my region''. 
That is just not good enough.  
A poll could be done. 
There could be a questionnaire but that is not even necessary. 
Alberta is going to hold a similar election this fall to select people. 
That would be a wonderful thing for them and this institution. 
It needs something positive in that place.  
It would set a precedent. 
Their responsibility would then be to the people and not to the prime minister.  
Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):
Nunavut means ``our land'' in Inuktitut, the language of the Inuit. 
Labrador borders it on the extreme southeast. 
It requires a lot of preparation and, I would say, negotiation. 
However, it must also be said that the history of the Northwest Territories is complex. 
We have nothing against the representation of Nunavut per se. 
Otherwise, my party will make it its duty to hound them about this important issue.  
Among them are Washat and Maliothenam.  
I demand the government keep its word. 
I ask this government whether it is going to contribute the $700,000 or not? 
Will it honour its commitment? 
So, I say to the government ``You promised things. 
Give them the $700,000''.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
I applaud their efforts with all sincerity. 
This trip to the north was quite an eye opener for me. 
It was very interesting to see the beautiful yet rugged terrain of the north.  
There are many challenges to be faced by the people in the north.  
We also saw a number of very positive things happening. 
There is a lot of excitement around the creation of Nunavut. 
There is a lot of expectation in the air. 
In conclusion, I am very pleased to be able to support the bill. 
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
It has had many hurdles along the way.  
Finally, the report recommended the transfer of federal programs to the territorial government. 
These recommendations were acted upon in the following years.  
The capital of this new region will be Iqaluit on Baffin Island. 
This amendment will eliminate any uncertainty in that area as well.  
This legislation helps to ensure that this will occur. 
There are concerns as to whether the infrastructure is going to be in place. 
Will financial assistance be provided? 
Will there be enough of it? 
Inuktitut will be the working language for them. 
It may be difficult to find people to staff all of these new positions. 
Furthermore, it is questionable whether the infrastructure will be in place at that time. 
This is a great concern. 
Nunavut will have a public government with Inuit and non-Inuit representatives. 
I believe this is an amendment the Nunavut people have not asked for. 
It is a feeble attempt to delay this particular piece of legislation. 
It does nothing for the Nunavut people.  
We agree in principle with this legislation. 
It attempts to rectify some omissions in the Nunavut Act. 
There are quite a number of challenges facing these people. 
We will be watching with interest because the clocking is ticking away.  
Is the House ready for the question?  
The question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
And the bells having rung: 
Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
I will do this again.  
The grain industry is changing rapidly in order to respond. 
It continues to contribute very significantly to the building of our economy. 
This industry is growing tremendously. 
Our government intends to be the catalyst for partnerships with industry stakeholders. 
I believe we are succeeding in our goal. 
Bill C-26 is proof of our commitment to rural Canada. 
Current regulations are seen to be unnecessarily punitive, offering minimal deterrent value. 
The proposed amendments contained in the bill would accomplish five main objectives.  
They would introduce a producer funded insurance plan. 
After deducting an administration fee the commission would forward the premiums to the insurer. 
The cost of the levy is proposed to be 38 cents per $100 of sales. 
The levy would be the sum of the insurance premium and administrative charges. 
Producers could choose to opt out of the insurance program. 
The plan has to be administratively efficient to keep costs down for producers. 
I close my speech by talking about the potential impact the bill would have. 
It employs approximately thirty people during peak periods.  
They provide valuable services to the local rural community. 
I encourage all members of the House to support it.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Special crops are of growing importance in western Canada. 
For this reason we are generally in favour of Bill C-26.  
The standing committee on agriculture heard from organizations that represent special crops growers. 
Both these recommendations make good sense to our caucus. 
The nature of these check offs has been a controversial aspect of the bill. 
Government members had no solid explanation as to why the plan required mandatory features. 
Bill C-26, despite its shortcomings, is by and large a good piece of legislation. 
On balance, it is worthwhile legislation. 
The major commodity groups support it and our caucus will be supporting it as well.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton, Lib.):
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
They were trail blazers. 
I thank Al, Leonard, Ed and Carol for their many years of service.  
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
The board fails to report these activities in its annual report to farmers. 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
The same applies to Ontario.  
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
Two Hercules refuelling aircraft have returned to their base in Winnipeg. 
Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
The emphasis has been on the core area from Windsor to Quebec City.  
The hon. member for Wentworth-Burlington.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
The Reform Party has a similar millennium bug. 
They should encourage their delegates to do nothing. 
Let the millennium bug bite.

Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
This is what happened in Lachute.

Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, tobacco claims the lives of 40,000 Canadians every year. 
NELSON A. BOYLEN COLLEGIATE INSTITUTE 
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Welcome to Ottawa, students.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
We all understand that inaction on this matter kills. 
Together we can build a smoke free future for all of our children.  
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
These careless comments are unfortunate and distressing. 
We are so near. 
I urge all of us to continue to work together.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, unfortunately the situation in South Asia continues to deteriorate. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the question. 
I deplore the decision by the Government of Pakistan to proceed with the tests. 
The hon. member for Fraser Valley.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
It is a very sad development but the tests have been done. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Canada has always tried to maintain peace between the two countries.  
For now, we just have to wait and see. 
We regret this and we also regret- 
The hon. member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
It has opposed it from the beginning. 
What about those with HIV through the blood system?  
He asked the Minister of Immigration to close the borders. 
This is sheer hypocrisy.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is sheer undiluted nonsense. 
They pick and choose those to whom they award their political compassion.  
They are the embodiment of insincerity. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Is this what the member is saying?  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
This is what I object to.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The member says he is not referring to the same people as we are. 
students and poor families. 
Who does the leader of the Bloc Quebecois speak for?  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
It has been committed, but will be spent between now and March 31.  
So, that is $2.7 billion from the employment insurance fund.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
We have been doing just that all week.  
These studies reminded the minister that the 1994 reform has cost the unemployed heavily.  
Like everyone, the minister knows that a substantial surplus has been accumulated. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I think he did not get the whole picture.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:
There are some very positive aspects- 
The leader of the Democratic Party.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
What is the minister waiting for?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
The leader is making an example for the House of exactly that approach.  
The people who take it can take it with confidence for that reason.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. 
Finally, when will the government account to the taxpayers of Canada for these expenses?  
It is a pretty general question. 
The hon. House leader.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
My colleagues, I am not sure where the questions are going. 
We will have to keep it to the administrative responsibility of the government.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
A case was raised now without mentioning it. 
My colleagues, here is the dilemma that I have. 
I think I am going to rule both of you out of order.  
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will shift gears here for a minute. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
It is real money. 
In my opinion that is real money.  
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the real money is in a surplus. 
He is being called out by his friends as well as by his opponents. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not think that the choices are tough at all. 
I do not find that a difficult choice. 
I find that good government. 
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Five years of inaction has resulted in the current situation.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
They cannot interfere in a state jurisdiction.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this is more than just a concern. 
He has the Strangway report. 
He has the facts. 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
This is completely regrettable. 
We said so in Birmingham and we are saying it again in the House today.  
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I think that Canada has set a good example. 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
It is out of order. 
The hon. member for Mercier.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
The Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the minister responsible for infrastructure. 
Will the government commit to keeping this level of participation?  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the leadership of the Canadian military continues to be in serious trouble. 
Over the last couple of years four generals have left the forces in disgrace. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
We believe in a fair process. 
Let us allow that fair process to take place.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this issue is of national importance. 
It is a top general in our armed forces.  
Surely the minister can tell us today what specific allegation is being investigated.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there has been no charge laid against anyone. 
They have a right to maintain their privacy. 
They have a right to presumption of innocence. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
My question to the Minister of Finance is very simple. 
To whom belongs the surplus in the employment insurance fund?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member should tell us his choices. 
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I fail to understand what the member is referring to. 
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we treat all ridings the very same way. 
We welcomed all the projects submitted to us.  
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank my hon. colleague for his question. 
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the President of the Treasury Board. 
However, in the public sector we have started to put together groups of people. 
He has alluded to one. 
There is now one in every one of the most affected departments. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the Environment.  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the proposal we have is the action we are taking. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Perhaps he could discuss it with me at some other time.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Natural Resources.  
We have both a federal and a national secretariat to co-ordinate the activity. 
The plan is well under way and Canada will meet its commitments.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
Has the minister now changed his mind? 
BC MINE IN BLACK LAKE 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
This is precisely what the workers at the BC mine need.  
Otherwise, he might suffer the same fate as Mr. Young.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
But we have to see what else can be done.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
We will not have additional business beyond that point other than private members' hour.  
Next Monday shall be an allotted day. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
The motion reads as follows: 
Whereas the scheme has questionable support at the farm level, and 
The committee members from all parties actually supported some of the government amendments. 
This was an idea suggested by the Winnipeg Commodity Exchange.  
The WCE wants to access the hog industry. 
The Canadian Export Development Corporation, CEDC, would be the insurer.  
I conclude by saying that the PC party supports this bill. 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there agreement to proceed in this way?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.) moved: 
This is a classical sustainable development issue.  
It must be stressed that the issue is not new to us in Canada. 
How can we successfully achieve the Kyoto goals with this kind of perverse tax incentive?  
It would be patterned on the Toronto atmospheric fund established in 1992.  
The Canadian atmospheric fund needs start-up capital. 
This is a remarkable achievement.  
This will certainly cause a major and difficult problem.  
There are no mandatory fuel economy standards. 
In short, there is very little to write home about.  
This area requires particular attention.  
The secretariat needs to develop an integrated effort with all these departments.  
Second, reductions must be real and not merely reductions on paper. 
Third, reduction must be quantifiable and verifiable. 
Fourth, the system must be enforceable. 
There are limits to its value. 
In conclusion, we have already waited a long time. 
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Government cannot unilaterally establish a target. 
It must work with the provinces. 
That was the purpose of the Regina accord.  
Surely Canada's interests deserve more consideration than this.  
No wonder the provinces were up in arms. 
This was not a national position but a federal government initiative. 
The provinces have jurisdiction over their natural resources, including energy production. 
They have control over power generation, building codes and transportation. 
The federal government has jurisdiction over transboundary air pollution. 
At the same time, federal roles and responsibilities have not been made clear. 
There is no information on the results achieved from government actions.  
This should have been done before Canada signed the Kyoto agreement. 
The only studies that have been available are from external sources. 
These are examples of the magnitude of the deal signed at Kyoto. 
Such information is needed to make a sound cost-benefit decision.  
Canada's economic interests must be protected. 
Developing nations must be an integral part of the solution. 
A national consensus should be gained before international commitments are made. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
What is the situation now, after five years of Liberal government? 
But there is more. 
The list of this government's environmental failures at the international level continues. 
Let us take a look at Canada's role in these negotiations. 
Where was the Government of Canada? 
No one could tell. 
Who could be opposed to consultation?  
Unfortunately, this was not the case. 
In both cases it failed miserably at getting its vision across.  
The federal government has been aware of this situation since at least 1995. 
I refer to the report by the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
It is very timely. 
That was also a contention of the environment commissioner. 
Those have not started at all. 
I believe the Progressive Conservatives took that position. 
The only party that still will not take this test is the Reform Party. 
Its bottom line is still dollars, what it will cost.  
The provinces have to acknowledge that there will be costs. 
But the issue is one of transitional measures. 
As Canadians and as citizens of the world we should take this challenge. 
It should be taking the lead. 
Only one minister should take the lead on this issue for Canada. 
In seven years there is a measurable target we can take. 
Why are they not knocking on government department doors to be a conscience?  
We could do it this summer as a quick start initiative. 
We could send our youth to senior citizens homes. 
Let us challenge ourselves.  
Our railroads are the cleanest form of transporting goods in this country. 
It only connects the southern portion. 
We must reforest immediately the vast tracts of land which have been left bare. 
If man can cut the trees down, man can grow the trees. 
Let us be open with the media. 
A secretariat should be formed immediately and be open to the public. 
Nothing is going to be done about it. 
We know we have failed on that measure.  
We need the power of the Prime Minister behind this whole initiative. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
I was very honoured to be a member of his team during that debate.  
The other thing that drives our economy is export. 
A high proportion of our gross domestic product is exported. 
I read from the IPCC report issued in 1995. 
The science on climate change is from a practical perspective beyond dispute.  
To some degree this motion focuses on that as well.  
We need to start addressing some of the issues that are most important. 
It must be based on science. 
In this case it is. 
It is the government's role to actually enhance it. 
Those three things we should really focus on right from the start. 
We should move in that direction.  
There are many gains in terms of what would benefit our economy. 
We need that kind of involvement as well.  
I refer to the issue of acid rain. 
The Minister of Finance loves to talk about our record. 
I love to talk about our environmental record. 
I applaud the member for Davenport for continuing to add to this debate.  
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
As it stands now, six months later it is only 1% of the mark.  
The member for Churchill River made a very constructive intervention. 
He referred to the Bonn meeting, which is a good reminder. 
He spoke about transitional measures, a very interesting concept. 
There is a lot of potential in what he said.  
I conclude by thanking the member for Fundy-Royal. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
(The House adjourned at 4.14 p.m.)
