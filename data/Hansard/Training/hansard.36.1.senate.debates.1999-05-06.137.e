National Organ Donation Discussion Day 
That means that only half the people waiting for transplants last year actually got them. 
One in four people awaiting a donor will die before they get a transplant. 
That is about 150 people this year. 
Several factors are at the root of the problem. 
The information is then printed on the back of the card. 
Another problem lies with training of medical staff. 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Does the honourable senator have leave to continue?  
I thank honourable senators.  
The result of these shortcomings is missed opportunities to save lives. 
In this way, the organs could be used for transplantation without delay.  
Three times as many organs are being transplanted. 
Ninety per cent of Spaniards waiting for organs now receive them.  
The cornerstone of Spain's program has been training and awareness. 
We need to implement a similar training program in this country.  
We must act now. 
The Late Francis V. Baldwin 
Hon. Wilfred P. Moore :
Mostly, however, he was known for his passion for the game of basketball. 
Indeed, Frank Baldwin was "Mr. Basketball" in Nova Scotia. 
Bob Hayes, the legendary athletic director of Saint Mary's University said: 
Bruce Reynolds, president of Basketball Nova Scotia, said: 
The sport has lost a builder without parallel and a friend without parallel. 
It's a sad day for basketball.  
I'm sure he never left an enemy in the world. 
He was revered within the coaching community in Canada. 
He will be sorely missed and wonderfully remembered.  
A legend is gone.  
He was a giant of a man. 
Revision of Naval Service Act 
Hon. Calvin Woodrow Ruck :
At that point in time, Canada did not possess any ships of her own. 
The first rule explicitly stated, "All recruits must be members of the white race."  
It was allegedly revised at the end of hostilities in 1945. 
That is a major step forward.  
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration

Tenth Report of Committee Presented 
Thursday, May 6, 1999 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Canadian NATO Parliamentary Association 
Canada-China Legislative Association 
Report of Visit of Co-chairs Tabled 
Committee Authorized to Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Tuesday next, May 11, 1999, I will move: 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Is that an accurate statement? 
That is fairly clear. 
That is reported today, May 6. 
I'll be very happy to take that back to cabinet and back to Parliament.  
What is the government's position? 
Surely individual ministers are not devising Canadian policy and ignoring cabinet consultation. 
What would be the requirement? 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I am not aware that the government itself has undertaken specific measures. 
Shipbuilding-Development of National Policy- Government Position 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
That resolution was sponsored by the New Brunswick wing of the federal Liberal Party.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
That matter is under review.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, my question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I cannot answer that question with certainty. 
Increase in Tax Revenue- Influence on Deficit-Government Position 
The Honourable Leader of the Government also boasted about reducing the deficit. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Reduction of Employment Insurance Premium- Government Position 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The government has also cut benefits to allow the surplus to increase.  
Mr. Manley, in an interview with The Ottawa Citizen , made a number of comments. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I do not disagree with Mr. Manley. 
He has put his position forward. 
Does he agree or disagree with them? 
Can he tell us exactly what his government's tax policy entails?  
We have a better medicare system. 
As well, we have the best education system. 
We have low productivity and our children are leaving the country. 
Not if our dollar continues to go up.  
That is the ranking by KPMG. 
We are now ranked tenth.  
Thanks to Mike Harris!  
Honourable senators, my question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
If there is agreement of the Senate, I could read it.  
The statement reads as follows: 
w Immediate and verifiable end of violence and repression in Kosovo; 
w Withdrawal from Kosovo of military, police and paramilitary forces; 
The UCK is the liberation army. 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
I thank the government leader for that answer. 
I certainly would welcome the tabling of that document.  
Certainly that is a position which Canada is instrumentally placed to advance.  
We are now at another turning point in world history. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, that would be a suitable course in due time. 
There remains a great deal of difficult work to be done.

"( b ) describe the offence in respect of which the surrender is requested;" and 
( f ) by renumbering all cross-references accordingly."  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, the bill deals with extradition. 
Honourable senators, the right to life is a human right. 
That distinction is important in our debate. 
I would submit that the right to life is self-executory.  
So it is with the right to life. 
What did she say? 
Comments and questions have been helpful.  
These proposed amendments that are before us are serious, and they are technically complex. 
As honourable senators know, His Honour has undertaken to give further study to that issue. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Therefore I move, seconded by the Honourable Senator DeWare: 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt this motion?  
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
The committee has already opined negatively on the principles of the amendments. 
The Senate has now debated the amendments for three weeks at third reading. 
In fact, the Senate has acted as a virtual Committee of the Whole. 
This debate reminds me that sometimes the Senate can be a dangerous place. 
I could not agree more with the honourable senator. 
Senator Graham accused me of seeking perfection. 
However, the adage simply does not apply in this case. 
How will she decide? 
In which case will she exercise her discretion not to seek assurances? 
Who will live and who will die?  
In that instance he was referring to the extradition treaty.  
This is not a new concern. 
That decision then references the rather infamous Cotroni case.  
We are in ardent agreement with the ministry. 
They intend a different track in the future. 
Years could pass before that treaty is ratified. 
No one can give any assurances when it will be ratified. 
This bill, unamended, promises more of the same.  
It was just war crime legislation. 
Honourable senators, these amendments are about justice. 
In Deuteronomy , chapter 16, verse 20, we find these words: 
Justice, justice, shall ye follow.  
For over five millennia, commentators and sages attempted to interpret these words. 
"Why should the word justice be repeated twice?" 
Obviously, this is a personal matter for each senator. 
Should the amendments not carry, I will not support Bill C-40.  
Human rights rank above the rights of states. 
Human liberties constitute a higher value than state sovereignty. 
Honourable senators, do these amendments not lend themselves precisely to his thesis?  
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Would the honourable senator accept a question at this time?  
That is a possibility, but I do not believe it is a probability.  
It is a question of timing.  
We have the Charter at the international court. 
They are able to raise all the Charter-like protections. 
All those principles are incorporated into the international tribunal at The Hague now. 
Amnesty International, the Criminal Lawyers Association and the ministry all agree. 
On motion of Senator Lynch-Staunton, debate adjourned.  
State of Financial System 
Consideration of Report of Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee on Study-Debate Continued 
I apologize to honourable senators. 
I was away last week. 
We did not arrive at our recommendations lightly.  
The financial landscape will be very different in the 21st century.  
One of the more controversial aspects of the report was auto leasing. 
We listened to them and we tried to focus on the consumer. 
You can find that in the report. 
I will not read the whole of that to you because it was quite extensive.  
Our report is quite comprehensive. 
In this way, the consumer has a choice.  
It should be noted that banks do sell life insurance:
It is not something you wish to collect, like an annuity. 
It is something you wish to pay, and never collect. 
It is not a wealth management product. 
We are talking about banks here.  
I was tempted to copy his whole speech because it was well done. 
Honourable senators, the MacKay task force report was long overdue. 
Over the course of our study, we looked for a vision for the next century. 
Our response to the MacKay task force is the beginning of a vision. 
It is not what the MacKay task force recommended. 
It is certainly not something for which we on this side would wish.  
The role of the Senate is very important to studies of this kind. 
On motion of Senator Carstairs, for Senator Stewart, debate adjourned.  
Lack of Government Support-Inquiry- Debate Adjourned 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall rose pursuant to notice of May 4, 1999: 
I should like to describe briefly four measures that would almost immediately stimulate shipbuilding.  
Lease financing has become a predominant method of financing significant capital items. 
I will expand a bit on that a little later on.  
Four, make some changes to NAFTA. 
We should work towards eliminating this exemption.  
This could be done for every vessel constructed in Canadian shipyards. 
Shipyards suffer a very distinct disadvantage in this regard. 
We should also determine what needs to be done to upgrade existing schools. 
It will take a national commitment, and the lead must come from the federal government. 
I look forward to the interventions of other honourable senators in this debate. 
I suggest to you that it has a sense of timeliness right now. 
On motion of Senator DeWare, for Senator Bolduc, debate adjourned.  
Leave having been given to revert to Government Motions: 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, May 11, 1999, at 2:00 p.m.
