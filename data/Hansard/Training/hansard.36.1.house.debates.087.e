EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 87 
Friday, April 3, 1998 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
Tuktut Nogait also has many features that are of interest to the scientific community. 
Many explorers, including John Franklin, surveyed the coastline. 
And yet, Bill C-38 has not been passed.  
We will approve this bill in principle at second reading. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
I raised that issue on September 29, 1995. 
The Reform Party is supporting this legislation. 
That ultimately was cancelled once that region was turned into a park.  
Madam Speaker, I listened attentively to my hon. colleague's reply. 
He may have missed the point I was trying to make.  
It is a very real dilemma. 
We have to determine how far this development can go. 
All this will have to be closely examined in committee.  
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
New Democrats support Bill C-38. 
To date just over 60% of this goal has been completed. 
A great deal of work and political leadership is required to complete the vision. 
Elevated areas within the park's boundaries are designated as refugia. 
Protection of the hundreds of archeological sites is imperative. 
Visitors to the park will experience a pristine Arctic wilderness. 
Tuktut Nogait national park includes over 16,000 square kilometres. 
Nothing could be further from the truth for several reasons. 
The proposed deletion area is located in the Inuvialuit settlement area. 
The Sahtu Dene and the Gwich'in are opposed to the deletion. 
Is it the depressed metals markets? 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
I thank them for their contribution to the protection of Canada's ecological integrity.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
PENSION BENEFITS STANDARDS ACT, 1985 
Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
I will highlight the thrust of these amendments later.  
Examples of these sectors include banking, interprovincial transportation and telecommunications.  
These are two of the three pillars of retirement security for Canadians.  
Private pension plans represent that vital third pillar. 
As I stated earlier, these changes are long overdue. 
This also added to the challenges. 
In some cases insufficient contributions were made to fund these improvements.  
The range of powers and regulatory components needed are not there. 
Bill S-3 meets these challenges. 
I want to go into the basic principles. 
Regulation and supervision must be cost effective.  
I want to discuss the basic principles in more detail. 
The first principle helps us to focus on what pension plans are. 
They are really employee benefits.  
This should not necessarily mean that the plan be terminated. 
This leads to another closely related point.  
In a market economy some companies will inevitably encounter problems. 
This is simply business reality. 
Furthermore the supervisor must have a clearly defined role.  
This guide is similar to ones issued for financial institutions.  
I would like to move on to another aspect of this legislation. 
The government believes that action is necessary and needed to correct this situation. 
In addition, financial institutions would be responsible for administering the pension plan.  
The details of this regime will be introduced later through regulations.  
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
J. R. Shaw built a small family business into a true western success story. 
This House congratulates J. R. Shaw, a true Canadian entrepreneur.  
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
These symbols help bind us together as a nation.  
This year's theme is: ``Give Wildlife an Edge:
In communities throughout Canada people are involved with their environment. 
They donate their time to help wildlife and their habitats.  
CANADA-LEBANON PARLIAMENTARY FRIENDSHIP GROUP 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton, Lib.):
Volunteers have been working on millennium projects for over a year. 
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
Most of these issues have existed for over 50 years. 
Our veterans' concerns should not be a new millennium project.  
Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):
I am proud to note the impressive performance of two Canadian members.  
That is why this biennial competition is so important.  
GENERAL CHARLES DE GAULLE 
Such interference is absolutely outrageous.  
We are pleased with the French initiative. 
Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):
We wish the college a very successful open house.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Many measures will be required to remedy the financing problems of the CPP.  
SOCIETE SAINT-JEAN-BAPTISTE 
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
This sovereignist notion was also in the air during the 1970s. 
The silence from the sovereignists is a source of concern.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the situation in Cape Breton is becoming desperate. 
Honestly, that is all we are looking for. 
Is that too much for the people of Cape Breton to ask?  
O'NEILL COLLEGIATE CHOIR 
Mr. Ivan Grose (Oshawa, Lib.):
These students are members of O'Neill Collegiate's intermediate chamber choir. 
THE LATE ROB THOMPSON 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Even then his optimism and his sense of humour were very evident. 
These were the traits that helped him in the face of adversity. 
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
The Vriend decision was not about interpreting the Constitution. 
It was not about protecting rights. 
Abraham Lincoln said that the candid citizen must confess that if- 
The hon. member for Laurentides.  
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
Did Fulton-Favreau fail because of the ``nasty separatists''? 
Did Victoria fail because of the ``nasty separatists''? 
Were the failures of Meech and Charlottetown the fault of the ``nasty separatists''?  
That is why the only solution left is sovereignty.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the government does have compassion. 
The government is concerned. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is a reflection on compassion. 
He said ``We have to remember what this is about. 
Why did the health minister take his eye off that goal?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
B.C. has said that it is ready to move. 
Saskatchewan is now ready to have a conference call on the issue. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, every provincial government stands solidly behind this agreement. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is very simple. 
We, and most Quebeckers and other Canadians, support the Canadian option. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Is that what I am to understand from his response? 
It does not make any sense.  
Mr. John Godfrey (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have already answered all these questions many times. 
We have submitted over one hundred pages of responses. 
The matter is totally clear. 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, first, the question is based on false premises.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the Deputy Prime Minister's response is also based on false premises.  
Mr. John Godfrey (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
We then answered the questions asked.  
But we also have our own questions. 
This question should be put to the representatives of Mr. Parizeau in this House.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is woefully misinformed. 
They are solidly behind this deal. 
The hon. member should not cruelly raise- 
The hon. member for Halifax.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the minister can repeat his mantra. 
Is the minister now prepared to negotiate a new deal? 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member is simply wrong. 
We came to a conclusion as to the appropriate response. 
That is the responsibility of public officials.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
My question is for the Minister of Finance. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for giving me advance notice of the question.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the minister for his unusually succinct answer.  
When will the government respond to this recommendation?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We have again looked at the capital gains tax. 
The question is simply one of expense versus the cost.  
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
He believes it was an unforeseen tragedy. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the health minister is running out of excuses. 
Why the two tier standard?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
It looked at what happened. 
It is a sound principle. 
It is a principle accepted by every government in this country.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the principle is that when the government is negligent it should pay. 
Some people would call it malpractice. 
I call it just plain wrong.  
Why will the health minister not right this wrong? 
Why will he not compensate the victims?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
I rely, among others, on the Krever report in that connection.  
The hon. member refers to 1981. 
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is absolutely no connection between the two. 
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
His package is wrong. 
Other ministers of health in the provinces now know that too. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We looked at the history of the matter. 
We proceeded on what we believe is sound public policy.  
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Yesterday they went public asking for help. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, these questions have been asked repeatedly this week. 
He knows of the RCMP investigation. 
He knows of course of the province's inquiry. 
The hon. member for Wild Rose.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the government is ignoring the people. 
It is not the inquiry we are talking about. 
We are talking about the conditions on the reserve.  
I do not think she ran in the federal Liberal election.  
Chief Roy Whitney does not want an investigation. 
He is the close friend. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
This is the right thing to do.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
There is no question about that. 
It is referred to in the Krever chronology.  
They chose not to do so and the consequences were tragic. 
It is for that reason we have chosen that year.  
There is broad support in many circles for that approach. 
The hon. leader of the Progressive Conservative Party.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Veterans Affairs.  
Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for her question.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Why now are we failing to help those who gave us freedom? 
Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
We do recognize the need for sanctions. 
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
We will take his suggestion as representation.  
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
A study was carried out in order to identify those employees suited to learning French. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, for Health Canada, public safety is the bottom line. 
They will look at the science capacity in the department. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
This decision has had a serious impact on the hog industry in West Nova. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am answering on behalf of the minister of agriculture. 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank the hon. member for his question.  
Revenue Canada does have special programs especially at this time of the year. 
That is very commendable and it works well.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
This is exactly what Bruce Starlight's letter warned the minister about.  
The minister ignored Bruce Starlight's warning. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
That is why we have a commissioner of official languages.  
That concludes oral question period.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I ask that an order of the day be designated for consideration of the motion.  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):
FOOD AND DRUGS ACT 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions to present to the House today. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the second petition has to do with the family. 
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
The petition states the position of the group, which opposes the Multilateral Agreement on Investment. 
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the second petition contains 389 signatures.  
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions to present this morning. 
The cost for treating prostate cancer is very high.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
The first petition calls for a review and a revision of the Young Offenders Act. 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
Those questions have not been answered.  
There have been no responses to these questions and they are long overdue.  
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the department has tried to respond in a timely fashion. 
I will make note of the hon. member's concerns and pass them on.  
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
PENSION BENEFITS STANDARDS ACT, 1985 
Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
The details of this regime will be introduced later through regulations.  
I would like to move now to speak about reducing regulatory burden.  
OSFI has been participating in this development for upwards of two years now. 
This refocusing is consistent with the government's intention to further clarify OSFI's mandate. 
This is similar to the power in the financial institutions legislation.  
This bill does not specify that threshold. 
Those details will be provided in the regulations.  
Subsequently a range of experts was consulted on this proposal. 
Alternatives are being considered for achieving the same result. 
I will spend a couple of moments on the arbitration process for surplus assets. 
Many comments were received but not many concrete suggestions were made. 
The Senate was concerned about certain situations regarding plans in the wind-ups.  
We agree that this is a concern. 
As such, the original bill had a certain no man's land. 
The measures in this bill are the result of a broad consultation process. 
I have highlighted the important issues dealt with in this legislation. 
Of that we are confident.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
I will talk about some of the highlights of this bill under two main areas. 
The first area is that of administrative reductions. 
A new kind of simplified pension plan is also created under Bill S-3. 
This will be an added bonus for these small businesses. 
Some major changes include the following. 
In principle I support the bill, as does the official opposition. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
This is with particular reference to the members of the Bloc Quebecois.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
We agree with that. 
The point I am making is that these people are all very biased.  
These are all senators appointed by the Prime Minister.  
In fact, he is a former business associate of the Prime Minister.  
The Senate was set up by the Fathers of Confederation to represent the provinces. 
That was the original intent of our Senate. 
There is no accountability in that other place. 
By definition we feel all bills should originate in the House.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
The maritimes have 30 collectively. 
This is a major discrepancy and it is something that will take constitutional change. 
For example, electing a senator does not take constitutional change. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Canada's system of retirement income has three pillars. 
The bill before us updates that act.  
However, the bill is not particularly controversial. 
The legislation will help improve that process.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I would like to ask a question of my colleague who just spoke.  
Senate reform is another issue. 
It is arguable that there needs to be some significant Senate reform. 
It was under a Conservative government that Stan Waters was elected as a senator. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I will follow up on the issue raised by my colleague. 
That is a good point.  
In a democracy it is the people who rule. 
If we are to endorse a situation where the other place- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am afraid I have to interrupt at this point. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The purpose of the debate is not to question what has already happened. 
How can it be relevant to debate some procedures and not relevant to debate others?  
Citation 459(1) of Beauchesne's sixth edition states: 
Relevance is not easy to define. 
In borderline cases the Member should be given the benefit of the doubt- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
The bill amends an act that was brought into place some time ago. 
This is an important bill, not just in the federal jurisdiction. 
This is a very nice problem to have. 
The money is not there but the government will just get it from them. 
That is how our federal public pension plan has been managed.  
Obviously it should not just sit there for ever and ever. 
It needs to be allocated in some fair and reasonable manner.  
It would be nice to have that kind of return on our Canada pension plan. 
It is nice for them. 
But there always seems to be some tension.  
These questions in the past have been left to the courts to decide. 
The judicial part of our system does rule in these kinds of disputes.  
The employees were not too impressed with this so they went to court. 
The court ordered the owner of Dominion stores to return the funds to the employees. 
There are not many big pension plans in the country. 
The superintendent is supposed to make sure that the private pension plans are well funded. 
The courts decide who gets any surplus.  
Under these amendments, the role of the superintendent is broadened. 
The superintendent did not have this role before.  
We are going to be asking some questions about that.  
We have a responsibility to look into these matters and we will do that. 
We want to encourage modernization of some of the measures. 
As with many bills, we see some positive measures. 
That is a real concern. 
I urge other parties in the House to also look closely at this area.  
We will continue to study the bill during the committee hearings. 
Other issues may arise. 
However we have identified the main one. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Democracy really means rule by the people. 
We rule through the agent of our elected representatives.  
That totally flies in the face of the whole principle of democracy.  
It contravenes some of the most cherished traditions and values of our country.  
We will oppose the introduction of bills at every turn of the wheel.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak for a moment. 
That is probably a shock to a lot of people.  
I want to allude to the fact that the bill originated in the Senate. 
The senators are meeting with these people and I hope they are listening.  
Let us look at the types of legislation being put into place in the land. 
They want their elected officials to do that task. 
That is what we were elected for.  
I agree fully with their comments. 
The House can expect support from this side. 
Our only objection would be to the origination of the bill.  
I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The bill addresses some of the very real concerns of parents. 
Our families are the building block of society. 
Children are our nation's future.  
Our children are a most precious resource as they are our future. 
If we protect our children we are protecting the future of Canada.  
Reformers are concerned about the safety of our children. 
This could effectively be achieved when Bill C-284 is passed.  
Let us look at the mechanics of our current legal system in this regard. 
The individual has still committed the offence.  
Very few are denied. 
With that background let us go back now to Bill C-284. 
I hear one member saying that makes good sense. 
These are the concerns of Bill C-284.  
Why is Bill C-284 necessary? 
Essentially it sends a message that protecting our children is paramount. 
It would be good for both the offender and of course for the children.  
If no appropriate application is made, then no disclosure is given.  
Overall the bill is important for the protection of our children.  
Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
However, in recent years, violent crime has declined. 
This is the least we can do as legislators.  
For example, geographical location is a factor. 
More violent crime occurs in urban centres than in the country.  
Extraordinary incidents occur with some tragic unfortunate results.  
Piecemeal legislation change is not a solution to the problems perceived.  
I believe Bill C-284 is too narrow in its focus and too punitive. 
The law must be fashioned to accommodate a range of offenders in any given category. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of Bill C-284. 
These are tragic and disturbing figures. 
I share the view of those who believe that rehabilitation is a laudable goal. 
On balance it is far too important. 
Let us support our families and the safety of our children. 
Let us do it and let us do it quickly.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Bill C-284 has all the elements that make excellent legislation. 
First of all it is based on common sense. 
This legislation is also simple and direct. 
Finally this bill is reasonable and fair. 
That means 99% are pardoned. 
The possibility of this happening is very high and very real. 
They are so very sensitive to the newest theories in criminal rehabilitation. 
I believe Canadians want the law to place children first. 
We have dared to bring these preventable crimes to light.  
We all know it happens. 
We all read the newspapers and watch television. 
Let us take the example of a nursery school. 
That is certainly not the fault of the police. 
It is the fault of the law. 
It is obvious that we need to remedy this horrifying oversight.  
I believe Bill C-284 is the ideal solution. 
At the same time the bill offers a reasonable approach.  
This fairness can be seen in the following example. 
Again I will refer to my nursery school scenario.  
He requests, and is granted, a pardon for his assault conviction.  
Just how much of a risk do children face? 
This study also found that pedophiles had the highest rate of sexual recidivism.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
For that he should be congratulated.  
Let me talk for a few moments about the Criminal Records Act. 
There are some possibilities which have to be explored.  
It held formal meetings between March and November 1967. 
That justice committee report came back to the House. 
The government at the time proceeded with a study of the initiative. 
The principal issues obviously extend to others. 
Has sufficient study been done?  
I believe the parallel exists here as well.  
This is certainly something that should be considered in terms of this bill as well.  
It means that it would still remain alive as an issue. 
I ask him to keep that in mind as we move forward.  
I again congratulate the member. 
All private members' business deserves our respect and attention. 
I believe he has done a excellent job in raising this issue. 
We should be thankful for a fine job on behalf of all private members.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
However, there are a number of observations I would like to make. 
We have but one purpose. 
We are not vindictive. 
We do not hold malice. 
We have one thing in mind. 
I do not think the last member who spoke from the government would agree. 
Now I watch them struggle in adulthood. 
If there are ways and means to prevent this, then let us go for it. 
We are not looking for credit in any way. 
The hon. member who initiated this bill would be the first to agree to it.  
Different organizations have been mentioned. 
This led to a disaster. 
I was the CEO to the board. 
They should have this right. 
Finally, let us forget about politics. 
Let us work together, whatever it takes. 
If it means going back to the committee, fine. 
That is not good enough for us on this side of the House.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
(The House adjourned at 2.21 p.m.)
