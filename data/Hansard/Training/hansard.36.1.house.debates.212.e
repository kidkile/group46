The House met at 2 p.m. 
Members sang the national anthem ] 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):
We thank them for their dedication and for their spirit of volunteerism. 
May they continue to serve us long.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, St. John Ambulance is celebrating 900 years of community service. 
Their generosity and commitment merit our admiration.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
NATIONAL ORGAN DONOR WEEK 
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
These statistics are startling.  
FORUM FOR YOUNG CANADIANS 
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
NATIONAL ORGAN DONOR WEEK 
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this is National Organ Donor Awareness Week. 
This has to change.  
They literally gave themselves for others.  
The gift of a kidney would be to her the gift of life.  
Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre-Rosedale, Lib.):
Margaret was invested with the Order of Canada in 1983. 
TRAGEDY IN LITTLETON, COLORADO 
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
The agreement covers the conditions involved in keeping them on the labour market as well.  
These agreements, it should be noted, reflect the priorities of the provinces.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
The bag contained a million dollars.  
He turned the money in like the great citizen he is.  
The question now is, who owns that money. 
However, as a police officer the rules are not so clear.  
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
FISHERIES AND OCEANS CANADA 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
On decision making within the department he had this to say: 
We have already seen the movie cod one. 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
Just how important is democracy to the Prime Minister?  
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
We must continue to relentlessly challenge our own standards. 
NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR NURSES 
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
After six years of Liberal government, Canada's health care system is in crisis. 
This government's record on health care issues is a national disgrace.  
Mr. Rick Limoges, for the electoral district of Windsor-St. 
Rick Limoges, member for the electoral district of Windsor-St. 
Clair, introduced by the Right Hon. Jean Chretien and the Hon. Herb Gray.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, just to advise the new member for Windsor-St. 
Clair, the official opposition is on this side of the House. 
We certainly congratulate him on his victory in his riding.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
There are air strikes at this moment. 
It is a strategy that is supported by the 19 nations involved in NATO. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
What on earth does that mean? 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the position of Canada is very clear. 
That is exactly what is going on. 
The air strikes will continue for some time. 
I said that yesterday. 
We will not be the ones to not be members of the team.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
As it sits right now, no one knows what his position is.  
The Prime Minister has two days left. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are not confronted with the problem at this moment. 
We are in the phase of air strikes. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
I would ask the hon. member to be very judicious in his choice of words.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
This person pretends that he is a responsible member of parliament.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is easy for the Prime Minister to act this way. 
He thinks it is some kind of joke. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
There was a fourth debate on Monday on the same issue.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
How could he have so little respect for parliament?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
That is the government's position. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are assuming our responsibilities. 
I hope we will not need to send combat troops. 
The hon. member for Laurentides.  
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
We will do everything to share whatever information we have. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Canadians expect a leader, not a follower. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are working at the United Nations. 
Of course I have talked with the Russians. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
We cannot have it both ways. 
Do we want Russia's participation or do we want NATO's domination?  
Will Canada lead or blindly follow?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I said that last week to one of your questions. 
You should read what I told you last week.  
I ask hon. members to direct their remarks to the Chair.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
We know now that the program is not bankable. 
We know now that very few if any dollars have been going into producers' pockets.  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
When they return those forms then we can work on the forms.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Mr. Spooker, in Manitoba only 5% of producers will be eligible.  
I know there is a question in there somewhere.  
Approximately $900 million was supposed to flow to farmers. 
Unfortunately the government seems to be wanting to save money as opposed to saving agriculture.  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
The member refers to the forms. 
That is the sixth page. 
The last one is a list of receivables and payables.  
Let us be judicious in our choice of words.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
This is a huge decision. 
It should be a Canadian decision. 
Why is he letting NATO tell us what to do?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, when will the Prime Minister act like a leader? 
The last time I checked, Canada was a sovereign nation. 
They made a big deal about not taking their marching orders from Washington. 
Little did we know they would be taking them from Brussels.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we had a debate. 
The morning after they could have had a vote on that and they declined.  
The government has the confidence of this side. 
I thought it was enough to speak on behalf of all Canadians.  
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
It is very important for Canada and for the United States.  
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
When are ground troops necessary? 
Does he have a position?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a very clear position. 
That is what is going on at this time. 
We are not there yet.  
We are accelerating the air strikes at this moment. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister misses the point. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
We have said that now at least 17 times.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, now for the 18th time.  
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
He certainly knows far better than that.  
We have learned lessons from the past. 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
In fact there was too much capacity. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to correct the hon. member. 
As soon as the forms come in, we will deal with them. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I said that in the House last week. 
Nobody dictates to anyone what to do.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, so much for Canada's leadership.  
My question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That said, the member's question is very relevant. 
Mrs. Judi Longfield (Whitby-Ajax, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Of course they are far more modest. 
INDIAN AFFAIRS AND NORTHERN DEVELOPMENT 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
In fact, the auditor general confirms that matters have gotten worse.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I read the auditor general's report with interest.  
The hon. member for Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert.  
Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert, BQ):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Trade is up, investment is up, and employment is up. 
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
This information comes, I hope, from sources other than the media. 
Such actions alone would probably justify sending ground in ground troops.  
This would not put anyone's life on the line, and might actually save lives. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
SPECIAL JOINT COMMITTEE ON CHILD CUSTODY AND ACCESS 
Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO COMMITTEE REPORT 
Yesterday a question of privilege was raised by the hon. member for Red Deer. 
At that time there were two points raised. 
That was the issue we were dealing with.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
I will come back to this point a little later in my remarks.  
Your nose is growing.  
Mr. Speaker, I would appreciate- 
Gentlemen, we are listening to an explanation. 
I therefore ask hon. members to stop heckling.  
It may be possible to trace this. 
The specific times vary, of course, depending on the location of each member. 
I say this for the following reason. 
These kits were available to members of the opposition on request. 
Again, I apologize most sincerely for this error in judgment and basic courtesy.  
Does the hon. member have something new to add to what we are discussing?  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
They said they had copies of it. 
They quoted from it and asked me to respond to it. 
That was three reporters.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
I wish him well.  
We do have a dispute as to the facts and to the times.  
I take it at face value.  
Yes, the information should have been put in both lobbies. 
No, it was not. 
Will that be corrected? 
I think the leaks come from all sides. 
It is the institution that we are dealing with here. 
It is the institution at this time in history is in our hands.  
At this point I find that it is not a point of privilege. 
I hope that it will not occur again. 
I hope that the committee can come up with a solution to our particular dilemma.  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House to present the report?  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
Mr. Speaker, the committee reports the same.  
TAXPAYERS BILL OF RIGHTS 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
I will be sharing my time with the member for Souris-Moose Mountain.  
They are heavily regulated by requirement of the government. 
It makes very powerful decisions that affect the economy. 
To date, we have not seen it. 
He says he has it. 
We have asked for it but he has not presented it.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
I would ask perhaps that the hon. member retract his statement.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I accept the point made by the member for Simcoe-Grey. 
I believe the member for Simcoe-Grey is quite correct.  
Mr. Richard M. Harris:
I see you are anticipating this new phrase.  
We see no example of that.  
This is a very simple request. 
They what to know what he is afraid of. 
Only the Prime Minister knows what he is afraid of. 
Maybe then the Teflon jacket on our Prime Minister would start to fray.  
It was a black mark on democracy. 
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. Richard M. Harris:
It hangs in my office for all my constituents to see. 
I ask nothing less than that of the government. 
Let it put forward its code of ethics. 
The Prime Minister has not done that. 
Every single Liberal member of that government voted against it last night. 
They have once again betrayed the trust of the Canadian people.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the code of ethics is a very important issue. 
What is the hon. member's opinion- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That is a point of debate and not a point of order.  
Mr. Richard M. Harris:
Mr. Richard M. Harris:
We were the third party then. 
We are now the official opposition. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
It is more important than the Liberals. 
It it is more important than any party in the opposition. 
I am talking about what is important to Canadians.  
We have to get into a selling program.  
We just debated the issue of the leakage of reports. 
What did the public see when it listened to this debate? 
Canadians are now looking at the House in a disrespectful way. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The member just said that he would not be speaking about tied selling.  
There is a great interest in this topic. 
My colleagues opposite have raised it. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The deputy government House leader makes a very good point. 
The opposition brought in a specific concurrence motion. 
Those same members rate politicians at the lowest end of the scale. 
That is exactly what I am telling the government opposite. 
It is time we stopped the nonsense. 
That is a concern.  
We have a job of selling to do not only within this finance committee report. 
We sometimes wonder why the Canadian public does not really appreciate politicians. 
Let me say something. 
I am a minister of the government. 
There is a formal code of ethics for ministers. 
It is a public document. 
That is his prerogative. 
We have access to information. 
Absolutely everything we do is scrutinized every day. 
It was to use civility. 
It was to treat others with respect. 
Have we seen that from the Reform Party? 
Some of the things that have gone on are absolutely unbelievable. 
Nor have I misinformed in my whole career. 
We talked about respect. 
It was a leak, and that is what bothers me.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
It is a very relevant subject for the House to be discussing. 
Mr. Richard M. Harris:
They support tied selling.  
By the way, they support tied selling.  
They will not talk about their own ethics. 
I put a question very- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
What I am talking about- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I move that we proceed to orders of the day.  
Mr. Richard M. Harris:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Unfortunately he was missed. 
I wanted to bring that to your attention.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Chair is deeply indebted to the hon. member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley.  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
This is what is behind Bill C-69. 
It provides for a flagging system. 
He could then apply to the solicitor general for permission to break the seal.  
These are important mechanisms intended to ensure the credibility of the process. 
The bill also contains provisions guaranteeing the rights of rehabilitated individuals. 
This bank contains information on offenders' criminal records.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments of the hon. member opposite.  
Many people do apply for pardons. 
When a person applies for a pardon, what are their chances of getting it? 
It is almost a fait accompli.  
The government member equated a pardon with being rehabilitated. 
Another report of the Correctional Service of Canada states: 
Does sex offender treatment work? 
We are still uncertain. 
However, later I will make the point that it needs to be strengthened.  
Who should have access to this information if there is a pardoned record out there? 
We questioned various groups. 
We looked for support on this issue and we asked how they felt about it. 
We have support from groups right across the country. 
What is the point of not informing them of this kind of information? 
They purposely do it. 
That is why we need to make every attempt to protect children from this situation.  
In some ways Bill C-69 attempts to do the same thing.  
There are some key points in Bill C-69 which need to be strengthened. 
We have not seen those regulations. 
We have been pardoning pedophiles for 20 years and we have never released this information. 
There is a lengthy process involved to get it. 
We are still leaving the discretion in the hands of the solicitor general. 
There is a real problem with this. 
An organization requests to have a record checked. 
That puts the police in a very difficult situation. 
If the conditions are met, we should be releasing the information. 
He opposed Bill C-284 when it was introduced. 
We have seen the government come forward with its own bill, Bill C-69. 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
What would this bill actually do? 
He would continue to enjoy discretionary powers in all other cases.  
As I have said, this moral obligation ought to be translated into a legal one.  
With this adjustment, the government might better attain the objective of its bill. 
I would like to return briefly to the verification system itself. 
This brings me to another point. 
There is nothing in the bill right now to allay our concerns. 
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
This has always been the commitment of the New Democratic Party. 
We applaud this piece of legislation. 
The community was concerned. 
The Sheldon Kennedy organization has been mentioned. 
I echo the comments I made yesterday. 
It is important to recognize there has to be a balance. 
The member for Calgary Centre spoke to this and raised some very good questions. 
I think they are questions we will examine in committee. 
The hon. member discussed what pardons were and how many people receive pardons. 
We are a human system. 
Many pardons are granted for things other than sexual offences. 
My colleague from Calgary Centre talked about the recidivism rate of pedophiles. 
We are right to be concerned about that. 
If they have nothing to fear, then they have nothing to fear.  
There are questions however and some of them were raised by other speakers. 
In the interests of time I will not go through all of them. 
I question why that discretion exists. 
One would hope it would not. 
These and other questions have to be raised in committee. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I declare the motion carried. 
YOUTH CRIMINAL JUSTICE ACT 
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
My initial findings were circulated among my colleagues in the Reform Party. 
The only real direction provided to the courts is to order the less restrictive sentence.  
This is not the case.  
All the minister has done is provide the courts with the discretion to do so. 
Under the new act the courts have not been mandated. 
Canadians should make the law through their elected representatives. 
The bill falls far short of this simple democratic principle. 
They have not been mandated at all. 
In other words we have not told the courts what we want. 
Even those offences must be tried in the youth court system. 
Then the crown must apply for an adult sentence to be imposed. 
The bill is deficient in that way.  
It is not mandated that the names be publicized.  
That is not mandated. 
Again it is left to the discretion of the courts.  
What do we have in the bill? 
We will have to wait and see. 
We think that is wrong.  
We have gone back to that. 
There is not a standardized form of sentencing implied within this statute.  
It is deficient in that way, which I think is very unfortunate. 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Unfortunately, it is the Reform tape playing.  
I disagree with the crime rate of juvenile offenders in Quebec. 
Now it is levelling off and coming down a bit, which is wonderful. 
If there are methods to account for that, let us emphasize those methods. 
Let us see what we can do.  
It has abandoned them.  
It is unfortunate that it is doing that.  
I hope that answers my colleague's question.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
What is it cutting down on? 
The government is reducing that budget by an enormous amount.  
It is not cutting anything out of the provincial budgets. 
It is cutting out of the federal programs.  
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I know that in a former life the hon. member was a policeman. 
Madam Speaker, there is a real story here. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
There is nothing run-of-the-mill about it. 
This bill refers to 14-year olds. 
To all intents and purposes, these are not even adolescents yet. 
The clause in question states: 
This makes no sense whatsoever. 
It is a sign of distress, a sign of inner turmoil. 
I just do not see it.  
Members know that this bill is politically driven. 
It is a question of votes.  
That is what has to be understood. 
That is what we are talking about.  
It is too sad to be funny. 
There is a problem setting priorities. 
Things are happening as if the word nuance was prohibited in ministers' speeches. 
And yet, I think a distinction must be made.  
This does not make them criminals in the same way as adults. 
This is what I just cannot understand.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member. 
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ) moved that: 
I want to go into a few examples of these.  
The auditor general made many criticisms with respect to the selection of this helicopter. 
Other documents as well were lost only God knows how.  
That is the good neighbour strategy. 
So much for Canada's sovereignty in the area of national defence.  
The department bought the aircraft from the only supplier it consulted. 
Only one supplier was consulted. 
This is a commercial aircraft and not a military one. 
Other types of helicopter were turned down. 
In addition, the studies called into question the suitability of the aircraft that was selected.  
Four helicopter manufacturers were competing for this contract. 
There are other examples of major purchases. 
I mention here the purchase of 35 helicopters intended this time for maritime patrol. 
They fight submarines, acting as the eyes and ears of the frigates.  
In other words, the department is badly mismanaging its budget.  
Another example is the Leopard thermal weapon sight. 
The total estimated cost of the project is $145 million. 
DND decided that purchasing the thermal weapon sight was the only affordable option. 
The Coyote provides the army with a reconnaissance capability. 
However, no other vehicles had been tested.  
These are enough examples to justify the motion.  
We must change the defence department's way of doing things. 
Moreover, the pilot projects selected are relatively unimportant.  
Conversely, in Great Britain, the smart procurement initiative was much for audacious. 
Canada could follow the lead of the British in that regard. 
Meanwhile, the House could make a first step by voting in favour of this motion.  
Finally, we do not believe that our motion is an end in itself. 
However, we do think that it is a step in the right direction.  
Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
In addition, in 1997 the Government of Canada launched Contracts Canada. 
This approach had many pitfalls. 
Its mandate is to ensure the integrity of the procurement process. 
Canada is one of the few countries in the world where this separation exists. 
It is crucial to ensure the process remains fair. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
With respect, I would like to suggest that this would be a bad idea.  
In fact the auditor general's report makes mention of that. 
I will quote from that document: 
The question basically was what is wrong? 
Where is the problem?  
That is where it lies. 
What would happen to the process? 
The politicians should not be telling the specific department what to buy.  
I know that other contracts have been let. 
There has always been the question of sole sourcing. 
There is always the question of political interference. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this motion. 
The auditor general was scathing in his report. 
All Canadians deserve an open and fair defence procurement procedure. 
They are not receiving the quality they deserve from their taxes.  
In three cases, the Department considered only a single option. 
In other cases, the options analyses were inadequate.  
This is simply not good enough. 
Furthermore this is not news to this government. 
The auditor general reminded the government of the following: 
Housing and pay conditions for our forces personnel still demand attention. 
All Canadians deserve to have these very serious issues resolved.  
In the standing committee we are currently reviewing the procurement process. 
Perhaps part of the problem could be resolved if there was more public transparency.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
In my opinion, there are good reasons to support this motion. 
I tend to partially agree and partially disagree with the member for Calgary Northeast.  
There is no question that things have been dragging.  
It says it was only $500 million. 
It was cancelled for strictly crass political purposes. 
Our search and rescue capability today is hanging by a thread. 
Once we get that it will still take five to eight years down the road.  
Many questions have been asked about this Liberal decision. 
This committee should have the same oversight role with regard to defence procurement. 
Vigilance must be demonstrated in the field of defence procurement as well. 
Thus I support the motion.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
I seconded this motion because I think it makes a lot of sense. 
This would probably come under the Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs. 
One hundred million dollars is a lot of money. 
The government would do well to be transparent.  
I had to replace the member for Joliette on the committee. 
National Defence representatives, officials and military personnel appeared as witnesses. 
We were given a few examples. 
I was able to question witnesses on regional impacts.  
Why did the member for Joliette ask me to replace him? 
This information seems to be a state secret. 
If that had been the case, I could understand. 
I also asked how these things were assessed and by whom. 
In fact, I think the member for Joliette is a little bit too reasonable. 
He suggests that at least we start at this level.  
Personally, I would go further, but he is wise. 
He is trying to get the support of all parties and possibly government members. 
It seems to me it would be in the public interest.  
This is what our constituents want us to do. 
Decisions like these reflect the centralizing approach of the government.  
The year 2000 is near. 
In this instance, decisions are made strictly at cabinet level.  
And who controls the cabinet? 
In fact, only a handful of people make the big decisions.  
I want to commend him for moving the motion and aptly arguing in its favour. 
I urge my Liberal colleagues to support it.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House adjourned at 6.30 p.m.)
