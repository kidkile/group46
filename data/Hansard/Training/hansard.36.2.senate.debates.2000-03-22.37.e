Wednesday, March 22, 2000 
The Senate met at 1:30 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
The Late Honourable Michael Starr, P.C. 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
It is reassuring, however, that his legacy is an example to others. 
I extend my condolences to his family.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
I served in the House of Commons with Mr. Starr. 
I think of Joe Greene. 
He was always ready to discuss. 
He never presumed that he had the answer to everything.  
The labour movement in this country owes much to him. 
He was a good man, kind and thoughtful. 
Above all, he was most fair in the sense that he listened. 
He never presumed until the evidence was all in. 
Now he is with God. 
International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
In Canada, this initiative has received strong support. 
Throughout the 11 years since its launch on March 21, 1989, the "Racism. 
The Honourable Landon Pearson 
Hon. John G. Bryden :
Honourable senators, I rise to bring to your attention my seatmate.  
Is she running for the leadership of the party?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
May you find some resemblance to your own chambers in the United Kingdom.  
Committee Authorized to Meet DuringSitting of the Senate 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
What will the government do? 
This is a delaying tactic. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
However, the minister has not yet replied to that request. 
Possible Announcement on Restructuring-Request for Information 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
In a country as large as Canada, passenger rail service is critical. 
The matter has been before the minister for some time. 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
In fact, the famous Red Book said: 
Canada must promote sustainable development around the world.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I do not have the details of that specific project before me. 
Influence of Human Rights Policyon Granting of Funds 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Honourable senators, I wish to go a bit further with this line of questioning. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Those directions, I am sure, are taken seriously by that body.  
In fact, it has been operating within its own resources.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I know that the honourable senator shares that view with me.  
Delayed Answers to Oral Questions 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
(Response to question raised by Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk on February 22, 2000) 
The Department's trade officers can also provide information and advice.  
- We provide both corporate and political information to companies.  
(Response to question raised by Hon. Donald H. Oliver on February 29, 2000) 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Douglas Roche on March 1, 2000) 
Thank you for inviting me to participate in these hearings.  
You are also aware of Theatre Missile Defence, or TMD.  
The systems are akin to one another, but there are differences.  
To avoid confusion, I will not use the term BMD.  
WHY IS THE U.S. DEVELOPING THIS SYSTEM?  
Two recent developments have added urgency to their thinking.  
He also set out criteria that would govern a deployment decision.  
These are major considerations for the United States.  
WHERE WOULD AN NMD SYSTEM BE LOCATED?  
WHEN WOULD IT BE DEPLOYED?  
The target date for this Review is June.  
The first test of the NMD "kill vehicle" was in October 1999. 
The second test in January 2000 was not fully successful.  
It was, however, reportedly a very near-miss.  
A further crucial test is now scheduled for May.  
NMD RAISES LARGE ISSUES 
The Soviet Union chose Moscow and installed a system.  
The U.S. chose Grand Forks, but has not installed a system.  
The Treaty is intended to ensure that deterrence works.  
Both sides agree that an NMD system would be inconsistent with the ABM Treaty.  
The U.S. has engaged the Russians in discussions to amend the Treaty.  
Indeed, they maintain they are potentially in greater danger than the United States is.  
That is the nub of the diplomatic issue.  
We are open to seeing the Treaty amended if the parties can agree.  
NMD, THE ABM TREATY, CANADA AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS 
We have, nonetheless, been following the development of this technology for some time.  
How it would affect Canadian defence relations with the United States.  
Such an outcome does not strike me as preordained.  
And is NMD the appropriate response?  
The NMD program would offer little in this area.  
Is NMD going to be cost effective?  
That depends on how the costs are calculated.  
The ABM Treaty has been a centrepiece of international strategic stability for thirty years.  
START II calls for a reduction to 3,500.  
For the first time, Start III would also address tactical nuclear weapons.  
All could be lost if the ABM Treaty were abrogated.  
If their vulnerability were to increase the Atlantic would, figuratively, widen further.  
Talks between the United States and Russia continue.  
NMD appears to be on a fast track in the U.S. 
But there remain some significant unknowns.  
Will the technology work?  
These are all real and serious questions that remain to be answered.  
It remains to be seen what the U.S. Administration will itself decide.  
The question of Canadian participation remains open.  
Cuba-Efficacy of Quiet Diplomacy 
(Response to question raised by Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk on March 2, 2000) 
Decisions are taken by individual firms for commercial reasons. 
Will the government review its Cuba policy?  
Statement of Minister of Finance-Inquiry-Debate Adjourned 
...some of the recommendations simply cry out for implementation. 
We need equal opportunity here.  
Josephine Grey, Director of Low Income Families Together, tells us that the, 
The culprit, honourable senators, was Bill C-12, which was passed in 1996.  
His motivation, however, was skewed. 
Atlantic Canadians will not be fooled.  
People in poverty need money in their pockets now. 
The government could have shown leadership here. 
After all, he who pays the piper calls the tune.  
You have to see the face of poverty. 
We're real people. 
There's nothing here for me and my family. 
Molly Ladd-Taylor, a York University professor said: 
She wants these services in place for her children.  
The government has given extra funds to the provinces with no commitments. 
This is what we are experiencing right now in Canada.  
Post-secondary education institutions also felt the crunch in this budget. 
Honourable senators, it is no wonder the premiers are angry. 
This year's budget does nothing to redress past cuts. 
The result will be increased tuition and higher student debt. 
In cities across Canada, university buildings, bridges and roads are crumbling. 
On motion of Senator Kinsella, debate adjourned.  
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
