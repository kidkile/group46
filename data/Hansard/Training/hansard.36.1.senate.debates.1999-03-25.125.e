The Senate met at 9 a.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Consideration in Committee of the Whole 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
I do not think the rules allow that.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
It is acceptable procedure, honourable senators.  
We have certain witnesses who have agreed to appear before us. 
Are honourable senators prepared to hear those witnesses now? 
Honourable senators, it would be appropriate if I introduced the witnesses to the Senate. 
We can speak from our seats.  
Thank you, Senator Kinsella, for that important advice.  
Mr. Minister, would you like to open the proceedings?  
Hon. Marcel Masse, President of the Treasury Board and Minister responsible for Infrastructure :
We had proof of this again yesterday. 
Government intervention at this time is urgent.  
This situation is having a very serious impact on western grain farmers. 
They can no longer send their grain to foreign markets. 
Honourable senators, I am now ready to answer your questions.  
Legislation of this nature seems to be more the rule than the exception. 
What is it that falls apart along the route? 
Are there no corrections possible?  
In the case of the blue-collar workers, we have a tentative agreement. 
The right to strike is a fundamental right. 
The employer has the edge. 
It is too heavily weighted on one side.  
You mentioned that injunctions have been taken out. 
I am thinking of the grain handlers on the West Coast. 
How far have you gone to get injunctions to stop certain disruptive activities?  
There is a way to bypass those who weigh the grain. 
Therefore, an injunction would not have been useful in that case. 
We did not have much success with injunctions. 
This is an interesting point because normally workers apply pressure by withdrawing their services. 
That is the problem.  
That counterbalanced the fact that it increased the cost of the settlement for the government.  
If that is so, why the urgency for this law? 
Am I correct that the vote is to take place next week?  
The vote will probably be some time next week. 
However, we can only hope that the agreement will be ratified. 
There will be a period of time before ratification. 
During that period, rotating strikes continued. 
They continue to create problems in the economy. 
The union has indicated that they will ratify the agreement in a week. 
Is the right to strike being given too generously? 
As you said, I will only comment on your remark. 
The right to strike is essential to collective bargaining. 
The right to strike is clearly not an absolute. 
We believe this is what has happened in this case. 
I refer to the disruptions at Dorval airport, in grain transportation, and so on.  
We have had those.  
I cannot recall previous provisions of this kind. 
There are no precedents. 
This is a new case. 
The workers in this group have been declared essential. 
As a result, there is the possibility of a strike.  
In this case we are not removing the right to strike. 
Technically, the intention was that they would all be designated essential. 
There is no right to strike in that group.  
Yes, in this case we are preventing a right to strike. 
That was not my point, minister. 
Those circumstances seem irrelevant to the point I am making. 
I think it is a bad precedent.  
They were in line with a long list of agreements. 
That was not discretionary in the case of the blue-collar workers.  
Obviously, I take your word for that, minister. 
There are lots of examples. 
There is no third-party intervention.  
In our case, yes, usually the process has been arbitration. 
We are constantly in negotiations with our partners, with the representatives of the employees. 
Thank you for that, minister. 
That is what you focused on in your answer to Senator Murray.  
There is a separate section of the bill dealing with them. 
My first question on this is one of principle. 
For one technical reason:
We cannot let them strike. 
They are all designated essential services because they are all necessary.  
Let us be very precise about this issue.  
There are 4,500.  
How many of those 4,500 are already designated "essential service"?  
That 4,500, minus 500 to 600.  
Therefore, there are 4,000 correctional officers who have been designated as "essential service." 
In other words, they may not walk off the job or strike, et cetera. 
Where are they designated as "essential service"? 
What instrument defines that?  
Please be conscious of the fact that Senator Lawson also has a question.  
What is the reason for the time limitation?  
I believe that the minister must leave at about ten o'clock.  
What do you mean by saying that the minister must leave?  
We agreed that officials will stay behind.  
That is correct, and the officials will stay behind.  
Some of us are not familiar with the plan. 
The minister must leave at ten o'clock, and we respect that. 
How long can they stay? 
We do not want to impose on them, either. 
They have other responsibilities also.  
They will stay for a reasonable length of time.  
If that is convenient with them, that is most satisfactory to us.  
All 4,500 employees are, in principle, designated. 
At present, 4,000 are designated as "essential service." 
You must send them a letter within a certain period of time, and so on. 
At present, these 500 are not designated. 
I will come back to this matter with the officials later. 
I now have a policy question for the minister.  
First, I wish to permit Senator Lawson to ask a few questions.  
When did you discover that they were not designated essential?  
The problems about the designations are still ongoing. 
However, they have not agreed to exempt the other 500 to 600. 
We had to use the back-to-work legislation for the 500 to 600.  
You dramatize all these incidents that have taken place with rotating strikes, and so on. 
The negotiations are divided into two parts: prior to the settlement and after the settlement. 
Yesterday was the worst day of the rotating strikes.  
When was the tentative settlement made?  
The settlement was made the day before yesterday. 
In other words, we did not get an agreement. 
Almost without exception, we achieved the settlement. 
You are talking about future negotiations with all departments of the government. 
It is one thing when you do not have a settlement. 
How dare you do that and use it? 
Do not bring it before us. 
There are some circumstances in which I would support it. 
However, I cannot support this legislation when you have a negotiated settlement between the parties.  
Mr. Chairman, there are at least 20 questions in there. 
The union clearly believes what we believe. 
We have an agreement that was initialled two days ago. 
The union knew what the reaction of their members would be. 
Yesterday has proven that they were right.  
The situation is clear. 
We do not dream in technicolour. 
We know the facts and the union knows the facts. 
We know that we must stop these strikes right now. 
Come forward and strip all of the workers of their bargaining rights. 
At least be honest about it up front. 
You want to guarantee that there will not be any incidents. 
That is what you are doing, piece by piece.  
If we cannot improve it by negotiation. 
The answer to your question is "yes."  
We have told them that. 
We have made that public.  
It is not in the bill. 
In the bill, you can do anything you want.  
I think there should be some assurances.  
Honourable senators, I know that the minister has to leave. 
On your behalf, I thank him for having been here this morning. 
We do have other witnesses.  
Mr. Chairman, I have a few questions for the officials.  
In particular, how has this applied to the correctional officers in question?  
That is basically the policy.  
Where is the authority to designate?  
It flows from the act. 
Is a list of designated employees published?  
I am not aware that it is published. 
I am not sure if it is published. 
I do not think so. 
It is submitted to the PSSRB for decision. 
There is another series of problems, I understand, with new jobs being created. 
When did the process begin? 
What is the nature of the public administration process to which you refer?  
When did you say the designation process began? 
Was it two years ago, three years ago or last week? 
I am told the process began in early 1997.  
That is two years ago, roughly.  
I do not know. 
In terms of the negotiations at Table 4, were you participating at that table?  
Were you participating at the table?  
What was the recommendation of the conciliation board?  
Therefore, the comparison stands at 7 per cent to 10.5 per cent.  
Does that mean a spread of 3 per cent of the payroll.  
That is a 3 per cent spread in the payroll, yes.  
My policy question relates to the question that Senator Murray was asking. 
What would be your reaction to that proposal?  
I would like to offer a point of clarification. 
That is a significant difference.  
Mr. Chairman, I wish to ask questions later in relation to national rights. 
Perhaps other senators have questions.  
That is the situation in which we find ourselves.  
Must a letter be sent to each employee?  
I suppose a copy would be sent to their bargaining unit.  
Yes, they have the list.  
From a designation perspective, the public service is a moving target. 
There is constant organizational and structural change. 
Yes, it is the position that is designated.  
That is one part of the problem, yes.  
Who are these people, Mr. Jolicoeur? 
Are you referring to Table 4? 
I am talking about the 500 who somehow escaped designation.  
They are prison guards.  
They are all prison guards? 
How could those jobs have been changed; a guard is a guard, is a guard. 
The fundamental driver in the public service is the position. 
That is one case. 
That is my understanding.  
Yes, at the moment they are spread across the country. 
Yes, that all prison guard positions would be designated.  
I see the problems that would arise therefrom.  
There must be some changes in your administrative procedures that will be necessary.  
I say that only because the representatives of the union are waiting. 
Are we working under a deadline? 
Are we expected to stop at noon? 
If need be, can we not continue this process in the afternoon?  
I am not suggesting that we are operating under a deadline.  
It is as ludicrous as that?  
I understand that that is currently the case.  
How long has this been going on?  
It was not one action but a series of actions.  
It will continue for quite some time, I gather.  
I would like an overall assessment of the government's salary policy. 
That is the biggest difference. 
Who are the negotiations conducted with, then?  
It is not a bargaining process in their case. 
The increases are set by the government. 
It led to additional increases.  
What will the increase in payroll be for the two years we are talking about?  
What is this four-year period?  
It began in 1997, after the freeze.  
Yes, for members of the executive category.  
The unions will use this argument. 
In certain cases, they will already have exceeded this after two years. 
They will quickly put the increase of certain members of the executive category into perspective. 
We gave you the average increase for members of the executive category, for cadres.  
What do you consider "cadre"? 
The 7.96 per cent figure includes positions at the EX-1 level. 
There are deputy ministers, and associate deputy ministers, or there used to be.  
How many are in this executive category?  
Between 3,000 and 3,500 .  
Is that correct, more or less?  
Could the honourable senator repeat the question? 
I did not understand it.  
Part 2 comes into force only on proclamation by order of the Governor in Council. 
I have been through all of that. 
This bill does not supersede those provisions?  
Mr. Chairman, I should like to make two comments. 
First, we are not too far off schedule. 
That having been said, I do not think we will be too far off.  
We are moving to seven.  
Why, in your view, would this only apply to blue-collar workers? 
We have done that for the lawyers in Toronto. 
There is a policy decision to be made here. 
There will be a need to study that in the coming years.  
Honourable senators, I believe that our witnesses are finished. 
We thank them for appearing and for staying on to answer questions.  
I am told, Mr. Bean, that you will be making a statement. 
Mr. Daryl T. Bean , National President, Public Service Alliance of Canada:
I certainly wish we were doing it under different circumstances. 
I wish to assure the honourable senators that it does no such thing.  
The President of the Treasury Board knows that that is not true. 
It does not end there. 
There are other examples in the unionized federal public service. 
I said conscious and voluntary decision.  
Let me make this perfectly clear, 728 non-designated positions.  
Why did the government do this? 
In the scheme of the government's overall payroll, these amounts are relatively small. 
Why legislate terms and conditions of employment? 
Here again, Bill C-76 proves this point. 
They had the right to strike, and they exercised that right. 
It is not invalid. 
If necessary, we will certainly take that one on, too. 
Mr. Bean, welcome, and thank you for your very forceful presentation. 
As of late yesterday, we have been waiting for those 30 pages of wage rates. 
If it were to be suspended, we would speed up the vote. 
The Easter weekend creates a problem. 
We could speed it up if the legislation was suspended.  
You will be recommending to your members that they approve this tentative settlement. 
They also wanted to lump Saskatchewan in with Atlantic Canada. 
Finally, we have been able to correct that situation. 
I am talking about situations with which I am personally familiar. 
I am aware of the Halifax airport being disrupted. 
This revelation came after the announcement of a negotiated settlement.  
I can sympathize with the minister's argument. 
I would like your comment or that of Ms Turmel on that point.  
That is why we conducted a rotating strike. 
We have had enough experience with legislated agreements. 
Why would the employer ever talk to you again?  
Yes, we had to cause some minimum inconveniences. 
I am expressing only a small amount of it. 
Some of you may find my words offensive, and I apologize if you do. 
However, I am expressing only a small amount of the frustration that exists. 
They have been almost two years at the negotiating table. 
I believe that that would upset you, too. 
Your dispute is with the Government of Canada. 
There are only 70 grain weighers among your 14,500 employees. 
Why would you target that group?  
Why did you specifically target these people?  
First, I have no idea from where you got that statement. 
It is certainly not one I made. 
Yes, on occasion we did target grain and did slow down shipments. 
I do not apologize for that. 
The discussion was largely with the officials, as you will recall.  
That is not in my hands. 
What is the correct number?  
There are 728 who are not designated. 
We have the list with the positions.  
I wish to explain briefly the designation process in the federal government. 
That is, of course, because some positions are vacant. 
Subsequently, three things occurred. 
Third, there were some new positions created which were not included. 
That is consistent with what the officials told us. 
The minister talked about a loophole. 
The officials described something that I would describe as an administrative snafu. 
You say it adds up to 728 positions.  
There is something wrong when such a position is put forward. 
That is the real reason for that provision.  
Are you taking this case to the Public Service Staff Relations Board? 
Was this at your initiative or the government's?  
We both had a complaint, for different reasons.  
And that they need not be designated?  
Is that your position?  
We have been saying that for years. 
If a position is vacant, then it obviously cannot be essential. 
Something is wrong with this system.  
There is no doubt as to what it means. 
The service will be provided by the correctional officers. 
Would you not say so? 
No. I would suggest to you that it is not essential that everyone be designated. 
The same can be true for the correctional officers. 
They can still maintain service.  
I would agree with you that there is something wrong with the process. 
There are about 100 positions in the original group which have no one filling them.  
That satisfies my concerns about the discrepancy. 
Mr. Chairman, I wish to add one thing. 
We were talking about 1989 earlier.  
The reality is that our members take their jobs pretty seriously. 
They do go out. 
That leads me to my key question. 
I certainly agree with your first summation. 
The minister said that yesterday was the worst day yet. 
I do not believe we have exceeded 4,000 workers on any given day. 
I congratulate you for that. 
The House then gave a standing ovation for that settlement, and properly so. 
Why, then, are we here talking about legislation? 
I suggested suspension of the legislation. 
I have no doubt in my mind about that.  
That is outrageous, particularly in the face of an agreed-upon settlement. 
Let me say that it does not assist the process. 
I will not repeat it.  
It does not assist the process when you have unconscionable fines. 
They are told that they will face a fine. 
This legislation does not allow them to do that.  
Someone described collective bargaining as being like a marriage. 
We have reached tentative agreements for approximately 100,000, give or take. 
I accept the results of the vote. 
We had a tentative agreement for the correctional officers. 
Do you know of any precedent? 
Every one of our complaints has been upheld by the ILO. 
In one case, they even sent a mission to Canada. 
That is highly unusual. 
No doubt the ILO will condemn this legislation.  
Effectively, there is no third party overview in this process. 
That is certainly the indication. 
My problem is that I have nothing official on this.  
Failing that, the government has this authority, even though it is extraordinary authority. 
I have been in this process before. 
That you can do. 
We will be exploring that.  
The expiry date would be June 1999. 
A couple of months away.  
The spread between the parties is not that great. 
There is a vehicle available to us, namely, a ministerial letter. 
As well, the contract expires in a couple of months.  
I guess that is the risk.  
I would suggest that it is a minimum burden.  
I wish to return to the concerns expressed regarding ancillary demonstrations to the rotating strikes. 
This one is dated March 12, 1999, and reads: 
Support from Table 1 has been great!  
They are gloating about that one, I guess.  
Edmonton, Alta - Canada Place was again the target of successful picketing. 
Both grain elevators are down for the rest of the strike. 
Bad legislation will go through and bad feelings between employer and employees will continue.  
No doubt that information is pretty accurate. 
That was March 12 I believe I heard you say. 
Yes, we have delayed people going into buildings. 
Obviously, we have used it. 
Very little of what the government has argued is the reason for this legislation. 
That takes care of that one.  
Yes, we have picketed Revenue Canada. 
I seriously hope that you can understand the frustration and the anger. 
It is impossible for me to control all of the members. 
I ask you to put yourself in the shoes of the lowest paid workers. 
I understand why you would raise the question and I respect the question.  
I have quite a different kind of question. 
It is most obvious in the blue-collar workers. 
It ranges anywhere from 20 to 40 per cent.  
This is not exclusively a Canadian problem. 
There is a considerable movement to the private sector. 
What is really going on here? 
People know that when they retire, they will have a decent pension.  
I thank you both for appearing here this morning. 
I wish to close by thanking honourable senators. 
I do appreciate the forthright manner in which you are addressing this matter. 
I would ask that we call in the next witnesses.  
I ask the minister to bring that to Minister Masse's attention. 
It would be helpful if we had a document along those lines.  
I do not think we can negotiate here.  
I will take that on.  
Ms Viviane Mathieu , correctional officer:
I have worked in the Leclerc, Montee Saint-Francois and Donnacona institutions. 
So I hope you will be understanding.  
Canada's 4,700 correctional officers have been through the same things.  
Mr. Andre Belanger , president, Union of Solicitor General Employees, PSAC:
We refer to it as the super maximum.  
Correctional officers represent one of the links in the judicial system. 
Yet, we have to work with them daily. 
This is the atmosphere in which we have to work every day.  
We have to deal with pressure from inmates constantly. 
We run into critical situations regularly.  
There is a huge possibility that these people, too, are HIV-positive. 
That is what we run into daily.  
We have to do clinical intervention with them. 
We need to be mindful of respecting those rights.  
We unanimously support the majority report of the Conciliation Board. 
We are imploring you to amend this bill. 
Every day, our working conditions impact on our families, our neighbours, our community. 
Over the years, those who are near to us have said "Enough is enough." 
Our working conditions must change. 
A comparison must be made with RCMP officers. 
We are a police force and we want to be treated like one. 
I thank the witnesses for their very clear presentation. 
This morning, we talked about 728 of your colleagues who are non-designated employees. 
I work at the regional reception centre. 
Seven of the 160 officers in that institution will be in a legal strike position. 
We did not want to go on strike.  
We perform important, even essential, duties within Canadian society. 
Canadian society can count on us.  
Furthermore, we have proved this. 
In your facility, what duties do the seven designated employees perform?  
They are CX-2s, like I am. 
Some of them may be CX-1s. 
Almost all of us perform the same duties, with a few exceptions.  
We can all fill in all the positions. 
This does not present any real problems internally. 
Safety is not at all jeopardized. 
We would not allow that.  
What training does one need to apply for such positions? 
When I was hired by the Correctional Service, in 1974, Secondary V was required. 
However, the nature of the work is different now. 
One of the basic requirements for our work is judgment. 
Since the prison world is constantly changing, interview techniques have improved. 
We have made many requests for further training. 
My question was more about post-hiring training. 
This takes six or eight weeks, according to how much experience a person has. 
Then there might be refreshers and upgrades in the institution. 
There was much discussion at the bargaining table about training. 
Often there are no updates. 
We should read: "All your members should have been designated." 
That is the process. 
The position is designated, not the individual.  
What is this about? 
Will these 728 individuals eventually be designated?  
Clearly it is very complex. 
The agreement was signed a few days ago. 
That is what we understand. 
It is denying us the right to strike.  
That is the way it is throughout Canada. 
We do not understand. 
The members find this extremely unfair.  
There was a lack of information from Treasury Board. 
The process has been going on for three years. 
Treasury Board officials should come and explain this contradiction to us.  
Once the dispute was settled, that could cause problems between colleagues. 
Is the government's concern justified?  
There have been picket lines for some time. 
In fact, they may be worse. 
We have a highly developed sense of duty and of good citizenship. 
We administer legislation every day. 
It is true that there were some delays, but minimal ones. 
Our people know this. 
We do not understand the government. 
We find this legislation unfair and unjustified. 
I doubt the government would accept that. 
We will make the suggestion to them. 
Our membership will decide. 
They will decide whether they want to accept it. 
Judging by my knowledge of my people, I believe they are going to accept.  
We can now start with the clause-by-clause study of the bill. 
There are no more witnesses to hear from.  
Perhaps we could break now. 
I am in the hands of honourable senators.  
That might help us to accelerate the process.  
We should then wait for such an undertaking. 
It may be easier to get the response.  
I suggest we move to clause-by-clause study. 
We can defer third reading until later this day.  
We might want to amend in committee one or another of the clauses. 
Why not wait until after the lunch adjournment?  
Could you not move an amendment at third reading?  
That is my suggestion.  
We can do clause-by-clause study now. 
There may have been developments over that period. 
We will deal with third reading later on. 
We have seen sitting here since nine o'clock this morning. 
That is not my recommendation, quite frankly, honourable senators. 
They have always been deferred to third reading. 
That might be helpful.  
Would that be agreeable?  
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin (The Hon. the Acting Speaker) :
Honourable senators, the sitting of the Senate is resumed.  
Report of the Committee of the Whole 
Hon. Peter A. Stollery :
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Honourable senators, the Committee of the Whole requests permission to sit later this day. 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.  
The Senate resumed at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Promotion of Products from Minority Communities 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
The example set by AT&T is instructive in this regard. 
Many of the top computer firms have no African-Americans on their board of directors. 
Honourable senators, this is a model which could easily be developed in Canada. 
It demonstrates a win-win situation for minorities and for business. 
Fiftieth Anniversary of Confederation 
The world had changed by then, and so had Newfoundland.  
We now celebrate 50 momentous years of being Canadians. 
Our music, Newfoundland folk songs, is played on the carillon of the Peace Tower. 
Canadian Institutes of Health Research 
Hon. Wilbert J. Keon :
Later that evening, I attended a dinner to celebrate the occasion. 
Assembled there were the country's leading scientists and health professionals.  
Fiftieth Anniversary of Confederation 
Their performance will include some traditional Newfoundland music as well. 
A World Free of Nuclear Weapons 
There could be no medical response in a nuclear war. 
Nuclear weapons are weapons of mass destruction. 
Thursday, March 25, 1999 
The Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has the honour to present its 
The Hon. the Speaker :
It states "two senators having abstained." 
That is not a proper report, as such. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Send it back, then.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
We cannot proceed with it.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I am in the hands of the Senate.  
When shall this bill be read the third time?  
At the next sitting of the Senate.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Your Honour, I want some further information. 
I thought you just told us that the report was out of order. 
I do not understand.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
It is up to the Senate to decide what to do, however.  
You ruled that yourself. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
It is for senators to decide if we wish to have the rules enforced.  
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to, on division.  
The Estimates 1999-2000 
Interim Report of National Finance Committee on Main Estimates Presented and Printed 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Perhaps I could ask for leave to consider the report now. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
In essence, that is a summary of what we looked at.  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, I wish to underscore what Senator Stratton has said. 
This is an interim report. 
The committee will be continuing its rather exhaustive study on the Main Estimates. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is it your pleasure to adopt the report?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Supreme Court of Canada 
Articles Regarding Remarks of Supreme Court Justice-Notice of Inquiry 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
( e ) to the continuing public commentary on judicial activism in Canada; 
( f ) to the matter of judges' public statements; 
( g ) to the principle and concept of judicial independence of Canadian justices; and 
( h ) to the role of Parliament in these matters.  
Protection of Conscience of Health Caregivers-Presentation of Petition 
Hon. Raymond J. Perrault :
The petition relates to the protection of conscience in medical procedures.  
Honourable senators, my question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
There have been comments on this matter in the media. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I am not aware of the moratorium being lifted. 
In the meantime, I shall make my own inquiries about any lifting of the moratorium.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, we have gone to war in the last 24 hours. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Possibility of Deployment of Land Forces in Former Yugoslavia-Government Position 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, as usual, we have to get our information from the press. 
What Canadian force ground units are being sent to Kosovo? 
Are we preparing for a ground war with Serbia?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I intend to do so as soon as we return. 
President Milosovich must take responsibility for the current situation. 
This agreement would provide for Kosovar autonomy within the boundaries of Yugoslavia.  
We act in concert with other nations. 
In this respect, an appropriate coalition was in place to make a difference in Kosovo. 
Honourable senators, circumstances change. 
The Secretary-General of the United Nations himself has approved this action. 
This is a very grave humanitarian problem. 
We should support our troops. 
Of course, I do; that is not the issue. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, the minister said that we are trying to solve a humanitarian problem. 
There are other countries involved. 
We are one of 18 members of NATO.  
The decision has been sanctioned by the Secretary General of the United Nations. 
I think the action that was taken was the right one. 
Perhaps it should have been taken a long time ago. 
What consequences does NATO expect to achieve by these bombing raids? 
We are doing this, apparently, to dismantle certain military installations. 
Is that not what we all aspire to accomplish? 
In a perfect world, we would have perfect answers.  
I am not talking about a perfect world; I am talking about the Balkans.  
Will bombing bring Mr. Milosevic to his senses? 
Will it bring him back to the table? 
I do not know. 
They will bomb away, regardless of the consequences.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the matter was debated in Parliament on a previous occasion. 
Changes to Employment Insurance Act-Request for Further Particulars 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
In part of the response, the government said: 
How long are the funds borrowed? 
Are they returned, and how much is outstanding?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Fire aboard Aurora Aircraft in Nova Scotia-Government Position 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Is my honourable friend sure it was an Aurora aircraft?  
It overflew Yarmouth and managed to get back to Greenwood. 
I will try to give an answer later today.  
Hon. Jean-Claude Rivest :
Several hundred million dollars are available. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government):
Honourable senators, I am pleased that the Honourable Senator Rivest raised this question. 
Mr. Pettigrew has proposed to act as mediator in order to find a solution. 
Honourable senators, I have a supplementary question on that issue.  
What is wrong with that?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I shall make further inquiries. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I must pursue that further. 
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
Honourable senators, my question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
We are supporting our troops 100 per cent.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I am not aware of that. 
I have a further question on that subject. 
I am informed that the aircraft landed safely. 
It was only smoke.  
There were 11 men on board and no one was hurt. 
More details, if I have them, will be given to you later.  
Thank God for that, this time.  
Where do you think smoke comes from? 
Delayed Answers to Questions 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I have delayed answers to two questions. 
( Response to question raised by Hon. Terry Stratton on March 9, 1999 ) 
The Plan has already been a success. 
Last year for instance, the government revised its historical estimates of GDP.  
The speech was posted by mistake and Revenue Canada apologizes for the error. 
The speech provided to Senator Carstairs has been removed from the web site.  
Appropriation Bill No. 1, 1999-2000 
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.  
Canadian International Trade Tribunal Act 
Bill to Amend-Third Reading 
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.  
Government Services Bill, 1999 
Consideration in Committee of the Whole 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
It is signed, "Yours sincerely, Alain Jolicoeur."  
Perhaps we could all have copies as we go along.  
I only received one. 
Would you like to receive yours now, Senator Lynch-Staunton?  
No, I will receive mine along with everyone else.  
Shall the title be postponed?  
Shall clause 1, the short title, be postponed?  
Shall clause 2 carry?  
Shall clause 3 carry?  
Shall clause 5 carry?  
Shall clause 6 carry?  
Shall clause 7 carry?  
Mr. Chairman, I wish to speak to this clause. 
Parliament always embarks upon legislation of this kind with very considerable reluctance. 
We all know that. 
That is unpleasant enough as a matter of principle. 
This is a bad precedent that we are establishing today. 
That answer is always the clincher.  
Possibly that problem could be identified. 
I am in the hands of the Chair on how to deal with that.  
With leave, I suggest that the names be attached to the record.  
Yes, that is perfectly agreeable.  
(For text of document, see Appendix p. 2994.)  
We just received this legislation.  
I am talking about the general representations that were made.  
I am just making a general comment.  
I am making a specific one.  
This is probably true for some provinces. 
There have been unfortunate inconveniences, we all agree. 
It is a question of judgment. 
Shall clause 7 carry?  
All those in favour of clause 7? 
Ask them to please stand.  
I do not think we stand in Committee of the Whole. 
I think the clerk must take the count 
Those in favour of clause 7, please stand. 
We will take a count. 
We do not take the names down formally.  
Those in favour of clause 7, 30; those opposed, 26.  
I declare clause 7 carried.  
Shall clause eight carry?  
Shall clause 9 carry?  
Shall clause 10 carry?  
Shall clause 12 carry?  
Shall Clause 13 carry?  
Shall Clause 14 carry?  
Shall Clause 15 carry?  
Shall Clause 16 carry?  
Shall Clause 17 carry?  
Shall Clause 18 carry?  
Shall Clause 19 carry?  
Shall Clause 20 carry?  
Motion in Amendment Negatived 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
( a ) by replacing lines 10 to 26 with the following: 
( b ) by replacing lines 27 and 28 with the following: 
(2) The terms and conditions prescribed under subsection (1) constitute a new; and 
May I have a copy of the amendment, Senator Kinsella?  
I have the motion in amendment. 
I do not think we have to distribute it.  
I would like to speak to the motion in amendment.  
I will take advantage of the amendment to make a comment. 
I will put the motion. 
All those in favour of the motion in amendment, please rise. 
All of those opposed to the motion in amendment, please rise.  
You may take your seats. 
On the motion, yeas 26, nays 35. 
I declare the motion lost.  
Were there any abstentions? 
I forgot to ask. 
I declared the motion lost.  
Shall clause 20 carry?  
Shall clause 21 carry?  
Shall clause 22 carry?  
Shall clause 23 carry?  
Shall clause 24 carry?  
Shall clause 25 carry?  
Shall clause 26 carry?  
Shall clause 27 carry?  
Shall Schedule 1 carry?  
Shall Schedule 2 carry?  
Shall clause 1, the short title, carry?  
Shall the title carry?  
Shall I report the bill without amendment?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, the sitting of the Senate is resumed.  
Report of the Committee of the Whole 
Hon. Peter A. Stollery :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. Edward M. Lawson :
Honourable senators, I wish to propose an amendment. 
I propose this amendment more out of disappointment than anger. 
There is no need for this legislation.  
Why would you risk a dangerous precedent like this when it is unnecessary? 
Give collective bargaining a chance to work.  
Motion in Amendment Negatived on Division 
Hon. Edward M. Lawson :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion in amendment?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those in favour of the motion please say "yea"?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those opposed to the motion please say "nay"?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
As I hear it, the "nays" have it.  
And two honourable senators having risen.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is there agreement on the length of the bell? 
Motion in amendment of Senator Lawson negatived on the following division: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I declare the motion in amendment lost.  
The question before the Senate now is on the main motion. 
Does any other honourable senator wish to speak on the main motion?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
In fact, since the agreement was reached on Tuesday evening, strike activity has intensified.  
There was also heavy picketing at many correctional facilities. 
The second issue I want to deal with is the position of correctional workers. 
It is part and parcel of the normal collective bargaining process.  
The government's preference is a negotiated agreement, and the legislation reflects that.  
Honourable senators, this legislation was originally introduced to deal with a very difficult situation. 
Hon. Edward M. Lawson :
However, that is not the primary issue. 
I give you that caution.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I wish to make a correction. 
We have been receiving conflicting evidence on this. 
There is a contradiction there. 
If the document was signed, why is the government now reneging on it?  
It is my understanding that it was an administrative error.  
That is not an administrative error.  
That is my understanding, honourable senators. 
I will have to seek further clarification on that. 
That is what Senator Lawson is talking about. 
That is unheard of.  
We have this comfort letter which sets out the basis of the settlement. 
Senator Graham spoke, then Senator Lawson spoke. 
Honourable senators, I wish to ask a question of Senator Graham. 
Thereafter, Senator Lynch-Staunton asked his questions. 
I still wish to ask questions of Senator Graham.  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, I would like to speak at third reading. 
I do not feel compelled to make long speeches on every issue. 
This is what the Senate is all about. 
So, I will spare you a very long speech on these legal issues.  
I want to be on the record as fully sharing his view.  
That is the beauty of the Senate.  
I was impressed by some of the interventions I was able to catch today. 
Again, I fully share the views expressed by Senator Lawson. 
I can see what will happen. 
My honourable colleague says that I may be sitting alone. 
Someday I may force my honourable friend to sit alone, too. 
However, I will not go that far in using the rules.  
Thank you, again, Senator Lawson for sharing with us your great experience.  
Hon. John G. Bryden :
We have both been at the bargaining table many times. 
On my part, I sometimes represented my friend's organization. 
However, there are some interesting facts here. 
There is no guarantee that people will always act in good faith.  
Is my honourable friend right, honourable senators? 
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
Honourable senators, I have a question for Senator Bryden.  
That is my understanding. 
Honourable senators, there is a trust factor in all of this. 
We would not have undermined the right to strike or the right to negotiate.  
I ask my honourable friend for his comment on that.  
I will comment on it, honourable senators.  
I am not sufficiently familiar with the circumstances and the details. 
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
The strike of the gain handlers came at a very difficult time for farmers. 
We had a very difficult winter. 
Our elevators were plugged and in many places still are. 
I understand there are seven ships waiting to be loaded. 
This will cost the farmers demurrage. 
My actions here today are based on that thinking.  
May I respond to Senator Bryden?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I am sorry, Senator Lawson, you have already spoken.  
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Shall I say on division?  
The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate that the following communication had been received: 
Secretary to the Governor General 
Foreign Publishers Advertising Services Bill 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
I wish to make a couple of remarks.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Business of the Senate 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Except as provided elsewhere in these rules, the following motions are debatable: 
In other words, the reference of a bill is not a debatable motion. 
I only raise that point for future consideration.  
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration 
Thirty-Second Report of Committee Adopted 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I ask for some explanation of what is in this report.  
Privileges, Standing Rules and Orders 
Consideration of Ninth Report of Committee-Debate Continued 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
I shall give no speech today. 
I would hope that leadership on both sides will come to terms. 
In my case, this has been dragging on for almost six years. 
I am ready to speak with Senator Robertson on this issue.  
On motion of Senator Kinsella, for Senator Robertson, debate adjourned.  
Bill to Amend-Consideration of Report of Committee-Debate Continued 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
On motion of Senator Carstairs, debate adjourned.  
Review of Nuclear Weapons Policies 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
On motion of Senator Di Nino, debate adjourned.  
Recent Decision of Supreme Court of Canada- Inquiry-Debate Suspended 
( f ) to the nation-wide, extensive commentary and public discussion on the matter; and 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Both judges and senators are appointed by ministers of the Crown. 
However, different considerations pertain to judges and senators. 
Both have different law-making powers. 
Once accorded that independence, they take on entirely different public duties.  
Thus was the vision of the founding fathers of Confederation.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.  
May it please Your Honour: 
To which bills I humbly request Your Honour's assent.  
The House of Commons withdrew.  
The Honourable the Deputy Governor General was pleased to retire.  
Recent Decision of Supreme Court of Canada-Inquiry-Debate Continued 
( f ) to the nation-wide, extensive commentary and public discussion on the matter; and 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Honourable senators, I continue my remarks from where I left off.  
Honourable senators, I digress. 
In that sense, Parliament continues to reign supreme. 
In his article of some years ago entitled, "Judicial Free Speech:
Justifiable Limits," Professor Russell wrote the following: 
Liberty depends on enjoying rights under law. 
It is the judiciary's function to provide such adjudication. 
To do so, the judiciary must be as independent and impartial as possible.  
Judicial independence and impartiality cannot be absolutes. 
To again quote Peter Russell: 
He entered these instructive words in his diary, dated January 11, 1943: 
Judges must be independent by the absolute appearance of impartiality. 
They must stand outside the daily political fray. 
Obviously, this has been a matter of some great debate.  
It deals with the issue of judicial free speech. 
Supreme Court Justices McLachlin, Sopinka and Wilson are recent examples.  
This is the question of utilization of free speech. 
Professor Friedland went on to state: 
See A. Wayne MacKay, "Judicial Free Speech and Accountability:
Should Judges Be Seen but Not Heard?" 
In a speech by Justice Sopinka, "Must a Judge be a Monk?"  
This was addressed to the Canadian Bar Association on March 3, 1989. 
At page 8, Justice Sopinka said: 
This was his assumption for speaking out. 
He cannot be allowed to speak from the shelter of a judgeship."  
In chapter 9 of The Court in Country , entitled "The Charter:
The author goes on to say this about that quote: 
In bluntest terms, two very different models of democracy are at stake.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
May I have leave to continue, Your Honour?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme:
Is it a long yes? 
I need several minutes.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
I thank you, Senator Prud'homme and others.  
I was a volunteer advisor to the minister at that time. 
In 1994, the Canadian Judges Conference stated: 
However, this still would not wholly satisfy any objective test of impartiality.  
Maybe this is an idea whose time has come.  
I have a question for him.  
I realize that in the United Kingdom statute law is supreme. 
The Honourable Senator Stewart raises an important point. 
However, they have a very mixed system.  
On motion of Senator Kinsella, for Senator Nolin, debate adjourned.  
Committee Authorized to Permit Electronic Coverage of Deliberations 
Leave having been given to revert to Notices of Motions: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honorable senators?  
Role of Canadian Judicial Council 
Media Comments-Inquiry-Debate Continued 
Hon. Anne C. Cools rose pursuant to notice of Thursday, March 18, 1999: 
That she will call the attention of the Senate: 
( d ) to the matter of justices' public statements in the media; and 
Chief Justice McEachern's letter states: 
Honourable senators, Chief Justice McEachern is a fine judge, and a fine man. 
Public posturing by justices is objectionable. 
...Canada's future would have been more assured.  
About the role of the Supreme Court in this decision, Mr. Trudeau said: 
Mr. Trudeau gave us a solemn and ponderous criticism of the court, saying: 
He asks for public confidence in Chief Justice Antonio Lamer. 
However, the problem eludes him. 
Honourable senators, I turn now to the judicial condition in Canada. 
Judicial activism has been aggressive and dominant for the past decade. 
Neither can they plead confidence in this judges' or that justices' personal integrity. 
The problem is in the judicial condition of Canada. 
I believe that justices must uphold the same principles.  
I shall speak to this matter in the future.  
Some clarification is needed. 
The Charter made no such command. 
It is constitutional vandalism.  
He raises Chief Justice Lamer's flag, as the trustee of the public interest. 
That is at the heart of the controversy. 
Did the accused in R. v. Ewanchuk get justice in that case? 
Did activism, ideology, and ideological feminism have a role? 
If so, what role, and who answers these questions?  
Chief Justice McEachern's letter proves this.  
Parliament alone represents the public's and citizens' representative interest.  
Section 99(1) reads: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I believe there is agreement not to see the clock.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Please continue, Senator Cools.  
In closing, I shall illustrate my point about the political nature of this controversy. 
Warring of all kinds is politics, usually bad politics.  
On motion of Senator Carstairs, for Senator Sparrow, debated adjourned.  
Fiftieth Anniversary of Confederation-Inquiry 
The agreement was scheduled to come into effect on 31 March 1949. 
Every Newfoundlander over 50...was 
This is what he wrote: 
Honourable senators, times do change. 
The number of people living on relief continued to increase until 1939. 
There was growing public opposition to its commission. 
I had no particular desire to go to Newfoundland. 
Several new Canadian bases were also built. 
By 1942, there was a budget surplus. 
The government began to improve services.  
Honourable senators, you know the result. 
Therefore, Confederation came to be.  
Newfoundlanders rant and roar over Confederation, 1946-48."  
This is what his son writes: 
Especially in the outports, he was treated as a new Messiah. 
What was it that Joey Smallwood offered to the people of Newfoundland? 
What did he use his rhetorical ability for? 
When he spoke of the advantages of Confederation, he promised family allowances. 
He promised old age pensions for the retired. 
I quote Rand Dyck again.  
Mr. Smallwood gave this reply: 
I like Mr. Cashin. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Special Committee Authorized to Extend Date of Final Report 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Motion in Amendment Adopted 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Thus, I can then have an opportunity to question Senator Forrestall.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion in amendment?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
We are back to the main motion, as amended.  
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion as amended?  
Motion agreed to, as amended.  
Leave having been granted to return to notices of motion of the government: 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, April 13, 1999, at 2 p.m.
