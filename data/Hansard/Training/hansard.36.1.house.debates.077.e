GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
SPECIAL IMPORT MEASURES ACT 
BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1998 
Alberta is going to use its this fall to elect senators in waiting. 
However, there is no requirement for the Prime Minister to recognize that elected person.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
TAX EXEMPTION FOR VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTERS 
Mr. Gerard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):
Volunteer firefighters often represent a community's only firefighting force. 
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
Mr. David Iftody (Provencher, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
I am pleased to discharge my duties today by presenting to this House a petition.  
Mr. Speaker, I ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
The transportation industry is a vital component of our economy. 
Every work day 2.3 million tonnes of freight are on the move in Canada. 
This is a significant reality for the shipping industry.  
It is also one of the oldest pieces of Canadian legislation. 
When enacted in 1936 this legislation was based on 1896 British merchant shipping law. 
That is in that legislation. 
The Canada shipping community of course deserves better.  
Two, to make the act consistent with federal regulatory policies. 
Three, to contribute to the economic performance of the marine industry. 
This government is committed to action. 
As I mentioned earlier our approach to reform is in fact a two track process. 
This is a futuristic departure from the current paper log system.  
Other provisions will be incorporated into the second track of the reforms.  
It will also improve the corporation's ability to manage the pension fund.  
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
There is no question the existing act is obsolete. 
The replacement part I will modernize the ship registration system. 
Another quaint Canadian custom is being eliminated.  
The registry certainly needs updating. 
There are currently 45,000 entries on the ship registry, which is a physical impossibility. 
There are not that many vessels in Canadian waters. 
Now the nation's ships, like its citizens, will be objects of computerized lists.  
Ships can be reinstated too. 
Don't leave home without your licence.  
Under the current CSA certificates of registration do not expire. 
The minister will continue to appoint tonnage measures to calculate a ship's tonnage. 
We already have zebra mussels and lamprey eels in the Great Lakes. 
Perhaps these regulations will be prevent future ecological disasters. 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
I am not going to cry over spilt milk. 
I am pleased to see it back on the order paper. 
My speech will not have a negative tone-on the contrary. 
So it is important to have legislation that reflects economic imperatives. 
In terms of economic development, shipping is vital. 
I will come back to this later, in any case.  
Let us now look at the main features of this reform. 
On the face of it, this idea does not present any problems. 
You will see in a moment to whom I am referring.  
Last year, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans held consultations. 
We know how this is done. 
This does not keep it from making stupid or arbitrary decisions. 
I call upon the public to be vigilant as well.  
There is no longer any reference in Bill C-15 to pleasure craft. 
The Bloc Quebecois is not opposed to having big boats registered. 
This is absolutely scandalous. 
You will be charging people for services they are not getting''.  
That is totally crazy.  
I tell them to watch out. 
The Bloc does not criticize for the pleasure of it. 
I have a background in labour relations. 
I have worked with labour unions. 
I give him my party's word on this. 
However, people should watch out. 
This government can hide things from any of us. 
The Bloc Quebecois will have to think up a strategy in this respect.  
Quebec closed two of Canada's three largest shipyards. 
So, Quebec is the only province to have acted thus. 
All this took place under the Conservatives. 
Conservative or Liberal, it is six of one and half a dozen of the other.  
There are people in Quebec who have clear ideas on the issue. 
We would have liked the federal government to follow the Government of Quebec's lead. 
But there is nothing from the federal government. 
Pilots' groups had long called for this. 
Bloc Quebecois members can only indicate our approval of this provision. 
I do not think the pilots were asking for charity. 
All they wanted was for their pension plan to move into the next century. 
I have no reason to think he will do otherwise.  
I will even go a bit further. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Questions have been raised with regard to that response. 
I will note some of these questions and concerns. 
These powers have already been divided.  
A tax free status at the corporate level sounds familiar.  
Second, it calls for a flexible manning regime. 
What exactly does that mean? 
I am almost afraid to ask. 
Finally, it calls for the application of ship safety standards that are genuinely international. 
We need legislation from the government to ensure this does not happen.  
Registration should be required for all vessels towing field barges or other hazardous goods. 
It is important for the safety of our waterways. 
This has led to an increasing number of tour boats. 
These boats might be under 15 tonnes. 
Let there be no misunderstanding. 
I am not suggesting the small pleasure craft need to be inspected. 
This section is contrary to the stated objections of the new act. 
Privatization of inspection will not encourage viable, effective and economic marine transportation. 
Yet every one of these ships had valid certificates issued by a classification society. 
Yet, as the crews are mostly from third world countries, we rarely hear of it.  
Are we ready to accept such a system in Canada?  
We suffer from the cuts to airports. 
We suffer from the privatization of port police. 
Are we now going to have to suffer because ship safety will go down? 
We cannot put our safety and our environment in jeopardy. 
A figure of $12 million per annum has been stated. 
We do not have an equivalent act in Canada to protect Canadian interests. 
So much for free trade.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
The government chose to carry out the reforms in a two-step approach. 
The minister may set limits on the fees and expenses charged.  
This is something to consider and watch for in the future.  
Certificates of registry will have an expiry date. 
We would encourage caution here. 
We are very pleased to hear this.  
We are pleased with certain aspects of the legislation. 
Clauses pertaining to definitions are important. 
Therefore we think this is good.  
We support the bill. 
It is long overdue. 
However, it is here now and we support most of it. 
Certain parts of the bill warrant further analysis at committee. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Accordingly the bill stands referred to the Standing Committee on Transport.  
CANADIAN PARKS AGENCY ACT 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
This account will be used to finance new parks and national historic sites. 
It will have to repay these advances subject to current interest rates.  
Their present job is guaranteed by Treasury Board for two years. 
It is not the intention of this government to either privatize or commercialize Parks Canada. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Quoting them, they use words such as business-like manner.  
Words like program review are hidden. 
No, the Liberals know a lot better than that. 
It will create a lot of trouble. 
The repercussions will take several years to recover from.  
Our parks are a sacred sanctuary. 
Our parks are a part of our national identity. 
Our parks help us define what it means to be Canadian. 
The New Democrats supported it wholeheartedly. 
The reason this bill is being introduced is for financial deficits and cutbacks. 
The finance minister stated several weeks ago that we have reached a balanced approach. 
But we never know where this roller coaster is going to go. 
User fees will skyrocket. 
Canadians are angry that our national legacies are not being protected. 
The legacy of national parks needs to protected. 
It cannot be measured by dollar value.  
Bill C-29 does not seem to be the answer. 
Why should we consider something like that? 
That has to stop. 
Let us stop it at the national parks. 
These are important symbols of our identity. 
We must think long and hard before we embark on this path.  
Why is this necessary? 
Can we not fix the current problems identified by the recent round of consultations? 
No, they did not mention anything like that. 
Again they are not mentioning that the agency is not for privatization.  
Services will be eliminated and there will be user fee hikes. 
That is the mentality of business-like corporations.  
That is exactly what is happening.  
Canadian parks are not being privatized, but they are on the road to being commercialized. 
Let us keep the national parks as a Canadian entity. 
They are now operating on American soil, on American rail lines. 
The Canadian dream of uniting our nation has been abandoned.  
Is that where our parks are going?  
That person will oversee the agency responsible for our parks and heritage sites. 
The CEO will have exclusive hiring and firing powers. 
The CEO will also have the power to negotiate employee contracts. 
We do not know what kind of contract they will have. 
We do not know- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Yes, I am, Mr. Speaker. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
I would like to call for a quorum count.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I will ask the clerk to count the members present.  
And the count having been taken: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am advised that we have a quorum.  
The hon. member for Churchill River will have one minute to complete his remarks.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
Could the member enlighten us on that?  
I thank the hon. member for raising that point. 
Nobody has any idea. 
We are opening the door to an insecure future. 
There is no vision of what our national parks will be. 
We have not achieved the percentage of lands to be set aside.  
It is uncharted waters and it is a scary thought.  
All of these parks will be impacted as well as future parks. 
But at what cost? 
Who is going to design and manage them? 
It will be the chief executive officer. 
He will be negotiating contracts with the staff. 
We are giving him two years to come up with it.  
What happens to the employees? 
They will be operating without a contract. 
Who do they fall under? 
Who will decide how to procure these lands? 
That is a scary thought.  
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
I saddens me to see the direction our parks are taking today.  
I am giving you the real facts, for I lived them. 
I was the person who took money at the entrance. 
They had to turn their cars around and leave. 
That is where things have got to today. 
Today, they are in the process of being destroyed. 
Our parks are now being destroyed.  
It is absolutely false.  
We must also look at the reasons why national parks were established. 
Often, they are the main employer.  
There are other reasons that explain what the government is doing. 
I can see it coming. 
I can also see how the human aspect is absent from our parks. 
Fees are unbelievably high and they are not consistent across the country. 
In some parks they are very high, compared to other places.  
I heard people's concerns. 
No one likes this system. 
It goes against what we believe. 
All Canadians should have access to our national parks. 
This access should not depend on their income.  
We changed the rules and you will no longer have access to anything''. 
I was also one of those who were expropriated from Kouchibouguac national park. 
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I congratulate the member for Beausejour-Petitcodiac on a very caring speech.  
I raised this issue earlier with the NDP member. 
Will it be the same with the new agency? 
We are standing on a slippery slope. 
In fact, this is where we are heading.  
The chief executive officer has exclusive authority. 
We clearly have to figure out exactly what the Liberal government is up to here. 
It is trying to pull a fast one, as we say.  
However, some members of this House can see exactly what is going on. 
It is not fair, and that is a fact. 
That is quite obvious. 
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
This bill will also make consequential amendments to other acts.  
We have to rethink a number of things.  
It takes four and a half hours to walk to the statue.  
During the last few decades, funding was haphazard. 
I remind the hon. members that Parks Canada was not even officially recognized. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
There a number of very poor Canadian families in the country. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his important comments.  
He alluded to poverty. 
I do not come from a very wealthy region. 
Fees will be charged, but there is a downside. 
Some major infrastructures are necessary to make it easier for the tourists. 
I really appreciate the hon. member's question. 
Mr. John Godfrey (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
The Canadian Parks Agency will differ from the existing organization in two significant ways.  
The agency will still be audited by the office of the auditor general.  
To this end new flexibilities are being created. 
Once again, I am picking up on what the hon. member for Chicoutimi has said.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Five members have indicated a desire to speak on questions and comments. 
If we have a chance, we will go to the member for Churchill River. 
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will try to make it quick. 
We are very proud of it.  
Is there some formula? 
Mr. Speaker, the first question was about the expansion of the parks system. 
As the member indicated, these are complex matters with many layers. 
Two things can be said on the second point of user fees. 
It is a mandate of the parks not to charge more than the service costs. 
In other words they are not designed to be profit centres. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the answer is straightforward. 
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
The proposal seems to make some move toward organizational simplicity and administrative efficiency. 
There seems to be a delayering and more financial accountability.  
The parliamentary secretary said that they are in the process of planning. 
I hear this so often from the government. 
Mr. Speaker, let us talk about planning in two ways. 
This has been a difficult period for Parks Canada. 
That period is over. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Is that going to be changed?  
The chief executive officer has exclusive rights. 
It could be the chief executive officer. 
It is a practice which is simply being reincarnated in the proposed legislation.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
This rarely happens on the other side though.  
Canada is a country filled with natural wonders. 
People come from around the world to take in the beauty of our country. 
Let me explain why.  
It will have access to $10 billion for parks and historic sites. 
As well, third party operators will be permitted to administer certain facilities. 
This in turn will allow for the establishment and expansion of new initiatives. 
This is how the government should work when it comes to areas such as this.  
The agency will be able to bargain directly with its employees. 
The auditor general will be able to audit the agency at his discretion.  
The maintaining of our environment is also very important.  
The agency will consult directly with parties that may be affected by any new fees. 
It was my pleasure to support that bill. 
I firmly believe that we have a moral duty to preserve Canada's natural environment.  
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
How much hope do we have in the government?  
We are allowing the government to do that.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It tends to keep tempers down.  
Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to respond to the hon. member's question.  
He is right, I said hope. 
I did not give a full commitment about that. 
He is right regarding the question about whether this agency is going to consult people. 
There is still a bureaucratic tangle over there. 
Some will say they do not trust those people.  
That is important to us. 
Parks are a natural heritage. 
We have parks here that are world heritage sites. 
We are custodians of these parks for the people of the world.  
The people will be the custodians, not private enterprise.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
This is a good point.  
That is why we are supporting this one good idea of the government. 
The government should start looking into this and doing these kinds of things more often.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
I believe him to be a sincere member of Parliament. 
I believe that what he was stating was what he feels is accurate and true.  
These are the same folks who were against NAFTA, for example. 
When a government says trust it, I become very suspicious. 
It is not a reflection on my hon. friend. 
What is behind all of this? 
Why would he want to change the name Parks Canada? 
I think that is Canada. 
Our national parks are sort of a Canadian icon that we leave for future generations.  
It is a tremendously and wonderfully beautiful province. 
Vast parts of it will now be preserved for generations and generations to come.  
Is this act intended to improve the situation? 
We take this very seriously. 
As New Democrats we have studied Bill C-29. 
That is the reality. 
That is what is taking place today.  
They are dedicated to the environment and to the work that they do.  
We are saying it is a job we attach little significance to. 
That is what we are telling them.  
I think it should be the reverse but that is the reality.  
We talk about improved financial procedures. 
That is scary language. 
It means less money. 
With this legislation, we are now going to make it even more difficult.  
Section 24 of the act deals with the fees. 
That is the consultation. 
Maybe she is going to consult with the hon. House leader for the government. 
Maybe it is going to be the CEO of the Royal Bank. 
We do not know.  
This does not mean that fees are going to go down. 
It means I suppose how quickly they are going to increase. 
Is that the kind of country we have become? 
Is that the kind of place Canada has become? 
Yes it is and this legislation will simply make it worse.  
This legislation is scary. 
However, we will have to wait and see.  
That is simply not true. 
It is not called privatization, it is called commercialization. 
It is a new word. 
We will call it a commercialization. 
That is what it means. 
That is what it is.  
That is not what Canada is all about.  
I want to close my remarks by saying let me look at this government. 
As a matter of fact, we have some billions of dollars in surplus. 
It is not positive. 
Next year, it looks like it will be at some unimaginable level.  
Why would it continue to lay off park employees? 
They tell us it is.  
Still they want to impose this kind of damage on our park system. 
There are some serious inconsistencies here.  
There is no other police force in the world any better than the RCMP. 
What did the government decide to do? 
Disney now has the right to market Mounties around the world. 
The government endorsed it. 
It liked this idea. 
That is where we are. 
``We sold out the image Mountie to Walt Disney. 
Okay, we have done that''. 
There goes a little Canadian heritage out the window. 
``Why not privatize the national parks? 
We will call it commercialization or we will call it a special agency''.  
We have talked about it in caucus at some length.  
I will watch my friends in the Reform Party. 
They are sensitive people in certain areas.  
We will watch them because this is the chance. 
How do we vote in terms of the future of Parks Canada?  
This is the question. 
We will decide it on this vote.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Is there a possibility of foreign interests getting involved in our parks system?  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for that very thoughtful and insightful question. 
Obviously the answer is yes. 
That is only part of the problem. 
The real problem is the chill effect of that threat. 
It will chicken out.  
I appreciate the question from my hon. friend.  
Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):
The member has some beautiful national parks in his province. 
I appreciate the seriousness of my colleague's question. 
The member should be proud to live in such a province.  
His question is well taken. 
The glaring shortcoming, as my friend point out, is well taken. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Accordingly the bill stands referred to the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage.  
Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Third, the amendments will strengthen oversight and review the administration of military justice.  
Each set of figures performs a discrete function in the criminal justice system. 
Each of these figures can be found in the military justice system. 
This has meant that he played an active role in the administration of individual cases.  
To this end there are five important features of the bill. 
It will remove the minister from the day to day administration of individual cases. 
Let us look at the minister's role. 
This includes responsibility for administration of military justice. 
Bill C-25 implements that recommendation. 
I would now like to address the responsibility of the judge advocate general. 
The judge advocate general will supervise the overall provision of these services. 
I urge all members to support Bill C-25.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Bill C-25 amends the Department of National Defence Act. 
These are the things the government says this legislation will do.  
To be fair, there are some positive changes in this bill. 
I will focus on three areas. 
Substantial amendments to the bill are needed. 
To demonstrate this I am going to focus on three areas.  
A critical area is that of implementing the position of an independent inspector general. 
Unfortunately it is not included anywhere in the legislation.  
There currently is an inspector general. 
It is important to clarify this. 
The powers are very narrow. 
We see a very substantive role. 
He has completely missed this critical aspect of the Somalia inquiry.  
We have excellent men and women serving in the military. 
We have some excellent people in command positions in the military.  
We certainly saw this as we travelled with the defence committee.  
That was another separate position that was recommended in the Somalia inquiry.  
The minister still has not followed through on that commitment. 
Rectification of problems continues to remain within the chain of command. 
The Dean Marsaw case, which was a well publicized case, points that out. 
They can be assured that there will only be positives that will come from this''. 
That is what they said.  
What did they do? 
They sent a threatening letter to Simone Olofson. 
They criticized her in the strongest terms for presenting before the committee. 
This woman works on the base in Cold Lake on a contract basis. 
She is not a member of the forces. 
They can go through the list. 
This could have come from the minister. 
It could have come from any rank higher than this person. 
The minister said he apologized for it. 
What Reform has said on this is that this office needs to be independent. 
We have been calling for that to be clearly separated.  
That independence just is not there. 
That is pretty clear. 
We have some great concerns about this office of the judge advocate general.  
It is clearly not there. 
His words just do not match up with what is in the legislation. 
I will go through that step by step. 
That is what is stated partly in this legislation.  
Instead of making things better, it is pretty clear that this legislation makes things worse. 
It narrows the pool even more.  
There is a problem with these changes, other than just the narrowing of the pool. 
The JAG will still be within the chain of command. 
He will have three levels of officers above him. 
He will be outranked by approximately 25 individuals. 
What we called for is more independence. 
We suggested that the JAG be taken out of the normal chain of command.  
If that does not happen, he will be outranked by 25 people. 
We know what that means in the military. 
The rank system still allows for influence to be held over the JAG. 
In fact, these changes will allow that to become law.  
The present minister has already recognized the problem inherent in these amendments. 
The best person for the job may not be able to fill the position. 
The third area is that of the military police. 
Judge Warren was commissioned to report on the military police. 
It is another glaring gap in this legislation.  
I have talked about some of the specific problems with this legislation. 
It must appear in words. 
I want to ask the following of any of the government members. 
In fact, one would have to look back a long way. 
My guess would be about 30 years. 
Give some credit to the Conservatives. 
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
A number of cultural presentations from the different regions were also present.  
The Arctic winter games provide- 
The hon. member for Calgary East.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Racism divides people and weakens society.  
The Reform Party is committed to fighting racism. 
JOURNEE INTERNATIONALE DE LA FRANCOPHONIE 
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Humber-St. 
The world will be joining my riding, here with us, colleagues included. 
Mr. Speaker, you are invited as well.  
We will start off the brand new 1999 with Soiree '99. 
Mr. Speaker, you are invited to that as well. 
We are ahead of our time, Mr. Speaker. 
That is the best offer I have had today. 
The hon. member for Cariboo-Chilcotin.  
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
It is not hard to understand why. 
Two hundred and seventy-eight people will lose their jobs. 
British Columbians are suffering. 
What does this government care? 
British Columbians demand changes- 
The hon. member for Simcoe-Grey.  
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, today I rise to point out a disgraceful act. 
The Prime Minister of Canada is considered to be a man of integrity. 
He is one of the most highly respected politicians in Canada and in the world. 
It is this simple. 
Those words are not permitted in the House of Commons. 
I would like you to withdraw those last words.  
If they would withdraw their comments, Mr. Speaker. 
I would ask you specifically to withdraw those words.  
I withdraw those words, Mr. Speaker. 
LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION 
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Shame on the leader of the Reform Party.  
CONSEIL DU STATUT DE LA FEMME 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
In Quebec, the Conseil du statut de la femme is an important institution. 
The hon. member for Saanich-Gulf Islands.  
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Let us talk about the facts. 
Let us talk about this Liberal dismal record.  
LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Its antics have shown otherwise. 
Canadians deserve honest and responsible representation. 
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
These brilliant columnists want the Bloc Quebecois out of the House of Commons. 
Their wish to do away with sovereignists in Ottawa would be fulfilled even sooner.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
The banks say bigger is better. 
They talk about providing better service at a better price.  
LEADER OF REFORM PARTY 
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Shame on the Leader of the Reform Party.  
Yesterday, we saw the true face of the Leader of the Opposition. 
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
SIMCOE NORTH FRANCOPHONE COMMUNITY 
Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):
Long live the French-speaking community in Simcoe North and long live the Canadian francophonie.  
Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
The Liberals are being a touch sensitive about the lucky lackey in the Senate. 
David Black served on Viceroy's board of directors with the Prime Minister. 
He says that Viceroy rewarded the Prime Minister with shares. 
It is even legal.  
Why did he say it?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
He broke his promise to end Senate patronage.  
It is unbelievable the upset these Liberals are feigning. 
He actually stepped outside and talked to reporters. 
Too bad he did not stay to answer their requests.  
The Prime Minister said he received no remuneration. 
This is a simple question. 
David Black admitted that the Prime Minister was rewarded. 
Why is he still saying that?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, again I return to the real issue. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I think we can get third time lucky here. 
I know if I make my friend a millionaire he will become a Tory''. 
This latest millionaire appointment is Liberal to the core.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
The Deputy Prime Minister.  
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the arrogance of the government has no bounds. 
It simply refuses to listen to Canadians.  
This Prime Minister did. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Yet, to my knowledge, the principle of cabinet solidarity still exists.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
But let us go back to the issue. 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, any information that is released is on the public record.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
We will recall the Le Hir episode. 
Poof-bye bye francophones! 
Any information they do not like they make disappear.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. 
Racist groups are flaunting the law by using the Internet. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is a very important question. 
We will ensure they are enforced as stringently as possible.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Internet providers should be responsible for hate material stored in their systems.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, again this is an important issue. 
It is complex from a legal point of view. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
He sounds more like President Suharto than he does the prime minister.  
When will the Prime Minister start taking some responsibility? 
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
We have gone through a very difficult period. 
We will continue that.  
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
Members are probably asking where that comes from.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
The hon. member for Okanagan-Coquihalla.  
Why is the Prime Minister treating it like it is Liberal Party property?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
The hon. member for Roberval.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
She just said that the letter she wrote was made public. 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
The member for Roberval.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, we will never know the end. 
It is she who is misleading the House. 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
The Bloc Quebecois and the Parti Quebecois should be ashamed.  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
My question is to the President of the Treasury Board. 
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
This is our policy.  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
The new policy of the government is take now and give it back later. 
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, what we have done here is very simple. 
Every household and every business knows this. 
This is the policy of this government. 
When we commit, we pay.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
That is exactly what I said. 
We will not be satisfied until every single Canadian has a job.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
We are monitoring this situation very carefully. 
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are all concerned about this issue of the Kanesatake First Nation.  
We are working in a participatory way to try to deal with this issue.  
Mr. Charles Hubbard (Miramichi, Lib.):
I come from Saskatchewan and I know how the NDP operates. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
The last cut was $1.4 billion.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Communities throughout B.C. are still waiting. 
Cities like Cranbrook have bills to pay.  
The minister blames B.C. but his excuses do not wash. 
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Environmental protection is one of the weak suits of the NDP.  
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Robert D. Nault:
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the Environment.  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am happy to respond to the question. 
The deputy minister was before the committee. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, all the regulations we put in place are enforced.  
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Revenue.  
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
I look forward to the input of Canadians and my fellow- 
The hon. member for Surrey Central.  
CANADIAN INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCY 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, CIDA gives out contracts worth billions of dollars. 
VICTIMS OF HEPATITIS C 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We have now received Mr. Justice Krever's report. 
We have accepted the recommendations concerning the department and the ways of assuming our responsibilities.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, in what is becoming a pattern the hon. member has her facts wrong.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
She did not answer that question.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
In annex A of the report the methodology is set out.  
In fact the statistics- 
The hon. member for Lanark-Carleton.  
Mr. Ian Murray (Lanark-Carleton, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
The byelection he talks about has only been in progress for a few weeks.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
I hope for similar co-operation in the future.  
We are looking forward to support on this. 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
I look forward to that.  
That component is a real show of support for and commitment to the Canadian military.  
I commented on the words. 
Money is the second key commitment that must be made by government. 
We thought that was absolutely necessary based on the financial condition of the country.  
That is completely unacceptable.  
There has been a promise to replace the search and rescue helicopters. 
What about the shipborne helicopters? 
We all know that the Sea Kings are unfit to fly. 
They just have not shown the commitment in terms of equipment and training. 
This legislation, quite frankly, does not cut it. 
It is a series of half measures. 
We oppose this legislation. 
Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert, BQ):
However, they will not have anything to say about the conduct of the armed forces.  
What will we be left with in the end? 
The threat of reprisal is not an imaginary concern. 
Corporal Purnelle and Major Armstrong were among them. 
It is the whole concept of accountability that is at stake. 
The functions of the inspector would include those of the ombudsman.  
This would have indicated a clear willingness to make changes. 
So we can forget about openness.  
We, in the Bloc Quebecois, believe that all military personnel must be treated fairly. 
Usually, summary trials are presided by commanding officers. 
It is, however, a different matter when the accused may lose his freedom.  
This right entails the right to counsel.  
The choice between a summary trial and a court martial can have serious consequences. 
When I say obliged, I am not exaggerating.  
The judge advocate general holds office up to the age of 70. 
The various judge advocates are civilian lawyers who cannot be removed. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Does the House give its unanimous consent to the tabling of this document?  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
The title of the bill does not state it all. 
A number of factors have contributed to the introduction of this bill.  
Another factor has been the adoption of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
We know that something went terribly wrong in Somalia. 
Nor would it be right to simply deny it. 
It would not be right to deny why this happened. 
All of this has happened. 
This is a fact. 
Some talented inquiring reporters broke the story. 
In 1994 the Liberal government set up the Somalia Commission of Inquiry. 
In the beginning the Liberals appeared very keen to get to the truth. 
They were going to get to the bottom of things. 
To say the least, this frustrated the commissioners. 
Nevertheless, the commission continued and the Liberal government got scared. 
They were now well into their term of office and preparing for an election call. 
We all know what happened next.  
I thought it would be appropriate to read some of the headlines into the record.  
I will set those aside.  
A second says ``Prime Minister acting in a most irresponsible fashion''. 
Another headline says ``Canada's military remains not accountable''. 
It is depressing to read these headlines. 
Another one says ``The Somalia inquiry a mess''. 
Still another says ``Cutting off the inquiry will backfire in terms of political fall-out''. 
Grits shielded from military scrutiny''.  
I guess we have to nevertheless do these things.  
Wouldn't you know it? 
The Minister of National Defence called the inquiry's work an insult. 
This bill completely ignores- 
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
I am sure the minister would be taking note of the speech some place. 
I do not see a quorum. 
Perhaps we could ring the bells.  
And the bells having rung: 
I see a quorum. 
The hon. member for Kamloops has the floor.  
I can hardly take that, Mr. Speaker. 
I have never experienced this before in my life. 
I do not want to overdo it and change their minds very quickly. 
Thank you, that is more like it.  
This might be called whistle blowing. 
There is also the matter of accountability. 
But there are positive aspects. 
We will be working hard in committee to improve the legislation.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
There are several questions which we must ask ourselves. 
The first question is perhaps the most important. 
That brings us here today. 
He said at that time the death was still a mystery to him.  
That is why we are here today. 
I do not bring up Chief Justice Dickson for no reason. 
My party agrees with Chief Justice Dickson. 
There is something drastically wrong. 
Does the bill address the need for change? 
The government did not listen. 
The government ignored this recommendation. 
The Somalia inquiry commissioners recommended that the office of the inspector general be created. 
The government ignored that recommendation as well.  
Chapter 44 is entitled ``The Need for a Vigilant Parliament''. 
The government might want an example and this might surprise it. 
My party calls it an inspector general to act as an ombudsman. 
And still this government does not act. 
If passed, will this bill work in a practical way? 
I hope the government does not interfere with this process.  
They are experts and they have something to add to this bill. 
But that is not all. 
I hope the government takes my party's suggestions seriously.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
It deals primarily with the military justice system. 
This operational reality has specific implications for military justice.  
Discipline is the lifeblood of any military organization. 
It promotes effectiveness and efficiency. 
The government looked closely at these events and has acted decisively.  
It has been asked what about the inspector general recommendation. 
It will enable the minister to focus on other duties and responsibilities.  
They are people who are being well trained to carry out that function.  
Reform of the summary trial process is already well under way. 
Bill C-25 will recognize the judicial nature of the courts martial. 
As such, it will eliminate the position of president of the courts martial panels. 
These people are well qualified to do that.  
The first is the military police complaints commission. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
The minister proposed that there be an ombudsman. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
There is an ombudsman who indeed will be independent. 
The person will be independent and will be from outside the Canadian forces. 
That I call accountability and transparency. 
It addresses the issue of the examination of what is going on in the military.  
I am not afraid to have people looking over the shoulders of the military. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
This appointment seems to exactly hit on what the minister is looking for. 
It has the element of a civilian and the element of a former military person.  
He is praised in this release as being an extremely competent man. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:
Mr. Speaker, given that the hon. member once worked for him- 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:
Mr. Pitzul has considerable experience in the military. 
He spent most of his legal career in the military. 
He has been a judge. 
That adds to the depth and experience he brings to this position. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
That 80% figure is probably a bit erroneous. 
In this country mutiny can be very serious. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The minister of defence.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:
We are implementing over 80% of the recommendations.  
The member talks about the other 20%. 
We are by and large implementing all the recommendations. 
We have covered them with other positions.  
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
I think this is important. 
What is wrong with our own courts? 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton:
I thank the hon. member for the question. 
In some cases they may be abroad at the time. 
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
Later in life I also served in the Canadian Armed Forces Reserve.  
I come to this debate with a little knowledge regarding the forces. 
Currently, Canada has some 1,300 troops located in Bosnia. 
Recently we sent a small contingent to the Persian Gulf.  
They do Canadians proud each and every day of the week.  
I congratulate the entire crew of the HMCS Okanagan for a job well done.  
This is certainly a tremendous sacrifice for them and their families. 
I do not think that is fair to our men and women in the forces. 
They deserve much better.  
The first problem is that the bill creates more bureaucracy. 
That is not good enough.  
I think Canadians are pretty fed up with order in council appointments. 
Another problem is with the office of the judge advocate general. 
Currently the judge advocate general wears three hats. 
So you can see there is a conflict of interest.  
There is only one person who can do that. 
That is the chief of defence staff. 
He is offering him legal advice. 
He is also very thankful that he received this appointment. 
We could give you many examples of why this is important.  
That is why an inspector general is so important. 
Where are they to go? 
The problem is that they have nowhere to go at all.  
This office must be filled by a civilian. 
This would be the mechanism for ensuring civilian control of the military system. 
This is a fundamental principle of Canadian society.  
The minister acknowledged that himself. 
We have frigates in the Canadian Armed Forces that are worth millions of dollars. 
We have CF-18s that are also worth millions of dollars. 
A term of 14 years is not enough. 
Canada is a nation that recognizes its obligations both internationally and domestically. 
The government has demonstrated this quite clearly through spending cuts. 
The reductions this government has imposed have hurt the Canadian Armed Forces. 
The government has done our armed forces no favours whatsoever. 
True things were coming out. 
I strongly support substantive changes to the military justice system. 
I believe that Canadians also support changes to the military justice system. 
The government now has the opportunity to address the problems. 
We will be putting forward many amendments on this bill. 
The way it stands right now, we cannot support this bill.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
It was not completely clear from his answer. 
I ask the member which is it. 
Is what has been created a new bureaucracy?  
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member for his question. 
That is what we mean by independence. 
It would be similar to a provincial ombudsman role.  
Independence is very important. 
The government's reaction to this does not meet the test of independence. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
Last week I brought this to the attention of the House.  
At the end of the letter he threatened her against continuing.  
Who indicated that the letter should be written? 
We do not know because the independence is not there.  
The system the minister has proposed is about patronage appointments, order in council appointments. 
Appointments would be given to friends of the Liberal government across the way. 
There is no independence.  
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
But Bill C-25 is primarily about military justice. 
The Dickson advisory group made two important points in this regard. 
It is these mechanisms to strengthen oversight and review which I would like to address.  
It will establish a military police code of conduct. 
This leaves the perception that the process is slow and unresponsive. 
It has also been the subject of observations in three recent reports. 
For example, it will make three important changes to the grievance system. 
First, it will clarify the circumstances in which a member may submit a grievance. 
The CDS will have the option of referring any other grievance to the board. 
The board will provide findings and recommendations and submit them to the CDS. 
The code of conduct will establish a clear standard of professional conduct for military police. 
This review will be tabled in Parliament.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
We have had the Dickson report. 
I will ask him a straight question. 
He asked what the military needs. 
The military certainly needs the tools to do the job. 
With this government it will get the tools to do the job.  
Jump start is also a good term. 
Reform wanted to reduce funding to the military. 
We talked about the JAG, the judge advocate general. 
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a comment and a question. 
My riding was one of the ridings affected by the ice storm. 
I am glad that point was made by the hon. member opposite. 
The military saved lives in my riding. 
I will say that time and time again. 
I was very proud of the Canadian military which brings me to my question. 
What problem are we trying to solve here? 
I have listened quite intently to this debate. 
Reform is very good at these rather simplistic solutions. 
Have an independent counsel. 
It will take care of itself. 
Let us think of what the Americans did during the Watergate crisis. 
This issue is not as simplistic as Reformers would have us believe. 
There are different ways of accomplishing the same goal.  
The member has a base in his riding. 
I am reluctant to interrupt the hon. member. 
The House resumed from December 11, 1997 consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
This is a motion which on the surface has some merits. 
It is one which many people have mixed feelings about. 
At the time Canada was not at war with Spain. 
We had laws prohibiting our citizens from fighting in this foreign war. 
This matter has been debated in the House before. 
Spain has publicly thanked these men who joined the international brigade. 
However, the indisputable fact is that they were soldiers of conscience. 
They went on their own to fight the fascist aggression.  
Canada was not at war. 
The Canadians who participated in the Spanish civil war did so on an individual basis. 
They let their conscience be their guide. 
We recognize the sincerity behind this motion. 
No one can fault them for that.  
They were courageous individuals. 
However, this House cannot say that the laws are wrong. 
We as a country did not support this war. 
Where would we stop? 
This would set an untenable precedent.  
Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):
I do not know where the member got that figure. 
They suffered heavy causalities. 
Only 646 returned to Canada.  
Let me make it very clear about the government's view of their efforts. 
They were not fighting for Canada. 
It was a sound policy. 
That is what it did with respect to Spain in 1937. 
I would ask hon. members to consider what kind of precedent this would set. 
What kind of example does it make for young people today? 
What message would we be sending to Canadian veterans? 
This could set an untenable precedent.  
This is an emotional issue. 
I ask my colleagues to vote against the motion. 
We mourn the loss and admire the qualities these men displayed. 
That is how the law should remain. 
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
We are at a time when our government is making apology after apology. 
The Japanese were apologized to, as should have been done. 
At that time the laws were not good. 
The minister of aboriginal affairs has just apologized to First Nations people. 
They were just obeying the law. 
No question, they did not do anything wrong but it was wrong. 
We recognize that what they did was right and it was a just cause. 
As a country we will not even look at a way to recognize it.  
Among those Canadians was Dr. Norman Bethune. 
There are only 40 of these people alive. 
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
Constant recalls living through the Great Depression. 
There were no jobs to go to. 
We students thought the political-economic system was a failure''.  
The Great Depression had a profound impact on Canadians. 
Therefore, what is at issue is not kind of people that were fighting fascism. 
We were fighting to protect the country's democratic institutions. 
Is it not in the Canadian nature to want to preserve democracy? 
Is altruism not a Canadian trait? 
Why are we still talking about the Spanish civil war in Canada today? 
Who are the veterans of the MacKenzie-Papineau battalion today? 
Following their heart-wrenching defeat, about 650 veterans returned to Canada. 
They came home to Canada and they went back 
Why cannot Canada at long last recognize these people's courage. 
Other nations have embraced their Spanish war veterans. 
He spoke of courage and innocence.  
Neither does the Royal Canadian Legion. 
I wholeheartedly agree with this important statement. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member. 
Let us reflect together on an important question. 
To the survivors, psychological and emotional redress is even more important. 
In conclusion, I would like to share with you an interesting discovery. 
``To our fallen comrades, our victory is your vengeance. 
I am very proud of their courage.  
They had the courage to stand up and be counted.  
I support this motion.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
The motion reads as follows: 
The committee will be free to make whatever recommendations it deems advisable.  
These men and women were not adventurers. 
These volunteers were fighting to protect Spain's democratic institutions. 
The word ``antifascist'' was written on their pay slips. 
The international brigades fought under the command of the legitimate Spanish government's army. 
Only half the Canadian volunteers came back. 
Money was raised to help them out and to provide the casualties with medical care. 
Within a few months, however, their sacrifice and heroism was forgotten. 
One of them became the chief instructor of the armoured tank corps in Alberta. 
Another taught officers how to read and draw maps.  
A number of parachuters dropped behind enemy lines were Spanish war veterans.  
They were punished and persecuted by the totalitarian regimes.  
They are Calgary, North York, Ottawa, Thunder Bay, Toronto, Winnipeg and Vancouver.  
That is why the Bloc Quebecois will be voting in favour of this motion.  
Mr. Carmen Provenzano (Sault Ste. Marie, Lib.):
However, having said all this, I feel obligated to oppose Motion No. 75. 
My reasons for this are simple and straightforward. 
The Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion was not a recognized unit of the Canadian Armed Forces. 
Its soldiers were not authorized members of a Canadian fighting force. 
I am not alone in holding this position. 
So too has the Royal Canadian Legion.  
However, in Motion No. 75 there seems to be a leap in logic.  
This cuts right to the heart of the matter. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I too am pleased to rise to speak on Motion No. 75. 
I think history is important. 
It does a disservice to our history. 
It was a strange and tempestuous coalition which itself came to blows internally. 
One can make no moral apology for the evil that was done in that respect.  
These are all documented incidents. 
Faithful Christians were burned alive after digging their own graves. 
Others were burned or had their eyes gouged out. 
Churches and convents were indiscriminately sacked and burned. 
That is not what the record shows.  
I call on my colleagues to oppose this motion.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Let me give a brief historical overview of this issue. 
In 1992, the number of judges sitting in Campbellton dropped from two to one. 
Normally, I would agree. 
The two levels of government are the only ones dragging their feet.  
If so, what is it waiting for to act?  
The government's inaction impacts very heavily on the human level. 
This situation cannot continue. 
The issue here is one of ensuring the effective allocation of existing judicial resources. 
There are ongoing discussions.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
I do not think there is any harm in having some competition. 
I could go on at some length. 
One could go on and on. 
I can summarize by simply saying our health care system is in serious trouble. 
Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Home care is already an integral part of our health care system. 
It is not an add-on or a new idea. 
The hon. member for Waterloo-Wellington.  
ATOMIC ENERGY CONTROL BOARD 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Ongoing concerns have been expressed in relation to the use of nuclear power in Ontario. 
I am not here to debate whether or not to use nuclear power. 
This is unacceptable to residents of Ontario.  
Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Safety has never been compromised. 
Technology is not the problem. 
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.46 p.m.)
