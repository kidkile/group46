Tuesday, March 17, 1998 
The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Then the former mayor of Ottawa added with characteristic flair: 
Luckily, it is not that difficult.  
I think of the life of a successful business woman. 
I think of the astute and committed political activist. 
No task has been too great, no contribution has been too much. 
Now to me, that is real leadership.  
However, like all leaders, we may anticipate Senator Cook has her faults. 
Probably her greatest is her honesty and plain talk. 
I stress the word "cooperation." 
Senator Johnstone has enjoyed great success in many areas. 
His business endeavours have borne much fruit. 
Senator Johnstone, we are privileged to have you join us in this chamber.  
Senator Fitzpatrick never settled for second. 
Senator Fitzpatrick, we welcome you to this place. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. Raymond J. Perrault :
As they say, it may be the luck of the Irish that the dates coincide. 
They are talented people in their own right.  
In recent years, Ross has added another industry to his list of activities. 
It is a great product.  
Hon. P. Derek Lewis :
He has been and still is active in over 30 organizations. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Late Gabrielle Leger 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Gabrielle married Jules Leger a year later. 
They were real partners. 
In 1979, she was named Chancellor of the University of Ottawa. 
Mrs. Leger died last Tuesday at the age of 81.  
Mrs. Leger has left us fond memories. 
She chaired the Jules and Paul-Emile Leger Foundation. 
She helped read the Throne Speech.  
In 1978, the Heritage Canada Foundation created the Gabrielle Leger award. 
Mrs. Leger was the Chancellor of the University of Ottawa from 1979 to 1985. 
Canada has just lost a great lady. 
International Women's Day 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
At home, Canadian women have made significant progress towards economic equality. 
By 1993, this figure had risen to 72 per cent.  
About 25 per cent of all Canadian business owners are now women.  
Ruling of House of Commons Speaker on Reform Party Initiative 
Their words are clearly code words to cover their real agenda. 
The tactics of the Reform Party as the Official Opposition are reprehensible. 
I support the decision of the Speaker in the other place. 
Participation of Canadian Athletes in 1998 Games at Nagano, Japan 
In the end, this was the most successful Paralympic games ever for Canada. 
The Paralympics were not just about medals. 
This is a story, honourable senators, which must be told across this country. 
I hope we will.  
Unemployment in Rural Canada 
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
This has not been done.  
These countries are basically stealing our markets.  
Does this government plan to destroy this rural way of life? 
Some historians refer to what took place at that time as an act of genocide. 
We can see in our own country the results of this tragedy. 
Many thousands of those people died, and were buried in Canada. 
I remember that we repaired markers, and cut the grass. 
St. Patrick was born in Britain, of Roman stock, around 389 AD. 
As a youth, he was kidnapped. 
He escaped six years later and fled to Gaul.  
He is said to have driven all the snakes from Ireland. 
Just to conclude my remarks, I want to say something about leprechauns. 
Honourable senators, the Whelans are still making a contribution. 
Ruling of House of Commons Speaker on Reform Party Initiative 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
I wish to be very clear:
Senators Stollery and Whelan were members of that house at that time. 
Believe it or not, that motion received unanimous consent, on February 14, 1973. 
He asked: "Is it really agreed? 
Really, there is unanimous consent?"  
Wherever I stand, stands the flag of Canada. 
I am proud of this country.  
What the Reform Party is doing is le triomphalisme dangereux. 
To sing O Canada !, I disagree with that. 
That was on February 14, 1973. 
That was 25 years ago.  
That is the way to respect the symbol. 
Do not put it everywhere. 
It is almost like a clarion parade that they want. 
I disagree with that.  
I repeat the same words of my friend Senator LeBreton - shame and double shame. 
I was so angry last night. 
I tried to get a line, all night, to Pamela Wallin. 
Before, they stood draped as this one right here. 
That is the way to show our respect, not to over do it. 
Otherwise you wonder what is going on.  
Last night Pamela Wallin interviewed Mr. Fotheringham. 
I could not believe what I heard from such a fine gentlemen. 
Today I say, if anyone has a contact, put us on. 
I know about the NDP and, of course, the Bloc I discard. 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
From the outset, this case has been surrounded by controversy. 
Mr. Mills was terminally ill. 
He had already been given the last rites and was suffering intense pain. 
Clearly this was overkill and an overreaction on the part of the police. 
By all accounts, Dr. Morrison is an excellent, caring individual and physician. 
Her career has in effect been ruined. 
Our legal system has failed Dr. Morrison.  
The dismissal leaves a somewhat confusing message. 
We are left with no clear guidelines. 
There is a possibility left that law is different in reality than in the book. 
Right now, it`s like reading tea leaves.  
Surely we cannot ignore his request. 
How many other doctors must be subjected to what Dr. Morrison has endured? 
How many other careers must be ruined before action is taken?  
Pages Exchange Program with House of Commons 
The Hon. the Speaker :
You will remember that Ste. Agathe was badly damaged during the 1997 flood.

Business of the Senate 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
I do not wish to press this point. 
I should like to have some assurance. 
My friend Senator Bolduc suggests that I request a firm commitment. 
That is up to that individual senator.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella , (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition):

Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham , (Leader of the Government):
To my knowledge, it is not something that has been considered to the present time. 
Decision on Relocation of Marine Atlantic Headquarters-Government Position 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
March 24 will be an interesting night. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, that is a very important question. 
Hon. Jean-Maurice Simard :
Three months ago, the Minister of Natural Resources announced and confirmed this decision. 
It was announced by agencies, boards and officials.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
On December 16, I tabled a notice of motion to discuss this project. 
I spoke to it on December 17. 
Honourable senators, the procedures that were followed were quite normal and very transparent. 
Possible Appointment of Acadian Senator 
Hon. Jean-Maurice Simard :
Honourable senators, I have another question on a different topic. 
I saw letters to this effect. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
It is the member for Burlington, Paddy Torsney. 
Welcome to the Senate.
