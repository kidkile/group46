Wednesday, May 13, 1998 
The House met at 2 p.m. 
Members sang the national anthem ] 
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
Both of these factions should be ashamed of themselves. 
Bloc and Reform listen up. 
The residents of Simcoe-Grey want a united Canada. 
On behalf of all Canadians, enough is enough. 
Stop trying to break up our country.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
CANADA-WIDE SCIENCE FAIR 1998 
Mr. Reginald Belair (Timmins-James Bay, Lib.):
I have to make a comment. 
We have to get the punchline in there first.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
These are the brain drain facts. 
One-third of its co-op computer grads are hired away by Microsoft each year.  
For us in Canada this means lower taxes.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
``An elected Senate would be an ideal one.'' 
``Canadians will not tolerate much longer the status quo. 
Even a number of senators want the Senate reformed. 
NATIONAL SPEECH AND HEARING AWARENESS MONTH 
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, May is National Speech and Hearing Awareness Month.  
I am a person who suffers from hearing loss. 
Of course this is the lighter side of what for many is a major impediment.  
I salute the 10% of Canadians who suffer from hearing loss.  
MEMBER FOR NOTRE-DAME-DE-GRACE-LACHINE 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
How dare the government make decisions for future governments. 
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
But let us not forget that this is a collective responsibility. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Some of these senior citizens are working in fast food restaurants. 
They were told by this government that they would get a full meal deal. 
The finance minister's improvements nickel and dime Canada's poorest seniors. 
I am going to recognize the hon. member for Longueuil.  
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ): 
Member spoke in sign language as follows: ] 
Mr. Speaker, May is Hearing Awareness Month. 
Let us eliminate the wall of silence.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
The minister did not want this meeting. 
He has fought full compensation for the victims tooth and nail. 
He is the one that said this file was closed.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, first, I would caution the Leader of the Opposition against engaging in speculation. 
That is something I am not going to do.  
I am going to find out from them what their approach is.  
That is our objective.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
In other words, she does not want- 
My colleagues, the hon. Leader of the Opposition has the floor.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
It is the provinces which deliver the services. 
The hon. leader knows that.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
He wants to hear what they have to say.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Beaty will notice that there was not an answer to my question.  
They have a second request. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We will do the best we can.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have already taken concrete action. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
I am thinking of South Africa in particular.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
These are very significant concrete actions.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, we shall see whether the government is interested in very concrete actions.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Tomorrow we will determine whether we can settle the matter with a new consensus.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Victims will not accept two-tier compensation. 
Canadians will not accept two-tier compensation.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will, of course, approach the meeting with an open mind. 
That is the way I have approached the subject from the outset.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
That is a remarkable achievement. 
We will bring that kind of skill and commitment to this issue as well.  
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the health minister says that this file is closed. 
On March 8 he told Debbie Duncan her son would be compensated. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
Jonathon Duncan had 16 blood transfusions between 1983 and 1986. 
So much for one tiered approaches.  
Instead the minister has hung Jonathon out to dry.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
I caution the member to be careful.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
She did not change a single section in the law. 
She did not hire one more police officer or a single social worker.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
I encourage you to do that throughout question period.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
In fact I tabled that government response yesterday. 
Yesterday I made it plain that I would be introducing legislation in the fall.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
The minister appears to have a keen grasp of the obvious. 
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
The hon. Minister of Justice has the floor.  
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
I find that very interesting.  
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. David Pratt (Nepean-Carleton, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Natural Resources.  
What is the minister doing to encourage district energy projects? 
It is one of the solutions we intend to pursue with respect to climate change.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
It has been pushing for this type of action. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
We have cancelled a pending joint ministerial committee. 
We are doing all this in conjunction with any action within G-8.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my supplementary question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Give us a strong report and we can act on it. 
You are a member of the committee.  
I encourage hon. members to please address the Chair at all times.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
They are the ones that run the health systems in the provinces. 
Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):
What is Canada doing to help the people of Sudan?  
Mr. Speaker, Canada has been providing assistance to Sudan for years. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the preceding has been a paid political announcement.  
When it comes to tax cuts, size really does matter.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
SAINT-JEAN-BAPTISTE-DE-ROUVILLE HYDRO CO-OP 
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the President of the Treasury Board.  
The same was done for Manitoba and the Saguenay region.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is to the finance minister.  
Hungry people do not need empty speeches. 
They need jobs to fill empty stomachs.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is absolutely right. 
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
That promise has not been kept. 
No charges have been laid.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
That is not how the criminal justice system works in this country.  
He did bring it to my attention. 
Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
What does he say to that?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
I know he has been preoccupied with the preparations for tomorrow's meeting. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have conferred with officials. 
In fact, my staff has seen a draft response which will be worked on further.  
I assure her we will deal with them on that basis.  
STANDING COMMITTEE ON JUSTICE AND HUMAN RIGHTS 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I agree with my colleague's comments. 
My colleagues, indeed, these types of points have been raised before.

Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
We have been waiting for an answer since October 3, 1997.  
Mr. Speaker, the member is correct. 
I am sure that is a hope shared by all hon. members. 
Shall the remaining questions stand?  
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Motion No. P-8 has been on the order paper for half a year. 
After all, the Liberals do it all the time.  
I will certainly look into that matter.

Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC) moved: 
(a) the Foundation shall not carry out its objects and purposes in the province; 
This is the kind of attitude we are up against. 
Once again, this is a demonstration of the government's bad faith. 
The board will not have the power to delegate to the provinces. 
I am very disappointed. 
It shows just how inflexible this federal system is. 
This is all very disappointing. 
So I am very disappointed.  
Why not do that? 
I think the government is acting in bad faith.  
Is it to refer the bill to committee?  
Mr. Speaker, we are now looking at the bill. 
I am asking that this review be postponed.  
When one wants to negotiate, one does not rush things. 
I worked in the real estate sector for seven years. 
I know what negotiating means. 
One does not sign a contract until both parties have agreed to it.  
Perhaps I can clarify the situation. 
There is not unanimous consent.  
Mr. Speaker, I am not surprised by the answer. 
I am therefore disappointed. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Obviously some dramatic measures must be taken.  
That is one point.  
I think for example of apprenticeship programs. 
We are woefully lacking properly trained apprentices in a number of areas. 
They should have access to this program.  
We should also recognize certain institutions. 
We have a number of concerns. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
We are suggesting that the government should hear what we are saying. 
Governments are notorious for making bad decisions. 
They do it all the time. 
It is a mechanism that will ensure fairness for students.  
The province would then use the funds for its own priorities.  
That was a few days before the election.  
What happened after that is history. 
I think we all know what happened. 
The impact was devastating. 
It meant that tuition costs had to go up dramatically. 
Student debtloads are much lower, about $11,000. 
I think what the government did was duplicitous.  
We do not want to let it get away with that. 
Let us give the provinces that option. 
All we are asking is to give provinces the options. 
We are encouraging the House to seriously consider adopting Motion No. 67. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
We have proposed 19 amendments to Bill C-36. 
We can simply rely on the good judgment of the provinces.  
Canadians deserve better than that. 
Canadians deserve to have true accountability. 
They are going to be given $2.5 billion. 
We do feel that they should know something about investments. 
This can prevent poor returns in fixed income securities. 
The auditor general's accounting advice is routinely ignored by the Minister of Finance.  
That is the way they were developed and proposed.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
It is a priority that has support right across Canada. 
Let us be very clear. 
The millennium scholarship foundation will not be a federal program. 
It is about increasing access to knowledge and skills. 
It is the country's dividend for balancing the books. 
I have said it in committee and I will say it again here. 
That is what this millennium scholarship fund is doing. 
There is no intent in this legislation to exclude such institutions.  
We have to understand this is an arm's length foundation. 
There is no legal obstacle to naming the auditor general. 
This amendment compromises the arm's length nature of the foundation. 
It gives the minister a direct role in the removal of the auditor. 
That role properly belongs to the members of the foundation.  
I do not think we can support that amendment. 
We are looking for independence, an arm's length relationship, accountability and transparency.  
Motion No. 65 makes reference to the booking of this foundation. 
The auditor general came before the committee. 
It is certainly very clear.  
The member from the Bloc spoke eloquently at the meeting. 
When we came to office there were a number of unfunded liabilities on the books. 
There were programs that had been announced but not funded. 
What we are saying is no more. 
I believe Canadians will support that. 
That criteria was certainly discussed at the finance committee. 
What we have here is a disagreement within in the accounting profession. 
Finally it is also required to hold a public meeting every year. 
So it is not about access to information.  
It is completely within the purview of the auditor general. 
There is transparency and there is accountability.  
I will close by saying that this is not a government program. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Why are we presenting this group of motions? 
The president of the Federation des cegeps said essentially the same thing.  
But they did not get it. 
They are thumbing their noses at people and at the democratic system.  
Minister of Human Resources Development made no bones about this either. 
With his usual candour, he indicated that this indeed was the reason. 
This project creates duplication and doubles costs for all taxpayers. 
Yet they talk of efficiency. 
That would be a positive measure to reduce student loans.  
The sixth criticism is a major one. 
He literally juggles all the figures he brings forward. 
What did the auditor general have to say? 
They no longer mean anything. 
Where will that kind of government accounting lead us?  
The second time was when the innovation fund was created. 
Therefore, like all the stakeholders in Quebec, we condemn this practice.  
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
In principle, no one really disagrees.  
I think it is certainly true.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
I would like to table those remarks. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
This bill makes it possible to implement certain provisions of the budget.  
It is important to know who these people are. 
They are not just sovereignists. 
They represent the entire education movement in Quebec. 
Why does Quebec feel this way?  
In the 1964 agreement, it had been decided to recognize Quebec as a distinct society.  
That is what distinct society is about. 
It was very clear what was on the table.  
The federal government had to choose between two alternatives. 
Why did the federal government not take that route? 
This right is already provided for in the legislation. 
It is what determines accessibility to education. 
Let me give you an example of what this system allows us to do. 
We have a project to recognize students' good performance. 
Along with that program, we will now have the millennium fund. 
For the student at the receiving end, it does not change a thing. 
It only creates a whole new bureaucracy. 
The members opposite do not seem to know how education works. 
To apply for a loan or a grant, one needs to fill out some forms. 
This total and absolute duplication.  
These are not exactly people who are identified with the sovereignist movement in Quebec. 
If an agreement is reached, it will be incorporated into the bill. 
We will never stand for it. 
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Today there was a report in the newspapers that Canadians are feeling poor. 
I can tell the House why Canadians are feeling poor. 
It is because their government has become richer at their expense. 
We all know that students' debtload has skyrocketed.  
They are both very worried about how they will pay this debt.  
Let us talk about what the government is trying to do. 
It has come up with what it calls a millennium fund. 
Who will benefit from this millennium fund? 
We are told that the fund is targeted toward students. 
We heard a member opposite talk about how the merit system will work.  
I would like to bring in another point of view. 
They do not have the money to send their children to university. 
Therefore, they have less time to spend looking after their families.  
What is the solution to that?  
They should look at another option, trade schools. 
These are the options the majority of the students in my riding face.  
Where is the millennium fund going, their tax dollars? 
That is fine, but what about the other students? 
We must also help them. 
We do not want a shortage of skilled workers in the trades area.  
Motion No. 42 is extremely important. 
They have that right because they are taxpayers. 
Their parents have paid money into the fund. 
That money has not been raised by private sources. 
I will talk about the provinces. 
Education is a provincial jurisdiction. 
It is very important that they be given flexibility. 
It is public money. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
My colleagues have outlined that specifically and very eloquently.  
It is instructive for us to look at real world experiences. 
Let us look at our own country, at Ontario and Saskatchewan. 
I lived in Ontario for 18 years. 
The current government took the bull by the horns. 
It substantially cut taxes. 
It also eliminated rules and regulations that tended to constrict and restrict the private sector. 
Ontario is engaging in a boom. 
Ontario has had more money coming into its coffers. 
What has happened to health care? 
That is not true at all. 
If taxes are decreased what happens? 
It causes investment to go into the province. 
It causes a revamping and a resurgence of the private sector. 
By doing so the amount of money in the public coffers is actually increased.  
Mr. Mulroney did it in 1992. 
More money went into the public purse. 
We have been pushing forward a very constructive plan. 
We have given it to the government. 
We have been telling the government to do this for many years.  
The NDP government took a very balanced approach. 
We obviously do not adhere to that rule. 
If we are fiscally irresponsible we are socially irresponsible. 
We do not compromise the rich because they can go wherever they want. 
We compromise the poor.  
What does that do? 
It does not work.  
In every country that has tried to do this it has resulted in abysmal failure.  
No one will go without. 
Those most socially deprived in those countries will be taken care of. 
The problems that affect us in Canada affect other developed nations all over the world. 
The reasons for it are very simple. 
It has right to work legislation. 
It has used tax havens. 
It has decreased taxes and eliminated egregious rules and regulations.  
What happened to the individual worker there? 
I implore the government to adopt the policies put forward by the Reform Party. 
Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne-Blainville, BQ):
Madam Speaker, you are as familiar with the Bible as I am. 
All the various communities in Quebec are protesting this fund. 
Let me give another example among many. 
Obviously, it did not work.  
I could go on and on. 
We also have the general manager of the Canadian Institute of Adult Education. 
That is a federalist talking. 
This is worth noting. 
That is the reaction of the business sector.  
It seems to me that the federal federalists were brighter than they are now.  
The Liberal motto is ``Make political hay while pretending to serve the public''.  
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
My colleagues have dealt thoroughly with this legislation in committee. 
Education is an area of provincial jurisdiction. 
They simply appreciate that the federal government should respect provincial jurisdiction. 
Yet the federal government refuses to respect this consensus.  
I mention this to illustrate a point. 
We cannot continue to ignore the delicate political reality in this country.  
The Prime Minister is not concerned about national unity or constitutional matters. 
He is concerned about his political legacy.  
My second concern with the millennium fund is one that has been addressed many times. 
It is a concern I alluded to only minutes ago. 
They will face the same financial constraints they always have. 
My point is that the possibilities for helping Canadian students are endless. 
However the millennium fund is clearly not the way to accomplish this.  
It is hard to argue why the fund should be shrouded in secrecy. 
Again, this is a reasonable amendment that entrenches a provision for fairness.  
It is a bad program that should be scrapped. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
We have seen an increase of 240% in tuition fees over the last 10 years. 
The NDP believes we need to have leadership from the federal government. 
The NDP is calling on the federal government to show the leadership that is necessary. 
What kind of way is that to start a life?  
We need a national grant system. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
His argument was quite simple.  
He said: ``Jean-Guy, take a good look in my barn''. 
He had a magnificent herd of Ayrshire cows. 
All that for the same dairy producer- 
And the same cow.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien:
And the same cow, of course.  
We are talking here about the same taxpayers, the same parents and the same students.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member. 
What is this all about? 
We are not challenging the fact that banks are trying to make profits. 
That is what has to change.  
Eighty-six per cent of my constituents rent their accommodation. 
Here is what I am asking of all parliamentarians today. 
The Reform Party and the Bloc Quebecois each represent a part of this constituency. 
Why should banks get involved in their communities? 
Let me remind you that, in 1992, banks made approximately $2 billion in profits. 
This year, profits will likely be closer to $8 billion. 
Banks should get involved in their communities because they operate in an extremely sheltered environment. 
UQAM is a breeding ground of ideas, which has enlightened the Quebec society. 
I would ask my colleagues to some enthusiasm about this.  
This is possible because there is an evaluation of banking business. 
Bank involvement is assessed. 
I will quote an example from New York State. 
This is something important which comes from the Community Reinvestment Act. 
I see that my time is running out. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The issue of community reinvestment involves a number of important considerations. 
There may be a number of models that would have to be carefully considered. 
Bill C-289 represents one approach to community reinvestment. 
This type of credit discrimination does not exist in our banking system.  
Disadvantaged ridings would be defined on the basis of the unemployment rate within the riding. 
Moreover there is a problem with the definition of community in general. 
Today the government is taking action to promote community investment. 
The banking landscape has changed dramatically in recent years. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
I think the motivation that gave rise to the bill is a very commendable one.  
It certainly influenced him and it influenced a lot of other people.  
That word perhaps is false. 
There is coercion involved in this bill.  
Throughout the clauses of the bill the words ``shall'' and ``must'' are located. 
That is not the issue. 
The issue is that the banks are doing that sort of thing. 
Are they doing it as well as they should?  
It is very interesting. 
The most recent of those quarterly reports is dated September 30, 1997. 
I did a comparison with the first report dated December 1995. 
The number of people however who received those loans increased. 
However, the total amount available in credit was considerably higher. 
Therefore, there were fewer people borrowing more money.  
This is all part of the banks' profit picture. 
It is true that the banks can argue that they are profitable organizations. 
Nobody will debate that. 
This bill restricts itself only to chartered banks. 
It also restricts itself to branches in chartered banks. 
There are two difficulties with this.  
I look particularly at the credit unions, caisses populaires and trust companies. 
These institutions are very community centred, very involved in the community. 
I do not think that was the intention either. 
Perhaps it was; I do not know.  
There are other ways of depositing money.  
The issue is one of reinvestment. 
This is to be done on an electoral basis.  
An electoral district does not have a constant boundary. 
It changes every 10 years, but nevertheless it does change. 
The issue now becomes one of being very micro centred. 
A community goes beyond an electoral district.  
In other cases there would be very much the opposite situation.  
I suggest that there are some shortcomings in the bill. 
Also we want to recognize the intent and purpose. 
The intention may be okay but I think there are some difficulties.  
In fact there are electronic banks that have no branches.  
What would the legislation do in that regard? 
I do not think that is fair.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
For this reason, I am in favour of this bill before us this afternoon.  
I think that is a very non-partisan statement.  
When I look at the cynicism out there today I see it is increasing. 
People are more and more turned off by the political process. 
It does not only come from certain groups in society. 
We can look at the big Japanese banks that are having trouble today. 
We are talking about two huge sumo wrestler type banks.  
The banks want to merge for one reason and that reason is greed. 
No wonder they want the mergers to proceed. 
They will lose their jobs. 
Approximately 30,000 Canadians will lose their jobs. 
That is a population of a small city. 
Those banks have been made very profitable. 
They do not have to get bigger to be more profitable.  
Even my Liberal friend from Winnipeg is embarrassed about the power of these big banks. 
It is a community without a bank. 
This is happening right across the country.  
This is happening now in the United States of America.  
There is nothing radical about it. 
It is happening in the United States. 
Let us make sure it happens here. 
We are not a rubber stamp. 
You can't blackmail the Parliament of Canada''. 
There was a survey in the Regina Leader Post about two weeks ago. 
It was a survey and not a poll. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
I find that to be unfortunate. 
He has conviction and he is certainly very dedicated to his cause. 
I understand the theory and practicalities of economy. 
We first talked about reinvestment in the community. 
This legislation also speaks to those good things. 
I am very pleased about that.  
The legislation also calls for more transparency in the banking institutions. 
That is as far as it should go. 
Under Bill C-289 banks in different regions would be held at different standards. 
Currently the legislation is not equally applicable to all banks. 
It is a step for which I congratulate the member. 
There should not be any criteria with respect to unemployment rates. 
It should be applied to all banks across the country.  
They are two separate issue. 
There are other ways.  
I thank the member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve for putting the bill forward.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I would like to clarify three points.  
Second, why was the electoral district used as unit of reference? 
I will not have unanimous consent. 
Do you know why the government is not willing to give its consent? 
Do you know why? 
You can see these people cannot be honest and upright. 
They are owned by the banks. 
We are nowhere near a real debate on the banks. 
I know we cannot count on the Liberals. 
I am sick at the thought of how hypocritical the Liberals are. 
And what will happen. 
Is there one member in this House who will rise? 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Just what are the government's plans for Shearwater? 
Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am afraid I must interrupt the hon. member as his time has expired.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
This agreement creates a number of problems. 
Mr. Young is now getting rich at the expense of the residents of New Brunswick.  
Canadians are sick and tired of seeing patronage everywhere they look. 
Let us listen to Canadians and do away with the idea of toll highways.  
Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
The overall agreement is for 50 years.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Let us get the facts straight here. 
Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am sorry, but I must interrupt. 
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.47 p.m.)
