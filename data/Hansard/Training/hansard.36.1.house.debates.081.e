The House met at 10 a.m. 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Ivan Grose (Oshawa, Lib.):
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
It is to be removed from the Order Paper.  
The motion is to be withdrawn.  
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
The factual distinctions mentioned by the minister are obvious. 
Section 2(d) of the charter guarantees freedom of association. 
The situation in the present instance is similar. 
The same reasoning unquestionably applies in the case of sections 56 and 57.  
In that sense the minister is stating the obvious.  
This appearance took place on April 24, 1997, almost a year ago. 
However, we are not acting because the regulations are unconstitutional.  
That the debate be now adjourned.  
It is not partisan in any manner.  
A report was filed in the House at least two weeks ago. 
It has been on the order paper since that date.  
Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):
My question for the hon. member is simple. 
This was my final opportunity to do so. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your guidance in this matter. 
That the debate be now adjourned.  
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
What is the purpose of the proposed motion to adjourn?  
To adjourn this debate only.  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
The petitioners ask parliament to amend section 255 of the criminal code as follows. 
Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have several petitions today. 
The first one will be of interest to the President of the Treasury Board.  
I am sure he will chase that one down.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Question No. 46 will be answered today. 
In fact, CIDA already would surpass this objective. 
CIDA is not alone in lacking precise information. 
These will be made available to all interested parties when completed. 
Achieving this is a major challenge for the industry as a whole. 
On this, there are two further issues that need to be mentioned: 
CIDA is actively pursuing this quality issue in our own programming.  
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
INCOME TAX AMENDMENTS ACT, 1997 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Since 1994 we have followed a consistent and solid plan centred on a balanced approach. 
In fact it is paying off today. 
They reflect key national values. 
It is this type of investment that all Canadians can appreciate. 
It starts applying this higher cash floor one year earlier than originally slated.  
There are also other parts of this wide ranging bill that should be highlighted again.  
The result appears to be a much higher level of giving.  
As a result, they have been closely scrutinized by private sector experts. 
No objective observer can question what had to be done. 
There was simply no way we could meet our deficit without those reductions.  
The deficit cutting exercise was transparent. 
It was done in consultation with Canadians and provincial governments. 
The bottom line is clear. 
We are making those investments with a clear and considered philosophy. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
I will lay out a number of the reasons that we oppose this legislation.  
This bill talks about taxes without talking about tax relief. 
We will say more about that later.  
We oppose it for that reason.  
I will speak to them in more detail shortly.  
I hope we can uncover what is really going on.  
They call that an increase. 
We do not want to leave that false impression.  
We need to draw attention to that.  
Yet the minister continues to boast about reduced taxes. 
Finally, I will touch on the issue of debt reduction. 
We oppose this on two separate grounds. 
It means virtually nothing. 
We have a debt in this country of $583.2 billion. 
Why is it important to pay down the debt?  
The other day I had an analyst in my office from Wall Street. 
This man informed me that he was extraordinarily concerned about Canada's current situation. 
Those were his words ``the Asian tsunami''.  
He left me with a document and I want to quote it. 
This is the forecast that he is giving to his clients. 
Due to the Asian crisis, Mitsubishi Motors tripled its forecasted loss.  
4. Due to the Asian crisis, U.S. small business confidence has declined.  
7. U.S. pricing power declined further- 
We witnessed, when the Asian crisis first hit, a flight to quality. 
That is what is germane in this issue.  
I do not begrudge it for a moment. 
It is not a problem that way.  
I think that really raises some important questions. 
It does not just end with the finance minister. 
I would say it is almost completely because of the high taxes.  
Therefore, we have all kinds of professionals fleeing Canada.  
I think that is a new trend. 
We also see it with engineers and computer scientists.  
This is a serious problem.  
There is a history behind this too. 
The government removed it. 
Why not just leave it the way it was? 
The only reason for it obviously is to get more money out of taxpayer pockets. 
It is another sneaky backdoor tax increase. 
I object to it. 
I think it is wrong and I think this government has overstepped its bounds. 
It has stepped into territory that previously has been almost sacred. 
It has started to tax another level of government. 
Would you keep them at the current level?'' 
That is not so. 
What has been the consequence of that? 
We have seen protests on the lawns of provincial legislatures. 
We have seen waiting lists skyrocket. 
They continue to do their damage.  
It is the architect of the great slashing that has gone on. 
It is the Dr. Kavorkian of health care in this country.  
We have countries not wanting to invest here.  
We point out that taxes in this country are just too high. 
I remember reading a letter from a lady in Quesnel, Margaret Snell. 
Her son wanted to play baseball and have swimming lessons. 
This is a social tragedy. 
I point to the staggering levels of unemployment. 
We raised the issue of the fishery, for instance. 
It is just never dealt with. 
We see Americans vacuuming the sea. 
Again, the government does not deal with it. 
There are a number of reasons why we oppose this legislation. 
We do not need that.  
I encourage friends to consider the message I have given today. 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
This is why these provisions are included in the omnibus bill.  
The minister owns a shipping holding company.  
That is the first question that springs to mind.  
Is he allowed to do that? 
On page 2 of the ministerial code of ethics, we read the following: 
Every public office holder shall conform to the following principles: 
This is followed by various headings. 
The first one is ``Ethical Standards''. 
The passage in question reads as follows: 
The second principle involves public scrutiny. 
It does not concern engineering firms, for example. 
It applies only to the international shipping sector.  
The third basic principle in the code of ethics concerns private interests. 
It states as follows: 
Clause 241 will impact upon the financial performance of his companies.  
The final principle is public interest. 
It states the following: 
This has happened more than once, moreover.  
Sometimes the Prime Minister is really funny. 
He sometimes has a really funny way of reasoning.  
The Prime Minister bragged about it on two separate occasions. 
Not only did he sponsor it, he introduced it. 
Great philosophy, great moral and political ethics.  
One must refer to page 16 of the code.  
What does it say on page 16? 
None of this has ever happened.  
We are not asking for the minister's resignation, at least not yet. 
But we are running out of patience. 
It is really hard to hold back. 
We are asking the government to shed light on this matter. 
We found a few. 
A company owned by an Ontario Minister of Finance was issued a permit. 
I am too attached to my principles. 
And this was over a humanitarian case.  
There seems to be a bit of a problem. 
The problem is twofold and that becomes serious.  
In fact, three versions were given. 
Already, the minister was violating the government's code of ethics. 
We do not intend to use these new clauses''. 
Within a day, there was a reversal, a new version was different. 
And that was just the next day. 
The third version was given to us by Len Farber. 
Len Farber appeared before the Standing Committee on Finance. 
Mr. Farber did not say yes right away. 
He is a friend of the Minister of Finance and he is his principal adviser. 
You do not understand anything''.  
We realized that we understood everything. 
That was a good start. 
This is not logical. 
Logic must come before anything else.  
The other part of the response came to us two days later. 
I will quote the hon. member for Stoney Creek if I may. 
He might gain something from listening to me this morning. 
The clarifying rule was enacted in 1991. 
He is talking about the old 1991 provision. 
The company now managing these assets is Canada Trust, based in Montreal. 
The parliamentary secretary gave us a description of foreign businesses to attract here. 
The hon. member attends sittings of the Standing Committee on Finance. 
That is what is happening in the finance committee. 
The bill was introduced on February 23. 
The Liberal majority systematically refused and voted against my motion. 
The Liberal majority voted against the motion. 
But I did get the support of the three opposition parties. 
I was not asking for specific individuals, but for any witness. 
We voted against it. 
He is laughing at the people. 
The fact of the matter is that he does not want witnesses to be called. 
But they do not want us to call any witnesses to answer our questions.  
That is not all. 
We are still waiting for an answer.  
I am still waiting for an answer.  
Many aspects remain to be clarified in this whole matter. 
Many conflicting statements were made by various people.  
There has also been much confusion in the reactions of government representatives. 
We have been talking about it since February 23. 
This creates even more doubts.  
Why has this not happened? 
Because there is indeed a problem.  
And it is not the only problem. 
This bill does not just apply to international shipping. 
That is what he told us. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
I will first comment on the format of the bill.  
I am the NDP member on the human resources development committee. 
Then along comes Bill C-28. 
In actual fact, Bill C-28 is very technical legislation. 
This needs to be said before we get into the substance of the bill. 
They would certainly have difficulty in deciphering this bill.  
This is not something new. 
The government is putting forward the message in that way, that it is an increase. 
The reality is that this is not an increase at all.  
What has the government decided to do? 
That is the reality of what has happened.  
This is very important, valuable work.  
Here again is where we hear the real story. 
That is what has actually happened in this country. 
It is very important that we consider the real impact and consequences of these cuts. 
These are real statistics and something that cannot be denied by the government.  
But where have the targets been to reduce unemployment? 
Where have the targets been to reduce poverty in this country? 
They simply do not exist. 
There is nothing that will deal with that.  
Will this bill improve access to health care? 
Regrettably the answer to that question as well is no.  
Some of them were street people. 
We have to ask ourselves why are those tuition fees so high. 
The next barrier is a massive student debt.  
Who is telling the truth?  
The questions they posed to students at that facility are as follows. 
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
We in Quebec have noted the same thing. 
I would like her opinion on the matter.  
That is what we stand for and what we believe in. 
We believe the students in Quebec would benefit from that as well.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The member also discussed the millennium fund, as did the member for Joliette. 
The millennium fund is part of Bill C-36. 
I would only hope we would talk about the context of this bill.  
At least on that point we agree.  
When we cut those taxes is when we can afford to cut those taxes. 
As long as I am premier, our fiscal integrity will never be compromised''. 
These are not my words or the words of any member of this government. 
These are the words of NDP Premier Roy Romanow. 
Would the hon. member comment? 
I would like the member to show me the increase in the cash floor. 
Not one new dime is going to the provinces. 
The government is not going ahead with a previous cutback. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for her comments.  
We are talking about their lives and their personal well-being.  
The government says that it is doing things for education. 
There are RESPs where money can be invested. 
However I see the bottom line in my riding. 
Does the member have any comments about that? 
Does it identify what she has been saying?  
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her comments. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
In the Liberal war of politics versus economics politics always wins. 
Unfortunately Canadians frequently lose. 
Dalhousie is my alma mater. 
In 1997 there were over 900. 
The number increased from 8 to 900 in that short period of time.  
Why is student debt load ballooning out of control? 
Acadia University is in my riding. 
Many of those students who were having difficulties came to my office to seek advice. 
Leadership is not about federal or provincial jurisdiction. 
It is about federal and provincial co-operation. 
Unfortunately it is now an issue with which all of Canada is familiar. 
These policies run counter to the most basic of free market logic.  
Bill C-28 epitomizes this Liberal philosophy. 
Again, this government is making the wrong choices. 
Personal debt is at an all time high in this country.  
It further complicates the tax code. 
Personal disposable income has dropped by 6% since 1991. 
The fact is that the cash floor is established on a national level. 
There may be one now. 
Canadians need a plan for growth. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I am sure the hon. member was here when the budget was put forward. 
I am not sure whether the hon. member really has his facts right. 
He should probably clarify that.  
I agree with him that transfers are important to the provinces. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
Do you agree with her?  
That is a basic argument of mathematics.  
It is appalling that he would be proud of it.  
We reduced that to 4% by 1993. 
Two years too late.  
An hon. member opposite said it was two years too late. 
It was a heck of a lot faster than the previous government. 
We deregulated financial services, energy and transportation. 
Those policies helped this government. 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I seem to have struck a chord.  
We reduced it to zero by the time we left office. 
Then we implemented the free trade agreement.  
The fact is those were the right policies then and are the right policies now. 
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
The European model puts a lot more emphasis on trades people. 
Does the member see that type of program working for Canadians?  
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member for Calgary West.  
Let us look at the first case scenario. 
Is this Liberal administration in any sort of a hurry? 
I cannot see why. 
What can I conclude? 
This government has something to hide. 
Where do the Liberals believe these profits are going? 
I want to offer my support to my colleagues on this side of the House.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
That is the challenge I lay to him.  
I believe the number is somewhere around 37.  
It is creating a generation of have nots in this country.  
It is a shame. 
We have to stem that tide. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, the hon. member talked about laying claim to future governments. 
Then he criticizes the government with the millennium scholarship fund. 
He knows where the $2.5 billion is going. 
He keeps standing up in this House and telling people. 
Is that what the Reform Party is in favour of? 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the parliamentary secretary for his question.  
There are several instances of that in my riding.  
That is a direct contradiction to what the member is trying to get across.  
The member brings up the millennium scholarship, an intrusion into provincial jurisdictions. 
The members for the Bloc made that very clear. 
I hear that from home as well. 
It does not cover enough people. 
It does not go far enough fast enough.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
See how thick it is. 
That is what they call tax relief. 
It is a telephone book. 
We are the people who pass the laws in this country. 
We are the ones who create taxes or change taxes. 
A Reform government would provide tax relief. 
They as well as the taxpayers are crying out for help.  
I see something as large as a telephone book. 
They tell us this is a good change to the taxes. 
There is no tax relief here. 
Yet the Liberals have so willingly fulfilled that task and filled their pockets.  
Disposable incomes have continued to decline since 1987. 
They can only suffer much.  
Indeed this bill is adding more regulation on top of regulation.  
There were promises made by the Liberals in the last two elections.  
What has that meant? 
That is what it means. 
They download on the provinces. 
That is not tax relief. 
It is a tax increase. 
What does it mean in terms of this whole debt situation? 
What about the contingency funds the government talks about? 
That is exactly what they are doing. 
I speak of the poor finance minister. 
Yes, he is a millionaire. 
Yet he shelters his own money offshore.  
He should be paying tax in this country. 
I feel for the finance minister.  
High taxes have created a brain drain. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
We have tax treaties with countries around the world. 
We have those treaties so we can promote bilateral trade and cultural exchange. 
The member has given information which is incorrect. 
The current RRSP limit for Canadian taxpayers is $13,500 per year. 
The member is somehow suggesting to all Canadians that this is unfair.  
According to the Fraser Institute the average family paid $27,000 in 1997. 
That is a fact.  
And he is defending the complexity of the tax code?  
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
Therefore, there was no real conflict of interest. 
The Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister continue to deny these facts. 
Because they are embarrassed. 
They are trying to hide the truth regarding this issue.  
Mr. Wilson is the Prime Minister's ethics counsellor. 
He is not an independent counsellor, he is paid by the Prime Minister. 
That is what we are calling for today. 
We will see then who is right.  
That is another matter. 
He is protecting his Minister of Finance.  
This government is stubbornly maintaining its planned cuts to the provinces. 
What the Prime Minister is trying to get us to swallow is twisted.  
The sick, the unemployed and society's most disadvantaged. 
The people are doing the work.  
We are familiar with it, the demagoguery of the current Prime Minister.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
In fact the minister quite rightly did not act at all. 
All decisions and discussions were held by the secretary of state.  
The Bloc Quebecois keeps moving on this issue. 
Then the Bloc members said that the clause would benefit the minister. 
Now the assertion is that there is an apparent conflict of interest.  
There is no conflict of interest. 
Pure and simple they are engaging in the most cynical kind of politics. 
It is something Canadians will not stand for.  
There is no room in this House for that kind of politics.  
Madam Speaker, I have here Mr. Wilson's statement. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
A finance minister in a situation such as this must tell the truth.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
I would like ask my hon. friend from the Bloc Quebecois two questions. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
This is also an opportunity to talk about our visions for health care. 
We have not heard any plan from the government. 
We have not heard such regressive, reactionary comments in the last 30 years. 
That is why this debate is so critical.  
With one voice we need to tell the government to preserve medicare. 
Canadians want medicare preserved. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
The question is who stopped it. 
The Liberals would like to pretend they stopped it. 
I will put the facts on the record. 
What did they do in 1995? 
We are not responsible''. 
They want a single payer, universally accessible, publicly administered health care system. 
They do not want the two tier health system being proposed by the Reform. 
They do not want the federal government to abdicate from its responsibility. 
Did the government accept that amendment? 
Where is their support for medicare? 
Where is their vision for the country? 
I think that says it all and why we need- 
It is almost two o'clock. 
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, There is a place where members are appointed 
You'd think that they had been annoited 
As citizens toil, these members sleep 
They rake in the benefits while taxpayers weep 
It does not have to be that way 
They should work hard to receive pay 
We could choose them by election 
Not by the Prime Minister's selection 
Account to the people on promises kept 
Duties and responsibilities met 
Vacations more like normal folk 
Then that place would not be a joke 
Ottawa in touch with what citizens feel?  
The only way that we will know 
Give the Senate election a go!  
Let the people decide for in the end 
They don't want the Prime Minister's friends 
Then the senator's guiding path 
Will not be the public's wrath!  
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Our government is especially proud of having been associated with this initiative from the start. 
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
They are practically treated like criminals. 
Officials almost automatically suspect them of trying to defraud the system. 
REFORM PARTY OF CANADA 
Mrs. Judi Longfield (Whitby-Ajax, Lib.):
Reform is out of touch with British Columbians- 
The hon. member for Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey.  
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
This will account for 16% of B.C.'s estimated revenues. 
That works out to $825 per person.  
The hon. member for Edmonton East.  
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
Shells rained down and brave men died, 
Canadians stood their ground.  
Their ranks finally broke, 
From the weight of superior force.  
Interned in cells of true hell, 
Rotting flesh, disease and death abound.  
Convention was not a word Japan understood.  
Slavery for Hong Kong war prisoners was.  
Our soldiers were forced, 
To endure unspeakable horrors, 
And to slave at unbelievable tasks.  
Sixty years hence nothing has changed.  
Japan and Canada have failed in their part, 
To compensate our brave Hong Kong veterans.  
Questioned in this House November last, 
Committee resolve of December past, 
Both should have caused result 
So I ask now 
When will government do honour to the task 
As the sands of time slip from our Hong Kong veterans' lives?  
Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-East York, Lib.):
I do not believe we can be any clearer on this issue.  
REFORM PARTY OF CANADA 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
The hon. member for Souris-Moose Mountain.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
REFORM PARTY OF CANADA 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):
The millennium scholarship fund will give money directly to students. 
That is what politics is all about.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
That should be the goal.  
Public hearings were held and they were well attended.  
It is high time Parliament took its responsibility. 
The time has come to act.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Every day, 34,000 children die of malnutrition and disease.  
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
REFORM PARTY OF CANADA 
Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering-Ajax-Uxbridge, Lib.):
That is what leadership is all about.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
I am sure that what will be announced is intended to be fair and reasonable. 
I ask my hon. friend to wait until the announcement is made. 
Then he will have something to talk about. 
Right now he is just blowing smoke.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Why is the government now abandoning her as well, without compensation?  
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada is abandoning no one. 
I urge the member to wait until tomorrow when the announcement- 
The hon. member for Macleod.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
Why will he not agree to compensate them too?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
I have received numerous letters from people who are in this situation. 
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
As they come up with specific questions, they will get specific answers.  
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
I understand that a statement was made in Quebec today. 
We are not yet in possession of the text. 
When we are, we will be able to comment on it more fully.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Trade.  
International concern over the MAI is growing.  
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is no agreement. 
Canada has signed no agreement on this matter. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
What is really needed is leadership, leadership to unite the country.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
I am confident he will continue to do so with great success.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, national unity needs leadership.  
The Conservative leader is demonstrating his leadership by making the leap to provincial politics. 
The Prime Minister should also demonstrate his leadership for Canada.  
Mr. Speaker, Canadian unity is progressing nicely. 
Things are going well.  
My door is always open to the leader of the NDP. 
All suggestions on national unity are welcome.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
The hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health.  
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
It knows today what is in that package.  
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
That inquiry only looks into the shooting itself. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
They are not as good.  
The hon. member for Edmonton North.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
There are terrible inequities on that reserve. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, it is very simple. 
They are much more visible''.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
DEPARTMENT OF FISHERIES AND OCEANS 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
But 60 miles down the river in Montreal it is only 44 cents. 
It is the same oil, four times the tax.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
These are private sector organizations which make contracts with the various shippers of oil. 
We insist upon having this system so we have the maximum protection of the environment.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
What I will tell him is that we have in place a regionalized system. 
It is an insurance policy. 
To get the insurance one has to buy in.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
There are $20 billion in the fund, but the minister is still waiting.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
The issue that we are facing is that the plan will expire in August. 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
Many of the provinces have already indicated exasperation over the delay.  
When can we expect the long overdue fulfilment of her promise? 
The minister often uses the word ``timely''. 
Canadians deserve and expect better than that.  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Who is causing the delay over there on the justice minister's side? 
Who is causing the delay over there?  
Mr. Speaker, I do not think the hon. member heard me. 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
The government has a program in place. 
This has been reported to the industry committee. 
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
What measures does the government have to help women and children?  
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has hit it right on the head. 
There are women living in poverty in many of the ridings we represent in Vancouver. 
There are single women who need education. 
We are also talking about money for women entrepreneurs- 
The hon. member for Okanagan-Shuswap.  
INDIAN AFFAIRS AND NORTHERN DEVELOPMENT 
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
My question is for the President of the Treasury Board. 
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
We must ensure that there will be enough for the economic cycle.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, last year, the Canadian economy generated 372,000 jobs. 
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Could the minister confirm this? 
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, what I can confirm is what I said earlier. 
The issue is on the table. 
It is being discussed as we speak with our colleagues at the provincial level.  
When the compensation package is revealed in its entirety tomorrow we will know the specifics. 
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
The hon. Deputy Prime Minister.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the Environment.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
In fact the legislation calls for the millennium fund to have its own auditor.  
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
I suggest that we cannot have it both ways. 
Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma-Manitoulin, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
I appeal to members to listen to the questions and answers.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
What has been the minister's response? 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, first, we have to start with accurate information. 
The member states that the west coast salmon species are extinct. 
This is not so. 
We have some serious problems with coho, steelhead and chinook stocks. 
The approach that will not work- 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
The vicious policy of closing post offices ended with the moratorium. 
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Naturally, we are also going to keep retail postal outlets open.  
A way must also be found to increase revenue. 
We are holding discussions now. 
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. minister. 
The hon. member for Churchill.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
We have a shortage of experienced truck drivers. 
We turn to other countries to fill these jobs.  
Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
My questions for Thursday is to the government House leader. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
That is the debate on amending the standing orders of the House of Commons. 
STANDING COMMITTEE ON PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
There was no motion before the committee at that time. 
That is the first thing that happened.  
We felt this would be sufficient to clarify his behaviour.  
The committee worked on the case for three months. 
The issue is not any less serious. 
On the contrary, these are people who may have threatened the Chair. 
Again, I call upon your good judgment. 
It has been agreed the members would appear one at a time. 
The 20 minutes was not a time limit in the sense of questions. 
Questions can be put at later hearings, no doubt. 
It was intended to show fairness to the members concerned.  
The first is to show fairness to our colleagues. 
I think that is very important. 
The next meeting of the committee is next Tuesday when we will continue these hearings. 
This is an ongoing set of hearings. 
It is up to the committee to decide if its president was within parliamentary practices. 
I would prefer that this matter be dealt with in committee. 
I am just repeating what I seem to have heard here. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
I thought it was all agreed to. 
The committee then moved to formalize and sustain the ruling of the chair. 
The Bloc stormed out and so on.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I am an associate member of the committee that is considering the matter. 
I think he put his case very responsibly and fairly. 
I would like to add, however, that you have made a prima facie ruling. 
We have heard from an expert, Joseph Maingot. 
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
I know that, generally, the chair of the committee is a reasonable man. 
Certain behaviour must be stopped. 
Conclusions must be drawn from these events. 
I have heard the interventions of four or five members on this point of order. 
I hope it can be worked out.  
I will leave this point of order where it is. 
They should be dealt with there. 
I will leave this right here, right now. 
INCOME TAX AMENDMENTS ACT, 1997 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
This creates very serious ramifications for health care. 
This bill is in effect a misrepresentation of the facts. 
What does that mean? 
This bill does not do that.  
That amendment was defeated. 
The Liberals spoke loudly and clearly to their own government. 
The Liberals sent this message to the government. 
Canadians have said with one voice that this is their priority. 
It has not been enhanced nor helped by the proposals of the Reform Party. 
This is a question about moving to a more cost effective health care system. 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
I know it had a major impact in her region.  
People do not always understand why that is. 
People tend to criticize him. 
All the provinces are affected. 
Yesterday, I saw reports on RDI concerning the Atlantic provinces. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member from the Bloc Quebecois for his question. 
The federal government has been abdicating responsibility for the developments at that level.  
It turned out that this again was smoke and mirrors. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
She is an NDP member. 
She lambasted the Reform Party throughout her speech. 
The B.C. NDP has foisted it upon British Columbia.  
Where is the money going to come from? 
Do we have to raise taxes? 
Money does not grow on trees. 
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
That party wants to talk out of both sides of its mouth.  
We have suggested that the government begin to reinstate that money. 
We have not said that it be done overnight. 
We know we have a surplus situation. 
It is clearly on record. 
We totally reject that approach. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
This bill nibbles around the edges. 
Our high unemployment rate has been referred to many times in this House. 
It is the highest unemployment rate among the G-7 nations. 
There is no reason for this. 
We need to keep our trained and skilled people in Canada. 
We do not need to reinvent the wheel. 
I will get into these opportunities in a little more specific way in a moment.  
I first want to deal with one specific area. 
We need a sensible debate on the issue of health care. 
Because of this governments have been forced to ration. 
The rich always have a choice. 
We cannot keep sticking our heads in the sand.  
That is absolutely unfair. 
Whichever way you slice it that is not accessible health care.  
Then there will be more money on a per capita basis for the public sector. 
I would argue two things. 
Right now we are subsidizing the Americans.  
This is not only doable, it is pragmatic. 
Above all, it would save our publicly funded health care system.  
Our system is very distinct and different from the system in the United States. 
It takes another six months to a year to get the service. 
But we could have the best health care system in the world. 
We need to have a sensible debate. 
We need to put all of the minds in this room together. 
We should not take what the Americans have done. 
I will end on that particular point.  
The government could work with its provincial counterparts to ensure this happens.  
The government could take the opportunity to streamline the GST.  
The economy was stimulated and government revenues increased. 
What did it do? 
It started to tax wildly. 
Government revenues went down and the economy had a clamp put on it.  
That is not a legacy any government wants to have. 
That is not a legacy we can be proud of. 
We have to face facts. 
We have spoken at length about other things. 
Some have managed to dig themselves out. 
They have become self-financing, self-sustaining and self-respecting.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
We are not the party that has a top down structure.  
The reasons are simple. 
We in the Reform Party live within our means. 
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I listened to my colleague, who is a health professional. 
Some people find this hard, and it is, but it had to be done. 
Even the former minister, Marc-Yvan Cote, congratulated Mr. Rochon on his courage.  
I say that it is wonderful to invest in health. 
This has caused terrible harm.  
I am going to ask my colleague a question. 
Mr. Speaker, many Quebeckers go to Ontario for medical treatment.  
That is an utter and complete myth. 
They cannot afford it.  
There is no single tier; there are multiple tiers in this country. 
This is how it would work. 
That is the bottom line in health care.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I do not know if I can make this brief. 
I am really disappointed. 
I am very disappointed that he would even suggest that. 
I will continue at some other point.  
We see people suffering left, right and centre. 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
He is even trying to cloud the issue.  
That is why we demand an explanation and a serious investigation of this matter.  
Is ministerial accountability not a fundamental principle of our parliamentary system?  
They are not subject to Canadian tax law''. 
My interests are Canadian companies. 
So the mystery deepens. 
So, are the finance minister's companies Canadian or are they foreign? 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The Bloc asked, essentially when this all started, who asked for this amendment. 
The response it got and the correct response is IMC Vancouver asked for this amendment.  
The amendment will cost nothing. 
It applies to foreign companies operating in international traffic. 
They are not and never have been taxable in Canada. 
It is pure politics. 
It is completely baseless. 
Bloc members keep shifting the goal post whenever they get an answer.  
They talk about what Mr. Wilson said in committee. 
I was present at that committee. 
It is highly unlikely and not the intent of anyone.  
I would be quite thankful. 
Mr. Speaker, I will not comment on all the remarks my colleague made. 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
I know there are other shipyards, for example at Les Mechins in the Gaspe. 
The hon. member is right. 
Here we are five years later and still it has not materialized.  
At the recent Liberal convention, some young Liberals proposed a resolution on it.  
She managed to convince them all. 
Here again, they put personal interests before those of the nation.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
They need shipyards in the West too. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
This can be a retroactive process. 
That is what I will do. 
It shows that the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing. 
Taxation policy should not be aimed at social engineering. 
Clearly that is what the Liberals are doing.  
I hate to see what they are doing in the area of cultural engineering.  
This is what the changes may mean. 
In terms of the general philosophy of the fund, she really stands behind it. 
This is exactly the kind of cultural micro engineering I am talking about. 
I come back to the key issue. 
We can talk about the very laughable situation of two departments getting all muddled up. 
That is not laughable to them.  
That is really the direction these people seem to be going in.  
It stifles our ability to buy running shoes for our children. 
It stifles our ability to have enough money to pay our mortgage.  
The ranch owners went to their accountants. 
Let us note that they did not all go to the same accountant. 
Many of my constituents are people in their sunset years. 
My constituents are honest, law-abiding, taxpaying Canadian citizens. 
This must be changed. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That is an underlying principle with which I am sure the hon. member would agree.  
It does not really do away with that point.  
I would want to know what my bottom line was going to be. 
We must simplify the tax law. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
After all that is fundamentally why we are in this place. 
If they would listen to the voice of reason.  
Very clearly the average Canadian understood that there was a commitment. 
Look at the Canada pension plan and the huge increase Canadians are facing. 
The government is not fooling anyone. 
The wool has not been pulled over their eyes on the issue of taxation. 
Canadians are fed up with being taxed to the extent that they are.  
In actual fact the exact opposite is true.  
There is a huge social cost. 
Most Canadians are capable of doing the arithmetic. 
This country is almost $600 billion in debt. 
What does it mean? 
I am getting up in age. 
Imagine winning a lottery. 
The 649 wins are now around $10 million. 
Then they could pay off our debt. 
My eldest child is in her second year at university. 
My two younger children are growing up quite rapidly. 
It is an embarrassment quite frankly for our generation. 
We should think about that. 
We should be ashamed of the mess our generation has made of this country.  
The world was at our feet. 
There were all sorts of job opportunities. 
I want to tell a story about my riding of Prince George-Peace River. 
I do not know who was responsible. 
A lot of people think we are from Alberta.  
It really highlights this whole issue. 
Yet in many regards it is a forgotten corner of the country.  
It is virtually ignored. 
It is a very resource rich region.  
We forget about that. 
This huge taxation is what is causing a lot of our problems.  
I talked early about the social costs. 
We try to think of what the problem is. 
I am encouraged by the increase in at home businesses. 
It is contributing to the horrendous social cost for all of Canadian society. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my colleague talked about payroll taxes. 
The hon. member is right on the mark with her comment. 
These alternatives are continually gaining more and more support, in particular from young people. 
The hon. member is quite correct. 
The reality is young people are becoming more knowledgeable of these issues. 
When we add it all up it is not a pretty picture. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the discussion about CPP is all about values. 
You either believe in the CPP or you do not. 
This government does and the Reform Party does not.  
I wonder if the hon. member would like to comment on that.  
We have to face ridiculous allegations like that.  
We are not saying we have to raise taxes. 
What we are saying is that we should spend our money more wisely. 
We do not see that from this government. 
We saw that very case leading up to this budget. 
Where did that money come from? 
I do not think it would have. 
I think that is the type of thing my hon. colleague is suggesting.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
In 1988 the children's tax exemption was replaced by a non-refundable credit. 
In 1991 Canada was in the midst of a recession. 
By 1992 the inflation rate had dropped below 3%.  
I want to talk about the threshold effect. 
This is the true legacy of this government: stealth tax.  
This is not the only place this government is using stealth tax technology. 
I mentioned it the other day when I was talking about bracket creep. 
I would like to make a comparison using that. 
It looks like we have developed a pattern here. 
Where is this government's commitment to child poverty?  
That is almost twice what the average Canadian wage earner receives.  
Members on the government side of this House should be ashamed of themselves.  
The original motion read: 
The amended version of the motion reads: 
I am sure this government has reviewed the possibility of fully indexing the child benefit. 
I assure her of my support and hopefully the support of my colleagues. 
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
The motion reads as follows: 
Collectively, families have lost over $800 million. 
They are distinctly worse off.  
I am in complete agreement with my colleague.  
Right now, the poverty of children and families is serious. 
It is obvious that the child benefit must be fully indexed. 
The problem is extremely serious. 
Under the Liberals, the poor have become poorer.  
It is going so far as to suggest that they seek charity. 
He described it as the most urgent problem.  
The real problem with this government is its lack of political choices. 
Poor children do not vote, but university students do.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
We also support the amendment put forward by the Bloc Quebecois.  
I begin my remarks by saying the year 2000 is very close. 
Much work has been done.  
In fact the child tax benefit is only partially indexed. 
Regrettably that is not the case.  
What about the threat to Canada's poor children? 
The child tax benefit has now been announced four times. 
There was no announcement in the budget we just dealt with.  
We know that it is not an increase at all. 
That too has evaporated. 
We in the NDP are committed to holding the government accountable. 
I thank the member for bringing forward the motion. 
Is the House ready for the question?  
Does the House agree to call it 6.30 p.m.?  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
However, they chose instead to try to use a plane to rescue survivors.  
Those same helicopters were used during the Red River flood. 
They could have helped this time too. 
The end of 1997 did not go quietly. 
Another plane crash occurred in Fredericton, New Brunswick. 
It was a miracle that no one died in that crash. 
But let us go back to the Little Grand Rapids crash.  
It went in for one reason. 
He was taking in reporters to get a story. 
Do they not have that flexibility? 
Lately we have received an alarming report concerning the rescue in Little Grand Rapids. 
The fuel would be less concentrated on the ground or wherever it landed.  
Nevertheless, when the dumping occurred the hercules had gone below the fog. 
It had cleared somewhat. 
Was the best option used during this rescue?  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Unfortunately they were unable to make it due to bad weather. 
The Canadian forces did what they could to assist with the rescue. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
My question is simply this. 
When will the government end this terrible uncertainty?  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
This government has done much and is continuing to do more. 
We expect to bring forward legislation in the coming months. 
The government is committed to moving forward with the seniors benefit. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
This should be of great interest.  
We could be marketing it around the world and exporting our expertise in this area.  
My problem with the federal building initiative is that it has been ponderously slow. 
It has only affected a handful of buildings. 
Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):
We must rest assured that the FBI program will not be cancelled. 
The FBI program is one of these. 
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.16 p.m.)
