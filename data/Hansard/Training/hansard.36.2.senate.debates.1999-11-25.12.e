The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker pro tempore in the Chair.  
The Honourable P. Derek Lewis, Q.C. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham :
Be prepared to stand up faithfully for right and truth, however the winds may blow."  
Some might even characterize him as the Baden-Powell of Newfoundland. 
Senator Lewis' dedication and reliability are well known in this place. 
The litany is extensive, it is impressive, and it is important for the record. 
These words aptly apply to our departing colleague.  
Hon. C. William Doody :
He is truly a very unusual man. 
His career as a lawyer has long been recognized by his peers. 
He assumed the chairmanship of the Law Foundation of Newfoundland in 1979.  
That was shortly before the Confederation episode referred to by Senator Graham. 
He refuses to say. 
Sometimes he refers to himself as a reluctant Canadian. 
His work with the Boy Scouts of Canada has been mentioned. 
Indeed, Derek has been active in just about everything. 
Besides, it would not sound very complimentary from my point of view.  
I wish Derek and Grace many happy years of retirement. 
He is of a quiet strength, with an extraordinary character and incredible wit.  
During that time, Derek was the Liberal Party's provincial treasurer. 
Honourable senators, I am sorry to see the departure of Senator Lewis from our ranks. 
I did not know Senator Lewis before I came to the Senate. 
Senator Lewis was a tremendous help to me in surviving those early months here. 
I have never known Derek Lewis to be in a melancholy mood. 
He was highly respected and well regarded in his community. 
God bless you, Derek!  
We have learned from our Newfoundland colleagues a great deal. 
We have listened to them reflect on the pros and cons of their new nationhood. 
Derek Lewis is not a great talker; he is a doer. 
He listens and he evaluates. 
I have noticed also over the years that he will not let go. 
He is not reluctant to use it, either. 
That says much about the strength of their relationship. 
I wish them both many happy years together.  
Honourable senators, Senator Lewis was born in Newfoundland in 1924. 
He married Grace Knight in 1961. 
He was appointed to the Senate in 1978.  
Senator Lewis is a lawyer in private practice. 
This fact has marked his life. 
I wish to thank him very much.  
That night, I heard a little tap at the office door. 
It was Senator Lewis and Senator Bonnell. 
I have enjoyed every minute that we have spent together.  
He was always there, and usually on time. 
He stayed until the bitter end of every meeting. 
Derek was indeed a most reluctant Canadian. 
In fact, he thought it was just a terrible idea. 
Derek, I do hope that you will write a book. 
Do not leave it to Senator Cook. 
I know that I will miss you dreadfully. 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
May you have many years of long and happy life left.  
Derek Lewis was then, and is now, a very gentle man. 
I will miss Derek in this chamber. 
I will miss Grace in her all-too-infrequent visits to Ottawa. 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
I knew very little about how the Senate actually worked.  
I was immediately invited to see him. 
"Work hard at committees," he admonished me.  
These were the first principles I garnered about the Senate. 
Principles and practice march best when they march together.  
For me, Derek brought all of these principles alive. 
Derek respected this institution. 
Derek gained an encyclopedic knowledge of the rules and respected the practices of this place. 
He was the ultimate draftsman when it came to committee work. 
Derek was quiet, careful, competent, witty and deliberative. 
He always retained a respectful arm's length from the powers that be.  
In a phrase, Derek was a senator's senator, a public solicitor's solicitor. 
Derek, your race is run. 
Your duty is done. 
You and Grace are heartily entitled to a good and healthy retirement. 
His manner was friendly yet modest. 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Senator Lewis was introduced to me as a very special person. 
I congratulate him on that and I thank him for it.  
He knows what is required to make this place work. 
We must also think about the contribution of Grace. 
She has our thanks for her tolerance of Derek's many absences. 
We also thank Senator Lewis' long-time assistant, Sallie.  
Senator Lewis, enjoy your retirement. 
You have worked hard. 
The Senate will miss you. 
May you have a long and happy retirement. 
We hope to see you and Grace often. 
You will be missed in this place.  
Hon. Edward M. Lawson :
He came from that part of world. 
The old senator passed on. 
The minister responded that he, too, had a confession. 
Senator Lewis, we shall miss you!  
I have greatly appreciated this Newfoundlander's qualities. 
Senator Lewis carried out his duties with honesty and ability. 
This is a rare skill!  
Senator Lewis, you have done both your province and your country proud with your service. 
I wish you all the very best.  
Hon. P. Derek Lewis :
Honourable senators, I thank the previous speakers for their comments. 
I will leave the disputing to others. 
I must say, I certainly enjoyed working with members on both sides of the chamber. 
Some of those activities were so unpredictable that they could at times be personally confusing.  
Over the years, many new senators have expressed similar concerns. 
Two committees on which I served come to mind. 
It had a different name then. 
It was a pleasure to work with the staff and officials of the committee. 
More recently, our chairperson has been Senator Hervieux-Payette. 
I myself served for a while as the joint chairman of the committee.  
The work of this committee was most interesting and important. 
That report was tabled in 1984. 
As honourable senators know, nothing has changed since.  
I recommend that senators read that report. 
These questions have, over the years, been largely ignored. 
I thank all staff and officials for the kindness and help they have shown me. 
I should mention one other thing. 
I do not do so as a point of privilege. 
It appears that there is a prankster in the chamber. 
I know not from where it came.  
It is probably from Grace!  
The Late Allan Austin Lamport, O.C. 
Hon. Francis William Mahovlich :
Honourable senators, the former mayor of Toronto, Allan Austin Lamport, has passed away. 
The year was 1953-54, the subway was open, and Lampy was mayor. 
This was a blessing for anyone who had to work at Maple Leaf Gardens. 
The subway saved time.  
The mayor was famous for his malapropisms or "Berra-isms". 
Before the U.S. had Yogi Berra, Canada had Allan Lamport. 
Here are some of them: 
Lampy found his "Lampy-isms" a formidable weapon in his political career.  
Hon. Peter A. Stollery :
I should like to associate myself with his remarks for personal reasons. 
My father, Alan Stollery, was a great supporter of Allan Lamport. 
First Report of Committee Tabled 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
First Report of Special Committee Tabled 
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
( For text of report see today's Journals of the Senate) 
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration 
First Report of Committee Tabled 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
(For text of report, see today's Journals of the Senate .)  
First Report of Special Committee Tabled 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Legal and Constitutional Affairs 
Notice of Motion to Authorize Committee to Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
Honourable senators, I give notice that on Tuesday next, November 30, 1999, I will move: 
Privileges, Standing Rules and Orders 
Committee Authorized to Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
I said 4:30.  
I thought the Speaker pro tempore had said 3:30 p.m. 
We are turning the whole thing upside down.  
Four committees in two days have asked to sit while the Senate is sitting. 
I leave that with senators to reflect upon. 
They seem to be constantly intruding on the work of the Senate. 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, Senator Lynch-Staunton, the Leader of the Opposition, has raised a valid point. 
Hon. Peter A. Stollery :
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it your pleasure honourable senators to adopt the motion?  
Replacement of Sea King Helicopter Fleet 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
In other words, the minister has been sitting on this for some time now. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, these are encouraging signs five years after the fact. 
The patient is not very well.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, my concern is for the well-being of Canadian Armed Forces personnel. 
The equipment is old and unreliable.  
We know that the Hercules are overdue. 
Presumably, that is so we can replace the F-18s.  
Why can we not purchase that new equipment and put it to work?  
Please act before we lose any more lives.  
These programs are underway. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
National Hockey League- Possibility of Government Aid to Teams 
Honourable senators, my question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
They would then give that property tax rebate to the Ottawa Senators. 
Will such aid be distributed equally to all Canadian hockey teams?  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Obviously, this latest measure was welcome news in the process. 
It represents a measure which, perhaps, is encouraging in the overall picture. 
They have done that reasonably well. 
I do not want to advance those arguments. 
I am speculating on what some objections may have been. 
Honourable senators, I am fairly consistent. 
I do not like subsidies of any kind. 
The year before it received $903 million. 
Book publishers received $31,643,742 last year. 
There is money for movie producers and television networks. 
This government should be ashamed of itself. 
You should be writing those cheques tomorrow.  
I certainly will convey his strong feelings to those concerned. 
That is the Liberal philosophy!  
Delayed Answer to Oral Questions 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Agriculture and Agri-Food 
Agricultural Income Disaster Assistance (AIDA) 
Here are some key changes: 
Changes to NISA have also helped put money in producers' pockets: 
The overpayment charge for interim withdrawals has been reduced.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
Has this ever been done before?  
I thank Senator Corbin for his question. 
I am afraid it is a precedent. 
I have not received such advice. 
Therefore, I conclude that this is a novel practice.  
The bill is now out of the Senate. 
We have referred it, with an instruction to report back, to the Banking Committee. 
Therefore, the bill will not be in more than one place at a time. 
It has gone to the Banking Committee. 
When they have concluded their deliberations, it will go to the Foreign Affairs Committee. 
I think this procedure will work. 
I hope that helps the honourable senator.  
In that way, the bill will not be in limbo somewhere.  
We are not doing it today, we did it yesterday. 
What we are doing today is simply clarifying what was done.  
We should proceed along clear-cut procedural lines. 
I am not comfortable with the way we have decided to do it.  
I accept the criticism, honourable senators, if that is what it is. 
It cannot delay until the other committee has reported. 
In that way, we would be staying within the ambit of the rules. 
However, I must also add that I think this is an extremely dangerous precedent.  
Again, I accept that criticism, honourable senators.  
It is not criticism.  
Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
Mr. Chapman went on to state: 
It formalizes our participation.  
Following Marc Garneau will be Chris Hadfield, on his second mission to space. 
Scientific discovery is advanced by our investments in space. 
Our investment advances innovation and spinoffs in our everyday life. 
Additional orders could bring the total contract up to $24 million.  
On motion of Senator DeWare, for Senator Kelly, debate adjourned.  
Speech from the Throne 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
In other words, debate would be completed in eight sitting days.  
In fact, he went so far as to say that it might be dangerous. 
Honourable senators, this is the proper way for subjects to be raised in this chamber. 
There is no impediment to doing so. 
One day's notice is required for very good reason. 
If it were two hours a day...that would be a total of 16 hours. 
Honourable senators, I shall correct the math of the Honourable Senator Kinsella. 
This is hardly an unreasonable number.  
That is more senators than we have!  
Beauchesne's citation 271.1 has this to say: 
I believe the numbers speak for themselves.  
On motion of Senator DeWare, debate adjourned.  
Parliament of Canada Act 
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
Logic, from Locke to Bosanquet, essayed language. 
Yet they could not grasp the poetic mind. 
Metaphor, as Shelley argued, marked out the clouded realm between words and thought. 
Language was poetry before prose. 
To paraphrase Mark Twain, the announcement of literature's death is somewhat premature.  
How do we remember history? 
In the Davidic biblical period, it was the Psalms. 
In the Peloponnesian Wars, it was the Iliad. 
In the days of the first Common Era, it was the Sermon on the Mount. 
In the First English Commonwealth, it was the daunting poetry of Milton. 
Even Jacques Cartier was a poet. 
There are over 1,500 published poets in Canada. 
Louis Riel was a published poet. 
The duties of the Poet Laureate are, and are meant to be, minimalist. 
The Parliamentary Poet Laureate, during the two-year term, shall: 
( a ) write poetry, especially for use in Parliament on occasions of state; 
( b ) sponsor poetry readings; 
Nothing should interfere with the work of the poet to write poetry.  
Honourable senators, I commend this modest bill to you for your thoughtful consideration.  
On motion of Senator Kinsella, debate adjourned.  
Report of Foreign Affairs Committee on Study- Order Stands 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
I believe that the order should stand in the name of a sitting senator.  
Hon. P. Derek Lewis (The Hon. the Acting Speaker) :
Is that agreed, honourable senators?  
Order stands in the name of Senator Hays.  
Social Affairs, Science and Technology 
Committee Authorized to Study Developments Respecting Euthanasia and Assisted Suicide 
Of Life and Death . 
In particular, the Committee shall be authorized to examine: 
2. Developments in Canada respecting the issues dealt with in the report; 
3. Developments in foreign jurisdictions respecting the issues dealt with in the report; and 
That the Committee submit its final report no later than June 6, 2000.-( 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Present State and Future of Aboriginal Peoples 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
I drive past a school called Sergeant Tommy Prince School. 
He actually served in World War II. 
When I go by that school, I am mindful of the conditions of aboriginal people. 
They would sometimes knock on the door and we would always purchase them. 
That was my only contact in my province with aboriginal people.  
They are certainly a significant part in terms of what they contribute to the province.  
It was the only school they were eligible to attend at the high school level. 
They rarely participated in classroom discussions and very quickly dropped out. 
That young man left me absolutely stunned. 
What fascinated me was that this young man had not been born in Canada. 
He was an immigrant. 
He came to Canada at the age of two or three. 
His parents were extremely well educated and sophisticated. 
These were not uneducated people. 
The comments made by her classmates were negative. 
Cathi's understanding of aboriginal people came from Theresa. 
Theresa taught her of the strengths of her aboriginal community. 
Mr. Lathlin invited me to visit the classrooms, and so I went. 
I must tell you that it was quite remarkable. 
It was a remarkable event to watch.  
It is true that we have made progress. 
There are now doctors and lawyers and dentists who are aboriginal. 
But that is not enough.  
Now they are dying prematurely because of brittle diabetes. 
We know diabetes can be controlled 
We have not received that substantive response. 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Honourable senators, Senator Carstairs' speech is compelling. 
I am sensitive to the issue on which he rose.  
Something else bothers me in Senator Carstairs' speech. 
Why is it that the government has not yet forcefully responded to those particular issues? 
Does the reason have to do with money, or is it more than that?  
Senator Grafstein, I do not think it is just money. 
In my opinion, it is lack of political will. 
Honourable Senator Chalifoux is here. 
Both she and I have been interested in the question of the homeless in Toronto. 
We are delighted that a minister has been named to coordinate this effort. 
She has done a fabulous job across this country. 
That is our expectation.  
Who is responsible, then?  
We, as Canadian taxpayers, are thus paying more for their hospital care. 
I wish I had a solution to the honourable senator's dilemma. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, the time allocated for this debate has expired. 
Is it your pleasure to extend the time to allow Senator Carstairs to answer?  
Honourable senators, Senator Finestone has asked specifically what we in this chamber can do. 
I think we have two vehicles. 
First, we have the Standing Senate Committee on Aboriginal Peoples. 
Sometimes, however, it is necessary to prod our committees a bit. 
On motion of Senator Carstairs, for Senator Watt, debate adjourned.

This motion does not have any such reference.  
On Monday, it is not an issue. 
We will be sitting at 1:00 on Monday. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, November 30, 1999, at 2:00 p.m.
