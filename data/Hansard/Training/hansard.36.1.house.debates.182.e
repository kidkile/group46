GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Charles Hubbard (Miramichi, Lib.):
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have the honour to present two petitions this morning. 
Today on budget day I hope the minister heeds that call.  
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
They call for a full judicial inquiry.  
Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Question No. 132 will be answered today. 
Question No. 132- Mr. John Cummins: 
I am informed by the departments of health and national defence as follows: 
The study designe is a double blinded, randomized, placebo controlled trial. 
The suggested sample size requires 280 persons per active and placebo group.  
Age over 18 years; 
2. Expected deployment to an area requiring mefloquine (chloroquine resistant area); and 
3. Informed, voluntary consent to participate in the study.  
Prior use of mefloquine, with or without an adverse drug reaction; 
4. Any allergy to the study medications.  
c) Health Canada did not undertake any formal investigations in October 1997. 
I ask, Mr. Speaker, that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
CITIZENSHIP OF CANADA ACT 
He has six minutes remaining in his allotted time.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to resume the debate. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Speaker, as I was stating, in my opinion the immigration system is broken. 
The minister is either unwilling or unable to fix it. 
We do point out problems with the system because there are problems with the system. 
I will continue to raise those issues- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of relevancy. 
Bill C-63 is about citizenship. 
I think he knows his remarks must be relevant to the bill. 
In the meantime, I will continue to make the same point. 
We would like to see the system of immigration addressed.  
Too much time has been spent on it. 
I think we have studied the criminality question enough at the present time. 
We should be getting on to some other very important issues''.  
There is a problem happening in Vancouver with an abuse of the immigration system. 
Canadians see the relevance. 
They see that the system is broken. 
The Honduran situation in Vancouver is one of them. 
The parliamentary secretary has the gall to say- 
Right now they are irrelevant. 
They are not addressing the citizenship act before this House.  
I invite him to do so at the earliest opportunity.  
Mr. Speaker, for the third time I will try. 
I will mention something one more time. 
That is the whole realm of the minister's responsibility. 
They do not want to listen to positive changes. 
There is a force of negativity coming from the government side. 
Obviously that does not seem to be happening so far today. 
In this bill I do not see a lot of substantive changes. 
I thank you for listening, Mr. Speaker. 
You have been very attentive. 
I wish I could say the same for the government members.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for the question.  
I am a bit surprised that members of the government do not see that link. 
I came to this country as a refugee. 
There are many refugees in this country who became citizens. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The hon. House leader has a point. 
How does the member opposite- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I have to suggest that this person is totally off topic. 
He is not making any relevant comments to the bill.  
I would like an apology from the parliamentary secretary. 
He is talking about my family. 
Please withdraw that comment.  
He knows it and he is continuing this rhetoric. 
That is an unbelievable comment coming from a member of the government. 
That is what we are here for. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
I am an immigrant. 
I immigrated to Canada in 1968. 
I guess the parliamentary secretary thinks I would stand up and slander myself. 
He says we slander immigrants, which I totally object to.  
He will have his turn to talk, I am sure.  
I thought it was valuable. 
I thought it was worthwhile and it is something that should be done. 
I thought it was great the way they did it in the years we arrived. 
Does he believe there should not be any screening at all? 
I would like the member's comments on that.  
We know that being a citizen is a privilege in this country. 
That is what Canada was built on.  
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
My own remarks will touch directly on the subject.  
They now have friends and neighbours of various origins. 
More than ever they do business all over the planet. 
By touching on political identity, this legislation reflects Canadians.  
I would like to emphasize two important aspects of Bill C-63. 
First, it corresponds to our modern way of understanding citizenship. 
Second, it recognizes the increased importance we give to the sentiment of belonging.  
Even then, Canada was innovative. 
This is one of the important changes proposed by Bill C-63. 
Our government recognizes the importance of adoption for the family. 
We are all aware that the rules of trade have changed a great deal. 
Economic borders have become more permeable. 
All citizens are equal; this is an inviolable principle.  
Canada wants good honest citizens who are able to integrate. 
Their children will remain Canadian citizens throughout their entire lives. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened to the hon. member very carefully. 
That is one aspect.  
We are talking about citizenship by birth. 
We want to continue this most important Canadian tradition.  
This is totally unacceptable.  
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask my colleague from Laval West a question.  
So, I would ask my colleague what provision is made for this fact.  
By integrating, I mean learning the French language and the culture of Quebec. 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member made some racist comments. 
That is not true. 
I have frequently been accused of this by members opposite. 
They say that my party or myself is trying to stop immigration. 
That is complete nonsense and out of order.  
The extra $900 goes to general revenue to balance the budget. 
If this is not a racist policy, what is it? 
How does she justify this? 
Mr. Speaker, I take great exception to the charge of racism. 
My record speaks for itself. 
I take great exception to this charge.  
We must not close our eyes to the fact that we may be born elsewhere. 
Why does he want to go back to immigration? 
We will come to immigration in due time.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
I do not think we can talk about one without talking about the other.  
We clearly see that the government can do this. 
That is part of the problem. 
I have people come into my constituency office. 
There are families whose family circles are broken. 
This is where I want to talk about citizenship. 
What do these ads say? 
This is precisely one of the things that is wrong with our immigration policy. 
I do not think Canadian citizenship is something that should be able to be bought.  
I make this point to the government. 
I do not think it is. 
I do not believe that being a Canadian is a commodity. 
I do not think it is something that can be bought. 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
I was glad that the government was actually listening instead of heckling. 
I hope that the message is getting through.  
That is exactly what my colleague was pointing out.  
I want to ask my colleague this question. 
I want to make him aware of a comment made by a CIC official. 
This is another example of an abuse of the system. 
Mr. Speaker, I did not use the term citizenship of convenience when I spoke. 
There may be all kinds of problems with fraud but that is another matter altogether. 
That is not what I was addressing. 
That is what disturbs me.  
I do not disagree with him. 
It is still a problem. 
It is all the same. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Representing the riding of Vancouver East has been a real privilege. 
That is something people are very proud of.  
I know what it means to them and I know what it means to me. 
I remember becoming a Canadian citizen. 
They fall far short of that.  
One problem is that the system is very often suspicious of people. 
There has been a lot of concern about the language requirements. 
They created new businesses. 
They provided the cultural diversity which blossomed within the city.  
The signals being sent out concern a lot of people.  
These are matters of serious concern. 
Those of the kinds of things we want to get away from. 
That is what has made this country great. 
It is something I am very proud of in east Vancouver.  
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
What do we do with the child if the parent has to be deported? 
These are difficult questions. 
Now it allows one five years to accumulate these three years of actual residence. 
I think we can all accept that. 
I have concerns about the widespread use of regulations. 
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member for St. John's East. 
It is refreshing to have somebody stand and talk to the specifics of the act.  
He raised the issue that it could be a child of a refugee. 
He is concerned about the implications. 
If so we would like to know about it.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.  
I am not aware of any particular instance where that clause has been abused. 
What do we do with the child if the parent has to be deported? 
That is a reasonable concern. 
It should be raised in the House of Commons. 
The minister should address the concern and bring an answer back to the House.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
I want to concentrate on several issues within it. 
I will be splitting my time. 
In fact that is quite true. 
One has to wonder what possesses people in Canada to advertise this in other countries. 
I pursued it a lot further than that. 
The police actually investigated the company. 
Is this a surprise in the House of Commons? 
The Liberal government knows about the ads. 
The Liberal government knows how this is working. 
Yet the Liberal government allows it to continue. 
It goes to show that on the surface bills like this one look great. 
I have attended lots of deportation hearings of criminals. 
I have been an intervener in those hearings. 
Perhaps he could resume his remarks without those kinds of references.  
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
I have been through that more than anybody in the House.  
I tried to be an intervener in that process and was cut off. 
To beat a deportation certificate. 
I hope that is what he meant.  
That member said if someone is convicted, not charged but convicted. 
The member referred to the Hondurans who are charged before the courts. 
The fact is these Hondurans are on film. 
They have been selling drugs to our kids in Vancouver. 
I can cite dozens of examples like this. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak in this debate today. 
It is a bunch of nonsense.  
We are out there listening to people. 
We have members elected by Canadians who know what immigration is all about.  
We know Canada is built on immigrants. 
We are talking ratios of our party to any party in this House. 
We have more than all the other opposition parties combined. 
We have talked to the people who are building Canada. 
This government wants to talk about citizenship. 
It has taken four and a half years. 
Government members have talked about penalties for bureaucratic delays. 
What does the government do in this bill? 
What does that mean? 
This is a bureaucratic insert in the bill. 
I say that because bureaucrats like delays.  
Let us look at the L.A. office. 
This party brought it to the attention of the House. 
He should never have been approved there. 
We do not need those bureaucratic delays. 
We know somebody has taken off with the money but where is it? 
Yet what do we have in this bill? 
That is in this bill. 
It is not a very good section of the bill. 
It is really rather embarrassing.  
Where are the bills on the refugee issue? 
Where are the bills on the criminality? 
How many have been deported? 
They probably reapplied to get their citizenship. 
We want to talk about this bill. 
Where are those people today? 
I doubt that very much. 
The member smiles on the other side and asks if they have been convicted yet. 
Yes, a lot of them have been convicted.  
He produced his papers for us. 
This young man had been in the country nine days. 
He was wearing quite nice clothes. 
The policeman said ``You're mumbling. 
You have something in your mouth. 
So he spit out $1,700 worth of crack cocaine. 
I asked the Vancouver police why they did not arrest him. 
As members know, in British Columbia the police cannot lay charges. 
Charges have to be laid by a crown prosecutor. 
It is not worthwhile to arrest this fellow. 
These are the words of the Vancouver police. 
They are frustrated over this whole issue.  
I saw the man spit the crack cocaine out. 
It is an illegal substance. 
We know he is peddling or using it. 
He should have been taken in. 
It is not a bad place to be. 
Talk to the member for North Vancouver. 
He came here as an immigrant and applied. 
What is wrong with the system?  
I want these immigrants to become citizens of Canada. 
We should be encouraging it. 
I hope we can get this section changed in committee.  
It should not be a penalty for them. 
This bill is wrong and we will oppose it.  
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
Is that the thrust of the member's argument?  
Mr. Speaker, it is not a cavalier attitude. 
We have a process and we agree with that process. 
They should count for the amount of time they have been here. 
This allows the bureaucrats any delays they want. 
I think everybody in this House would want it. 
We should do what we can to encourage them. 
He was one of the greatest lieutenant governors we ever had.  
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my colleague has spent a great deal of time in politics. 
That has been shown in their attitudes here today. 
Mr. Speaker, I have already mentioned the one fault with the bill. 
Those are two issues of the bill which are of concern to me.  
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
We must clearly reflect contemporary Canadian values. 
Bill C-63 aims to modernize Canada's citizenship legislation.  
Of course the concept of citizenship has evolved over time. 
I would like to explain some of the changes the bill outlines.  
Bill C-63 does not propose a change to this policy.  
Citizenship is also granted to children born outside the country to Canadian parents. 
The legislation would also increase the chances for family reunification. 
We understand that need and respect the wishes of the Canadian family. 
It is important to have the family united in this land.  
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
I understand that the Citizenship Act has not been amended since 1947.  
It is something I have been promoting. 
Canada is a young country in the family of nations. 
At the same time we are continuing to evolve and build our traditions. 
It was a tremendous event. 
They wanted to come here for a very important reason. 
They wanted very much to be part of this country.  
Those were great celebrations. 
When I look at the oath of citizenship I see three themes. 
The first deals with respect for our democratic traditions. 
Canadians have developed their own unique traditions. 
Another theme seems to be rights and freedoms. 
They may possibly have come from countries that did not have those rights and freedoms. 
Canadians developed their own charter of rights and freedoms. 
The other theme seems essentially to be a respect for our laws. 
I have studied this issue of oath because it interested me. 
Canadians respect their laws and respect their democratic values. 
This is a very powerful statement of people.  
It partially says that but it goes a little further. 
My colleague who just spoke specifically mentioned the oath.  
Something to this effect is a more appropriate oath for Canadians.  
Some people will mention the monarchy. 
I am not opposed. 
I am not an anti-monarchist. 
I am pro-Canadian. 
Some of them did come from the United Kingdom. 
I know what was going through their minds. 
What they often asked me was what had they done. 
They thought they were coming to a new country. 
I had to agree with them.  
This is not anti-anything. 
Nobody can steal our tradition as a people. 
I am not talking about doing away with it. 
Canada can continue to be part of the British commonwealth. 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, Canadian citizenship is worthy of protection. 
Our citizenship is very highly regarded internationally. 
I can remember sitting at committees where they were dominated by the Liberal government. 
This minister chose to ignore that recommendation.  
This long tradition started in 1977, not quite so long ago. 
In 1995 there were 500 births to foreign women in British Columbia alone. 
But who is to say what problems might arise in the future? 
Some of these returning Canadians might be members of organized crime. 
What if some of these individuals have significant health problems? 
They will not be denied entry. 
I received 3,685 responses. 
Only 341 people said yes. 
The second issue this raises is adoption outside Canada. 
This is where a Canadian married a Romanian girl in Romania. 
The daughter could come before the wife.  
Before I close I would like to bring up the business of citizenship judges. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and Youth), Lib.):
Even if they were, our society has many people with the same problems.  
We are an accepting democratic nation. 
Why do we always have to look at it from an angle of negativity? 
Why do we set a negative premise?  
Let us look at the aboriginal history of Canada. 
Then what would we have? 
What would we have had? 
Why are we not more generous, more understanding and more accepting? 
Why are we not working together on this policy?  
It lets in people with criminal records. 
It lets people who are known terrorists in the international scene. 
It is more generous than it should be.  
My comments were about newly born children. 
Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Brampton Centre, Lib.):
Does the hon. member agree with changing the words in the oath? 
Now we have the changes but she has not said anything. 
Does she agree with the changes or not?  
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
They find out they are not Canadian citizens when they thought they were.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
I was not born in this country. 
I felt very proud of my status as a Canadian citizen. 
I am a Canadian by choice.  
As well, my sister married an immigrant from Nigeria.  
It is a danger to them in some cases.  
What does the minister do? 
The minister decides to fill up the windshield wiper fluid container. 
That is about what the bill does. 
The government is well aware of this. 
In fact that was done.  
The committee did its work. 
They released a very thoughtful report. 
The committee did its work with commendable timeliness. 
What do we find in the bill? 
I do not know what good it did. 
That is about all the bill does.  
We are not quite sure what the commissioners are going to do. 
I could make a number of other criticisms about the bill. 
Unfortunately 10 minutes goes very quickly.  
I hope to speak to it again at third reading.  
The member mentioned that we do not have any legislation before us. 
It was therefore deemed that commissioners would be much more appropriate. 
However, that will be open to debate once it gets to committee.  
The member also wanted to know what the functions would be of a citizenship commissioner. 
That is the way I see it.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Kelowna makes a good point. 
The Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration has already studied this problem. 
It is one of the frustrations I have with the way the House works. 
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
I found a job. 
It was one of the proudest days of my life. 
From that moment on I joined the Canadian family. 
I became eligible to vote. 
I became eligible to stand for elected office. 
I became eligible to carry the most respected passport in the world.  
There are also changes to the residency requirements for citizenship. 
I think that is the right way to go.  
I firmly support these two amendments.  
Citizenship must be earned. 
People like them should not be allowed to stay in Canada. 
I do have faith it will become law. 
Unlike many of you, I was not born in Canada. 
Our country is a mosaic and not a melting pot. 
The honour and dignity of Canadian citizenship are yours. 
Please treasure it and be proud of it''.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
I have a couple of comments and then a couple of questions for the member.  
We are certainly thinking alike on that.  
I would not debate that a great deal. 
What should we do? 
I think the citizenship judge will be gone and replaced with some patronage appointment.  
I would like the hon. member's comments, please.  
He was appointed by a previous government. 
He is a good citizenship judge. 
That is what is important. 
What are we going to call them? 
Are we going to call them judges or commissioners? 
In my opinion that is not too important. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
I am glad he chose Canada. 
I am one of those who was born in Canada. 
If it did not matter, it would not be here. 
Could the member please explain that?  
If the majority of committee members support it, the amendment will be accepted.  
Mr. Speaker, I have another comment following the member's reply to my colleague.  
I am not sure how many committees this member has sat on. 
I have been on many committees. 
Four or five years ago the committee submitted a very comprehensive report. 
Liberal members contributed a great deal to the report. 
Where is that piece of work by the committee? 
It has not been brought forward. 
There is no reflection of it in this bill whatsoever.  
Committees on the Hill are not very functional. 
It is obvious that is what is happening. 
What happened to that good report which I know the member is aware of? 
Where is it at?  
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is aware that we have a process to follow. 
The committee could be as effective as the members are effective. 
The committee could be as progressive as the members are progressive. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
There was not even a decent burial.  
Canadians see it as a massive corruptive unit. 
Let us hope that this changes for good.  
This is a fact and a terrible thing but it happens.  
Many of those people are still here. 
I believe we ought to exercise more care.  
They were welcomed in Canada and they made outstanding citizens. 
Let us hope this bill changes that.  
What steps are being taken now to prevent illegal immigrants coming to this country? 
What steps are being taken to speed up the deportation of these people? 
I wish I did but I do not.  
These people are still with us. 
That is the history of this country.  
We came here as immigrants. 
It is important that we keep that in mind. 
Yes, there is some criminality. 
He mentioned the Ukrainians and the Chinese. 
There is a long history of that. 
Those people were not the most outstanding characters who came from France. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The hon. member is on questions and comments. 
Mr. Speaker, this is referring to what the member said. 
It is a commentary on what he said. 
It is important to look at history. 
Some of it is quite humorous.  
The hon. gentleman knows my area of complaint. 
I want to make one correction. 
It seems to me that immigration leads to citizenship. 
It seems like we should be dealing with immigration.  
I am proud of those people I have worked with. 
I am proud to have worked with immigrants for years. 
I am proud to have their children within my educational institution. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Unfortunately Bill C-63 contains blatant patronage.  
Nor did she elaborate on how many commissioners she would be appointing.  
The legislation does not state how this advice to the minister would be accomplished.  
What we have now is a public relations job. 
We have a case of clear, blatant patronage. 
We have no substantive changes in this regard.  
We have not seen any major changes in that regard. 
They think that vigilance is required with regard to some of these issues. 
We have a behind closed doors process with no parliamentary oversight.  
I am sorry, but the whole thing smells of Liberal arrogance. 
Like I say, we go back to this issue of patronage appointments. 
We can change the name but a Liberal apparatchik smells the same. 
What it boils down to is clear vote brokering.  
This is not the only example of this type of thing. 
What message does that send out to other immigrants? 
The bill has a lot of other unsavoury aspects to it. 
If the parent is to be deported, what is the status of the child? 
The quality of immigrants determines the quality of citizenship in the country. 
That is a lax system and we have serious problems with it.  
Instead of penalizing the bureaucrats we are penalizing the applicants to the process. 
There is something warped about that and something only a bureaucrat could enjoy.  
We have not seen anything.  
The auditor general reports that we have 20,000 people to be deported. 
Yet the records only demonstrate that 4,000 have actually been deported. 
There are Liberal lawyers who are pulling the strings and making money off the system. 
The whole thing smells.  
We have all these issues with the criminality being advertised and everything else.  
It is something we should consider as well.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have been listening to the debate today. 
In fact, they have probably left simply because of that.  
I find the member's explanation astounding. 
They cannot have it both ways. 
We all know there are problems with the system. 
There are 16,000 people unaccounted for. 
We have no exit controls and no way of knowing.  
I will throw another number at him if he is not sick of numbers yet. 
If he does not believe it, he can read them for himself.  
That just does not wash.  
For the member to say that is totally wrong. 
Mr. Speaker, I will tell the member about outrage. 
That is not even on the record books. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
The first statement inside is ``This enactment replaces the existing Citizenship Act''. 
I am a Canadian citizen. 
We should be able to say that with pride. 
We are proud of our country.  
Not a single person in that arena was not singing the national anthem. 
Their hands were clasped over their hearts and they were singing with pride.  
We should be proud to be Canadian.  
I was born here. 
My grandfather was an immigrant to Canada. 
He chose to come here. 
I am so happy that he did. 
What was her reply? 
That seems to me to be the typical Liberal interpretation of legislation. 
I decry that kind of statement.  
I will now ask a whole series of questions. 
These are the issues the chamber was concerned about. 
Who will be doing the standardized language testing? 
Will this be a major expense and undertaking?  
There are tremendous cultural differences with respect to language use. 
Who is going to do the language testing overseas? 
This will cause an even greater backlog than there is now. 
That training would be totally payable by the immigrants. 
The minister on her own volition has proposed the following oath: 
What is left out of the present oath are the words ``heirs and successors''. 
It should be allegiance to the Queen followed by heirs and successors. 
That has been eliminated in the proposed oath. 
The oath adds a couple of very interesting phrases. 
It adds the phrase ``respect our country's rights and freedoms''. 
And who grants those rights and freedoms? 
Do the citizens grant the rights and freedoms to the country? 
Does the country grant those rights and freedoms to itself? 
Does some other country grant those rights and freedoms to another country? 
Does the United Nations do it? 
Does the World Court do it? 
Who grants these rights and freedoms to the country?  
The second phrase is ``to defend our democratic values''. 
I am unalterably in favour of the values we hold as a democratic society. 
That is what we need to do. 
I must do that and I myself pledge to do that.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member on his intervention. 
It is very important that all members take that point of view. 
I respect the member for that.  
Would he support that statement?  
Total investment of $50,000 Canadian, approximately $30,000 U.S.''. 
Was that the Government of Canada?  
I am not accusing anybody of doing it. 
I know there is an official ad.  
We do not want people from a criminal element. 
We do not want that in our society. 
We do not want to advertise for them to come to Canada.  
I see that it is almost two o'clock. 
The hon. member still has three minutes of questions and comments. 
We will now go to Statements by Members.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is budget day 1999. 
The Reform Party agrees.  
This time the government must respond or it will pay the price.  
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to wish all members of parliament a happy new year. 
Xin nian kuai le . 
EAST COAST MUSIC AWARDS 
Mr. Charles Hubbard (Miramichi, Lib.):
The music industry on the east coast is vibrant and in constant expansion.  
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Books, newspapers and magazines are instruments of freedom. 
Schools feature classroom discussions on censorship.  
To be able to read one has to be literate. 
The hon. member for Vancouver Quadra.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
It is an exercise in good faith and good constitutionalism.  
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
To all Canadians I wish happiness and prosperity for this, the year of the rabbit.  
Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):
The asbestos strike marked a total change in mindset. 
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
There is no doubt that this alert needs to be taken seriously. 
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
This day marks the beginning of a new chapter in our nation's history.  
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Across Canada virtually all remaining Buchenwald detainees are doing the same.  
This is an insult.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
But that is not all. 
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Clearly, this is a custom they hold very dear.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):
George's earlier this month.  
Those are the real facts.  
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, Nunavut held its first general election yesterday. 
A monumental task has been accomplished, but much still remains to be done. 
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Middlesex, Lib.):
I hope to see everyone at this year's Stratford Festival.  
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Mr. Speaker, the budget will be handed down today shortly after 4 o'clock.  
The hon. member for Delta-South Richmond.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
There is no denying the inaccuracy of the government numbers. 
They now admit to underestimating third party compensation. 
The deal is a good deal only for the Minister of Finance because this government- 
We will now go to oral questions.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
The hon. member for Edmonton North.  
They are the people in waiting lines here. 
That is the Liberal legacy.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
The Liberals are the sponsors of two tier health care. 
It is under their watch that governments have cut spending drastically. 
Mr. Speaker, I will say it again. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We work in collaboration with them. 
That is why we had a very good meeting two weeks ago. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
We already know what is in it.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We have been obliged to cut everybody to make sure we have a balanced budget. 
For the last two years we have had a balanced budget. 
It has been going on for six months and- 
The hon. member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
This budget today is not a health care budget. 
It is not a budget for hardworking Canadians. 
He is sitting on a large surplus. 
Why is he raising taxes again this year? 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The hon. member for Prince George-Bulkley Valley.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
I think he is finished, Mr. Speaker. 
I would ask the hon. member to go directly to his question.  
Why is the government doing it again? 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Hopefully, but I do not know absolutely, there will be a very good budget again. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
He is being generous with our money.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
This is true as well for Quebeckers, who are very concerned about health care. 
I think there will be good news for Bernard Landry.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I understand that the leader of the Bloc Quebecois is somewhat nervous. 
That must upset the Bloc Quebecois a bit.  
That is a good balance and sound management.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the President of the Treasury Board.  
The President of the Treasury Board is once again a compulsive fund raider. 
Why is he doing that?  
The deficits and the surpluses which are in the accounts are created by accountants. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, we have negotiated at table two. 
These regional rates will continue.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Delay and deny have become trademarks of the Liberal government. 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, as I indicated yesterday, the payment will be fair and reasonable. 
It will be done between my office and the public complaints commission.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
The question that remains is simple. 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
The question is will it be meaningful. 
It will be meaningful only if the Prime Minister turns up. 
Does that everyone include the Prime Minister?  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we get one step forward and two steps back. 
What are we supposed to believe, the Prime Minister's words or his actions?  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there has been no misappropriation. 
Everything is in the books very clearly. 
The Auditor General of Canada made a decision in 1990, which we respect. 
We comply with the law, there is no problem in that regard.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, quite the opposite. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
It has finally agreed to fund everyone in that hearing. 
It is the government that has to listen to this independent inquiry.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
FEDERAL EMPLOYEES' PENSION FUND 
Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the pension fund is a legislated fund. 
It is important that my hon. colleague understand this.  
Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Bruno-Saint-Hubert, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, again, I think it is very clear. 
It is a legislated fund, with the government guaranteeing to pay pensions.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
We see the results. 
The minister has known about this for some time.  
My question is for the defence minister. 
When are you going to replace the aging Sea King helicopters?  
Please address the questions always through the Chair.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
What the government has done is invested in new search and rescue helicopters. 
It has bought new armoured personnel carries. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Our pilots are taking undue risks flying old equipment. 
When will our pilots, their crews and their families get new helicopters?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
We are in the final stages of doing that.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. 
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there are no cases of harrassment. 
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
As my colleague points out, their challenges will be many. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
This is a slap in the face to democracy and an insult to Canadians.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the truth is the government does not intend to- 
The hon. member for Red Deer has the floor.  
It does not want to debate the plan in the House.  
Canada is not a dictatorship. 
There should be an open and frank discussion about it before the decision is made. 
The hon. Minister of National Defence.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I never said such nonsense at all.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the last questioner and this questioner has one thing in common. 
In this case it is not true. 
The $750 million figure we gave is the correct figure.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my supplementary question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
This is another way to help the poorest countries.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
The government has committed itself to settling outstanding claims and we will do that.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
My next question will be simpler. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
I have met with these agricultural groups. 
I have talked with them about their legitimate concerns.  
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Could he tell us about the latest developments in aquaculture?  
Hon. Gilbert Normand (Secretary of State (Agriculture and Agri-Food)(Fisheries and Oceans), Lib.):
He was selected in a competition involving 172 applications. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
My question is for the revenue minister. 
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.  
We have given two alternatives to our employers. 
Certainly, if we need to take further action, we will take that under serious consideration.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
They are seeking support from the community mobilization program. 
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
The hon. member then asked a second question in relation to home invasions. 
The hon. member for Compton-Stanstead.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
This is the same engine of the ill-fated Labrador.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
That matter has been identified and it is in fact being rectified. 
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton-Springdale, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
What is our government doing to make winter driving safer?  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
This shows how the government in particular is concerned about road safety.  
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
He's full of shit.  
In short, he was given preferential treatment.  
You're a liar.  
I direct myself directly to the member for Scarborough Centre. 
Did you use the word liar? 
I would like you to withdraw it.  
I take it back.  
We are going to hear the question from the member for York South-Weston.  
If a professional athlete falls ill he or she is given preferential treatment.  
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the principles of the Canada Health Act are clear. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
It is appropriate that the member for Scarborough Centre withdraw those words as well.  
He has asked me to ask the hon. member for Scarborough Centre about this. 
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
That matter is behind us. 
I address myself to the hon. member. 
And if he did, will he please withdraw them.  
Mr. Speaker, absolutely, as I did earlier.  
We have settled this matter.  
The hon. member for Scarborough Centre wishes to seek the floor. 
If it is another point I will hear it.  
Mr. Speaker, my reference was not to the hon. member for York South-Weston- 
I consider this matter closed.  
CITIZENSHIP OF CANADA ACT 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
I think of some bills that have been before this parliament recently. 
We sometimes refer to them as patronage appointees. 
Permanent resident were the words that were added.  
I talked about this bastion of Canadian culture. 
The report questioned the efficiency of the current system. 
I do welcome these observations. 
They are consistent with some of the conclusions that we ourselves have reached at CIC.  
The issue of removals also warrants particular attention. 
It is not monitored or administered properly. 
They are given a deportation order. 
During that time the person gets married, or they have a child. 
Then they claim they want to stay here under humanitarian grounds. 
They work the system and drag it out. 
Then they go for the risk assessment. 
They wait a few more years and Canadian citizenship is there for the asking. 
They have totally end-run the entire system.  
That is not the case. 
The member should know that.  
People who are set for deportation will be deported. 
The child at that point has the choice of going with his or her parents. 
So far they have gone with the parents.  
Citizenship is granted to people born in this country. 
That is not something new. 
It has always been the case. 
I would hope that the hon. member would recognize that.  
Right there, the auditor general confirmed it to us.  
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We are now into 10 minutes, no questions or comments. 
Resuming debate, the hon. member for Mississauga South.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of clarification. 
I am not sure. 
The opposition seem to be talking about something else.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member has a question of relevancy. 
It is always apropos to raise it. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
The hon. member who just raised a point of order is quite correct. 
I have followed the debate. 
It leads straight to credibility.  
When members rise to speak and to present information, their word is on the line. 
The members of the Reform Party in expressing their values referred often- 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson:
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Does the House give its unanimous consent that the document as referred to be tabled?  
Mr. Speaker, I have the same document in front of me. 
It refers to an address on Bathurst Street in Toronto. 
It is not a government office. 
It is not the Government of Canada. 
This happens to be- 
The document is available to all members. 
How do you know that?  
They will not wait around until someone decides to invite them to leave. 
For the life of me I do not know what an illegal immigrant is. 
It is a contradiction of terms. 
That is not an immigrant or a refugee. 
The member for St. Albert was an immigrant. 
With regard to refugees there is no question. 
Our process allows for the respecting of those human rights regardless of their status. 
We have a system in place. 
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
Our immigration system has been in crisis for years. 
What does the government have to respond to all this? 
What does Bill C-63 say to that? 
We all know where this perverted logic led recently.  
That is kind of an open ended statement. 
That comes from subclause 44(1). 
There is no definition of what adequate is. 
I find that a little hard to swallow. 
That is not the case. 
It is not clear here where the guidelines are.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
It came on in late afternoon. 
The young man appeared to the doctor to be in good health. 
That is the way she related the story. 
I think it was in the neighbourhood of about six months. 
The doctor assumed wrong. 
Frankly I know the doctor involved did not find it funny at all.  
They do not check immigrants to Canada for contagious diseases. 
This is an ad that was placed in a foreign publication. 
There are ads to attract criminals into Canada. 
It was considered a melting pot. 
It was considered an exemplary community at that time. 
At that time we had an immigration policy that made sense. 
Sadly the priorities of government have changed over time. 
Sadly we have a government that puts as its first- 
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan:
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We are debating the immigration bill. 
The hon. member for Skeena was addressing an ad, which in my opinion was relevant. 
It seems that is the only thing the opposition is interested in. 
It is talking about irresponsible companies- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We have a government- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
The hon. member is quite right. 
It is a haven for criminals.  
I cannot understand why the hon. members do not understand. 
We are talking about priorities. 
Canadians are not satisfied with this. 
They want something better. 
They want a better set of priorities. 
I wish the members on the other side would get it. 
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
This legislation has been a long time coming. 
As far back as 1987 the government announced plans to bring in needed amendments.  
What do we have? 
A few of the key recommendations of the standing committee. 
We have a bill that fails in many respects.  
This is fundamentally wrong. 
It will not go away. 
The problem will continue to plague our courts and the immigration system. 
I will now comment on section 6(1)(b) of the legislation. 
Once again the legislation fails to address this loophole.  
Certain individuals are able to take advantage. 
Again, this is wrong and the minister has closed her eyes to the problem. 
She must be held accountable.  
Some judges held that actual physical presence was not necessary. 
They must be paid off through patronage appointments.  
Appointments for a period of up to five years are also very attractive. 
I will now move on to section 43 of the bill. 
Again we see powers of the governor in council. 
There was once a time that members of parliament made the laws of Canada. 
We are also moving closer and closer to concealing our laws from our citizens.  
Statutes are available individually. 
Regulations are another matter. 
Surely this could have been set out within the statute. 
Can we not define spouse within the legislation? 
It is for these reasons that I am unable to support this legislation. 
The minister should be sent back to try again, but that will not happen.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
(Order discharged and bill withdrawn) 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
I also serve on the citizenship and immigration committee- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That would certainly be debate and not a point of order.  
Mr. Speaker, even the points of orders seem to be nonsensical. 
It is about citizenship.  
Let me share with this House a couple of facts. 
The phone number listed in Toronto is no longer in service. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would ask the member to talk about the citizenship act.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Surrey Central has a point of order on relevance. 
I will talk about the bill. 
Is the Reform Party opposed to that? 
The Reform Party does not want to allow that to happen. 
That is the Reform mantra. 
That is what Reformers believe.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am trying to hear the comments of the hon. member. 
Could he address those comments?  
I am reading right off the summary. 
It is the summary of the citizenship of Canada act. 
It is the act.  
It strengthens the integrity of the act and addresses more modern issues. 
That is relevant to the act, unlike the nonsense we have been hearing. 
I think this is a good time to take a break.  
(The sitting of the House was suspended at 4.12 p.m.) 
The House resumed at 4.15 p.m. 
FINANCIAL STATEMENT OF MINISTER OF FINANCE 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.) moved: 
That this House approves in general the budgetary policy of the government.  
What all of this obscures is what budgets should be about.  
It is to build today for a better tomorrow. 
Canadians knew, therefore, that a long-term plan was needed.  
Five years ago, we put that plan in place. 
It is to build on the success of previous years. 
And with this budget, we are.  
It is a budget that continues to equip Canadians to succeed in the 21st century.  
There is no doubt we have felt the effect of the storm. 
No other G-7 country, not even the United States, has matched our record.  
Furthermore, job prospects for young people have improved significantly. 
This is not to say there are no risks. 
Very clearly, there are.  
For Canada, putting this framework in place is a priority.  
At home, the priority is also clear. 
There will be no rewind to the reckless spending of other people's money.  
This budget demonstrates that. 
Second, we must never lose sight of the need to be balanced in our approach.  
A successful society does not run on one cylinder. 
We must respond to the reality that success on one front requires action on several.  
Third, we must never shy away from the need to make choices. 
In today's world, power lies in partnership. 
Canadians have the right to expect that their governments will work together.  
Fifth, we must focus on the longer term. 
Finally, and most important, we must always be fair. 
The test of good government is not to protect privilege for the few. 
It is to provide opportunity for the many.  
Our country has finally left the era of deficit financing behind.  
This means four consecutive years of budgets in the black. 
But nothing could be further from the truth.  
It certainly is beyond those who do not understand it.  
But it means as well that we cannot stop the debt fight now. 
Many other major economies measure only the debt that is owed to markets.  
So far, so good. 
But does this mean that all of the challenges are behind us? 
We are weathering the storm much better than most. 
Here is our response to those who hold those views.  
In 1998, it allowed us to respond to the ice storm. 
This year, it has enabled us to support Canada's farmers who are in difficulty.  
That speaks to our nation's finances. 
However, it does not by itself speak to our nation's future. 
A nation is not a corporation.  
Markets do many things and they do them well. 
But there are many things that markets cannot do.  
Markets deal as they should in services and goods. 
They do not, however, deal with the common good. 
Our purpose is not just to build a better bottom line. 
It is to build a stronger nation.  
Over the decades, Canadians have made a series of defining decisions. 
They were decisions about much more than some government program. 
They were decisions about what kind of country we wanted to be. 
They were the decisions that led to medicare.  
They worry about the costs of paying for services and drugs that are not covered.  
Today with the books balanced we are able to do even more. 
We are renewing and strengthening the equalization program.  
This program reflects the shared commitment of all Canadians.  
In 1996 we began to address this disparity. 
Today we are moving much further and much faster than that. 
It must, and it will remain so. 
Some have said eliminate equal access. 
They have the right to know if the quality of their health system is improving. 
One will provide insight on the health of Canadians. 
Third, the Canada health network is being established on the Internet. 
As has been said, health is more than health care.  
It also allocates additional resources to help ensure food safety in Canada.  
This budget devotes important resources to addressing this serious situation.  
Research is at the core of a quality health care system.  
This begins with good research infrastructure. 
Already exciting projects supported by the CFI are underway. 
As we will say later in the budget, its funding will be enhanced.  
They are working under tremendous stress. 
This budget does just that.  
Finally, the nature of modern health research has changed dramatically. 
They have proposed to create the Canadian institutes of health research.  
It would transform those strengths into an even stronger coherent whole.  
This program has become a huge success in its first year alone.  
Going forward, we must build on these initiatives still further.  
Let us now turn the coin over.  
This budget takes further action in each of those three areas.  
They require a sustained investment.  
Research and access to knowledge support one another. 
This initiative has tremendous potential for a whole range of industries and services.  
The networks of centres of excellence have been a successful part of this endeavour. 
After all, they worked for it. 
The principles of our tax policy are clear.  
First, our tax system must be fair. 
We want tax relief to be permanent, not temporary. 
They make the tax system more fair.  
As a first step, this measure was targeted to benefit low income Canadians. 
This year, we complete the job. 
These discussions have concluded in agreement. 
That family received $145 in tax relief from the 1998 budget.  
Low and modest income families will benefit the most. 
Finally, all 15 million Canadian taxpayers will receive tax reductions.  
The tax measures we have announced today are important and they are fair.  
But our action to reduce taxes will not end here.  
The finances of the nation were out of control. 
Our response was immediate. 
We eliminated the deficit. 
Then, last year, we began to get our debt burden down.  
Third, we lowered taxes. 
And in this budget, tax relief has been provided for each and every Canadian taxpayer.  
That is the summary of this budget.  
Government must focus on those areas where it can really make a difference. 
We can never lose sight of the need to take a balanced approach. 
For the social and economic needs of our country are not separate. 
They are not in conflict.  
He said that the 20th century would belong to Canada. 
They have said he was wrong.  
Well, Laurier was right. 
There is so much we must continue to build. 
There is so much that lies ahead to accomplish. 
The story of this century may be over. 
It is time to take on the world and win. 
Some may say that this is too ambitious. 
We say that there is no ambition that is too great for this country.  
Let there be one thing coming from what this government has done. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
After much tutoring from the opposition he has finally learned how to say tax relief.
