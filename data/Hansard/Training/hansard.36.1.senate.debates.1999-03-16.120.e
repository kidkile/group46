The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Employment Equity in the Public Service 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
In concrete terms, this means 91 out of 3,200 people. 
The situation is similar with regard to the House of Commons. 
We should not be lagging behind, especially to the extent that we are now.  
Our governing institutions should reflect the mosaic of Canada. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Privileges, Standing Rules and Orders

Review of Nuclear Weapons Policies 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Commitments Made by NATO on Kosovo- Government Position 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, do we know exactly to what we would be exposing these 800 troops? 
The situation over there is so volatile. 
We intend to live up to those commitments. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, this is an important question. 
I fear that we are making these commitments because we have always made commitments. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, perhaps we should have further discussions on this matter. 
Senator Bolduc has suggested the Minister of Foreign Affairs should appear. 
This matter will be taken under serious consideration.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. Leonard J. Gustafson :
Will he please convey the seriousness of this problem to the cabinet and the government?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
The matter is under very serious consideration.  
There is hope that the matter will be resolved soon. 
Honourable senators, the strike on the West Coast has come at a difficult time. 
The people in charge there seem to pick the most difficult times for farmers. 
I cannot emphasize enough the importance of taking this issue to the government.  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, this raises serious issues of public policy. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, not at all. 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Honourable senators, my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Can the minister enlighten us as to those changes? 
Which arrangements are being reviewed by the Government of Canada vis-a-vis Cuba?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, our basic policy of engagement with Cuba will not change. 
We intend to continue to do that.  
If it is not correct, which relationships are we reviewing?  
We have told the Cubans so in a frank way. 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
It is a review. 
It should not be pre-judged. 
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
Honourable senators, in regard to Cuba, the human rights denials have never ceased. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I am cognizant of the concerns expressed by the Honourable Senator St. Germain and others. 
That is good news.  
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
If such support is forthcoming, what steps are being taken to ensure his successful candidacy?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I am sure he is presently doing the same with respect to Mr. MacLaren.  
I would like to be assured that the government is taking this candidacy seriously.  
The Estimates, 1998-99 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Compensation Paid to Estates of Pilot Victims of Crashes-Government Position 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I would have to presume so, honourable senators. 
I believe that the minister acted correctly and promptly in this matter.  
Honourable senators, I share that sentiment.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable Senator Forrestall, the time period for Question Period has expired. 
I think it is important to other fliers. 
The minister is correct. 
Delayed Answer to Oral Question 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
CANADA'S MERCHANDISE TRADE 
Carriage By Air Act 
Bill to Amend-Third Reading 
I thank them for their diligence.  
This is a convention which is already widely in force. 
That, honourable senators, summarizes Bill S-23. 
Second, in accordance with established practice, the wording will be gender neutral. 
Fourth, references to the new Schedules IV and V are added, where appropriate.  
The longer we delay, the less competitive our carriers can be.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.  
Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act 
Bill to Amend-Second Reading 
Each of these transfer programs has its own distinct objective.  
At present, there are seven provinces receiving equalization payments.  
The formula is set out in federal legislation.  
Provinces that receive equalization are all raised to the same level. 
Last month's budget showed that payments will be higher this year. 
The last renewal exercise was no different. 
The bill before us today is the result of their work.  
Other priority areas received much attention due to the complexities of the issues. 
There remain, however, some areas where further analysis and discussions are required. 
I should now like to examine some of these changes. 
First, a few words about the sales tax base. 
The government is proposing to take all forms of games of chance into consideration. 
This change will make it possible to calculate equalization payments with greater accuracy.  
The third priority is user fees. 
In other words, it prevents them from becoming excessive because of changes in economic circumstances.  
This will give provincial governments more predictable protection.  
It is vital to our economic union.  
That was, and remains, the position of the Progressive Conservative Party. 
That means that if a province loses people, it loses money. 
Instead, it is making only minor changes. 
I understand that we will hear from the Minister of Finance in committee on Thursday. 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
First Nations Land Management Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
Canada's Aboriginal Action Plan." 
Some of these partnerships already exist. 
This type of cooperation provides mutual benefits to both jurisdictions. 
We hope to see more of these partnerships flourish under the new legislation.  
Bill C-49 also establishes new partnerships among the 14 First Nations. 
This is the road to self-reliance and the road to self-government, honourable senators.  
This brings me to Gathering Strength's third objective. 
The benefits will also spread to neighbouring communities, which will prosper from economic spinoffs.  
This bill will establish a win-win situation for all parties. 
This matter will be resolved by the signatory First Nations. 
An arbitration process has been set up to ensure that this delay will be respected. 
The rules and procedures cannot discriminate on the basis of sex.  
The framework agreement has been amended. 
The bill before us reflects those amendments. 
This legislation is about much more than land management, honourable senators. 
Hon. Noel Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Yes, that is correct.  
They are quite excited about this new opportunity for self-reliance and self-governance.  
Saint Mary's is within the Maliseet Nation. 
Questions have arisen, particularly around the rules of marriage breakdown. 
It is totally silent. 
I believe this proposed act will open up that discussion. 
They can tell us how they feel.  
This is a wonderful opportunity. 
On motion of Senator Kinsella, on behalf of Senator Ghitter, debate adjourned.  
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Honourable senators, I raise a point of order on this bill. 
They seem to be, on my reading, the same in substance.  
Turning to rule 63(1), it states: 
Rule 558(1) states: 
Decisions of the House 
Honourable senators, we know the rule is in existence in the Senate.  
Honourable senators will recall that this bill has an interesting history. 
It was introduced by Senator Lynch-Staunton. 
It seems to me, honourable senators, that this withdrawal is tantamount to a negative. 
I was about to propose amendments, as the honourable senator knew. 
Was this action in effect a negative decision? 
Honourable senators, let me explain. 
He knows that I will introduce amendments, which will not be much changed. 
Meanwhile, all that we have lost is public time. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
In this case, a question was not put. 
At least the house knew that it was to be reintroduced.  
There was no hidden motivation. 
Hon. Noel Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, Senator Grafstein raises an interesting point of order. 
I concur with that as a principle.  
I ask honourable senators to think for a moment of what is transpiring. 
When a matter is withdrawn, it is being removed from the decision-making process. 
Thus, no decision has been taken. 
I suggest that no final decision has been taken on the matter. 
There was no negation. 
Therefore, we were dealing precisely with the issue of withdrawal. 
However, I take the position that the bill is the same in substance.  
The spirit of the rule is as set out in Beauchesne: 
The plain and clear words of the rule provide: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Are there any other honourable senators who wish to speak to the point of order? 
If not, then I am prepared to rule.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
...has been resolved in the affirmative or negative...  
That has not happened, of course. 
What has happened is that the bill was withdrawn.  
I then consulted Erskine May, which states clearly: 
It was not proceeded with. 
I rule that the bill is in order.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
It does not do away with the traditional Royal Assent ceremony. 
As stated in the McGrath report: 
Note the word "abandoned."  
Granting assent on behalf of Lords Commissioners has been allowed since 1541. 
The bill respects tradition while acknowledging reality. 
It attracts little if any attention. 
It is not easy to arrange at a time convenient to all. 
The Senate itself can sometimes have many more empty seats than occupied ones. 
The Lords will soon be relieved of its hereditary peers. 
The Lord Chancellor has been relieved of his black tights and buckled shoes. 
There is even a suggestion that church and state become separate.  
On motion of Senator Grafstein, debate adjourned.  
Access to Information Act 
Bill to Amend-Third Reading 
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.  
Consideration of Interim Report of Special Committee-Debate Concluded 
I agree wholeheartedly - and who does not? 
We all know that this chamber has its critics. 
In fact, my idea was hardly new. 
I sincerely hope the government will act on it.  
The report has other valuable suggestions on road safety. 
The committee is determined to work towards that goal. 
Another special interest of mine and others is marine safety. 
In 1996 alone, five people died in jet-ski collisions. 
A person was literally cut in half by a jet-ski. 
I will not detail them all. 
Instead, I encourage you to read it carefully and to support its thoughtful suggestions.  
Honourable senators will also see that a good deal of fascinating work remains. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Statement of Minister of Finance-Inquiry-Debate Continued 
Hon. Therese Lavoie-Roux :
It is time he reviewed that, because this is no longer true. 
We should go back to some progress.  
To quote Health Minister Allan Rock: 
These questions remain unanswered, at least for the time being.  
Honourable senators, I have always preached improved health care for Canada. 
Every one of us has seen this for ourselves. 
Another area targeted by the budget is research. 
However, as stated in a recent article in The Toronto Star : 
What happens after two years? 
Honourable senators, this is not an imaginary concern. 
Just think of the suicide rate in this country. 
Just think of all the people we call "homeless."  
I am not criticizing the federal government any more than the provincial governments. 
We need a longer term vision.  
Education, a factor in inequality, was also hit by cuts. 
I would like to know how the government intends to fight these serious problems. 
And it must want to do so. 
Finally, honourable senators, I wish to comment briefly on the issue of unemployment. 
It is characterized by contradiction and risks that we must address as responsible parliamentarians. 
The minister proudly listed the positive aspects of these performances.  
This is what I intend to do now. 
I recommend that you read it.  
Honourable senators, the field of economic policy is very wide. 
Next, there are physical resources, which are natural resources and equipment. 
There is technology, including the condition under which it is developed, and industrial innovation. 
You will say that the minister has told us things are fine. 
There is no cause for celebration here. 
I have just made a reference to taxes. 
It is a move we have no choice but to make. 
On average, Americans work 200 hours more than we do in a year. 
This is not insignificant, it amounts to 10 per cent of the work time. 
We lose the benefit of their expertise and experience. 
One cannot create uncertainty without paying a price. 
This is also true for Canada. 
In that same issue, Ms Janigan made an accurate diagnosis of our problems.  
They are hardly motivated to become more efficient. 
Efforts must also be made to strengthen the social fabric rather than sow discord.  
These then are my sad observations on our growth lag. 
I have only given half of my speech. 
I will do so another time. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
We have fewer major companies than elsewhere. 
We are 30 million in number. 
We do not have a multitude of multinational companies. 
That is one of the reasons.  
The other is that we have a relatively limited industrial structure. 
In each of the sectors, there are two or three major firms. 
This is something we have become accustomed to.  
American companies use their technology when they open a subsidiary here. 
We benefit from technology transfer free of charge. 
It will not always be that way. 
That is the second reason.  
I understand that they have incentives. 
They are recent, in the last five or ten years. 
I am not sure this is a good arrangement. 
Therein lies the whole problem of our government laboratories. 
This is one of the major problems. 
Indicators of real demand fall down on technological developments. 
That is one of the major problems in Canada. 
All the major computer companies are grouped together. 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Honourable senators, first, I wish to commend Senator Bolduc for his excellent speech. 
He is raising questions that are bedevilling all of us. 
However, at the heart of the issue is the question of an efficient national economy.  
What does the honourable senator say about that?  
I will surprise you, honourable senators. 
I think that, for once, the federal government is not interventionist enough. 
It is too polite with the provinces. 
It is probably afraid of criticism from Quebec City, Toronto or elsewhere. 
The result is that the federal government is not taking enough action.  
I agree with respecting jurisdictions. 
In this case, the federal government should be more active. 
The government should go further.  
It is not easy to accept. 
On motion of Senator Carstairs, for Senator Graham, debate adjourned.  
Canada and the Nuclear Challenge 
Motion by the Honourable Senator Roche, seconded by the Honourable Senator Keon: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I am prepared to proceed with the ruling on this matter.  
As always, I find it helpful in highlighting this issue.  
Rule 46 stipulates that: 
In its fourth report presented in March of last year, the committee noted that: 
By the time the facts have been established, it is generally too late.  
Accordingly, the Modernisation Committee recommended, and I quote: 
That is the core of the process of debate.  
I rule, therefore, that the motion of Senator Roche can proceed.  
I do not wish to debate what was said in the other place. 
That is not my concern here.  
I served in the other place. 
I left it willingly and said goodbye to it. 
What I am concerned about is the principle that I brought forward.  
Hon. Fernand Robichaud (The Hon. the Acting Speaker) :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
Some things change; some things do not. 
Savoir vivre ensemble, together, will always be the great challenge for Canadians.  
We agree on that.  
This is what I will discuss today.  
The economic context may possibly have temporarily justified the reduction. 
However, I believe that these funds must come back to at least former levels.  
The design of the actual French immersion programs is developed by the individual provinces. 
It is a pittance, but at least a show of support.  
Students are thereby able to improve their grasp of the French language. 
However, the level of assistance is not sufficient to create a lasting impact. 
More ought to be done. 
There is also, obviously, room for additional expansion.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will you seek leave to continue your speech?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Thank you, honourable senators.  
These figures which I have just quoted are, in my opinion, truly impressive. 
Attitudes toward French immersion have been resoundingly favourable. 
On motion of Senator Kinsella, debate adjourned.  
Hon. Lois M. Wilson :
Margaret Atwood has said: 
The facts of this world seen clearly are seen through tears. 
Why tell me, then, there is something wrong with my eyes?  
Let me say a word about the concept of development. 
Let me say a word about population and health. 
At this rate, the earth's population will double every 40 years. 
We live and die together.  
It cost one rupee to have it removed. 
Who could criticize her? 
Food was her overriding concern. 
In particular, what role does Canada see itself playing?  
Is it the panacea it pretends to be? 
Margaret Mead spoke of literacy for all of us in these terms: 
This kind of literacy is a spiritual requirement of the highest order in our world.  
In the refugee camps, literacy circles were started. 
Those who had a year or two of education shared their knowledge with the rest. 
He told his companion that he had never seen such a herd. 
He took one last look at them, expressed his distaste and rode away in disgust. 
We hear them; however, many do not swallow them or digest them. 
We look to transform the situation. 
I invite you to do so. 
On motion of Senator Carstairs, for Senator Callbeck, debate adjourned.  
Energy, the Environment and Natural Resources 
Committee Authorized to Extend Date of Final Report 
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor , pursuant to notice of March 11, 1999, moved: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Senate adjourned until Wednesday, March 17, 1999, at 1:30 p.m.
