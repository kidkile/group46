Thank you, Greg, for your good services over the years.

This is the end of his second year in the Senate page program.

Notice of Motion to Authorize Committee to Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
Honourable senators, I give notice that, on Thursday, March 19, 1998, I will move: 
Multilateral Agreement on Investment 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
If he will not, why not?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
We did not do it.  
We are now in a position to create new jobs. 
Honourable senators, I acknowledge that more must be done. 
It is something which we must address.  
I was around when Medicare was introduced. 
This government is absolutely committed to quality health care. 
After lowering it from what?  
How much will there be for Nova Scotia? 
That is not what the Canadian Medical Association says.  
How much for Nova Scotia? 
One week before the election?  
I have one last supplementary question. 
I should like to have an answer to it, if I may.  
Let me point out - 
Not in Nova Scotia. 
Overall, major federal transfers have grown by $133 million. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Future of Cape Breton Development Corporation- Government Position 
I just wanted to mention that.  
You built them and they closed them down!  
Honourable senators, I do have questions about Cape Breton.  
Along with many others, I am very concerned about the future of Devco. 
I have some statistics here that are worrisome. 
The work force at Prince colliery now ranges from 400 to 500. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
You must look at his album more carefully.  
I was out by two. 
As the Leader of Opposition says, I should look at his album more closely.  
I recently met separately with management and members of the union. 
I listened very carefully to their concerns. 
I wish I could say that the geological problems at Phalen have been solved. 
Honourable senators, I thank Senator Graham for his answer. 
I have every confidence in Steve Farrell. 
He is a very good mining engineer. 
It was determined through that study that the Donkin mine was feasible. 
I agree with that goal.  
It should have been completed. 
There must be some reason that it has been held up.  
That was the purpose of the feasibility studies.  
A year has gone by. 
The life expectancy of Phalen has been substantially reduced. 
I understand those market studies have been completed. 
We understand that he is also looking for partners. 
The name SNC Lavelin has surfaced. 
Apparently there has been some indication of interest on the part of SNC Lavelin.  
That was last November.  
However, I will certainly endeavour to find some answers.  
We can look forward to that, I would presume, in a matter of weeks.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I have seven on my list. 
Honourable senators, I have one further question. 
There is an old saying - you do not carry coals to Newcastle. 
What is your answer to that, Mr. Minister?  
Delay in Appointment of Senator from Nova Scotia- Government Position 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Let me assure you that there are no shortages of applicants.  
He would be imminently qualified, as would many others.  
As well, there is a vacancy still to be filled in the province of Newfoundland.  
Certainly not to my knowledge.  
Hon. Eric Arthur Berntson :
Honourable senators, my question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
He is interested, of course, in the welfare of all good Nova Scotians.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, yes, I am aware of that unfortunate situation. 
I know also that the government is still considering the purchase of new submarines. 
I understand that that decision is under active consideration at the present time.  
Perhaps I was anticipating your supplementary.  
You were anticipating the question. 
In a perfect world, of course, there would be better planning. 
It is very regrettable that 100 dock workers face this hardship. 
I can only say that we will do the best we can. 
I will bring my honourable friend's representations to the attention of those most responsible.

Business of the Senate 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators, to proceed to Inquiry No. 18?  
Statement of Minister of Finance-Inquiry-Debate Adjourned 
Governments here account for 48 per cent of gross national product. 
For example, there is now talk about growth in Montreal. 
We are certainly proud and happy to see the unemployment rate go down a bit. 
In other words, "Social security first." 
No concrete measures were, in fact, proposed by Mr. Clinton.  
I am sorry to have to correct this impression. 
Third, a huge inequality has been created between generations. 
Let us get back to the recent budget. 
What is more, he said that the minister's priorities were in the right place. 
Frankly, I do not understand. 
What did the government announce in its budget this year in relation to this priority? 
There is no doubt that power changes people. 
He also looks for turns of phrase that sound like propaganda. 
If anything can be relied on, it is demographic forecasts. 
Yet the minister was off by $5 billion in 1997. 
He tells us that the debt will remain unchanged over the next three years. 
Obviously nobody can believe this. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted for Senator Bolduc to continue his speech, honourable senators?  
Thank you, honourable senators. 
So, it is fair to say that the middle class continues to pay dearly.  
As one person put it, this is a demagogic and provocative project. 
Another one said that the government was trying to solve the wrong problem. 
Take, for example, the medicare case. 
That is an important message.  
Those were good times indeed for Canadians.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable Senator Bolduc, I take it that you wish to table a document. 
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
On motion of Senator Stratton, debate adjourned.  
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration

Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :

Committee Authorized to Meet During Sitting of Senate 
Hon. Shirley Maheu , pursuant to notice of March 17, 1998, moved: 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
So far, it has been once a week, on Tuesday when the Senate rises. 
With the permission of honourable senators, we could meet tomorrow. 
I leave it in your hands.  
Honourable senators, we must bring this matter to a head. 
I see Senator Bacon disagreeing and shaking her head. 
Perhaps she is right. 
I want to be practical about this, but not doctrinaire. 
It is not a matter that we should take lightly. 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, perhaps I could add a few things. 
I agree completely with Senator Kinsella. 
However, I should like to point out two things which are relevant in this case. 
Unfortunately, there was not a sufficient number of senators in attendance. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
I find Senator Kinsella's point well taken. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, we waive the reading of the motion. 
I wish to understand the reason exactly.  
They met yesterday morning for an extended period of time. 
Honourable senators, I wish to move the adjournment of the debate.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators to adopt the motion?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I hear dissenting voices.  
Will those in favour of the motion please say "yea."  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those opposed to the motion please say "nay."  
The Hon. the Speaker :
In my opinion, the "nays" have it. 
The motion to adjourn the debate is defeated.  
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
