AMENDING LEGISLATION-SPEAKER'S RULING 
DRAFTING LEGISLATION-SPEAKER'S RULING 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Organized crime is big business and it is bad business. 
Organized crime is a global problem. 
Credit card fraud can run as high as $80 million annually. 
Our communities pay dearly to finance organized crime kingpins. 
Children are hooked by schoolyard pushers. 
That is what we have done. 
We renewed the resources for the anti-smuggling initiative.  
Just as important, we restored the sense of safety and security in affected border communities.  
We are not finished.  
Co-operation will be the hallmark of our effort.  
Ms. Reno and I believe this forum will pay great dividends in the future. 
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
This is no small town operation.  
Our families are at risk.  
Gang wars in Quebec are out of control. 
Edmonton is another city that is starting to feel similar pressures. 
The violence is absolutely unacceptable. 
Almost daily there are news stories directly related to gangs. 
They want solutions and, most important, they want solutions that are going to work.  
Today the solicitor general trumpeted the government's record. 
I do not think the government should be too proud today. 
The power to implement change was there to use. 
It is the government's administration and its responsibility. 
He was sentenced to five years in prison. 
But here is where the minister's happiness perhaps ends. 
The Kingston Whig Standard had similar words: 
Queen's law professor Don Stewart agrees with King. 
Bringing forward legislation should never be done just for short term political purposes. 
Is the law constitutionally sound? 
I also want to see laws that will withstand the supreme court challenges. 
Ministerial statements are fine, but ministerial action is preferred. 
The longer the government waits to act, the worse our streets will become.  
The solicitor general has made his statement. 
He is directly responsible for the administration of federal prisons. 
Since the second world war we have had many years of Liberal governments. 
There are broad sociological reasons for the success of organized crime. 
When tax policy kills the spirit, the sinister elements can more easily get a foothold. 
Capacity creates its own demand.  
Historically the Liberals have been very soft on crime. 
The most recent example was the DNA evidence collection bill. 
These are the broad societal reasons for the success of organized crime. 
If it could learn those lessons, then the courses of action would become evident.  
The annual statement may form a bit of an accountability measure.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
This shows how bad the situation is.  
One can also ask oneself the following question:
Is it stringent enough? 
The act also authorizes the seizure of goods that have been used by criminal organizations. 
Consider the cases where the police moves in to make a seizure. 
This is a legitimate question.  
So this is another weakness in the bill.  
This is an excellent initiative, but we have to go further than that. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
There is nothing new in the minister's statement. 
We can be sure that organized crime is just waiting to fill the void. 
It is putting our communities and citizens at risk. 
The minister talks about creating a seamless net against organized crime. 
It is clear that this net has some very large holes.  
Yet this minister and this government are doing the opposite. 
We encourage and support this government in its fight against organized crime. 
Yet there appears to be contradictions in its actions.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
I am nevertheless willing to extend credit where credit is due. 
The problem with this particular wording, I would suggest, is that it lacks specific intent. 
The port of Halifax was mentioned by the hon. member from the New Democratic Party.  
Again I would reiterate my earlier remarks. 
Laws are not the only answer. 
We have also heard about existing resources to fight crime. 
That is not just my opinion. 
It is the opinion of many local police officers across the country.  
Laws for the sake of laws mean nothing. 
They are just more paper''.  
In conclusion, I thank the solicitor general for his statement. 
I would reinforce my comments with four main points. 
Let us work to build upon it.  
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma-Manitoulin, Lib.):
We have to agree on getting started.  
CORRECTIONS AND CONDITIONAL RELEASE ACT 
CANADIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE SERVICE ACT 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, Question No. 24 will be answered today. 
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
The dpartment does not capture information solely for Cape Breton. 
Of those 223 cases, 179 decisions were issued. 
I ask, Madam Speaker, that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
CANADA PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
This is something which appears to be highly technical. 
That has actually been a pretty good part of the Canada pension plan. 
That is what the fund is used for.  
However, there will be a change. 
In a few years that investment fund will grow to over $136 billion. 
A board will be established. 
That board will have regulations, objectives and goals.  
There is a vision here that is more narrow. 
I think about jobs in Canada, creating more jobs. 
That is very important, investing in Canadian industry, in Canadian business. 
I noticed in the House yesterday that we were criticized. 
We are not talking about doctrinaire investment. 
It is a fund which was supported not only by the Bloc Quebecois. 
Then came Mr. Bourassa and the Liberal Party again.  
It will represent mainly the business community.  
Is that parliamentary democracy?  
They have been suggested by business groups before the committee. 
They have been suggested by trade union groups before the committee. 
They are reasonable amendments. 
They have fallen on deaf ears.  
We still have some time left. 
The parliamentary secretary is sitting across the way. 
This amendment is obviously not one where we have consensus. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
The member will also know that amendments are being proposed which the government is supporting.  
I want to make sure members understand a couple of the points the member raised. 
The disagreement in this regard has to do with the application of those funds. 
We cannot lose sight of the purpose of the investment board. 
We are talking about the Canada pension plan. 
The objectives have been ratified as a result of public consultation. 
The issue of where moneys could be invested did come up. 
He is quite correct in his reference to the minister. 
My comments will focus on two areas. 
Second, I will outline positive steps the government- 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Madam Speaker, in light of those comments I will reserve my comments to later.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Resuming debate on Group No. 3.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP) moved: 
Motion No. 9 reads as follows: 
I am joined in the House this morning by my friend from New Brunswick. 
Its credit rating has probably always been lower than the federal government's credit rating. 
It is a good thing, a positive thing. 
It was under the Liberal Prime Minister, Lester B. Pearson.  
Now that will disappear. 
Now every province will be on its own. 
That may not be a problem.  
It seems to be very bizarre that a so-called Liberal government would do this. 
That decision is out of our hands as parliamentarians. 
The bond rating companies had the province on the verge of bankruptcy. 
We are at the mercy of these New York bankers. 
They set the rates. 
What has happened in the last few years is that the province has recovered. 
That is exactly what is happening in this bill.  
It is the economy of the whole country that is supporting this credit rating.  
It is only fair that the federal government accept this amendment. 
Why is that happening?  
Brian Mulroney did not try to do this. 
Brian Mulroney did not try this when he was Prime Minister of this country. 
If he had, the Liberal Party would have been up in arms. 
The rat pack would have been up in arms in this House. 
People are getting cynical of this whole process. 
They get cynical when they see this kind of thing happening. 
Equality of opportunity is supposed to be a great principle of Liberalism in Canada. 
Why they are going to treat an Ontarian different from somebody from New Brunswick? 
Why they will treat a Manitoban different from someone in British Columbia?  
We are going to have the balkanization of this country in terms of lending rates. 
That is not just. 
That is not equality. 
That is not the kind of vision of a country I want to build.  
This will not be the case now in the rest of the country. 
That concerns me as a Canadian.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
There is a shortfall of $600 billion in the fund. 
I do not think that Canadians were looking for that.  
I do not believe the status quo would work. 
There are other vehicles to create employment in New Brunswick. 
I hope that Canadians can see exactly what is going on here.  
This is 1997, not 1966.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Madam Speaker, on a point of order.  
I wonder if the member would entertain a question. 
He is talking about this radical amendment. 
They suggested keeping this particular fund for the provinces. 
That is what is wrong with it.  
We are proposing to secure the CPP fund for future generations.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to be able to address this topic. 
We have never been in such bad shape as we are now. 
It was because of those governments.  
This is why our economy is in such a sorry state today. 
There is too much patronage, that is the problem.  
Liberal and Conservative members make me think of employment centres. 
This is why Canada is so far in the hole. 
This is why Atlantic Canada is always impoverished. 
Governments have never carried out their responsibilities in the Atlantic provinces. 
I am ashamed of the previous speaker.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
In short, there was no worthwhile diversification of the economy.  
Nowadays, the provinces can get fairly easy access to credit. 
I hope the bill before us will lead to such results. 
There is nothing of the sort in the government's plan of action right now. 
And I believe that today the provinces have other opportunities to borrow. 
There are various markets opened to them. 
So it did not help achieve what was being aimed at. 
It is of course very appropriate that assistance be provided to these groups.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
I think a distinction has to be made here.  
What we are talking about is preventing poorer and poorer senior citizens in this country. 
That is the concern that we have. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
All these major needs are prevalent in my region. 
We still have the remnants of the Hudson's Bay Company. 
They took the profits and left nothing. 
We do not even have major banks in some of these regions. 
However, if one has nothing to put in it then one is in trouble.  
Territorial governments have been borrowing from the provinces. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
They are in a great depression.  
I ask the permission of the House and the Chair to move a motion: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
There is no unanimous consent.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
We cannot ask the people of Canada to have their funds invested unwisely. 
That is what we are talking about.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
I am surprised at the comments coming from that member. 
It literally tore me apart. 
Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough Southwest, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
This money belongs to the people of Canada. 
They do not want it to be played with for political purposes.  
Why is the Canada pension plan in such a mess? 
The Canada pension plan represents a second national debt. 
We have to do everything we can to pay off that debt. 
It is a disgrace. 
This kind of philosophy has failed us miserably in the past. 
It is an investment for the future. 
This is not our money to play with. 
I wish we had unlimited money. 
Someone has to pay. 
The money belongs to the people. 
It is their retirement fund. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Without it the rationale for fuller funding disappears. 
They had other issues.  
I think it is important to emphasize like other pension funds. 
There is a transition period. 
It was part of the negotiation. 
Yet here we have a motion that continues to put forward the status quo. 
They talk about regional development. 
They talk about labour participating and different types of initiatives.  
Canadians have said unequivocally that they want the pension plan to survive. 
That is what we are doing. 
The NDP cannot have it both ways. 
It allows for a higher rate of return than is presently there. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to add a couple of points. 
He referred to it as a shortfall of some $600 billion. 
It is in the hands of Canadians, the premium payers of the CPP.  
Today's workers pay for the benefits of the then retirees.  
We have an aging society. 
It makes good sense. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
It must be remembered that governing means forecasting, anticipating. 
It means being able to see 10, 20 or even 100 years down the road. 
And he was successful.  
The Quebec pension plan investments are earning a distinctly higher return. 
The Minister of Finance would then be facing serious problems.  
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
The younger generations must also be able to benefit from a public pension plan.  
Quebec has never had a directive of this type. 
A wide consultation process will take place, possibly in early 1998. 
This is very unfortunate, because it is my party.  
I see that the hon. member just realized we were talking about his party.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
I want to respond very briefly to the comments of the Bloc member.  
The member said that there are problems with the fund. 
I wonder if that has ever occurred to those members. 
There will be more government mismanagement. 
They already have their greedy eyes on that money. 
More of that will not solve the problem.  
They should have a say in how it is done.  
The evidence is right here. 
We have been saying the same thing. 
That has to be a consideration.  
It is not their fault. 
It is the fault of the government that has mismanaged it. 
We have got to have a solution that will serve us for all time. 
What has been proposed here is not that solution.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The House will now proceed to the debate on the motions in Group No. 5.  
That Bill C-2 be amended by deleting Clause 58.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC) moved: 
We are deeply concerned about EI and CPP payroll taxes. 
If we want to create jobs, start by cutting payroll taxes. 
Put people back to work. 
Give them the opportunity to make our economy grow. 
It is not good news for the Canadian economy. 
Actually it may be good news for the Canadian economy, the underground economy that is. 
Thus amended, the French text of the subclause reads as follows: 
The answer is very simple. 
By their very nature, actuarial estimates are subject to error. 
So imagine what is like for Canadians who fall into both categories.  
Self-employed workers are hard hit by higher premium rates. 
They must shoulder the heavy burden of a combined premium. 
It is indeed of concern to Canadians generally, increasingly so. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
The amendment before us would not do that. 
This minister got the message from the NDP member here. 
They want something that will distribute wealth. 
They often work in sectors offering only seasonal work.  
Basically, this proposal sort of closes the circle. 
This is not a choice we want to make. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
They still have not learned their lesson. 
That is not what Canadians and the working people are asking for.  
I have, however, seen employers demanding this.  
This is why small businesses are closing.  
People working can pay their contributions. 
When they are not working, they cannot.  
We have not finished paying for what we is going on. 
I listen to what the people at home are saying. 
That is what my predecessor Doug Young said at home. 
In other words, we will have to improve our employment insurance system. 
I think that is what we must look at. 
The compensation plan only covers the difference between the two plans. 
It might save money.  
But that is not how it goes.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
The birth rate is dropping and life expectancy is increasing. 
Our pension system is losing ground and in need of changes. 
We want to put it on a rock solid footing. 
There are three components. 
Second, there is income based on work earnings:
Canada pension plan, or CPP, and Quebec pension plan, or QPP. 
Third, there is income paid by an employer or drawn from RRSPs.  
The Liberal government is proposing a program to improve the system. 
It represents, however, a large threat to the three components of the existing system.  
In addition, middle income seniors could lose up to $7,000 annually.  
No tax relief is planned by way of compensation. 
They discourage people from putting their money in RRSPs or in private pension plans. 
We think we have a better idea to improve our pension system. 
For the time being, we must limit ourselves to amending the government's legislation. 
We want to improve the administration of the Canada pension plan. 
We want to maintain it. 
The CPP must be saved. 
The employment insurance fund has a $13 billion surplus. 
These amendments seek to improve the bill so that it can meet these objectives. 
I urge members to support our amendments.  
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
I am surprised that such an amendment is being proposed today. 
I find this surprising, coming from the Conservatives. 
The employment insurance, of course, should be protected; I agree. 
It is because there are no jobs. 
Why is it that there are no jobs? 
Today, we are being told that pensions have to be protected. 
That is the real problem. 
Today, they are waking up and saying ``We have to wake up''. 
I have said this before and I will say it again, today. 
We are willing to take to the streets with them. 
I will be with these people because they want to work. 
These people have intestinal fortitude. 
Quite often, they are responsible for large families and have nothing. 
People want to work, but there are no jobs.  
They are trying to make amends. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, there are actually two amendments in this group. 
I would like to speak mostly to Motion No. 10 which was introduced by me. 
It would strike clause 58 of the act. 
I am sure that does not enlighten many people.  
In our view that is very unfair. 
It is taxation by stealth. 
That is with respect to the people who provide temporary services. 
So there is a wide range of Canadians employed in this area of temporary employment.  
The 1997 contribution rate was 5.85%. 
The case of the temporary help industry is just one example. 
There are other businesses affected very adversely but I will give this example. 
For some businesses this is a significant portion of their cashflow.  
That gives businesses adequate time to adjust.  
These businesses refer to the rate as punitive.  
There are others but time does not permit me to go into all of them.  
There is another consideration that I will bring before the House. 
This retroactive rate increase is going to be a real administrative cost. 
That invoice will then go to government clients. 
We really urge the government not to do this to people.  
It is not a fair thing to do. 
It is a real hardship. 
We hope that this amendment will pass.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
Madam Speaker, I support the amendment just brought forward. 
The member is absolutely right.  
What it does is eat away at government's capital in the sense of confidence.  
I do not think most Canadians can accept that. 
There is something wrong with that.  
Let us take a look at some past administrations. 
That is what this government reminds me of, that type of leadership. 
I think the present Prime Minister operates under that same formula. 
When they took office in 1993, that was a problem facing them as a government. 
It has not disappeared.  
Canadians were warning the government what would happen.  
Some of them were in this House. 
That is the tragedy in the whole equation. 
However, the present CPP pensioners deserve what they have. 
That is spelled with a b , $600 billion.  
Again, the government knew that this was coming. 
We are talking about a huge tax increase.  
What this is is a hidden tax. 
It is a silent killer of jobs.  
What is the government doing with that? 
The finance minister is using it to fudge the deficit numbers.  
We cannot be totally naive. 
I am going back to where I opened my remarks in this debate. 
It is like the old Mackenzie King philosophy:
Wait and the problem will take care of itself. 
It has not taken care of itself. 
The government has provided no leadership at all.  
I am going to get off the topic a little bit. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance on a point of order.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
They are in office to deal with these problems today. 
It has been completely blown out of proportion.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
I concur with much of what she said in her remarks.  
So it is a retroactive premium or assessment. 
Some would say it is a retroactive tax on both the employee and the employer. 
Doing this retroactively is something that I am very uncomfortable about. 
There seems to be something a bit unjust about it. 
In general I guess people have been notified that this is going to happen. 
I think that is unjust. 
I am happy that the amendment is before the House.  
The other problem will be on the employer's side. 
They are very, very labour intensive. 
Most of their costs are going to salaries, to labour.  
It might be wise for the government to consider not making this retroactive.  
That is going to cause needless hardship for Canadians across the country.  
It would indicate that parliamentarians do indeed listen to the people.  
It will be a hardship on Canadians. 
It is not progressive; it is regressive. 
It should have continued the indexation of the yearly basic exemption.  
It has moved from $400 to about $3,500. 
That has been a positive step in keeping this plan a bit more progressive. 
Now indexation will stop. 
It will be a bit more difficult for low income people in this country.  
I hope he does that. 
On the other side we have the employment insurance premiums. 
There was a bit of a reduction announced last Friday by the federal government. 
It was a small reduction. 
The government should keep both items as separate files. 
On the one hand the government should reduce EI premiums. 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
These two motions have one thing in common. 
It is not their fault if there is seasonal unemployment.  
We have to be careful with this because it can affect the program. 
I would like to come back to the Canada pension plan. 
A Quebec success story is often mentioned, the Caisse de depot et placement. 
There are people who cannot benefit from these.  
We have to be careful when we touch this. 
The people concerned form a very large part of the population. 
Very often, they are the less fortunate, the underprivileged in the system. 
The Conservative government was severely criticized for its lack of compassion for the unemployed. 
On debate, if I may, Mr. Speaker. 
I have one minute, so I would like to begin, Mr. Speaker. 
You have one minute. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Too many Canadians are being left behind. 
Working Canadians are falling further and further behind. 
Canadians have not experienced a real tax pay raise since the 1980s. 
A person's disposable income has actually fallen by almost 6 per cent since 1990. 
The tax burden on small business is unacceptable. 
We are now going to go to Statements by Members.  
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, protection of the environment begins in our communities. 
They charge $1.00 per bag.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Only one-third of federal departments have a strategy for dealing with the crisis.  
The auditor general has already lambasted the Liberals for their tardiness. 
Canadians are watching the Liberals fudge the year 2000 project.  
Ms. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
Such remarks are unacceptable. 
``We have been very happy allies so far''. 
``This honest, intelligent, determined and experienced leader that Quebec needs''.  
The hon. member for Manicouagan.  
Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
Canadians are asking what the government achieved.  
Somehow the Liberals managed to insult a proud army regiment based in Vancouver. 
They were suddenly set upon by three German tanks and about thirty infantrymen.  
Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):
I for one am delighted at Mr. Parizeau's frankness. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
We are far from the $850 million announced by the government.  
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
I feel personally insulted by Mr. Parizeau's remarks. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Politics aside, these people should be charged for such a vile act. 
Are we moving toward a culture of mass cowards? 
The Canadian flag is one of the most respected symbols of peace around the world.  
Is the government so weak that it will allow their assault on our heritage? 
Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard-La Prairie, Lib.):
He is the premier of all Quebeckers. 
In our democracy, he is my premier. 
I would had hoped that he would represent me.  
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
Only big corporations with the resources to bid will get the contracts.  
Why is the government changing the rules? 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
In order to promote national unity, it called for co-operative federalism with the provinces. 
In the same breath, that government implemented a series of programs coming under provincial jurisdiction.  
Flexible federalism means rigid status quo, it means going backwards. 
In Quebec, we want to go forward, we want real change. 
That is why we want sovereignty.  
THE LATE JUSTICE JOHN SOPINKA 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Stoney Creek, Lib.):
Truly he will missed.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the parties are in negotiations at this moment. 
We hope they will find a solution. 
The mediator is doing his work. 
He is asking for more time and we have given him more time.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we and Canadians have been waiting for mediation to work for months. 
This is the fourth strike at the post office in 10 years. 
These negotiations have been going on for over seven months. 
The strike is costing up to $2 million to this point.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
They are exercising the right that Parliament has given to them at this moment.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate that my hon. colleague has to continually talk about legislation. 
He is well aware that all this does is hurt the process. 
We have appointed a highly qualified mediator. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Its first recommendation was to compensate victims immediately. 
When will the Minister of Health announce that this compensation will be paid? 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We are most grateful to Justice Krever for his report. 
It will truly be an ongoing legacy to ensure the safety of Canadians.  
As far as claims by victims are concerned, I have already made my position clear. 
I would prefer to avoid a decade of litigation. 
I will be working with my provincial and territorial counterparts to find solutions.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Hepatitis C deserves better than this minister.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
That is the place to start. 
MINISTER OF INTERGOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
He said ``Listen very well to what the separatist leaders are saying. 
They are being very clear''.-That 
is what he said: ``They are being very clear. 
How can he say today that it was a fraud?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
They would vote very clearly, once again, for Canada.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Tonight, there is only one winner, and that is the people. 
The hon. member for Vancouver East has the floor.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the prime minister.  
It demonstrates the appalling record of the government on child poverty.  
Will the prime minister commit now to restoring these cuts?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, that is not acceptable. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
The right hon. prime minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
It will be lowered to $2.70.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Indeed that report is not news to me, nor to my department.  
Let us look at some of the chronology. 
The department responded immediately and commissioned a report. 
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Why will she not do that?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
We have to modernize social assistance. 
We have to make it proactive. 
MINISTER OF INTERGOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.  
Third, the Prime Minister challenged the Bloc to put the question clearly. 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, what a performance.  
Here is my supplementary. 
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the minister's focus is on a misunderstanding of Canadian Indian people. 
Have her officials so blindfolded her from seeing the real story- 
The hon. minister of Indian affairs.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
On that side of the House they refuse to accept aboriginal rights. 
Over here we are implementing the inherent right to self-government. 
On that side of the House they use tactics of divide and conquer. 
Over here we talk about partnership and building communities.  
Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):
The minister has been talking a lot about working together and partnerships. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
MINISTER OF INTERGOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
The hon. Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.  
Mr. Speaker, once again, it is a question of semantics. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
When is he telling the truth, before or after?  
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
Constituents of mine from the Hobbema reserve are also concerned. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
It is extremely important for us to understand that we need a new structural relationship. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I categorically deny this. 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, yesterday we accepted our share of the blame for what happened.  
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
I do however want to clarify- 
The hon. member for Athabasca.  
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
This Prime Minister even produced a white paper on assimilation. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
We identified the importance of helping to build a strong community.  
I would ask you to please keep your voices down.  
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the minister just identified the very problem. 
Talk, talk, talk and no action.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Our job is to encourage that and work together to strengthen it.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
I can assure the House that we have started already. 
We have doubled the amount of money available for regulation in Health Canada. 
We have established a blood safety council. 
We shall continue because safety is our bottom line.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
That will be our first priority.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the solicitor general.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member better check her facts.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Does this government want to be part of that kind of an agreement?  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Environment.  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her question. 
With this co-operation from the provinces and territories, Canada will play- 
The hon. member for Calgary Southwest.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
We resent those words.  
This member has been a foster mother to six aboriginal children.  
The hon. Minister of Indian Affairs.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is to the Minister of Finance.  
What is it going to cost the Canadian taxpayer? 
What is that commitment? 
Are we being taken to the cleaners by the minister? 
Are we going to be Martinized by this minister?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We will be meeting a number of the countries in Chile over the next week- 
The hon. member for Charlotte.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
The minister indicated he would act on it. 
There are 12,000 Canadians suffering. 
The hon. Minister of Health.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it was yesterday we received the report. 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
We will never support any appointment to the other House, no matter who it is. 
For this minister to ask that I think is out of order.  
The hon. minister of Indian affairs.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
My question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
What exactly is the federal government doing to improve the literacy of Canadians?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We are doing very well. 
We have the strongest literacy skills in the world. 
However, we need to do more. 
I thank her very much.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
There is really a campaign based on misinformation- 
That will bring to a conclusion question period.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I wish to make the following business statement. 
Perhaps we could get his attention. 
I know this is a wild rose day.  
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
My dear colleague, I myself did not hear the remarks. 
If the hon. member wishes to add anything, fine, otherwise we will let matters lie.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
The resolution read as follows: 
The hon. member has asked for unanimous consent to move a motion. 
Does he have unanimous consent to put the motion?  
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
I thank the hon. member for his withdrawal.  
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
CANADA PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
He has eight minutes remaining in his remarks.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Small business people are the real job creators in Canada. 
The tax burden for small business in Canada is higher than in most competing jurisdictions. 
Study after study around the world have shown that high taxes kill jobs. 
That is a Polaroid picture of Canada.  
It is a job creation tax. 
That is unheard of. 
This approach is without merit. 
Canadians do not need a multibillion dollar tax hike.  
This plan has merit and it makes sense. 
Small business is the engine of growth in the country. 
The House can and must make a difference.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
It is important for members to know the dimensions of the change.  
Currently an employee pays 2.925% on their insurable earnings. 
It is important to keep the dimensions of the change in focus. 
It was a change that was discussed. 
The intent of Motion No. 10 was to delete that requirement. 
It is a matter of a nominal change in 1997.  
This is not a surprise to business at all.  
That is not the case. 
How would that be handled? 
I think that is a very important question to understand. 
We have to deal with the deficit. 
It is the reason why we have low interest rates. 
It is because we have been getting our fiscal house in order.  
Members must remember that seniors do pay taxes. 
Their working careers were smaller than we have enjoyed today. 
In the real world there is a process of arbitrage and fairness and equity. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Since it is impossible to undo the past, the motion is in fact eternally flawed. 
I just want to talk for a second on the mechanism to collect. 
The second part of the motion deals with the steady state contribution rate. 
The principles require a constant contribution rate that can be sustained. 
This is a contribution of savings toward pension. 
They do not go into consolidated revenues; taxes go into consolidated revenues. 
We do not want that to happen. 
Let us be very clear. 
We have ensured that the concerns of Canadians have been reflected.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Small businesses have a lot of challenges right now. 
They are faced with the pending increase in interest rates. 
Small business people have always had challenges with respect to capital acquisition.  
This is a burden the government has put on them.  
I have some information which I would like to share. 
The Canada pension plan has been a very helpful program for small business. 
Seventy-five per cent.  
In essence small business has employed more people over the years. 
We are concerned about the rapid increase in CPP premiums. 
If they do, they just do not seem to stay in business very long. 
Saskatchewan registered the highest proportion of self-employed workers in 1996. 
Saskatchewan is the province I represent. 
Many farmers have incorporated and they are paying their own contributions. 
The increases and changes in CPP will affect women most in a very negative way.  
Most of the growth in self-employment between 1989 and 1996 was voluntary. 
They are of concern to us in the NDP. 
CANADA PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
This reform has three main components. 
This includes survivor and disability benefits. 
We thought we had seen everything, but this tops it all.  
The Reform Party members are against this retroactivity.  
I do not believe this is the case. 
Yes, I am in agreement with this reform. 
It imposes a surcharge on taxpayers, in that people will have to contribute more. 
It is like another tax. 
What Reform is telling us is that this is a tax increase. 
I find this very frustrating. 
I am not just thinking about myself. 
I think they should give thought to future generations when they establish policies. 
Policies on sustainable development as they are called.  
Unfortunately, you my son, will have to pay for your university education''. 
I do not understand. 
I am not into partisan politics. 
I am talking much more of a generational thing. 
This makes me very uncomfortable. 
This shift to the right will lead us nowhere. 
I do not want that kind of society. 
I want a fair system.  
I intend to keep Reform members on their toes. 
Mr. David Iftody (Provencher, Lib.):
Indeed, it is true that it will have an effect. 
This is an important contribution. 
Was it proper then? 
There have been no constructive proposals brought forward in this regard. 
This is the central feature. 
This is particularly so in Manitoba where we are enjoying record growth in our exports.  
I believe the amendment is wrong. 
Is the House ready for the question?  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP) moved 
That Bill C-2 be amended by deleting Clause 59.  
That Bill C-2, in Clause 61, be amended by 
(a) replacing line 3 on page 31 with the following: 
(b) deleting lines 8 and 9 on page 31.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC): 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP) moved 
That Bill C-2 be amended by deleting Clause 68.  
That Bill C-2 be amended by deleting Clause 69.  
That Bill C-2 be amended by deleting Clause 76.  
``year being generally constant.''  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Right now the only objective is to maximize the return for the contributor. 
That is a very laudable objective. 
The model would be la Caisse de depot et placement.  
Motion No. 11 would create some of the goals and objectives.  
Motion No. 13, is extremely important to members of the NDP. 
This is the one that would reindex the year's basic exemption. 
That indexation is now going to be eliminated.  
He spoke very eloquently on the previous motion which is very similar to this one. 
My motion will make this contribution progressive as well. 
Who could oppose that outside of the wealthy who come from Mississauga? 
And he is a Liberal.  
That is another motion I present to the House today.  
This reduction will affect women the most, especially low income women. 
That is very regressive. 
A message was delivered by the Usher of the Black Rod as follows: 
Accordingly the Speaker with the House went up to the Senate chamber.  
CANADA PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT BOARD ACT 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, before royal assent I was discussing Motion No. 16. 
Many people will experience a cutback to their benefits under the legislation. 
It will make accessibility to benefits more difficult. 
It is a step in the wrong direction.  
Disabled people are finding it more difficult to get benefits. 
This is happening at a time when we are experiencing economic recovery in the country. 
The so-called Liberal government is taking it out on the disabled.  
They are going after those who are most vulnerable in society. 
They are making accessibility to disability benefits more difficult.  
Motion No. 18 is also very interesting. 
It is a departure from the current Canada pension plan. 
I ask again if that is fair. 
I ask the hon. member for Abitibi if that is fair. 
That member is a free spirit. 
He should be rising in the House and saying that it is not fair.  
My motion would make it more progressive. 
It would be more progressive than the contribution rate for low income people. 
It would be lower. 
It would not be 9.9% but much lower than that.  
Turning to Motion No. 19, there is a cutback in benefits to women. 
I am not asking for too much. 
The economy is starting to turn around. 
Why penalize the disabled? 
Why cut back on survivors benefits? 
Once again it is an attack on women.  
My Motion No. 22 is self-explanatory. 
In a nutshell those are the motions I moved. 
There is also one Reform motion in this grouping.  
This group of amendments would restore progressivity to the Canada pension plan. 
The member for Abitibi may do that. 
He used to be a Conservative MP. 
Now he is a Liberal MP. 
It would be good for his constituents and good for Canada.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to correct the hon. member. 
This grouping contains a Conservative motion as well as his amendments.  
It reminds me of the George Orwell novel 1984 . 
How much do you think the $3,500 of today will be worth in 2017? 
Is this what we call creative taxation?  
I should say will have, again, more impact on these people. 
The Progressive Conservative Party strongly believes in equity. 
In fact, young people are severely affected by the reform of the pension plan. 
So much for intergenerational equity.  
The same goes for all low income earners.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
We believe this is a very good idea and a very good recommendation.  
We can help low income Canadians by lowering payroll taxes. 
No wonder Canadians think the government cannot add.  
It is up to each and every one of us to make sure this happens. 
Now it is our generation's turn to become nation builders. 
I urge all members of this House to consider this very seriously.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
On the contrary, she is saying that it is an unwarranted and unacceptable tax hike. 
We in the Bloc Quebecois feel the same way. 
But there is worse. 
We must not forget those to follow, subsequent generations. 
There must be no mistake about this. 
The Liberal and Conservative governments should have taken action much sooner. 
The Caisse is the pride of Quebeckers. 
But back to the amendments. 
Following this line of thought, Motion No. 13 is admittedly a bit special. 
The New Democratic Party and the Reform Party agree on something. 
They are also against it. 
They want to have their cake and eat it too. 
That is not possible. 
For us, it stands to reason that it should operate this way.  
We are against this amendment for the reasons outlined before. 
This would have the effect of not ensuring the long term viability of the plan.  
As for Motion No. 17, I do not have any comments. 
There is something I do not understand in all this. 
Equipment and facilities that generally cost more are required.  
It is the same thing in the case of people who have an incurable disease. 
So these are the main arguments. 
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
We are proposing to let it float, let it be indexed for inflation. 
We are very concerned about this. 
These are mostly part time workers, women and others, who would suffer. 
We want better benefits for our seniors. 
Our change proposes that the benefit formula in the calculation is altered. 
It reduces benefits for the disabled. 
Of the larger earnings base, contribution rates do not have to rise so quickly. 
We want to increase them. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
This is something that we would all like to see happen.  
The thought, the intention behind these amendments is something we would all agree with.  
When we purchase something, we must have money to do that. 
Are we willing to pay for them? 
The government is us. 
Here we have amendments saying ``We want more''. 
The question is how much can we afford? 
Six hundred billion dollars is a fair chunk of change. 
We have no money available to pay for the ones we have. 
They are kind of an interesting mix. 
Contributions are paid into a pension. 
They are invested and everyone benefits from that. 
That is a pension plan.  
That is an income redistribution program. 
It is a social program. 
It is not a pension plan. 
There is no pension plan in the world that operates in this way.  
That is exactly what the majority of the amendments are proposing.  
We should get on with that. 
Their sole purpose is to get a pension out.  
I think it is dishonest. 
I would certainly urge the government to get rid of taxation by stealth. 
We would like to increase benefits for everybody. 
To promise more would be irresponsible and totally unrealistic.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Madam Speaker, I would like to discuss Motion No. 11 put forward by the NDP. 
It would place a tax burden on Canadians that would be hard to take.  
As it stands the EI fund has a huge surplus. 
Certain decisions have to be made. 
The government wants young Canadians to foot the bill almost entirely. 
The NDP does not want anybody to foot the bill. 
We want to spread the bill as equally and as fairly as we can. 
I believe our amendments will do that.  
Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):
Contributors to both plans benefit from an exemption on the first portion. 
That means that the more you earn, the more you pay.  
The Bloc will vote against this motion. 
It makes no sense at all. 
I think even they do not understand. 
How can we understand this total mess? 
It makes no sense from beginning to end.  
I will not read through the motion. 
Motion No. 17 is the same as Motion No. 14. 
There were two associations with a total number of 3,000 members.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
Madam Speaker, I want to speak to Motions Nos. 13 and 14.  
We cannot operate in a vacuum when we are talking about the realities of finances. 
It would be fine if we could, but unfortunately we cannot. 
We need to make sure that the fund is stabilized. 
The stabilization of that fund is paramount.  
I talked about the government postponing the inevitable. 
At some point reality comes home and we have to deal with it.  
It would be insolvent. 
Basically the fund at this point is dead. 
In other words in two years the fund will be broke.  
What we are really talking about is pay in and pay out. 
It is on a day to day basis that the fund is sustaining itself now. 
The reality of having to deal with it is there.  
I would call it an astronomical increase in rates.  
There is an unfunded liability of $600 billion staring the government in the eye.  
The motion that is proposed by the NDP just will not work. 
We are looking at a 10 year exemption.  
They are just not getting it. 
I have the same type of cases back home. 
In other words the fund is money in and money out. 
The government is taking a very hard look at who qualifies for these benefits. 
Laying blame is not going to solve the problem. 
And I do not agree with the huge increase in premiums either. 
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
What is the government trying to do? 
Does this government have no shame?  
Resources would be much better spent by increasing benefits and the number of beneficiaries.  
Women will also be negatively affected by Bill C-2. 
It made the situation of women even more difficult.  
We must ensure that subclause 61(2) is deleted.  
Did anyone listen to them? 
I went through a number of problems Bill C-2 will cause. 
We could do well with more politicians like Mr. Parizeau today.  
I am pleased to have contributed to the review of this bill.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
He would have said that we need balance. 
We need to look at the sustainability of the Canada pension plan for the future. 
Children are poor because their parents are poor. 
We want to put more women into poverty? 
Our amendments are an attempt to address that fact, and it is a fact. 
It is a fact with this legislation. 
Where is the gender analysis? 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will spend some time discussing points that were raised. 
We have to do something. 
We have to make sure that the Canada pension plan is still there.  
It is important to put in context the amount that we are talking about. 
I am afraid this is not the case.  
There are a number of reasons for that. 
The same levels or kinds of deductions would not be available to an employee. 
Mr. Speaker, I find this unbelievable. 
It has always been the practice, Mr. Speaker- 
I am sure he would want to comply with the rules in that regard.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That is in fact the motion put forward by the NDP. 
I ask the question, does the NDP want to kill the CPP by neglect? 
Let us do nothing. 
Changes to the benefits that had to be made were in fact balanced. 
Again, it is also very important to make note of this. 
The new coverage rules are still more generous than the original rules of the plan.  
We have seen the progressivity of the plan. 
The new coverage rules are still more generous than the original rules of the plan.  
The NDP has continued to focus on the disability aspect of the plan. 
Persons with disabilities are not being singled out. 
The CPP has always had limits to restrict the stacking of benefits. 
I have one final motion to comment on in the time remaining. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
They do not try to improve and they do not try to compromise. 
They do not think about the ultimate consequences and ultimate responsibility. 
We in the Progressive Conservative Party believe that the CPP must be saved. 
Canadians deserve it and future generations of Canadian deserve it as well.  
We know that payroll taxes kill jobs. 
The Canada pension plan provides a survivor's benefit. 
Canadians want the Canada pension plan.  
However, they know that payroll taxes will continue to kill jobs.  
Reducing the premiums to $2.70 is only a drop in the bucket. 
We cannot eliminate what we do not like without any regard for the consequences.  
I think you know who they are, Mr. Speaker. 
In fact, we agree with both measures that it proposes. 
But let us remind everybody that this is not a change of heart.  
If that party were the government, the Canada pension plan would be over.  
I campaigned for 36 days during the election this past May. 
Mr. Speaker, you did as well. 
You were there talking about the different issues in the election. 
What are you going to do with it?  
We are going to save the Canada pension plan.  
That does not solve your problem.  
We are going to raise premiums as well, compensated with a reduction in EI premiums.  
What did he tell that committee? 
I shake my head about the answer. 
I have read Reform's platform, and guess what? 
This fresh start is in fact a false start.  
I also want to talk about this very issue in terms of how this party- 
Information must be open and available. 
Procedures must follow acceptable patterns. 
It has been around for a couple of years. 
People up and down this country have been able to look at it.  
I am sure many people would like to have input. 
However, we only have one hour. 
That is a change which needs to be made. 
Otherwise we are just wasting our time.  
Does that sound far fetched? 
Any Canadian who pays taxes already shops at this store. 
It is called the Government of Canada. 
Does that not make sense, Mr. Speaker? 
I see your excitement.  
They do not just want to send them the money.  
This is the essence of my people's tax form act. 
Completion of the people's tax form would be voluntary. 
The analysis would be tabled in both the House of Commons and the Senate.  
He suggested we add a sheet to this form that gives people that control. 
Does that surprise you, Mr. Speaker? 
How about funding for special interest groups? 
Gun registration just did not fly. 
Foreign aid was not a priority. 
Multiculturalism was opposed by over 80%.  
Maybe I should not have mentioned those results. 
Is that not unfortunate?  
My colleague's reaction was very similar to Professor Palda's. 
I come back to my introduction. 
We live in a democracy. 
Special interest groups could no longer ignore public opinion.  
All of a sudden the excitement is dying down, Mr. Speaker. 
What is going on?  
This is the truth, though. 
Somehow the Liberal government does not seem to be getting the message. 
Everybody seems to be disappearing out of here now. 
They just do not want to hear this. 
We ought to listen to them.  
It would foster debate across Canada. 
It would decrease public cynicism.  
Third, it may even help unity problems. 
They would again feel like they belonged. 
It would be a small step in the right direction.  
Fourth, Canadians would find citizenship much more meaningful. 
They would be willing to accept more responsibilities.  
I have listened to some of the objections from people in Parliament. 
That is not so. 
The people out there know.  
There is an objection that this initiative may cost too much money. 
It would actually save money. 
That is the truth.  
Is there unanimous consent?  
There is not consent. 
There was not unanimous consent. 
Resuming debate, the hon. Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That is direct democracy.  
We take each and every response into consideration in the formulation of policy. 
As such I really cannot support this motion.  
The government wants to hear from ordinary Canadians.  
The finance committee took that information into consideration. 
It was a very passionate presentation indeed.  
The member makes a statement that it is useful information. 
We do not require this duplication of effort. 
We do not require the additional bureaucracy. 
Quite frankly, I am astonished that the Reform Party is putting this forward.  
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
Let us take a look at the title of Bill C-214: 
The title is a long sentence which could summarize our whole democratic system. 
``An act to allow taxpayers to inform government of their views''. 
The intentions of Bloc Quebecois members are clear. 
We want to give back to Quebec the taxes paid by Quebeckers. 
For the Reform members, that consultation was not adequate. 
Who will determine the priorities? 
They really have difficulty understanding how collective agreements are negotiated. 
Here again, we recognize the philosophy of the Reform Party.  
This kind of consultation would certainly help the sovereignist cause.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
At first glance the bill seems to be quite interesting. 
It even sounds great. 
This will in some cases be seen as an unnecessary piece of mail. 
He found a part time job. 
Then he found another part time job to supplement his income. 
He has a couple of kids. 
They are all juggling work and family responsibilities to try to make ends meet. 
They are barely surviving. 
You have to pay some of the taxes''.  
The current pre-budget consultations are relevant to this debate. 
We had round table discussions. 
The Minister of Finance went across the country and held discussions. 
Some people had a chance to participate. 
I have a few other suggestions. 
Many people have made other suggestions. 
The list goes on. 
It is not an appropriate mechanism for dealing with those kinds of concerns. 
We have to do that by improving our methods of accountability. 
We need the opportunity to convey those sentiments in the Chamber.  
There are many more ways to address the concerns of people.  
This is the greatest service we could provide to Canadians.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
What they are saying is no accountability and democratic input. 
Canadians want to have input into the governance of their country. 
It is that desire that has put Reformers in this House. 
This is the message we will continue to promote.  
This bill furthers this vision. 
This bill provides an effective vehicle for government to better serve the people. 
There is no consent.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
That is the way it has been. 
We can have this ready in April. 
We can have a form filled out and it would come through. 
It would not have to be touched. 
It would be automatically recorded and there the government would have the party's opinion''.  
I'm not a smoker.  
That is what makes the difference.  
We should support the bill. 
We should discuss it further. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
The last thing that the Liberal government wants is less public apathy. 
The more apathy the better. 
So what pray tell is the point of his argument?  
(The House adjourned at 7.14 p.m.)
