Thursday, December 11, 1997 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
BOARD OF INTERNAL ECONOMY 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
The meeting and visit took place between November 8 and 16, 1997. 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
HUMAN RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT AND THE STATUS OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES 
Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
SUBCOMMITTEE ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE, TRADE DISPUTES AND INVESTMENT 
Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk-Brant, Lib.):
Our committee endeavoured to do this. 
Our committee was informed about the advantages and the disadvantages of an MAI. 
We were presented with a wide range of views, as members can imagine, on these.  
Mr. Speaker, this bill essentially is quite simple. 
This is common practice in many provinces.  
VICTIMS BILL OF RIGHTS 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Is there unanimous consent to present this motion?  
There is not unanimous consent.  
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House to propose the motion?  
There is not unanimous consent.  
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Mr. Speaker, on a point of order.  
That does not sound like a point of order to me. 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
The member is stating what I think I just stated. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Is there unanimous consent?  
There is not unanimous consent.  
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Mr. Speaker, on a point of order.  
The Chair is having trouble. 
There is no point of order here. 
This motion did not get precedence over any other. 
In both of these cases, one member only did object.  
I do not think the hon. member is raising a legitimate point of order. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I present two petitions today. 
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
They are eagerly awaiting a decision on the pay equity dispute. 
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
It is a pleasure to support this petition.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
RIGHTS OF THE CHILD 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I move that all questions be allowed to stand.  
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
The House resumed from December 10 consideration of the motion.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
That is really what a prebudget debate is. 
At an absolute minimum unemployment should be reduced by 1%. 
We must develop specific strategies to attain that objective.  
That is exactly what this government has done over the last four years. 
It has focused on the wrong problem.  
It is focused exclusively on inflation, failing to set targets for jobs. 
It is what he does with inflation. 
It is what he proposes now to do with the debt.  
That would be a tragedy.  
Canadians need to consider this question. 
The Liberals have been positioning themselves as a party of balance on economic issues. 
The GDP is climbing. 
This is something the federal finance minister constantly crows about, constantly congratulates himself about. 
That is not something about which the government should be congratulating itself.  
The number of Canadians filing for personal bankruptcy has gone through the roof. 
We have been losing ground in that regard.  
Let me be very clear about what the NDP priorities are for the coming year. 
We will be pushing for those priorities to be expressed in the forthcoming federal budget.  
In 1989 the country set for itself a millennium project. 
That requires easing up a little bit on the inflation target band.  
These are the measures that NDP members will be advancing. 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I wish to seek unanimous consent to put the following motion without debate. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Frankly my head somehow was boiling and spinning at the same time. 
She thought that the government should have a full employment policy.  
For example, here in Canada we had a deficit. 
I want to congratulate the government for winning the war on the deficit. 
It is such a ridiculous question. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
The real issue here is family poverty. 
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Over the next two or three months there will be much debate. 
As history sometimes ends up repeating itself, everyone will go down with the sinking ship. 
This government does not understand that high taxes kill jobs. 
They have been taxed, taxed and overtaxed. 
This means cutting taxes. 
Canadians shared their frustrations and proposed solutions. 
This government did not listen. 
The suggestion is clear. 
This government is not serious about creating the environment to reduce employment. 
This government did not listen. 
The report from the finance committee does not represent Canada's interests. 
It is merely a supporting document of the Minister of Finance.  
Canadians are being held hostage by Liberal Party politics. 
It is a sad but true fact. 
In Jeff Rubin's 1997 Monthly Indicator named the ``The Federal Fiscal Dividend:
Who gets to spend it?'', 
The CFIB said it and we have said it too. 
We support these initiatives for the good of Canadian small business. 
It is time for this to stop. 
Working Canadians deserve to have their hard earned money back. 
The CFIB calls for a refund to Canadians and so do we. 
This is an achievable objective. 
It is time Canadians had a say in their economic future. 
We are going to fight to give Canadians that freedom.  
Why can the federal government not do this?  
The U.S. unemployment rate is the lowest it has been for 50 years. 
This is not luck. 
Yet again we witness a responsive, knee-jerk reaction to a critical upcoming opportunity. 
Canadians have caught on. 
No longer will we stand by and let unfairness happen. 
We demand that the government act responsibly with our money. 
They have earned the right to spend their own money.  
Any tax increase is wrong. 
Taxes must be cut. 
Again and again we hear the cry from working families and small businesses. 
In Ontario, our provincial government has kept its promise. 
Clearly there is a lesson to be learned here: high taxes cost jobs.  
The suffering has gone on long enough. 
We are not willing to sit idle on this. 
That is what it is all about. 
Canadians want to work. 
Young people want to put their skills and education to use. 
Let's get one thing straight. 
In my opinion, this is totally unethical. 
This practice must stop. 
We must stop the government from continuing to treat this fund as a cash cow. 
Recently we privatized the CPP fund. 
Why not consider creating a separate fund for employee pension fund moneys?  
The government's much vaunted program review exercise lost its effectiveness. 
There are risks that can derail this government from achieving a surplus. 
These are the items that demand immediate attention. 
Ignorance of these issues will only set our economy back further.  
This government must stop acting paternalistically. 
Canadians have earned the right to choose. 
The Progressive Conservative Party comes at this debate differently. 
Our view is simple and effective. 
Lower taxes means lower government spending. 
Informed, autonomous, independent Canadians foster a responsible society. 
We know what we would do.  
It also flies directly in the face of public opinion.  
Taxation levels in Canada remain too high. 
They depress investment that creates jobs. 
They force investment elsewhere. 
The role of government must change. 
What things should the federal government not be doing any longer? 
What things should the federal government be doing completely differently? 
What things should the federal government be doing that it is not doing now? 
The severity of these issues will not go away. 
The government has not proven itself in its pre-budget document. 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
I had the experience, which the member did not, of sitting through five Conservative budgets. 
On the other hand I have sat through four Liberal budgets. 
I heard the member talk about employment insurance premiums. 
He talked about reducing taxes. 
Tax revenues increased substantially over the last four years. 
That is why we are seeing the growth we are seeing now. 
It has nothing to do necessarily with some of the cuts that have been made. 
That is a novel idea. 
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I was not part of what happened then. 
The culture quite frankly was not there. 
It was characteristic of a lot of the governments around the world.  
It has been the greatest bonanza or dividend the country has ever received.  
Our future will be in free trade. 
Whatever happened in the past will never happen again. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
I have a strong faith in the common sense of the common people. 
I have consulted with my constituents. 
I do not buy the whole argument that it was the mentality of the times. 
We have a responsibility and we should not abrogate that responsibility.  
Between 1984 and 1993 the debt was multiplied by two. 
We inherited high interest rates and the debt. 
We also inherited budgets that were being constructed that were not even covering the programs.  
Shortly into the programs the cuts were made. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
I was one of those members.  
I have commented at some length on this before.  
I will run very quickly through these suggestions. 
I will make three points.  
I would like to see that change.  
This is a tremendous problem because these organizations have no accountability to the community. 
Revenue Canada does not even keep track of their financial statistics.  
There could possibly be only two members of a non-profit organization.  
Non-profit organizations do not have to send financial statements to Revenue Canada. 
It is not a matter of auditing every organization. 
Those are my three suggestions. 
It is an enormous sector. 
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
It is much more stringent, more elaborate and less ambiguous.  
This major abuse was covered in the last budget.  
Revenue Canada took very positive steps.  
There is a limit to what can be done by regulation. 
People cannot be sent to jail. 
They cannot be penalized because there is no law to that effect. 
People have used some charities to produce their own perks. 
This is a major abuse and it is often done by the affluent. 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Health care is a major concern of my constituents. 
They see the stress on the health care system. 
I encourage the government to proceed with both those initiatives.  
I would like to talk about that for a few minutes.  
We have numerous programs in government. 
Let me talk a little about youth as well. 
I talked about poor children. 
I also urge him to look at tax bracket creep. 
Again this is an issue of equity. 
I want to speak about the high technology sector. 
This sector is also extremely important to the economic growth of the entire country.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
These individuals earn $10 to $12 an hour. 
The only jobs available to them pay that wage. 
I am not too sure what the other family did.  
It is happening all across the land. 
These young people are struggling.  
In one case they cannot even afford a car. 
They are using bicycles. 
There is just too much they cannot do. 
That is at $10 to $12 an hour jobs. 
That is not what I am talking about.  
The member has touched on things which I touched on my speech. 
That is extremely important. 
Our child tax credit program is extremely important. 
I believe it does.  
I hope I addressed some of those issues in my speech. 
Many of the things our government is doing will help that. 
There is more to be done as well.  
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for Calgary Southeast.  
We hold town hall meetings. 
We publish weekly editorials in the newspapers. 
We ask for feedback. 
We get that feedback.  
They want balanced books. 
I will give a specific example to the House and Canadians.  
Kevin Machell three months later is still on the loose in this country. 
Maybe he is not in this country any longer. 
We do not know but he is still on the loose. 
Those two preschool children will be spending their Christmas under police protection.  
It is horrendous that this could happen. 
The problem is not the $26.4 million. 
It is to protect law-abiding citizens in this country. 
We spend some $4 billion on the department of Indian affairs. 
With that money the government is responsible for certain objectives and responsibilities. 
They were told to move out just before Christmas. 
They are low income families. 
What has this government done to change that? 
It has done nothing, not a thing. 
I am not saying that the federal Liberals are stupid or bad people. 
I was in the military and they are good people. 
They do the best with what they have. 
Just a couple of weeks ago we saw another example. 
It is outrageous that he was not given a helmet. 
He now has brain damage. 
That is inexcusable by this government. 
Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I sit here perplexed. 
It is really confusing when we hear those kinds of things.  
My colleague used some examples. 
I would like to give another example about spending priorities. 
I want to ask the member a simple question. 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the question. 
I think it is an important one about misguided funds. 
That is what we should do. 
That is what the Canadian public is clearly telling us as legislators to do.  
'' It favours Kevin Machell over the Gronos. 
Now, that is wrong. 
It is just plain wrong.  
It does not make sense.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
I appeared before it in my former capacity as a taxpayer advocate. 
These people are all well intentioned, as are all members of the legislature.  
Bernice arrives at work before 6 a.m. 
She does not have a car. 
She gets there on public transport, arrives and opens up her shop. 
By 7 a.m. she is working away. 
I asked Bernice one day how their business was going. 
They bought it the year before. 
I don't think she had really thought about that before. 
There is a reason it does not have the disposable income. 
This is the human impact. 
People like Bernice are working well into the night. 
I ask the members opposite one basic philosophical question. 
I used to be a Liberal. 
Liberals love to pride themselves on their sense of compassion.  
That is what they take money away from Bernice Lee to do.  
That is what this debate is about.  
That is ultimately what this debate is about.  
It is about who the money belongs to. 
Does it belong to the government? 
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I do not know what planet my colleague is living on. 
We came out of a devastating recession. 
We came out of a situation that was beyond control.  
These are the people who can make it on their own.  
That dividend is a result of what the government has done. 
Mrs. Lee, her husband and her children fall under those special interest groups. 
They call organizations for the disabled special interest groups. 
Would he stand up and congratulate the government right now? 
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
Reform members talked about their desire to consult their constituents. 
We had a very good and open discussion. 
Almost 70 people attended. 
I was very happy to participate.  
I have one slight criticism of the finance committee report. 
The finance committee has recommended that the limit be increased.  
This is very important. 
I object to this.  
RRSPs are used as a tax deduction. 
There are no laws in Canada against foreign investments. 
People are free to do that if that is their choice. 
That is one small point on which I differ. 
I believe it would be improper and unwise to proceed in that direction.  
A lot of the debate on budgetary items concerns expenditures. 
The Reform Party and others talk about government spending, spending, spending. 
We should all know the difference between investing and spending. 
When we invest in something, we expect a return. 
In other words, that money did not disappear. 
It will come back to us in the form of a return on our investment.  
One of those very important areas is science and technology. 
There is something like three jobs for every one of its graduates. 
We need to invest more in the science field.  
Recently the Conference Board of Canada published a very excellent report about the Canadian economy. 
It found some very remarkable things. 
It is a program I am very proud of. 
Bombardier was a recipient of the technology partnerships program. 
For instance as Bombardier sells more Dash-7 aeroplanes, money comes back into the government.  
This is a very interesting company. 
It makes the paint for the Challenger aircraft. 
It is very much related to aerospace.  
That generates all kinds of multipliers in our economy.  
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I have a question for my hon. colleague. 
He seems to be looking for funding for research and development. 
It is very difficult to predict what their quarterly payments would be. 
There are more interesting areas of the administration. 
I think the member was talking to some extent about the auditor general's report. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Sometimes we forget about taking it to the nth degree. 
It is about creating jobs. 
It is about creating opportunities for small and medium size businesses. 
It is also about helping our environment. 
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):
The national debt of more than $600 billion hangs like a millstone around our necks. 
It takes 35 of every tax dollar collected just to pay the interest.  
It is clear that we need to make certain strategic investments. 
These investments strengthen Canadian society for today and tomorrow.  
We ignore it at our peril. 
The fiscal dividend cannot be used to benefit this generation alone. 
This can assist Canada and the global community in reaching their goals. 
Canada is already a leader in environmental technologies. 
As well, we need to reward research and development in new agricultural products. 
I would also like to discuss briefly the excise tax on jewellery. 
Before I conclude I would like to refer to cost recovery in the agricultural sector. 
I congratulate the committee for studying the issue during its deliberations.  
The average citizen on the street did not have a choice.  
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not think Canadian people should be fooled on this point. 
That same son of mine has a family. 
Could my hon. colleague give them some hope?  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his comments and his question.  
Successive governments, Liberal and Progressive Conservative, built up the debt. 
That is quite true. 
However we elected those governments. 
Perhaps there is a lesson there. 
The people of Canada will do that, as we have been doing it.  
We are still considered the best country in the world in which to live. 
People are still clamouring to come here. 
We must be doing something right. 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
But that was the extent of the surprise. 
We want the Minister of Finance to pass seven specific measures. 
Fourth, the federal government must restore indexing in the tax tables. 
No indexing is essentially a hidden increase in personal income tax.  
Seventh, the Minister of Finance must re-establish funding for international assistance. 
Yet, these respective areas of jurisdiction are clearly specified in the Constitution. 
We said it throughout the last Parliament, and we are repeating it again. 
We are asking the government to comply with the Constitution of 1867.  
Quebeckers and Canadians are being taxed to death. 
Then it withdraws funding. 
They are just returning our taxes to us. 
The people are hungry, the people want to see a lessening of their tax burden.  
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
The hon. member knows he should not be using props in the House. 
I hope he will follow Standing Orders in this regard.  
It is not indecent, but it is not permitted.  
I could not have guessed.  
In her remarks, the member mentioned that her party had presented a dissenting opinion. 
She quoted a number of sections of the dissenting report.  
Which face is the real one? 
Which is the real intent? 
Remember Mr. Duplessis, who used to tell the federal government ``give us back our loot''. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Among other things, I will quote some of the people who participated in the debate. 
True, the Canadian federal system is rather pitiful. 
This week, the Bloc Quebecois made a very constructive proposal. 
We were even so lucky as to have the support of the NDP. 
I think this must be applauded. 
There is, however, still room for improvement in the employment insurance plan.  
We want to see that corrected.  
Budget choices will have to be made. 
So, many social stakeholders did not make extravagant demands. 
They want the money to go towards existing programs. 
Yesterday again, this was brought home to us in caucus. 
People are not stupid. 
They have seen what has been going on for the last 25 or 30 years. 
I will conclude on this. 
This is one of the fundamental reasons we want to leave this madhouse. 
In conclusion, we should listen to what the public is saying. 
The hon. member for Etobicoke-Lakeshore on a point of order.  
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am asking for unanimous consent for a motion. 
There is no unanimous consent.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
The question is whether there is consent now. 
The member asked for that consent. 
There was no consent. 
There is no consent.  
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Thank you Mr. Speaker. 
It is never too late to do the right thing.  
One can fake it only so far. 
What is real power? 
Let us see the facts in two columns.  
You should talk, with your five members in Quebec. 
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
We reached 49.4% last time, and we are carrying on the democratic battle. 
They have 5 members in Quebec, while the Bloc Quebecois has 44. 
That is the quantifiable and official result.  
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):
This dialogue and this optimism carried throughout the provinces.  
These are the parameters within which we held our debate. 
Children deserve to have every and equal opportunity to succeed in Canada.  
Four years of responsible government have produced positive results. 
As we all know the numbers, more than 1,012,000 have been created. 
We have that recommendation on the surtax. 
I want to thank them for that. 
The results of the work of this committee speak for themselves. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
In 1993 there were 1.5 million people unemployed. 
In 1997 approximately 1.3 million people are unemployed. 
It sounds like we have had a net increase of about 200,000. 
Mr. Speaker, I am not sure I understood the member's question. 
Perhaps it was my interpretation of the math. 
Then he suggested that was an increase. 
Could he clarify that point.  
That means 200,000 jobs have been filled. 
Therefore it has come down from 1.5 million to 1.3 million.  
Mr. Speaker, I am glad the member clarified that point. 
Earlier he implied there was an increase in unemployment instead of a decrease. 
The numbers speak for themselves. 
In Burlington the unemployment rate is somewhere around 7% or better. 
There are opportunities at home and abroad. 
These missions have demonstrated that Canadians can compete and will continue to do that.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Their recommendation is for a gradual increase, when needs are acute.  
The time allotted for questions and comments has almost expired. 
The member for Burlington.  
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's comments.  
There was definitely a call for increased spending on research. 
Canada needs to do more to focus on that innovative economy. 
I firmly believe in that. 
Many people in my riding are dependent on that research. 
They are fulfilling the research requirements of the nation. 
They are encouraging the country to do more.  
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
It heard 514 witnesses and received 463 briefs on this subject.  
We heard many things from Vancouver to St. John's. 
Some strong themes came through. 
``Keeping the Balance'' is a reflection of what we heard. 
Some see the discussion as a financial debate only, but it is not. 
It is also a debate about values.  
I would like to review a few of these issues. 
Time and time again, some of these themes rose throughout our process.  
Our treasured health care system was created because there was a need. 
This type of partnership approach could apply to other organizations and initiatives as well.  
In communities across Canada, people are concerned about our youth. 
Their priority lay in stabilizing our economy. 
This is one recommendation on which the finance minister has already acted.  
The result will mean that our society will gain both economically and socially.  
In conclusion, I have only grazed the surface of the results of the consultations. 
There is a widespread sense of relief that the deficit has been wrestled down. 
I feel strongly about partnerships. 
We will now proceed to Statements by Members.  
Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, Lib.):
My riding of Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington is a rural riding. 
In the countryside where people live in greater isolation, holidays often become community events.  
In my small village of Camden East, we constructed a creche near the river. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
The government's claims of savings are greatly exaggerated. 
It is a mystery. 
TRIBUTE TO FATHER GERALD MAUZEROLL 
Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau, Lib.):
Our congratulations and best wishes to Gerald Mauzeroll.  
PATRIOTS OF SAINT-EUSTACHE 
Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not believe everything I read in the newspaper. 
My constituents in the riding of Thornhill will be delighted if this report is true. 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
People are afraid of trucks. 
Quebeckers are the only ones who should make this decision.  
'TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
'Twas the night before Christmas and all of Sundre was sleeping, 
Safe in the knowledge Reform's watch I was keeping.  
Me and my stetson and Art in the night, 
Prepared our Sea King for a long winter's flight.  
We tightened the rotors and filled it with gas, 
Praying we will make it to see Preston at last.  
The copter it shook and landed with a splatter, 
On 24 Sussex, hey Art, grab the ladder.  
We ran from the copter to the back of the house, 
Past the guards and the sensors, quiet as a mouse.  
The PM appeared, mad as a hatter, 
Sculptures in hand, poised like a batter.  
Myron and Art, he cried with delight, 
Come in, come in, come in from the night.  
Of course you know Herb and Sheila and Paul, 
We're writing a new red book, it's due out next fall.  
Our ideas are vague, disjointed and few, 
Will you call Preston, he'll know what to do.  
Do you think this is Christmas, Art said with a smile, 
While off in the corner, I started to dial.  
Just as he signed Paul started to shout, 
How much will this cost, our books are in doubt.  
Our country's at stake, Reform is the answer 
If you don't like our beef, try eating Prancer.  
Mr. Carmen Provenzano (Sault Ste. Marie, Lib.):
VIOLENCE AGAINST ABORIGINAL WOMEN 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, violence in Canada's aboriginal communities is omnipresent. 
The federal government must take immediate action in this area.  
TRIBUTE TO SOEUR LORETTE GALLANT 
Ms. Claudette Bradshaw (Moncton, Lib.):
Soeur Lorette started this choir in 1957 at Beausejour school.  
Over the years, the choir became more community based. 
Soeur Lorette is a remarkable person who dedicated herself to children in her community. 
We are all very grateful to her for this. 
She is our idol.  
'TWAS THE NIGHT AFTER KYOTO 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
'Twas the night after Kyoto, and all through the land 
Not a person could tell where the Liberals stand 
While the stockings are hung by the chimney with care 
The Liberals claim that chimneys shouldn't be there 
They say we should trust them, don't worry or fret 
But Canadians feel they've been shafted, you bet 
They think back to Pearson, the airport that's gone 
Or the sad cancellation of the EH-101 
The Somalia thing, and the Krever thing too 
It's no wonder Canadians don't know what to do 
The Quebec referendum, Mulroney's Airbus 
With a new Liberal promise-more animal rights 
It was proof, said the Libs, that the system works well 
Then out in the land there arose such a clatter 
The spin doctors asked themselves, what is the matter?  
Our patronage system is working just fine 
Could it be they detect that our Grit arrogance 
Has now reached such proportion it causes offence?  
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the federal government has abandoned the once prosperous community of Cape Tormentine.  
The village lost not only the ferry but its prosperity as well.  
The program turned out to be nothing but a series of empty promises. 
They have suffered long enough.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Unemployment rates are frightful 
Inside the Grits feel delightful 
They say stop the cuts and then 
The Grits say we need to buy some votes back 
We must reward some old hacks 
The jobless can wait till then 
The Grits say, when we finally balance the books 
These same books we can cook 
And if Canadians hold on tight 
We'll give them a great big tax hike 
The Tories made it easy 
Free Trade is not so sleazy 
So we'll take the credit and then 
CULTURAL AND SPORTING EVENTS IN THE MAURICIE 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, once again the Mauricie region has to mobilize against this government. 
This government abused the trust of the people of Quebec and of the Mauricie region.  
We want to develop this event, not just to have it survive. 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Happy 1998 and thank you all.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, yesterday the environment minister signed the Kyoto deal. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
That is meaningless smog, Mr. Speaker. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister took into account the views of the provincial premiers. 
Provincial ministers were present as part of the negotiations.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Now we know what it is about. 
It is a fancy photo op with some headlines.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
It is a deal that is good for the world. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We invested in infrastructures at the request of the provinces.  
A look at what the Canadian government has done- 
The hon. member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
His math is interesting.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the member talks about unanimity. 
When we look at the infrastructure program, that was at the request of the provinces.  
The priority is to build the future.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
In that case, what is the point of the provincial premiers coming to Ottawa?  
Mr. Speaker, Canada is one of the most decentralized federations in the world.  
That is why they have come today, to strengthen our concerted efforts.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
He has increased the interest relief period for student loans.  
Many very good propositions were made to us.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of parents who do not have money to save. 
Luck should never determine anyone's chance for an education.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Let us start with youth employment. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Year after year the Conservatives said ``we won't co-operate''.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Why do we not have them? 
I ask the Prime Minister this. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is totally incorrect. 
We should indicate our sympathy with the families of the people who lost their lives. 
This has nothing to do with the matter of purchasing new helicopters. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Military experts long ago informed them which helicopter is the best. 
They are just trying to save political face.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is absolute nonsense. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, prebudget consultations were held in every province of the country. 
We are working in perfect co-operation with the provinces.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Once a Liberal, always a Liberal.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
We know reducing taxes is the fair and humane thing to do. 
We know it will help unite the country. 
Why not do it?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Why did the Reform Party give up on what it believes?  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
We want to pay down more debt.  
That is the point the finance minister is missing. 
Canadians have mortgages to pay. 
They have to pay for groceries. 
They want more tax dollars left in their pockets.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The Liberal government stands for the national interest. 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
My question is for the Minister of Transport. 
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Otherwise the bridge would be closed to all traffic on March 1. 
That is why we replied by saying we would offer commercial arbitration.  
I asked CN to accept a commercial arbitrator.  
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
The minister and the government talk of balance. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
SPIRIT OF COLUMBUS PLATFORM 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of International Trade. 
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I spoke with Mr. Landry some months ago. 
I directed the EDC to speak with the Quebec SDI. 
I have spoken with the MIL-Davie union president.  
The federal government feels this is a very important undertaking. 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
For this he was wrestled to the ground by police and held for 14 hours.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
We are awaiting the outcome of that inquiry in the interest of all Canadians.  
Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):
Now another promise has been made.  
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Veterans Affairs.  
In fact we have reduced it by half.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
The rhetoric is getting a little bit higher. 
I am going to permit the solicitor general to answer if he wishes.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
I look forward to its review.  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
The weather conditions were terrible. 
I did not say that anybody broke rules. 
Certainly it was done at considerable risk.  
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Can the defence minister confirm this?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Well, time is up. 
In 25 days all four helicopter bids expire. 
What is the minister going to do? 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is a hypothetical question. 
We are dealing with the matter as quickly as possible.  
We have good equipment now. 
We have people who operate it and do an excellent job. 
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
This project will be totally financed by the mint. 
We will also receive benefits because we will be able to pay dividends.  
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The court itself is the one that wanted to clarify the matter of representativity.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
Today there are 1.4 million Canadian children living in poverty.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The member has raised a very important point.  
The member referred to Scrooge. 
I look at the Leader of the Opposition and his speech yesterday. 
In fact, if they were ever elected, this House would indeed be bleak.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
And unlike her predecessor, can she give us those numbers and stand by them today?  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
I would suggest that the hon. member look to those opinions.  
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
My question is for the Minister of Immigration. 
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have one further question for the Deputy Prime Minister.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
I am not sure if I should quit while I am ahead here. 
I think I will.  
My colleagues, there was a House order agreed on for today. 
We will be taking our leave from this place for the next little while. 
I do thank you and I wish you good holidays.  
We are going to begin the tributes. 
The hon. Deputy Prime Minister will lead off.  
TRIBUTE TO THE LATE ANTONIO YANAKIS 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Yanakis was born on July 6, 1922 in Montreal. 
He achieved a Bachelor of Commerce at McGill University. 
He was very active in politics for over 20 years. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Yanakis was first elected in 1965 and re-elected five times. 
He went on to be re-elected in 1972, 1974, 1979 and 1980. 
I would like, once again, to extend our condolences to his family.  
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I did not know Mr. Yanakis personally. 
I arrived here in 1984. 
He was first elected at the age of 43.  
Mr. Yanakis stressed Quebec's dynamism. 
Incidentally, his family is here with us today.  
We worked together until 1984. 
In any case, we were troopers together in the House.  
We travelled together in Geneva where he represented Canada. 
He was one of us. 
I thank you in the name of Parliament.  
I think it might be a question of privilege. 
DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL REVENUE 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
I submit that this constitutes a contempt of the Parliament of Canada.  
Further on the same page, it states as follows: 
In the final analysis, in areas of doubt, the Speaker asks simply:
Mr. Speaker, I will not abuse the time of this House. 
Your ruling cautioned the officials of the Department of Finance in that instance. 
Now I would suggest the disease has spread to the department of revenue. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. House leader for the Conservative Party has raised an interesting point. 
I have ruled on matters similar to this one. 
However, I want to take the advice of the Deputy Prime Minister in this regard. 
I would like to hear from the minister involved in this question of privilege. 
Does the hon. member have permission to put a question to unanimous consent?  
The answer is no.  
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
The hon. member for York South-Weston is correct. 
With regard to the request made by the parliamentary secretary, it is not necessary. 
First you have to get permission. 
You are asking permission to have unanimous consent?  
Does the hon. member have unanimous consent to put a motion?  
The answer is no.  
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
NATIONAL DEFENCE AND VETERANS AFFAIRS 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.) moved: 
I take it the hon. member seeks unanimous consent to put the motion. 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
After that we will hear what the motion is.  
Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House to put the motion?  
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I have no difficulty giving consent to having these motions carry. 
We will go from there.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Is there unanimous consent?  
Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to understand. 
She could not be heard. 
The hon. member is right. 
I thought we would get through an impasse here. 
Yes, we do have rules in the House. 
I did perhaps transgress the rules. 
I hope the House will give me a bit of latitude on that. 
I think the House is reasonably well pleased with what it did decide on collectively. 
I take the hon. member's words to heart.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
It would be helpful for Canadians to understand the genesis of the report.  
Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question.  
I heard from people who are street people. 
They appreciated that we had paid down the deficit. 
People were looking for strategic investments. 
The member will see those recommendations in the finance committee report.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
She talked of paying down the deficit. 
It is borrowing less but that has nothing to do with paying the deficit.  
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
The member across the way mentioned that Canadians were proud.  
It depends on where one is living. 
What does the member opposite think about the way the government has been working? 
Madam Speaker, I thank the member opposite for her question. 
We are now in a position where we can make meaningful decisions about reinvesting.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
It met with many Canadians.  
I think it is called keeping the balance.  
For some Canadians things are going incredibly well. 
The stock market is skyrocketing. 
It is actually true that many Canadians will have a fantastic holiday. 
There are 1.4 million children living in poverty. 
We are behind Albania.  
My friend says ``We are behind Albania''. 
I do not think we should compare ourselves with Albania. 
Of the western industrialized nations we are second from the bottom. 
We have been there for many years.  
What is the government doing about it? 
Have things improved in the last year? 
Have things improved in the last two or three years? 
They have worsened over that time. 
This is bordering on immorality. 
This is simply unacceptable.  
We hear that regularly. 
This is one fundamental that we do not have in order. 
I know the government will say that it has balanced the books. 
It is not to say that this is necessary. 
In some countries there are no poor children. 
No poor children are living in the country of Denmark today, not a one.  
I challenge the Liberal member who is challenging me. 
My friends opposite do not even know the facts. 
They do not know the reality. 
They are saying that all countries have poor children. 
Not all countries have poor children.  
I remember when we kicked off our hearings with my hon. friends. 
They are honourable friends; they take their work seriously. 
They worked hard and they met with all sorts of people. 
I wonder if they listened, however. 
It puts the provinces in more debt to resolve its debt load.  
There is something even more cynical. 
My friend says ``Yes''. 
We have heard that essentially the deficit war has been won. 
Let us acknowledge the real heroes of the deficit war. 
Is it members of the Liberal cabinet?  
Is it the members of the Liberal caucus?  
Somebody had the audacity to say ``The Tories''. 
No, that is not the answer.  
Let us say who are the real heroes of the deficit war. 
They are the real heroes. 
They are the real heroes.  
Business bankruptcies have never been so high in Canadian history.  
Some selected tax cuts, yes.  
Is this a priority in our country?  
If you said 2% you would be too high. 
This is maddening and it is sort insane. 
No wonder people look at this place and ask ``Who are those folks? 
What on earth are they doing? 
What have they been smoking? 
Where have they been? 
That break would be to begin to phase down the GST immediately.  
The deficit has been paid down. 
We said we needed the GST to accomplish this. 
It has been accomplished and now we are going to repay the people. 
This is a proposal. 
It is not a radical proposal. 
We have heard it from many people. 
A number of my friends from the finance committee are here. 
Which ones did we listen to? 
We met with them all, but which ones did we listen to?  
It is a regressive tax which the Tories introduced. 
They were mean spirited at the time. 
Now is the chance to change that.  
One was to increase funding for health care. 
Health care is what distinguishes our country from most others. 
It is almost a Canadian icon. 
What they did not say is to keep funding at $12.5 billion. 
That is rock bottom. 
It is only part of the answer. 
Education is the second thing I want to talk about. 
This is something we could do if we were bold. 
But we do not. 
We might think of something else when we talk about the tax system. 
We might take a lead from certain countries.  
Those individuals will not pay any income tax at all in Ireland. 
Has this made Ireland bankrupt? 
No it has not. 
Has this encouraged Ireland's cultural sector? 
These are things that countries do that are bold. 
The rest almost exclusively have been created in the small business sector. 
I am talking three, four or five people in a firm. 
Does our tax system reflect the needs of these new entrants into the economy? 
I do want to acknowledge a good point in the report. 
There are actually a number of good points in the report. 
So this is a slight move in the right direction.  
The average family income since 1989 has fallen by 5%. 
Every other industrialized nation has seen theirs increase and ours has actually fallen. 
I could go on and on.  
More than one million people are out of work. 
Seventy per cent of the young people in this country are jobless. 
They are barely surviving. 
They are entering the ranks of the working poor.  
We have much work to do. 
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
For the last 24 months our interest rates have been at historic lows. 
The member talked about tax breaks. 
That is something which will cost the government immediately. 
When tax revenue is taken away, the government has lost revenue. 
It has to be replaced in some way. 
On top of that, he talked about extra spending. 
That is more expenditure.  
How much more would he like to put the country into debt?  
Madam Speaker, where do I begin?  
It was the first provincial government to have a balanced budget. 
It runs the most efficient government in Canada. 
That province was the first to balance its budget.  
My friend's question is legitimate. 
When we advocate a particular proposal, we ought to have a way to fund it. 
Let me answer by way of example.  
That is for one penny a cigarette pack.  
It is easy for my hon. friend to say where will they get the money. 
I should tell him one more thing. 
I do not think he is aware of it.  
I think this is very important to point out. 
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
He said that the ideas of the hon. member for Kamloops were half baked. 
I think they are fully baked.  
This is why Canadians are taxed to death.  
Is that how we got here? 
Is that what has been going on here? 
I am really curious.  
However, I will do my best to respond to my hon. friend.  
He has identified a rather crucial point. 
Perhaps my friend is extraordinary. 
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
Of course, after the election the balanced budget was not there. 
It was an aberration. 
Let us just settle on the best suntan on that side of the House.  
I have a question for the member. 
I do not totally accept that. 
I certainly hope that he can somehow prove to the House that is the case.  
I would like the hon. member to reconcile those two points.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member for Kamloops, a very quick reply, please.  
I will be brief and answer my friend's question directly. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House?  
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
So, this is a serious matter.  
I do not sit on the Standing Committee on Finance. 
This is the report of the Standing Committee on Finance.  
The worst speculations were being made about the development of our country. 
There was a major turnaround. 
In fact, it will disappear. 
Many jobs became precarious because of all these changes. 
It is a fact. 
Some sectors paid the price and shouldered the burden of that turnaround.  
What should we do and what do we suggest? 
What are the points on which we are going to agree for the years ahead?  
I think that all members should take note. 
This report contains a collection of proposals. 
Some others could be considered as well. 
Mr. Gary Pillitteri (Niagara Falls, Lib.):
They provided valuable insight in the consultation process.  
I support the report. 
I question this measure. 
However, Mr. Thiessen did not think this would occur in the immediate future.  
I question foreign investment. 
Often we import the problems of the host country with the investment. 
A classic example would be Korea. 
It is often said that capital has no conscience. 
Certainly foreign capital is going to look at its own country before worrying about others.  
There is an old saying that whoever pays the piper calls the tune.  
In the last 50 years important changes have taken place. 
Some are even reflected in the way the government does business.  
We must start educating our young minds. 
This is one of the oldest proverbs known to man. 
Another important change has been in the field of planning. 
It is paramount that we consult with Canadians.  
The wisdom is out there. 
It is not in the bureaucracy as this report shows.  
Those are the basics of a society.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
We have the best health care system in the world. 
The hon. member also talked about cuts to the provinces. 
The health care system is a provincial jurisdiction. 
We do have the best- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Most of us are going to have a very nice Christmas. 
Madam Speaker, the hon. member is exactly correct.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
The Economist article continued and said: 
Again, Conservative initiatives of which I am very proud.  
The Liberals are not responsible for the passage of time. 
The Hants Community Hospital has been reduced from 128 beds to approximately 30 beds. 
I remind the members of the Liberal caucus that this feeding frenzy is highly premature. 
Our leader has made this point clear on a number of occasions. 
Our party ran on a platform that included just that. 
Canadians know the simple fact that this government has yet to learn. 
This is a competitiveness issue. 
Liberals obviously feel that the status quo is acceptable. 
Unfortunately, it is those same ordinary Canadians who suffer by that Liberal government inaction.  
No one action should dominate another. 
Instead, the three should be used to complement each other and to strengthen the economy. 
In October I met with the Canadian Academic Round Table. 
They had their annual meeting in my riding.  
Current tax levels in Canada run counter to our culture. 
Our current tax system penalizes initiative. 
Since 1993 the Liberals have hiked the ratio to over 14%. 
The government is fundamentally wrong in its judgment.  
Higher taxes reduce disposable income in two ways. 
That has already begun. 
Young Canadians are the brightest light in our country. 
We cannot afford to lose them to other countries. 
I see no serious mention of tax relief in this report. 
Tax burdens are also related to all levels of employment. 
The children are not the root of the problem. 
We must address the tax system in Canada. 
In 1983 it had an unemployment rate in excess of 13%. 
At the end of the report is my party's dissenting opinion.  
Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):
More important, the member should want to ask some very specific questions. 
He expressed frustration in his speech about the consultative process. 
It never went out to consult with Canadians. 
The finance committee, under the Tory regime, never has a prebudget consultation. 
How did it help Canada reach economic prosperity? 
It had increased by this massive amount.  
The Liberal government has been in power for four years and the deficit disappeared. 
They have talked about EI premiums. 
The member also talked about unemployment, a significant problem in Canada. 
It is a challenge for all of us to try to address. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
His depth of knowledge on economic issues is obviously only exceeded by his height.  
The fact is that economic policy takes years to have meaningful impacts. 
I cannot explain an international phenomenon. 
I was not referring to my own opinion about this issue. 
It is to be considered. 
The government now talks glowingly about Liberalized trade. 
Perhaps it would have been better not to have done that. 
Reference was made to payroll taxes. 
There are times when it is required.  
Now is the time to pay down the debt.  
Let us be perfectly clear. 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I congratulate the hon. member on an eloquent, low key address.  
I noticed with interest his remarks on higher education. 
Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):
I would like to congratulate all the members of the finance committee, particularly the chair. 
They did a fine job. 
Some of the items I mentioned earlier in debate. 
In reality, several hundred million dollars have already been paid on the debt. 
We will actually be in a surplus position very shortly. 
Let us take a look at interest rates. 
We have made some good progress. 
During the election campaign many suggestions were put forward by many parties and many individuals. 
I will summarize what some of those individuals were saying. 
They are not interested in large across the board tax cuts. 
They talked about the need for new investment. 
They talked about the need to protect our social programs in Canada. 
I represent a riding that is rural in nature. 
We are about 30% of the Canadian population. 
The realities and the economic conditions we face are unique. 
Ms. Angela Vautour (Beausejour-Petitcodiac, NDP):
I am nevertheless concerned and wonder about my Liberal colleague's opinion. 
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
As a farmer that is very close to my heart.  
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member makes a very good point. 
One of the difficulties is this. 
Those types of things are important. 
I would like to see that type of initiative continued through the next year.  
We talked about the investments we made in the Business Development Bank of Canada. 
The hon. member for Etobicoke-Lakeshore, on a point of order.  
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
I hear no consent.  
Resuming debate, the Parliament Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
That is not a secret process. 
I sat on the foreign affairs committee this morning. 
That is an achievement.  
We want a balanced budget. 
The hon. member for Kings-Hants referred to it previously. 
I would endorse that.  
I think that is the key to what we are talking about. 
I think that requires a federal leadership.  
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
However, I am not certain of that.  
Wealthy communities can invest considerably more locally in education than poorer communities.  
In the wit is a large element of truth. 
The maritimes invested very heavily in education. 
However, I think it needs a little more structure and sophistication.  
I thank the member for that observation.  
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, on a point of order.  
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The motion is not adopted.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
There is no unanimous consent.  
Mr. Speaker, I appeal to the Chair. 
Earlier I saw a member indicate he did not agree. 
So I do not understand why his remark would be recognized. 
The Chair asked for unanimous consent. 
An hon. member said no, and I am afraid that determines the matter.  
The question is put to the House and the answers come back.  
I regret the circumstances are that I cannot entertain the motion.  
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I realize in about a minute things moved rather quickly. 
I believe you then asked if the motion is adopted. 
The hon. member is quite correct. 
The motion is a debatable motion. 
The difficulty we are facing is that it is going to take unanimous consent.  
There is unanimous consent that the motion be put to the House. 
The question is on the motion. 
I therefore put the question. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I think you will find consent for the following motion. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
I will make my point by reading from a letter. 
My husband works 12 hour days, six or seven days a week. 
Even with all the hours my husband works we are only making ends meet. 
We cannot afford an increase in CPP. 
This increase only means my husband has to work even harder. 
Which means we will see even less of him. 
How is this good for my two children? 
Why do we have to pay for a dishonest government? 
They preach about how they want to save our children. 
Couples stress about money and it does affect the children. 
It does affect the marriage. 
My oldest son is five and has said to me ``Why can't I Mommy? 
We can't afford it, right?'' 
This is from a 5 year old. 
All his friends at school get hot lunches on Fridays but he doesn't. 
How are we supposed to dish out another $100 a month? 
I can't work because of all the hours my husband works. 
Why should I have to? 
I want to raise my children not a daycare.  
My husband is 34 and I convinced him to finally vote this year. 
We had many an argument about it. 
A lot of people feel this way. 
I am beginning to think he is right.  
These are basic bills. 
Will CPP even be there when my husband retires? 
I have a friend who at 28 is having to declare bankruptcy. 
She has three children. 
I know that it could be us. 
They have to work harder and longer so the kids are on their own. 
The future looks bleaker.  
It is signed Margaret Snell of Quesnel, British Columbia.  
It is not only Margaret Snell. 
In fact, the government report even says that it is a problem.  
What was the recommendation? 
It is absolutely incredible.  
We have to deal with the debt. 
They pay down their personal debt. 
Of course they do. 
It is common sense.  
What does the government do? 
What exactly does that mean? 
It did not commit to putting a single dollar toward the debt in absolute terms. 
The government should have a serious plan to pay down the debt.  
It needs to start reducing taxes.  
We have a tax burden in this country which is absolutely staggering. 
It is because taxes continue to mount.  
My friends across the way stand every day and say they have cut taxes. 
People do not believe that. 
I do not believe that. 
We also know that the government has introduced 37 tax increases. 
We know all of those things. 
Frankly, I do not think anybody believes it.  
I do not think Canadians are buying that at all.  
Canadians know better than this government what their priorities are. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
He mentioned several of them, for instance bracket creep. 
Who is the biggest bracket creep in Canada. 
In addition there are user fees. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP) moved: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Does the member have unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The motion has been put and the general intent has been indicated. 
Who were these people? 
People from Canada became aware of this conflict. 
In spite of that, 1,300 people volunteered to go. 
We know now in retrospect that certainly was the case. 
It was an incredibly bloody conflict. 
It was then that Norman Bethune almost became a legend in his own time. 
They are documented in a number of ways. 
They were identified by government and by the RCMP as being suspect. 
Today in Canada there is only a handful of these survivors left. 
Remember that this was in 1936. 
They were young people at the time. 
Some were not necessarily that young. 
We have not done anything as a federal presence. 
My motion is seconded by a number of colleagues from various political parties. 
We owe it to these individuals. 
Therefore the cost is infinitesimal. 
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to be able to debate this motion. 
On the surface, Motion No. 75 would seem to have merit. 
Of course that would not be the end of the issue. 
It would be the beginning.  
Unfortunately the motion and its implication is really a non-starter from the beginning.  
It is not a clear cut issue at all. 
Canada was not at war with Spain. 
Would we make these benefits retroactive? 
If so, retroactive to when? 
Which dependants would be eligible for what benefits? 
That is how it has always been and that is how it should remain. 
The case for voting in the affirmative on the motion does not hold up. 
As the standing committee stated 10 years ago: 
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
I begin by thanking the hon. member for Kamloops for moving the motion.  
It is essential for us to remember our history. 
Canada was not a combatant in the Spanish Civil War. 
Canada has strong and vital communities of people of Serbian and Croatian heritage. 
We certainly did not sanction any reflection of ethnic tensions here. 
We value our role as a sanctuary of peace and democracy. 
I hope we are more enlightened today than in 1936. 
In matters of war we do not freelance.  
We also attended the Ceremony of Remembrance at the Vimy Memorial.  
Our level of knowledge about the first and second world wars is fairly good. 
The dream of international communism was betrayed by Stalin and others. 
Mr. Maurice Godin (Chateauguay, BQ):
Why did Canada not accept to provide assistance to Spain at the time? 
Why this discrimination toward our soldiers when they came back? 
I will try to answer these questions from a historical perspective. 
This power was exercised by the governor, who was appointed by London. 
This is the main reason why these rebellions took place. 
Quebec was hit first. 
We had no more business being in Vietnam than we did in Spain.  
History proved them right. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am sorry, but the member's time is up.  
For example, 72 persons have been removed from Canada during the past few years. 
We have prevented many from obtaining visas to enter Canada. 
This is one thing we will never compromise on.  
I thank the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve for his interest in this issue.  
Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):
Of course, the rest of his reply did not make sense. 
Admittedly, the Minister of Transport realized his error. 
It condemned the increase in rail freight charges.  
It is normal for a self-respecting people to have a country.  
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all.  
This included the subsidy for the Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway.  
I would personally like to thank the member for Manicouagan for his interest. 
One of my daughters was born there. 
I know Sept-Iles, Manicouagan and the North Shore very well.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
(The House adjourned at 6.40 p.m.)
