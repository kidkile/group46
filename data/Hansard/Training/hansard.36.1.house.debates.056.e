The House met at 10 a.m. 
BILL S-3-SPEAKER'S RULING 
Before proceeding further I would like to make two points of clarification. 
The hon. member alleged that both bills were essentially the same. 
I rule therefore that Bill S-3 is properly before the House.  
I do not rule for or against a member or a party. 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS COMPENSATION FUND 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
HERBAL REMEDIES AND SUPPLEMENTS 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to introduce several petitions today.  
They feel that these remedies have been dealt with in a heavy handed manner.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the second petition concerns the age of consent. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to present two petitions to the House this morning. 
The first petition has to do with the multilateral agreement on investment. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions to present to the House today.  
HERBAL REMEDIES AND SUPPLEMENTS 
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to present three petitions to the House today.  
The first one concerns the abolition of nuclear weapons. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
The third petition, Mr. Speaker, concerns the multilateral agreement on investment. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, question No. 54 will be answered today. 
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal, Minister of National Revenue, Lib):
The Department of Justice also provides support to Revenue Canada. 
However, the costs associated specifically with collection activites are not tracked.  
e) Number of seizures exercised-1,081.  
Mr. Speaker, I would ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
ALLOTTED DAY-THE FUTURE OF QUEBEC 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ) moved: 
Let me read the motion back to you. 
Mr. Duceppe seconded by Mrs. Debien moves: 
Quebeckers from every political stripe, both federalists and sovereignists, agree with this. 
This is a historical consensus. 
If there were no people, there would be no constitutions. 
The supreme court, their supreme court, their rule of law, their outdated colonial pretensions.  
Today's motion will be very revealing. 
The New Democrats will respect the result of the democratic expression of this right.'' 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the leader of the Bloc a simple question. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the leader of the Reform Party for his question. 
All parties in Quebec, both federalist and sovereignist, never accepted that Constitution.  
Let us think about that for two minutes. 
We have seen them at work.  
``We love you'' in French, in English, in multicultural, in all languages. 
They cannot even speak French in Nagano. 
We have had enough of this hypocritical rhetoric, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
When the time comes to vote, we will see on which side those parties stand. 
However, Quebeckers have understood what is at stake. 
Since I have little time left, I will name only a few of them. 
The consensus was reached in Quebec and it is still there. 
The government must take note of that. 
The future of Quebec is not a legal but a political issue. 
I am not the only one to think so. 
This is quite something.  
In Quebec, we have a saying: ``Don't bite the hand that feeds you.'' 
That is quite easy to understand. 
This is more than an image, it can be proven. 
Quebeckers cannot expect anything from the Supreme Court of Canada. 
Unfortunately, history has proven him right.  
The amendment is also in order.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
It gives me an opportunity to add something to the argument I was making.  
It is for Quebeckers to decide their own future. 
It is not a legal issue but a political one. 
That notion is nowhere to be found in the Canadian Constitution. 
That is the judges' interpretation. 
Rights must be respected. 
We believe there is no such right. 
Are the Cree less of a people than Quebeckers?  
And this government agrees with that statement. 
This is what he said in this House on September 19, 1995: 
And perhaps I could explain this to the Leader of the Opposition. 
On September 20, the Prime Minister said: 
The Australian constitution states that it is an indissoluble federal Commonwealth. 
Is Australia a bad democracy? 
In Finland, another multicultural nation, ``The territory of the State of Finland is indivisible''.  
I have a long list of democracies which have decided they were indivisible.  
The amendment is therefore absurd, because secession must be negotiable. 
Quebeckers cannot decide the division of the debt on their own.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Therefore, any sub-amendment must be related to his amendment.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The member for Joliette, on a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Unanimous consent was requested. 
We will leave it at that.  
Madam Speaker, I just want to clarify something.  
First I want to stress how important today's debate is. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
That is what democracy is all about.  
Madam Speaker, we must comply with the provisions of the Quebec referendum act. 
That is the bottom line. 
That is the issue. 
It seems that that is self evident in any democracy in the world. 
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I would like to ask the minister, who has just- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The member for Winnipeg-Transcona, on a point of order.  
We are now about to have two questions in a row from the Bloc Quebecois. 
I think it should be spread around.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
How could you miss him?  
I am not exactly small. 
Do I have to get up on my desk?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I was only looking in one direction.  
Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):
It is a bit like a divorce case. 
This is about divorce.  
It is a bit like that.  
I would like him to be a little more explicit.  
I am confident that the justices really want to be honest and competent.  
We should not confuse the issues for political reasons. 
They are too important for that.  
We are not going to make important decisions without that information.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I apologize for interrupting the minister, but his time is up.  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I believe I was not chosen. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
The official opposition is very concerned about the future of Quebeckers. 
I suggest that the motion before us is only half a motion. 
Every right is subject to qualifications and limits. 
Rights are limited by the rights of others. 
My right to extend my fist stops at the end of your nose. 
So what we have before us is half a motion. 
That law contains no explicit provision for the secession of a province. 
Reform has been quite clear on this point. 
We want Quebeckers to remain in Canada. 
We fervently desire to unite Canada for the 21st century.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
And if it is not, then the leader of the Reform Party has a choice. 
His second reason is to end bilingualism and multiculturalism. 
Mr. Levant in the name of the Reform Party goes on. 
I see the Reform members agreeing with that. 
That is the attitude they have shown.  
I have a second short question. 
Those are two straightforward questions for the leader of the Reform Party.  
But it gives us an opportunity to declare what our positions are.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
It sounds like debate.  
I am talking about you, Bellehumeur.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I did not think there was any dispute about this. 
Any attempt to detract from this principle is unacceptable.  
There are process questions that need to be answered. 
I heard some of the members address such concerns.  
This is our concern. 
These are reasonable questions. 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
It was always assumed that they would not.  
That is partly what kept the country together.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
I first want to deal with this motion. 
The motion reads as follows: 
That this House recognize the consensus in Quebec that it is for Quebeckers- 
-and for them alone to decide their own future.  
This is an issue that my party has already dealt with several times. 
It does not create a major problem for us. 
It is not the words in the motion that people might object to. 
The real problem is there. 
Yes, the motion is fine and we can support it. 
This is part of the problem. 
And this also must be said frankly. 
This is always in the spirit of portraying things as they are. 
And for good reason. 
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
That is the problem.  
In international law, we have to say things like they are. 
In international law, there is no rule. 
There is another rule. 
That is the plain truth. 
The Supreme Court could come back to us with that option.  
We think it is a bad idea. 
It is a political problem.  
There are a number of things we can do. 
I have recommended some institutional changes. 
We could make a commitment to delivery of services to people. 
Through such an agreement we could install predictable financing.  
Health care is probably the most important example. 
Over the last few years our health care system has been slashed in its funding. 
It is broken and needs to be fixed. 
We have had the worst of debates on these issues. 
It ran on that issue during the last election campaign.  
Now the concept of unique character is on the table. 
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
The Reform member says how profound. 
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
Here are 10 reasons why Alberta would be better off.  
I will quote three of them: 
Eliminate bilingualism and multiculturalism-.If 
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
He speaks about reality and truth.  
Every single party was calling for it. 
People will not obey that law. 
We saw it with cigarette smuggling. 
But they were duped. 
Such changes were never made.  
This is the reality.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
He says that is right. 
The reality is that it does not work.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
They want it to work. 
That would be their first choice. 
He knows it and I know it. 
That is how our language and culture were able to live on. 
That is the context in which I set my assessment of my country.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
That is what has led a growing number of Quebeckers to back sovereignty.  
We have moved from one constitutional failure to another. 
Discussions cannot go on forever. 
The hon. member for Joliette said that this has been going on for 30 years. 
Now we are up to 35. 
The Conservative Party clearly said it did not support them. 
The future for the federal government has to be defined by others besides Quebeckers. 
By the justices of the supreme court? 
By people in the other provinces? 
We can see clearly where they are leading us. 
What is Ottawa's strategy? 
They are playing both horses. 
What does all this mean? 
Let us have a look. 
In Quebec, nobody is talking about the Calgary declaration. 
These are profoundly contradictory pronouncements. 
But the declaration is silent on this point. 
This is hard to sell. 
Each time, they start again with a lower offer than the previous time. 
Then there was the Charlottetown accord, rejected by all Quebeckers. 
Since this did not work, the federal government tried giving even less. 
They want it both ways.  
Now, our dear intergovernmental affairs minister has launched a philosophical debate in all this. 
A transition mechanism was defined. 
Ottawa admits it would not respect the democratic will of Quebeckers. 
They will not dare debate this issue.  
Guy Bertrand has been the inspiration of all this. 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
I for one think that the people did understand very well indeed.  
It was a long debate, nothing new in Quebec. 
The people know full well what is at stake. 
No one has put in motion the process leading to sovereignty. 
Can you imagine this fine group organizing our future? 
This is true for all peoples, including the Quebec people.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
All agree that it is for Quebeckers to decide their own future.  
Constitutional law is based on decisions made by the people. 
This constitutional deadlock has lasted for 15 years. 
With this new case, the Supreme Court is heading towards a new impasse. 
Should we be surprised? 
Let us be proud to be Quebeckers.  
Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne-Blainville, BQ):
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Terrebonne-Blainville for his question. 
I fully agree with him.  
I think he is right. 
There are the Canadian people and the Quebec people. 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
Several reasons supported the decisions we made. 
These components of the Canadian identity are valuable assets for the future.  
They form the Canadian fabric.  
On every occasion, Quebeckers said no to secession and yes to Canada. 
What makes Canada strong is the values inherent in our identity. 
Openness, solidarity and respect for individual rights are often mentioned, and rightly so. 
These same values have shaped our common history.  
On each occasion Quebeckers have said yes to the Canadian component of our identity. 
For its part, our government wants clarity. 
Despite the dogmatic opposition of the Bloc, our country is progressing and changing. 
As Quebeckers and Canadians, we cannot support this motion.  
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval-Centre, BQ):
I would like to ask her two questions. 
My first question is:
Don't forget 1992.  
By a majority, we said ``We want to stay in Canada. 
We want to preserve our identity as Canadians and our identity as Quebeckers''. 
We answered ``We want to stay in Canada''.  
Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Quebec East, BQ):
Of course they understood them correctly. 
It is entirely democratic. 
It was not an attempt to manipulate. 
This clearly illustrates the state of confusion that prevailed at the time.  
The question must at least be clear. 
This question is rather clear- 
I am sorry, but the period for questions and comments is over.  
The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for International Cooperation.  
Mrs. Claudette Bradshaw (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Cooperation, Lib.):
Canada is a remarkable country. 
The province prospered in Canada, particularly since the Quiet Revolution. 
Quebec within Canada also has a dynamic, living and unique culture. 
Our children are our future. 
However, that does not mean that our Constitution is or should be immutable. 
Of course we have our challenges. 
Which country does not? 
We must put our difficulties into perspective.  
None of these challenges should lead to a break-up of our country. 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
I would like to know where the confusion lies. 
In 1995, 94% of the people of Quebec spoke. 
That was the 1992 referendum on the Charlottetown Accord.  
It is very clear to us. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member for calling me his Acadian friend. 
It is true that as Acadians we are friends of Quebeckers. 
However, I would like to relate my version of the evening of the referendum.  
I intend to answer your question. 
I do not think it was the same question. 
Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne-Blainville, BQ):
If it was not, then they should stop saying it was.  
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
Whom are we talking about exactly? 
But is it ethical? 
That is something else.  
Trudeau and his henchmen did not bother with these subtleties. 
In 1995, Quebec held its second referendum on the future of the Quebec people. 
This consultation again took place under Quebec's Referendum Act. 
Once again, the rules of the game were agreed to by all. 
The issues were clear. 
The referendums that were held in Quebec are good examples of that. 
That is a most undemocratic and illegitimate move. 
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
I would ask her two simple questions. 
Is that democracy in Quebec? 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral:
Mr. Speaker, I am really not sure what I should do. 
The first question was about the number of referendums. 
There will be as many as it takes.  
That is what I believe.  
``Hone your work carefully''. 
I am almost tempted to make a comment. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
No, this is a political move. 
To be so crucial, it would have to be understood. 
The law is not crucial. 
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
I would like to hear what the member has to say on this subject.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question.  
Questions and comments, for a very short question. 
The hon. member for Mount Royal has the floor.  
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
Why did he not want to deal with this amendment and accept it?  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
We believe that you make a contribution to our country by your uniqueness.  
The magnificent synergy of our two provinces is embodied in such people.  
Let me just mention a few of their achievements. 
Quebec is indeed Ontario's largest trading partner within Canada and vice versa.  
That commitment to equality, however, was by no means a call for uniformity. 
It appears to be a signal to which Quebeckers can respond.  
That is what we in the government of Canada wish to do. 
Together we are a stronger presence in the world and on the world stage.  
I know Quebeckers are interested indeed in more than survival. 
It is for those reasons that I cannot support this motion.  
Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Quebec East, BQ):
The very opposite is true. 
This is another issue I would have liked to tackle. 
In the past, a number of referendums were held. 
If he did I thank him.  
The member made reference to some of the history in Ontario. 
I was part of the David Peterson government in the province of Ontario. 
That was not easily done. 
The reality is Ontario recognizes the importance.  
For that reason we will not be supporting the motion. 
However, we do support the people of the province of Quebec's remaining in Canada.  
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
This is the reason why we are making sure it will be.  
Nothing is further from the truth. 
This country was built on openness and tolerance. 
Nobody is forced to be part of this country. 
We do not want Quebeckers to lose their country over a misunderstanding.  
We do not want the democratic experience to be turned into a bad joke. 
They will have to make their choice with full knowledge of the facts.  
Let us recall the controversial statements of Jacques Parizeau about a unilateral declaration of independence. 
In this regard, results of the last referendum are most revealing. 
The agreement reached by Parizeau, Bouchard and Dumont was quite extraordinary in its own way. 
This is sure a nice example of transparency and of respect toward Quebeckers.  
A confusing and convoluted question almost resulted in the breakup of the country. 
We want clarity, not confusion. 
We are in favour of democracy, but we also trust Quebeckers' judgment. 
Quebeckers played a major role in the building of our country. 
These values are enshrined in our Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
The federal Liberals are more and more alone in this adventure. 
They seem increasingly to be distancing themselves from the federal Liberal members of Parliament. 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
We would have liked the Quebec government to consider it. 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
He said that he would like to have a clear question. 
Will it be possible for you to have a clear and honest question? 
I do not think so. 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will wait until after question period.  
It being nearly 2 o'clock, we will now proceed to Statements by Members.  
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
I wish Cindy much luck in fulfilling hers.  
To all our Olympians, well done.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, sometime soon the government will introduce its 1998-99 budget.  
But the question is what do Canadians want? 
Mr. Carmen Provenzano (Sault Ste. Marie, Lib.):
We feel the government is playing Battleship with us. 
When we tried G-6, the Prime Minister got up and said ``No''. 
The next day, we tried B-3 and the Deputy Prime Minister said ``No''. 
We are entitled to answers. 
The Liberals should stop trying to take us for a ride.  
CITIZENSHIP AND HERITAGE WEEK 
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Under the Liberals, Canada has become a country of no choices. 
QUEBEC'S RURAL DEVELOPMENT 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
No. Is the media in an uproar for the government to do something? 
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
Our athletes are very deserving.  
Mr. Maurice Godin (Chateauguay, BQ):
You're not here as conquerors.'' 
I answered that this is Canada's own brand of bilingualism.  
Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
The hon. member for Calgary West.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, what a month for Senator Andy Thompson. 
They want to choose who represents them in the upper house.  
We do not have to live with these absentee amigos. 
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Nothing is further from the truth. 
Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
We should start by getting the senator reaquainted with some of the local customs.  
The upper chamber is not like the beaches of Mexico. 
Shirts must be worn at all times. 
CANADIAN EXECUTIVE SERVICES ORGANIZATION 
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
A very distinct society in Newfoundland is in danger of dying. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Is it to take out weapons factories or is it something bigger?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
There will be a frigate and Hercules airplanes going there. 
There will be some Canadians on board United States AWACS aircraft. 
At the moment the diplomatic efforts are still ongoing. 
At the moment we are not at that stage yet.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
The time for these vague answers and vague assurances has passed. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have clearly spoken about the position of the government. 
A frigate will be doing its duty there. 
The Hercules airplanes will be serving the forces personnel. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Canadian families are barely keeping their head above water.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We have provided those families in which there are disabled Canadians with lower taxes. 
We will continue in this vein.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, that was a real Oscar winning performance. 
It kind of reminds me of Forest Gump.  
They have seen their disposable incomes fall by $3,000 per family since 1990.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Companies like Hydro-Quebec do not qualify. 
The eligibility rules are very clear. 
They were established in 1988 when Lucien Bouchard was a minister in the Conservative government. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
I suppose it is a subtlety that the Prime Minister fails to grasp.  
In other words, the ball is in the government's court. 
Will it respond to the requests that have been made?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
It is very clear.  
The member for Temiscamingue.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We are not compensating large companies. 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
There is a big difference.  
Why, then, is the government stubbornly refusing to compensate Quebec? 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are very active diplomatically. 
Earlier I was talking with the president of France concerning initiatives. 
I consulted with him and gave him my views, and he gave his. 
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Why does Canada not- 
The right hon. Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, today we are hoping for a sighting. 
Senator Andrew Thompson is due back in the Senate from his siesta in Mexico. 
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Why is the Canadian taxpayer paying the senator's salary? 
I do not know whether this falls under the administrative responsibility of the government. 
However, if the Prime Minister wishes to address this I will permit him to.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I cannot kick him out. 
The Canadian people are asking him to do so. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Senators should be voted in and voted out.  
The Prime Minister says he cannot fire him. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The Reform Party voted against it in the Charlottetown accord.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Those allegations are now being looked into by the RCMP. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
The Reform Party has been undermining public servants. 
It has been challenging duly elected chiefs and councils with no evidence.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the minister knows that quote has been taken right out of context. 
The evidence is very clear that Mr. Starlight wrote to the minister.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
I have to ask what the motivation is of this opposition. 
I believe that is why we are on this- 
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):

Mr. Speaker, I recognize the contribution the hon. member has made. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
My question is simple. 
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member. 
The Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I cannot say for sure. 
Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I want to thank Mr. Harrigan and his team for their very good work.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I take the work of the investigator very seriously. 
I want to make sure that there is a full investigation done. 
We will report on the results when it is complete.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, there is one thing that should take no time at all. 
The letter has the minister's stamp on it. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
A woman died in an emergency room after a four hour wait. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
That reflects the priorities which this government puts on health care in this country.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We will do that because it is a commitment of our government. 
There is the head start program in the department of Indian affairs.  
We are doing our very best and we will do even more in the future.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Montreal and Toronto area emergency rooms are in a crisis situation. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
It is to that end that we are committed.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, we are getting the same old malarkey. 
They take dollars and give back pennies.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are working toward that very objective daily. 
Next week I will meet again with my counterparts in the provinces and territories.  
That is not the way to go. 
We shall do it the Liberal way. 
We shall do it the effective way.  
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
I want to tell her why we want to cut the spending. 
The hon. minister of Indian affairs.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
I have yet to hear from him. 
I am truly wondering if he is interested in these files or not.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
LABOUR SPONSORED INVESTMENT FUNDS 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We are in the process of monitoring the situation.  
Mr. Gilles Bernier (Tobique-Mactaquac, PC):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
We have even added consultation days, and parliamentary committees- 
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my wife and my children are status Indians. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
To them they do not exist.  
The hon. member for Rimouski-Mitis.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is a new one on me.  
COMMENTS DURING QUESTION PERIOD 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
She seems to want to get to her feet. 
She has the floor.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I was not trying to impugn anything against the hon. member. 
I was just trying to reflect the facts as I see them. 
ALLOTED DAY-FUTURE OF QUEBEC 
The House resumed consideration of the motion, and of the amendment.  
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
The motion reads as follows: 
We can all work together in the House to rebalance the federation. 
I pray that we all can work together for this mutual beneficial end.  
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
Madam Speaker, we all learn from our mistakes. 
That is the message we tried to get across. 
We continually fight for the fact that the west wants in. 
In this case let us try to represent regions effectively. 
That is what Reform stands for.  
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
The example of the Cree is often given. 
I will ask my colleague two questions. 
If not, the same is true of Quebec. 
We know there are problems in Quebec. 
There are problems in Alberta and right across this country. 
We are looking at rebalancing the powers in this country. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Mr. Levant makes comments such as ``Say no to other special interest groups. 
This kind of extremism is not what actually adds to the political process. 
I ask the member if he will distance himself away from these comments. 
The fact remains that the message was quite clear in those commercials.  
Whether the presentation is going to be used again is up for debate. 
The key is that the message was clear. 
It is something that the west wants. 
That is exactly what we are going to stand by.  
They are allowed to voice their opinions and they are allowed to do so freely.  
That is something which most members of this House would fight against.  
I am really upset that the member did not paint the proper picture. 
The fact is that he was a journalist when he made those comments.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member for Beauharnois-Salaberry.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am afraid that I did not hear that. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Clearly we need to have some legal parameters as to what this means. 
That is why we have supported the reference to the court.  
The motion is that the House recognize a consensus- 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity. 
The three questions that have been put before the Supreme Court are: 
There has to be a mutual agreement on the division of assets and liabilities. 
I do not think anyone wants to see that happen.  
Quebeckers can decide whether they want to leave, but the laws must be followed. 
After an agreement is reached.  
Hopefully the separatists will never get a majority. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I think this settles the matter.  
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Borders are collapsing at an incredible speed, faster than the speed of light. 
People are coming together around the world faster than ever before. 
People to people relations are becoming the prime element of our global village.  
It can do just about anything it would like to do. 
Madam Speaker, it is obvious a question was not posed. 
It is a very serious issue. 
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
These travels have already driven the message home. 
It is part of who we are. 
I have been reminded that I am sharing my time.  
My current portfolio makes me keenly aware of Canada's presence on the international scene. 
I do not believe it will. 
However, Alberta is also the cradle of pioneer spirit in Canada.  
Therefore, in Alberta, we appreciate the kind of determination needed to overcome difficult situations. 
This is no small achievement. 
In 1997 no less than 94% of Quebeckers can express themselves in French. 
I know solidarity is a value dear to Quebeckers. 
It is also important to Albertans. 
Our two official languages give us an edge when it comes to competing internationally. 
Both are recognized languages at the United Nations.  
Our country benefits for membership in both la francophonie and the Commonwealth. 
Our peacekeeping is good for Canada's international image. 
The fact that we are a united country gives us more economic weight. 
Together we are strong enough to be a member of the G-7.  
All provinces benefit from this membership. 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
He is extremely familiar with the Canadian justice system. 
I would like him to explain this to me. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Berthier-Montcalm. 
His comments are very eloquent. 
I was very interested in the hon. member's comments.  
Mr. Reginald Belair (Timmins-James Bay, Lib.):
Francophones who live outside Quebec are in a minority position in three ways. 
They are a minority on the continent, in their country and in their province. 
What affects Quebeckers affects us as well.  
My community has been called on to face special challenges. 
That is why we oppose Quebec secession.  
Our language is part of our Constitution. 
That does not mean that justice was always easily achieved. 
We still have to assert our language rights today.  
Canada's francophones are proud of what this country has become. 
Nobody can ask me to be indifferent to the political debate in Quebec. 
By separating from Canada, Quebec would take away a vital part of ourselves. 
Canadian federalism has greatly contributed to the French fact's vitality throughout the country. 
Canada can reap the benefits of its participation in the francophonie. 
That contribution stems from a vitality specific to each of our communities. 
Canada would not be Canada without Quebec. 
We francophones in other provinces need our fellow citizens of Quebec. 
Canadians know that diversity is a strength, not a weakness. 
No one is thinking of forcing Quebeckers to stay within Canada. 
Why renounce a part of what you are, of what we all are? 
The loss would be everyone's. 
Canadians themselves would be irremediably diminished, and francophones outside Quebec doubly so. 
Together, we have made this country a wonderful success.  
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
We can be Canadian any way we want.'' 
That is what he said in his speech. 
We do not have anything against francophones outside Quebec. 
That was the beginning of the famous 1867 Confederation. 
The question that begs to be asked today is this:
Why should Quebec want to separate from Canada? 
My question to the member opposite is this:
``If you do this, you will get a slap on the wrist.'' 
During the last referendum, the Prime Minister made promises in Verdun. 
Are they reason enough for Quebeckers to stay? 
Consequently, I have no doubt that we have a lot of affinities. 
Think seriously about the consequences''.  
I wish I had more time to speak.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
That is the bottom line. 
We must go to the bottom of things. 
That is not how things are in real life. 
And I could go on.  
The debate tonight is part of our history, of our evolution. 
It is a result of history, but not only of history. 
As I said before, poverty also affects a lot of people in Quebec. 
The other nation, not just a province. 
What do they offer us? 
This Canada only exists in theory. 
They would finally agree that Quebeckers are a people. 
For us, this was a fundamental debate.  
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
However, you have to understand one thing. 
It is a small part of the problems we experience as a different people. 
Mr. Reginald Belair (Timmins-James Bay, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, as there is not much time left, I shall be brief.  
Madam Speaker, this is a very interesting question.  
We have looked at negotiating strategies.  
In fact, we would feel it is quite normal to start now. 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
I address them-you-directly as a part of the Quebec society.  
A court of justice will never be able to replace the will of a people. 
The old rules were no longer applicable and valid. 
This referral is an attempt to fraud democracy. 
It is an attempt to put our democratic institutions under state supervision. 
This referral denies the existence of the people of Quebec. 
Let us talk about history, the official one and the other one. 
We got them by occupying the political space, in the respect of democratic rules. 
The result is that we have now become a modern democracy.  
This is where my political commitment comes from. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
She dealt with the substance of the matter. 
The result is an ever greater involvement of the judiciary.  
My question to the hon. member for Louis-Hebert is this. 
Madam Speaker, I think my colleague has raised a very important point. 
I see some very sad times ahead.  
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I will give you a small lesson in geography. 
Madam Speaker, I will continue the heartfelt words of my hon. colleague. 
And Canadians have to understand this.  
Secession within the law would already cause huge problems. 
We Quebeckers would not want our society plunged into such instability.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma-Manitoulin, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I listened carefully to the hon. parliamentary secretary. 
The rule of law is important. 
This needs to be done in an orderly fashion. 
He made reference to the rule of law by saying: 
The rule of law is not an obstacle to change. 
It permits change to take place in an orderly way. 
The government is hoping to have clarification. 
We trying to guarantee that it is done in an orderly fashion.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
I have three comments and one question. 
I would like to hear what my hon. colleague has to say about this.  
Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard-La Prairie, Lib.):
I have some reservations I would like to express. 
Despite these reservations, I was almost prepared to support the motion. 
Some would consider my reservations fundamental. 
Often it is simply a matter of semantics. 
It mentions a consensus. 
The word consensus has become a buzz word. 
It is being used, abused and interpreted. 
Is there really a consensus in Quebec? 
This too is contentious, and I am far from convinced there is one. 
In spite of this I might have supported the motion.  
We moved an amendment. 
The Chair ruled that amendment out of order. 
I am speaking here of our influence around the world. 
There is a contradiction in there, a double standard. 
There is a fundamental contradiction.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
On a point of order, the hon. member for Richelieu.  
He just challenged the Chair's ruling, and that is unacceptable. 
It goes against the democratic process established in this House.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
It was the decision of the House, not the ruling made by the Chair. 
It is the House, not the Chair, that did not accept the amendment.  
Is the hon. member for Richelieu rising on a point of order?  
The decision made by the Chair is being challenged. 
I will not stand to be muzzled.  
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Madam Speaker, I have several questions to ask my colleague.  
Second, when Liberals say ``a clear question'', that is an insult to Quebeckers. 
Is there not a clear message in there? 
They know full well the political issue that is at stake. 
It is an insult to their intelligence to show such an attitude.  
It was the same thing this morning with the amendment.  
There is an important distinction to be made. 
It was not accepted because it was out of order.  
Anything can be done with unanimous consent. 
It happens all the time, and it is not exceptional. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
This matter has been debated long enough. 
I am very anxious to hear his answer to this question. 
That is an opinion.  
There is talk of consensus. 
There is no mention of that, because it does not serve their purpose.  
That was the insult.  
Why are they trying to fool the people if they are so sure? 
Rene Levesque must be rolling over in his grave.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
The wording of the motion is very general and ambiguous. 
What about the position taken by the Cree people in Quebec? 
This cuts to the heart of one of the difficulties with this motion. 
The motion refers to the ambiguous concept of consensus.  
The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples stated: 
It is founded on emerging norms of international laws and basic principles of public morality. 
How does this notion take into account self-determination for aboriginals?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
(The House divided on the amendment, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the amendment lost.  
The next question is on the main motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
(The House divided on the motion, which was negatived on the following division:) 
I declare the motion lost.  
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege. 
Perhaps the member would like to apologize for this extremely rude and unparliamentary action.  
I did not see it.  
This government, however, does not see the need for a permanent solution. 
The government prefers instead to take a piecemeal approach to labour issues. 
As a trading nation we cannot afford to lose ground. 
Employers, on the other hand, stand to forfeit lost sales and revenues. 
These are normally powerful enough incentives for a negotiated settlement.  
In key economic sectors, however, this normal safeguard does not apply. 
Good labour relations cannot be legislated. 
It does not favour one side or the other.  
Here is how it works. 
For disputed areas, each party would be required to submit a final offer for settlement. 
The arbitrator's decision would be binding on both parties. 
The risk to Canadian jobs should be minimized. 
Final offer selection arbitration is not a new concept. 
That is what we have been saying all along.  
Even the Mulroney government saw the benefits of final offer. 
During the best of times this is a very severe hit on the national economy. 
In a recession it is devastating.  
Grain represents 30% of the port of Vancouver's business. 
Farmers do not want to be pawns in other people's labour disputes. 
A nationwide rail strike this spring is a very real possibility. 
Final offer selection arbitration is not discriminatory. 
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour, Lib.):
I know my colleague tries very hard to achieve good solutions. 
Members will ask is the system perfect. 
That is where this government feels that the responsibility should rightfully remain.  
My hon. colleague across the way is nodding and giving me a thumbs up.  
Let me explain what I mean. 
The preamble to the Canada Labour Code states: 
It means that labour unions have an important role to play in the economy. 
His party mainly represents rural ridings where agricultural interests are dominant and important. 
If the ports are closed, produce does not head for its destinations abroad.  
Final offer arbitration is one of the many mechanisms which may be chosen. 
The more complicated the dispute, the worse it gets.  
It is very serious.  
There are better solutions. 
It will improve flexibility and encourage settlement of disputes.  
Instead of seeking a balance, it eliminates the balance completely. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Stripped down to its basics, that is the essence of the bill. 
It is an ongoing battle. 
That may be the first recorded strike in known history.  
It is one of our most basic rights and freedoms as working people. 
There is certainly nothing new about it. 
They are reluctant to break new ground with their rulings. 
The actual fact is in Manitoba FOS was used very sparingly. 
It is poorly crafted and it is riddled with serious flaws and omissions. 
Mr. Jim Gouk (West Kootenay-Okanagan, Ref.):
He spoke about how this is a right wing plot by the Reform Party. 
It is not right wing like Reform.  
This method was taken out by the Conservative Party. 
That party sits to the right of the Reform Party here in this House. 
A number of misconceptions need to be cleared up. 
Strikes and lockouts are not collective bargaining. 
Strikes and lockouts are the result of the failure of collective bargaining.  
That is not collective bargaining. 
It is a failure of collective bargaining.  
The strike or lockout is a dispute settlement mechanism. 
We have no intention of taking collective bargaining away from anyone.  
Consider Canada Post which was mentioned by both members. 
The next time up was 1997 and the government legislated them back to work. 
There is a bit of a pattern here, is there not?  
The government legislated them back to work. 
The second time around the workers took a strike vote. 
That does not make for a happy side. 
There is a long history of the government intervening in labour disruptions in this country.  
Then the problem comes in. 
We have already heard figures mentioned about the cost of the ports strike. 
They could both go with the same settlement. 
They would say that they did not mean it to go that far. 
That is the way it should be. 
That is reasonable and proper.  
This is something that cannot go on. 
What is the impact? 
It is an economic tug of war between the employer and the employees.  
Who else is hurt? 
Primarily it is right there located within that worksite.  
Collective bargaining will still exist. 
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
I think it is necessary to correct some misconceptions they have about this process.  
We are not advocating a heavy-handed approach here at all. 
It is a tool that can be used equally by them.  
I see it as a real step forward.  
This tool can be used equally by both parties. 
They would get right down to the last parts of the case.  
That is exactly how we want it to happen. 
My colleague in the Reform Party from British Columbia made an excellent point. 
The parliamentary secretary says that this process will not work. 
There are many precedents in Canadian history to show that it does work. 
It does not resolve any of the outstanding issues. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
His response was that he was going to give students as many options as possible. 
This government has not done enough for our young people. 
Clearly the Liberals have missed the boat as far as young Canadians are concerned.  
The majority of them even think that the worse is yet to come. 
Moreover, the problem of inequality in our society is growing every day. 
This insecurity is most deeply felt by our young people. 
Young Canadians are our future. 
Last week, I met with students in New Brunswick. 
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
The whole educational process is the purview of the provinces.  
It increased assistance for students with dependants- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member's time has expired.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Canada has felt the effects of the Asian crisis. 
What can Canada do to mitigate any negative impact? 
I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of International Trade to respond.  
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am afraid I have to interrupt again.  
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
That was on November 24, one month before Christmas.  
That is a 3% decrease in net profits.  
Dairy products were subject to a quota- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am sorry, but the hon. member's time has expired. 
Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The motion to adjourn the House is deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 7.06 p.m.)
