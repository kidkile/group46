EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 190 
Friday, March 5, 1999 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
FIRST NATIONS LAND MANAGEMENT ACT 
I have been following this debate very carefully. 
I want the House to appreciate how significant- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there consent that the time on the first 40 minute slot be split?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I apologize for the interruption.  
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate and thank my colleagues for their consent.  
I anticipate that I will be able to do that. 
If not, I know my parliamentary secretary will speak to some of those issues.  
First and foremost, let us consider the context in which Bill C-49 finds itself. 
To me it is inappropriate. 
But first nations resisted. 
Bill C-49 is a product of over 10 years of work. 
It is called Bill C-49 and it is tremendously important.  
I do not think there is anything wrong with that.  
That bill did not pass. 
This will happen in consultation within the communities. 
There is a system.  
They are not sweeping at all. 
The code of implementation has to be verified externally.  
There is nothing here that is sweeping and broad. 
The third area is the issue of consultation. 
The first nations will do that. 
We build a partnership where both communities can benefit. 
That is the focus here.  
The mayor and council do not know the chief and council. 
That is a challenge we have right across the country.  
The chief and council did not know the mayor and council. 
The process engaged in was one that was dysfunctional. 
That is not how this country should work.  
I believe that is the right approach. 
To me, all this is part and parcel of Bill C-49. 
The issues that have been raised can be responded to. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Does the hon. member wish to specify a specific timeframe?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
A change has been made to five minutes.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the House for agreeing to this.  
One is the disposition of marital property in the event of a marital breakdown. 
She has indicated her willingness and her concern in this area.  
That does not square with what the minister is saying at all. 
This is an independent, unbiased real estate agent's expressed opinion.  
I direct those two questions to the minister and ask her to respond.  
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond. 
Let us look first at the issue of matrimonial property. 
The second question raised by the hon. member was on the issue of expropriation. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
We are really privileged to have the minister in the House today. 
I am sure she would go along with that.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Ten minutes, Mr. Speaker. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The suggestion was for 10 minutes. 
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Bill C-49 was introduced on June 11 in the House. 
At this time I would like to set the record straight on these matters. 
There are supreme court decisions which make this impossible to happen. 
This is nothing more than fearmongering.  
In the exercise of this power the first nations must establish the rules and procedures. 
The Railway Act statute is an example.  
Consultation has again been repeatedly raised. 
This is completely and categorically false and strongly needs to be addressed.  
There is another point that I would like to address. 
It is a myth. 
It does not exist as a requirement in the B.C. municipal act.  
The time for self-government is now. 
Please do not delay the passage of Bill C-49 any longer.  
In other words, it is communal land. 
Provincial laws cannot be replicated in their entirety to reserve lands.  
The important point here is that the community decides.  
The minister will make further announcements on this initiative in the near future. 
I would like at this time to respond to this challenge with some important facts.  
This is my wish. 
I think this is a good bill. 
This is what they have asked for. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Once again we will need the consent of the House. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We had questions and comments through unanimous consent. 
I am not sure if there was consent. 
I will therefore ask again. 
Is there consent to split the time?  
I have no difficulty with this. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
There are no questions and comments in this period. 
Mr. Speaker, I am happy to accommodate the request to split the time. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
It is up to the House. 
He was challenged to come outside the House and make those same statements. 
I can assure him that was the effect of his comments. 
It is really unfortunate that he sees fit not to apologize for those.  
I will go on to address some of the issues the minister raised.  
In that regard we agree with her completely. 
It belongs to the crown in right of the Queen. 
Obviously this is wrong and it needs to be addressed.  
We do not say it is bad. 
There must be provisions to protect those interests built into the legislation.  
It is beyond me why the minister is not willing to consider those amendments. 
This is a very well respected Liberal member of parliament. 
He is a lawyer and is recognized as a constitutional expert. 
He goes on to say a number of other things. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this Liberal government continues to erode the power of parliament.  
Parliament must be supreme. 
It must oversee the activities of the courts, the bureaucracy and cabinet.  
Then we should debate it and allow a free vote.  
Mr. John Maloney (Erie-Lincoln, Lib.):
Investments in early childhood development will provide beneficial social dividends.  
Families have diverse circumstances. 
The government has responded and will continue to respond. 
Consider the spousal tax credit for single income families.

Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
THE LATE GERHARD HERZBERG 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Dr. Gerhard Herzberg came to Canada from Germany in 1935. 
Although he was an astrophysicist, he nonetheless became Canada's first Nobel Laureate for chemistry. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard-La Prairie, Lib.):
There are a number of other artists to watch for on Sunday. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
This forms a basic right in any democracy. 
We have a right to decide and to make a choice.  
It is a leader in financing these foods and products. 
It also has an equal moral responsibility to all consumers.  
Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne-Blainville, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, once upon a time there was an ogre named Canadosaurus. 
He shared his cave with ten dwarfs who were bound in servitude to him. 
The fattest was called Ontariette, and the prettiest, Quebequine.  
He called these social transfers.  
That, of course, was because they loved the ogre.  
I want my 100 crowns''. 
``Ungrateful wretch'', shouted the ogre. 
``I give you an extra 20 crowns and you cannot even say thank you''.  
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
If I was not here, I would be there.  
This partnership is great news. 
It will be of great benefit to my community, Ontario and Canada. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
The hardships experienced since the downturn of the fishery have been staggering. 
As the minister is well aware, the fishing-

CENTRE D'INSEMINATION ARTIFICIELLE DU QUEBEC 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
The new limited partnership can point to universally recognized achievements. 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
The government's responses fall into three categories. 
I invite the finance minister to answer the question. 
Why is he allowing this clear discrimination to continue?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, again the hon. member simply does not seem to get it. 
That is why we have a progressive tax- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Calgary-Nose Hill.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
They have a difficult time under this minister's budget. 
What will the minister do to address this problem?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We have already said that.  
If it is, how does it gibe its approval of that with its questions? 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
The real issue is why the hon. member is arguing against individual taxation. 
That is the issue. 
Why does he not answer the question?  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
That is a low income family.  
When will the government act? 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Why has this government not taken action since?  
Mr. Speaker, the government is acting. 
We are very active internationally on the whole issue of the international smuggling of people. 
We are at the forefront of this effort.  
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. 
Mr. Speaker, the answer is no, no, no.  
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I am a little worried.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is to the government House leader. 
My question is very simple to the minister.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the minister has not answered the question. 
I will ask him once again. 
Will it be a confidence vote or not? 
We have to know that. 
Are members free to vote their own minds?  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
That is what parliament will continue to do now and in the future.  
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
At the same time we have improved substantially the equalization program. 
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
He calls this government's claims laughable. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is a little out of date. 
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, dictatorship is alive and well in the Liberal Party. 
Which one does it accomplish best?  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
How can he now claim the opposite of that which he voted on himself?  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
What is the government trying to hide in this Senate money spending? 
What kind of embarrassment is it trying to avoid? 
What is it that troubles the government about the way senators spend money?  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, nothing is hidden. 
The full estimates were tabled last Monday. 
Copies are supplied to all members of parliament and all members of the other place.  
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada is not involved with any propaganda.  
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, we have reviewed the agencies, boards and commissions. 
In that process we abolished hundreds and hundreds of positions. 
We amalgamated or got rid of up to 70 of these agencies, boards and commissions.  
In the process we saved the government a lot of money. 
All these decisions were done in the interest of Canadian taxpayers.  
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
Why will the minister not combine these bureaucracies? 
Mr. Speaker, once again, we have done that review. 
There is a continuing review of all these agencies, boards and commissions.  
Our purpose is to be able to give good government at the lowest possible cost. 
I think we showed it. 
We abolished hundreds of positions. 
We saved millions of dollars and we intend to continue to do so.

Mr. Speaker, I totally reject the member's allegations, which are totally unfounded.  
Therefore, I totally reject these allegations.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
Does the minister think that this statement by a respected elder has merit? 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the legislation is not being rammed through. 
In fact, we have had 50 speakers address this bill in the House. 
That does not include the interventions that were made at committee. 
The issue of matrimonial property is important. 
Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):

Mr. Speaker, that work is already under way in two important respects.  
The process is very well along in its development.

The government is moving on the file and we intend to meet our targets.  
Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Middlesex, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):

Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
They have been around for a long time. 
There are also other programs to help this industry.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
When will the government call a byelection in Windsor-St. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am sure the byelection will be called very soon. 
Thanks for the endorsement of Mr. Limoges.

We owe you one.

I found it very interesting. 
There is no need to refer it to any committee.

This question of privilege will be dealt with by the Speaker. 
In due course the Speaker will rule on this point of privilege.

The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
FIRST NATIONS LAND MANAGEMENT ACT 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
I note that the minister addressed her remarks specifically to me. 
I think this goes to the heart of the problem. 
I suggest they have done themselves no favours by doing this. 
The parliamentary secretary was talking about driving wedges. 
They indicated that their band members were in support of it. 
They are very concerned about their rights as band members. 
They want it to be enshrined in the legislation.  
It is not a difficult matter for that to be accomplished.  
The minister said that the concerns about expropriation are overblown. 
They cannot sell their homes. 
He in fact lives in Calgary; he has retired to Calgary. 
He wants to sell his home to get his equity out it. 
They had absolutely no knowledge that this had taken place.  
Yet not one penny has actually gone toward school or education. 
Not one penny was transferred to the provincial government in aid of education. 
We know that by and large Canadians are decent, fair minded people. 
I have met personally with virtually all the Musqueam residents. 
I know they are decent, fair minded people. 
I know they are not opposed to the aspirations of the band. 
They just want to be treated fairly. 
We certainly agree with the principle of devolving that decision making power. 
Why is there no provision for private property rights? 
It is not rocket science. 
I would ask that the House adopt the amendment.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The amendment is in order.  
FOREIGN PUBLISHERS ADVERTISING SERVICES ACT 
BILL C-55-NOTICE OF TIME ALLOCATION 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
FIRST NATIONS LAND MANAGEMENT ACT 
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
The nobles forced some changes. 
Fee common is not as common as one might think. 
It is not only our concerns. 
These concerns have been raised by a number of people.  
Petitions have been filed. 
``The details will be worked out in the next few days''.  
It further indicated that the member said: 
He said ``The public's concern is correctly focused on it''.  
Another government member plans to vote against Bill C-49. 
It is not just us.  
This is not too much to expect at all.  
I would like to speak for a moment on the expropriation provisions in this bill. 
We want to ensure that they are not unfairly left out.  
It can be natives over natives. 
Whoever owns an interest can have that interest ended by expropriation.  
A municipal expropriation act will talk about the compensation proposed. 
If people do not agree, they have recourse. 
We certainly do not want the courts to be involved early on in every dispute.  
They do not want it taken away without proper compensation.  
The bill is deficient in that way. 
It is in the interest of the signatory bands to put those amendments in place. 
I do not live on band land. 
I have a home that is held in fee simple in the town of Nipawin. 
Perhaps I do have something to gain. 
That is what we are doing. 
That is a ridiculous thing to expect.  
What can we say about the matrimonial home? 
Why has that not rung a bell with the government? 
Why is the minister simply saying that they are consulting? 
They have no vote. 
Because they did not want to be taxed without representation. 
What we have here is taxation without representation. 
Does the government consider this fair?  
It still creates conflict and hardship. 
It is a major concern to everyone. 
She is concerned about Bill C-49. 
We do not see that with Bill C-49 going through in its current form.  
Municipal councils raised concerns. 
Constituents raised their concerns. 
It just is not right to do it the way it is being done.  
Do they have the expertise to write property division acts? 
Do they have the expertise on expropriation?  
They could simply apply it. 
Judges could take it and understand it. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I have had discussions with the House leader of the Bloc Quebecois. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We may have to go back to the drawing board. 
The information I have is that debate will terminate in 14 minutes. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
Finally, in New Brunswick, it is the first nation of Saint Mary's.  
This legislation is paternalistic. 
They will be able to assume the responsibilities inherent in this control. 
This situation causes concern to associations of native women in Canada and Quebec. 
In this case, it is native women who are affected.  
This was taken from clause 17.(1).  
We are very surprised- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sorry to interrupt the member.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The money in this fund comes entirely from workers and employers. 
The government is deliberately altering the basic purpose of the employment insurance fund. 
This is why clause 2 of Bill C-299 provides that: 
Members will no doubt want to know what A and B stand for.  
These costly duplications have been funded with this money.  
This is the very purpose of having such a program.  
These amendments would add transparency to the program.  
I hope, therefore, that all parties in this House will support the bill.  
Mr. John Harvard (Charleswood St. James-Assiniboia, Lib.):
Let me explain why.  
However, nowadays we need much more than that.  
They now change jobs quite often. 
Those measures fit into a much broader plan of action.  
So far the new system seems to be working as it should. 
It is too soon to tell if further amendments to the EI program are required.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
This member was very far-sighted. 
It has a very strong government influence. 
The strong hand of government is very evident in the workings of the commission. 
For the cabinet to use this program for its own political purposes is not appropriate. 
I would certainly like to see a stronger provision.  
The government speaker talked about the fact that there had been reductions to EI premiums. 
I would point out that these are minuscule reductions. 
That is not the way this fund should be run.  
The member also talked about skills training. 
These are things that Canadian workers need. 
They are very disappointed in many cases. 
Some programs give virtually no skills at all. 
This is a very worthwhile effort on the part of the member. 
I applaud the member and support her efforts wholeheartedly.  
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
One might ask why these measures are necessary. 
Unfortunately this is not exactly the case.  
That is why Bill C-299 is important. 
The NDP would go even further and create an independent UI commission. 
I believe this is an excellent question. 
Fewer women qualify for maternity benefits. 
The government's changes in UI are hurting entire communities.  
Nova Scotia has lost $716 million between 1993 and 1997. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
You cannot pay down the deficit.  
I commend the hon. member for this piece of legislation. 
That is very important.  
There has been an offloading to the provinces in the area of training.  
The issue of seasonal work is another issue the government has largely ignored. 
It has punished Canadians who are involved in seasonal work. 
Seasonal workers in Atlantic Canada were hit extraordinarily hard. 
No, it did not do anything. 
Instead it reduced the size of government. 
The creation of a separate commission would be a great step forward. 
Those are the types of changes that are necessary.  
I am not confident the government will make those types of changes. 
The past is the past. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be brief. 
It is my contention that he is the one who does not understand. 
He and members on the Liberal side frequently talk about paying off the deficit.  
By definition it cannot be done. 
The deficit is an amount that one borrows. 
One cannot pay off a deficit since it is intangible. 
It is simply the amount borrowed.  
I just wanted to correct that point.  
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
I would like to thank my colleague from Calgary-Nose Hill who recognized my perception. 
Everyone knows that the past often foretells the future.  
They did not satisfy the auditor general any more. 
However, that was not done.  
The government ignored the unemployed and the needy. 
Where is the compassion? 
Where is the heart? 
Right now, unemployment is going down somewhat in Canada. 
This has been the case for several years. 
One might well wonder what became of the other 40%.  
Were they coddled for all these years? 
Did they receive government handouts? 
I do not think so. 
It is high time this government gave a signal to the Canadian public.  
I will give it an opportunity. 
Despite my years, I am still a bit naive. 
I will give it an opportunity. 
We must show compassion as well as reason.  
I therefore call for unanimous consent.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House adjourned at 2.15 p.m.)
