Wednesday, December 9, 1998 
The Senate met at 1:30 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
In her annual report, Commissioner Michelle Falardeau-Ramsay states: 
- That is, the federal government - 
...remained consistently below availability.  
This was a landmark convention. 
It employed language which was forceful, recriminating and aggressive in its opposition to racial discrimination. 
One clause in particular states that parties to this convention are: 
This redress marked a very important development in Canadian politics and history.  
Honourable senators, the need to fight racial discrimination is as important as ever. 
Today it has been ratified by 161 state parties. 
However, there is still a gross underrepresentation of women conducting affairs of state.  
The title of the discussion was, "Recognising the Inherent Dignity and Rights of Women:
A Mirage in the Distance?" 
We must not be satisfied. 
Incidence of Canadian Patrol Frigates putting to Sea without Sea King Helicopter 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
What that has to do with Labradors, I do not know. 
These helicopters fly, they do not float.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, order, please! 
May we have some order so that we can hear the honourable senator?  
Let us not be misled:
That is the problem - not icing or high seas. 
It should be grounded.  
Let us have no more half measures. 
Father Christmas of Northern Ontario Town 
Hon. Francis William Mahovlich :
The "Mr. Schumacher" that the town was named after was our very own Santa Claus.  
Mr. Schumacher then went to the University of Columbus. 
It was during Prohibition that he entered the business world. 
His business was selling cough syrup. 
However, that cough syrup happened to be 45 per cent alcohol. 
He amassed a fortune. 
He sold it not only by the truckload but also by the trainload.  
During his time there, he did very well. 
He was very fortunate. 
He went to Europe and began to purchase great art. 
My point is that this man was extremely generous. 
He passed away in 1957. 
Some of them are now principals and teachers there. 
Indeed, the spirit of Christmas is alive and well in the Town of Schumacher!  
Bill to Amend-Report of Committee 
Wednesday, December 9, 1998 
Clause 1, page 1 :
Replace line 8 with the following: 
LOWELL MURRAY, P.C. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Privileges, Standing Rules and Orders 
Seventh Report of Committee Presented 
Wednesday, December 9, 1998 
Your committee recommends that the following rule be added to the Rules of the Senate : 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration 
Twenty-Ninth Report of Committee Presented 
Wednesday, December 9, 1998 
Agriculture and Forestry (Boreal Forest) (Supplementary Budget): 
Professional and Other Services 
Special Committee on Transportation Safety and Security (Supplementary Budget) 
Professional and Other Services 
Special Committee on Security and Intelligence (Supplementary Budget): 
Professional and Other Services 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
State of Financial System 
I give notice that on Thursday next, December 10, 1998, I will move: 
Canada-Taiwan Parliamentary Friendship Group 
Meeting Held in Taiwan- Report of Canadian Delegation Tabled 
Leave having been given to revert to Tabling of Reports of Inter-Parliamentary Associations: 
This visit took place from August 8 to 15, 1998. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
My information is that those helicopters...  
- meaning the EH-101s - 
...would not be available until late next year.  
Senator Graham's information is incorrect. 
The fifteen other EH-101s were to: 
...support a national search and rescue capability.  
The contract was awarded to European Helicopter Industries Ltd. and to Paramax. 
EHIL was to build the helicopter and Paramax was to: 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I relied on that information to be accurate. 
Second, the savings to the taxpayers amounted to at least $30 million per unit.  
Including the cancellation costs.  
You should check your information again, Senator Graham.  
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
My question is very basic. 
When will you put helicopters on the decks of those frigates? 
If you do not intend to do it, say so. 
One flight was 300 kilometres, and another 200 kilometres. 
It did not make that much of a difference.  
A latter reason was high seas. 
The leader cannot have it three ways from Sunday.  
However, I certainly did mention icing conditions. 
The honourable senator said that the helicopter flew in the morning. 
Why it was it not sent out when conditions changed?  
Is the honourable senator talking about the situation that occurred in Quebec? 
Obviously, conditions changed during the day.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Yes, I did, honourable senators. 
This morning was the only time that we had left. 
That was the reason for clarifying the text.  
The meeting was to last 15 minutes at the outside. 
Unfortunately, some of the senators wanted to raise other matters. 
Two caucuses were meeting, but that was the only time we had. 
It was not a decisive meeting with votes.  
Wednesday mornings, the respective caucuses of this place have meetings. 
Honourable senators, it was not Liberal arrogance. 
It had nothing to do with being a Liberal or a Tory. 
We had caucus as well, I might add.  
Hon. Norman K. Atkins :
Might I ask whether attendance was taken at that meeting?  
Yes, the clerk has the attendance at the meeting. 
No, what time they left.  
If the committee was sitting during national caucus, the Senate was not sitting. 
That is Liberal arrogance.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
The Toronto Star says that democracy is noisy and that it is messy sometimes. 
The Globe and Mail today says sometimes democracy is noisy. 
How exactly is democracy messy?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
What did the Prince of Darkness say?  
Senator Lynch-Staunton again raises the question of the "forces of darkness." 
I acknowledge that that is really reaching.  
We were greeted by protesters and picketers, and the police. 
It was suggested that perhaps we should leave.  
I was asked to come back. 
Do you remember what the question was?  
Is that what Canada has come to? 
The role of the RCMP was to assist the Vancouver City Police. 
I feel it is important for us to have that information. 
The responsibility for his personal protection lies with the RCMP.  
As I have outlined, there were other forces which took part in those security arrangements.  
Honourable senators, with respect, that is hardly an answer to my question.  
Why not just admit it and get on with it?  
We wish to follow that due process.  
It is not working.  
Senator Ghitter alleges, while sitting in his place, that the process is not working. 
I will not read the entire document. 
However, Ms Shirley Heafey specifies in the mandate: 
What about the Clerk of the Privy Council?  
I understand that presently they have a list of 120 witnesses.  
Report of Auditor General on Distribution of Discretionary Funding-Government Position 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
In his response to me at that time the leader said: 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I thank the honourable senator for his question.  
The government has not yet determined how it will proceed.  
I do not believe the matter has yet been referred to committee. 
When it is referred to committee, the government will entertain amendments to the bill. 
It may be reduced to 15. 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
Discussions on Nuclear Weapons-Position of Minister 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, there is no question that the government is examining this particular issue. 
Canada remains committed to NATO. 
Minister Axworthy has very strong views on these particular matters.  
Canada will be well represented by Minister Axworthy and his officials.  
Possible New Strategy-Government Position 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Leave having been given to revert to Notice of Motions: 
Honourable senators, I give notice that Thursday next, December 10, 1998, I will move: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
On behalf of all senators, I bid you welcome. 
We are pleased to see Canadians here observing the work of the Senate.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Senator Murray, we are doing our best to ensure that that happens.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, for my guidance, am I to interrupt the proceedings at three o'clock?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Bill to Amend-Third Reading- Motion in Amendment-Debate Adjourned 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Our committee heard the evidence of many witnesses. 
On third reading, these concerns remain outstanding and unresolved.  
Honourable senators, this is not a simple test. 
But this act does not do it. 
That makes no sense to me at all. 
That alone would, I think, require explanation and justification. 
In response to concerns on this issue, departmental officials stated the following: 
There was a more traditional consultation done with a range of stakeholders.  
... in the recent discussions on this topic, 
S the stakeholders were asked to keep the contents confidential, 
The Canadian Bar Association believes: 
The Canadian Bar Associated states: 
Page 4, paragraph 6 reads as follows: 
Further, the Canadian Bar Association said: 
These problems will create unnecessary and difficult situations for employers. 
Mr. Von Finckenstein answered: 
... the amendments were put forward not by me and not on our suggestion but by - 
Therefore, today the Senate has golden opportunity to show its true colours. 
It can act as a body of sober, second thought. 
We have done it before. 
This time we must do it on our own. 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, I move: 
( a ) in clause 19 
(i) on page 14, by deleting lines 31 to 46; 
(ii) on page 15, by deleting lines 1 to 42.  
( b ) in clause 47, on page 39, by 
(i) deleting the heading before clause 47 and clause 47; 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion in amendment?  
Hon. Catherine S. Callbeck :
It is clear that deceptive telemarketers are notoriously creative. 
It is common knowledge that communications technology is developing at a fast peace. 
We also heard testimony from the Canadian Direct Marketing Association. 
I do not believe that there is a conflict. 
I do not think there will be a problem going forward with that.  
I think it is time to give them what they want.  
The third issue is wiretapping. 
Senator Taylor asked about this aspect yesterday. 
It is the most controversial aspect of the bill. 
There are many checks and balances against this intrusive mechanism. 
To give you one example, we heard from the Congress of Union Retirees of Canada. 
That organization was founded in 1993 in Toronto. 
They admit that they agonized over this issue of wiretapping. 
That, in a nutshell, is why we should accept this clause of the bill.  
The fourth question mentioned by the honourable senator related to whistle-blowing. 
Therefore, we believe that the whistle-blowing provisions are extremely important. 
Scam artists threaten and intimidate their own employees, not just their victims. 
The matter of consultation was raised. 
It has been improved with amendments. 
It enjoys widespread support.  
On motion of Senator Tkachuk, debate adjourned.  
Child Custody and Access Reform 
Report of Special Joint Committee Tabled 
Leave having been given to revert to Reports of Standing and Special Committees: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Consideration of Report-debate adjourned 
No other interpretation is valid. 
The Senate members of the committee were extraordinary. 
We missed him greatly when he had to leave us. 
I do not know how we could have managed without them. 
Our Senate clerk, Cathy Piccinin, was quite simply splendid.  
Of that, there is no doubt.  
It was an enormous task, and we cannot thank them enough.  
On motion of Senator Pearson, debate adjourned.  
Business of the Senate 
All Committees Authorized to Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
Leave having been given to revert to Notices of Motions: 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
Appropriation Bill No. 4, 1998-99 
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.  
Canada Small Business Financing Bill 
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.  
Honourable senators, this bill represents new and groundbreaking legislation. 
For this, Minister MacAulay should be thanked. 
Your committee looks forward to seeing his promises implemented.  
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
These provisions are quite wide. 
We were given the argument that DNA, like fingerprints, is just another method of identification. 
We were confronted with a very serious dilemma.  
We were delighted with the acceptance of that principle.  
Hon. John G. Bryden :
It is like a tiny bar code. 
I would draw honourable senators' attention to the following words: 
I therefore urge honourable senators to support the bill at third reading.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.  
Second Reading-Order Stands 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
On motion of Senator Kinsella, for Senator Beaudoin, debate adjourned.  
Royal Canadian Mint Act Currency Act 
Bill to Amend-Second Reading 
The bill makes several changes to the laws governing the mint and Canadian currency. 
That would be a disservice to Canadians.  
The problem is not the amount. 
Work on that plant is nearing completion. 
Honourable senators, this expansion does not make sense. 
The mint did not need to build this plant. 
It could have continued to get its blanks from Westaim. 
This is unnecessary empire building.  
Second, beyond the overcapacity issue, the mint is being sued by Westaim for patent infringement. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading- Debate Adjourned 
Honourable senators, Bill C-57 is the bill in question. 
Bill C-57 is the government's response to that request.  
Honourable senators, I would now like to outline the main features of Bill C-57. 
The reason for this change is as follows. 
As I mentioned, all three will reside in the territory.  
We are at the dawn of a new era in Canada's history. 
On motion of Senator Kinsella, for Senator Andreychuk, debate ajourned.  
Bill to Amend-Third Reading- Motion in Amendment-Vote Deferred 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
It will then be tabled for all members of the chamber to read.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
What is the date of the letter?  
The date is December 9, 1998. It reads: 
Honourable senators, may I ask a question to the honourable deputy leader?  
If I heard correctly, the committee was to report to an assistant deputy minister. 
In the machinery of government, an ADM is a fairly low-level manager. 
I have been waiting for the last hour and a half for the French copy.  
That is from a minister of the Crown.  
It seems you have confused two paragraphs. 
For purposes of clarification, let me repeat them: 
With respect to the work of the Senate committee: 
It would be my understanding that that report would go directly to the minister.  
This letter is signed by whom?  
It is signed by the Honourable Andy Mitchell, Secretary of State (Parks).  
Honourable senators, the answer to that question is somewhat muddy. 
Obviously, ministers can be changed at any time. 
We are all aware of that. 
Perhaps I misunderstand the letter. 
You have not addressed that at all. 
Here is $2 million. 
Is that what the government is saying in this letter? 
Do you expect the people of the North to buy into that? 
Is that what we are being led to believe?  
Let me be very clear here. 
No one has indicated that the people of the North should go away. 
That is their land. 
They live on it and it is hoped they will get working opportunities.  
We have here a situation of probability. 
This could be a very successful mine. 
That money will start flowing at the beginning of the next fiscal year. 
That, in and of itself, should provide jobs for that region.  
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Honourable senators, I have a follow up question. 
Was the minister made aware of that?  
The development of this park has taken seven years in the negotiating phase. 
That still did not answer my question. 
Could I have leave of the Senate to table the document?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted to table the letter, honourable senators?  
I am in your hands, honourable senators. 
I will not withdraw my motion, even if an extra $2 million is offered. 
I heard from the deputy leader that that is part of the $10 million.  
I am still concerned about the Inuvialuit. 
That is a big property. 
There is a future for the people there in mining.  
I am in your hands, honourable senators. 
I am not withdrawing my motion.  
Honourable senators, I have nothing against the creation of national parks. 
However, we have a much different situation here. 
Let us look at the facts here. 
The government says that the agreement was signed in 1996. 
They have much higher unemployment there.  
Who is in favour of the 2.5 per cent being excluded? 
The Government of the Northwest Territories is opposed, as is the local government.  
The Government of the Northwest Territories definitely signed the agreement. 
Who is opposed to this? 
Who is in favour of it? 
After all, they probably come from Bluenose, Nova Scotia. 
Honourable senators, I ask you to remember this. 
The response from Parks Canada and Ottawa is that it is a done deal.  
Jose Kusugak who represents Nunavut Tunngavik Inc. appeared before the committee. 
He also represents the people of the area. 
He pleaded with the committee. 
He represents a large group of people.  
I always remember this adage, honourable senators:
Many of them had never seen the Atlantic Ocean.  
We have a situation here in which the people have spoken. 
Yet, the bureaucrats in Ottawa, Ontario, say, "It does not matter to us. 
We have set this agreement up. 
We have delineated the boundary lines. 
We will not change them." 
We do not want that to happen.  
Forget the people of the area." 
That is what is happening here.  
No, we will not.  
I wish my dear friend Sister Butts from Cape Breton were here. 
She knows all about unemployment.  
She is a strong supporter of this bill.  
What is happening here? 
All the parties have not agreed. 
That is what has happened here. 
However, 99 per cent of the people in that area want the exclusion. 
They deserve the jobs. 
They deserve to be heard. 
I say again, the people represent the power in this country.  
Ten million dollars has been spent and two jobs will be created. 
No jobs will be lost for the 2.5 per cent.  
The people must be heard.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, may I have leave to continue?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
We are the chamber of sober second thought. 
Honourable senators, we support the needs of the people of the area. 
What do we have to lose by doing this? 
There will be a delay of a few months, but that is about all. 
It is the right thing to do. 
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
I should like to make a comment and then ask a question of Senator Buchanan. 
I think that is a mistake. 
In his speech he said: 
Tuktut Nogait Park covers an area of 16,340 square kilometres. 
The park would then cover an area of 28,000 square kilometres.  
That is the figure I was using.  
There is a misunderstanding. 
That is not the way I read the maps.  
Perhaps Senator Adams could answer the question. 
I used the figures I found in his comments.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I read that the area of the park would be 28,000 square kilometres.  
The committee can find the facts.  
That is the ultimate proposal for the park. 
By the way, I read every word of the testimony heard by the committee. 
I am well informed.  
The honourable senator may be right. 
Tuktut Nogait is the core area we are dealing with here now. 
Honourable senators, that is absolutely my opinion. 
If the figure of 28,000 square kilometres is wrong, I accept that. 
What the honourable senator just said is absolutely right.  
Hon. Herbert O. Sparrow :
The Hon. the Speaker :
The letter has been tabled. 
If there is a request for distribution, we will have copies made.  
How would I request that the letter be distributed?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I shall ask the Table to make copies.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those honourable senators in favour of the motion in amendment will please say "yea"?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those honourable senators opposed to the motion in amendment please say "nay"?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
In my opinion, the "nays" have it.  
And two honourable senators having risen.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
A Bill to Change the Name of the Electoral District of Stormont-Dundas 
Honourable senators, this bill is fairly straight forward. 
Demographics change over time. 
We have all gone through changes in the names of ridings over the years. 
I gather that others are suggested as well.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
A Bill to Change the Name of the Electoral District of Argenteuil-Papineau 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
In the future, a little more caution will be required. 
We accept these proposals with pleasure. 
It is difficult to refuse them. 
I am not criticizing these two bills.  
Eventually, there will have to be a debate. 
I am talking about a principle for the future. 
However, stand by for the next debate.  
I have an answer for my colleague.  
No, that will not be necessary.  
It is because Mirabel simply was not included.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read second time and passed.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
The Roman Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Mackenzie-Bill to Amend-Third Reading 
Hon. Norman K. Atkins :
First, I wish to add my support to this bill. 
It is my belief that this is deemed desirable and necessary by the diocese. 
We should amend the statute accordingly.  
That brings me to my second reason for rising to speak today. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, cell phones are not permitted in the Senate chamber. 
It is in someone's desk, Your Honour.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
You may now continue, Senator Atkins.  
Eventually, parliamentary involvement is no longer necessary.  
I believe it is time we changed this method of incorporation.  
The state of California has a corporation sole statute. 
It grandfathers all existing corporations sole. 
It is time that we streamlined this procedure and adopted a similar statute in Canada. 
However, that will have to begin in the House of Commons. 
There is nothing else that I wish to add at this point in time.  
Thank you for your consideration. 
We are now ready for the vote!  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Privatization and Licensing of Quotas 
Consideration of Report of Fisheries Committee- Debate Adjourned 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Fishers and fishing communities are divided on this issue.  
Minister Anderson does not have an easy portfolio. 
These are difficult times in the fishery. 
Canada's commercial fisheries are undergoing extremely severe changes. 
The federal government is now promoting what they call "comanagement" in the fishery. 
Our committee does not wish to attach blame. 
In our report, we do not attribute ill intentions at all. 
Our committee approached this issue with an open mind. 
We had no axe to grind. 
Our intent was to ask questions. 
We felt that our study would add a positive note to the debate. 
The report speaks for itself.  
I would like to say a special thank you to witnesses for their valuable contribution. 
We were very impressed with the calibre of their presentations and their great credibility. 
It was long and sometimes complex with technical testimony that sometimes boggled our minds. 
It was a privilege for me to serve with such devoted parliamentarians. 
Thank you to you all.  
Hon. John B. Stewart :
The Department of Fisheries and Oceans has my sympathy.  
Senator Comeau explained to the house what individual quotas are. 
To allocate or privatize a certain quantity of fish is not like enclosing land. 
Quotas, in a curious way, lead to excessive effort. 
So much for individual quotas. 
Let me say a word or two about individual transferable quotas.  
Individual transferable quotas are feared. 
One fear is that the quotas will come under the control of foreign corporations. 
However, it is worse than that. 
That may be a fear which is unfounded but it is present.  
Why was it important to have testimony from these two countries? 
The evidence is not all in favour of individual transferable quotas. 
The same is true in the case of Iceland.  
That is not true in Canada. 
In any case, let me put it before you.  
Concentration is now the trend.  
However, the fisheries are much more than that. 
That belongs to someone else in the government. 
Perhaps it belongs to the Department of Human Resources. 
Perhaps it is a matter of concern in regional economic development. 
That would be a great help. 
I am happy that the committee made that recommendation.  
Before I sit down, I must say that I enjoyed my work on the committee. 
I thought that Senator Comeau did a splendid job as our chair. 
Several other members also contributed greatly to the work of the committee. 
On motion of Senator Carstairs, for Senator Perrault, debate adjourned.  
Report of Foreign Affairs Committee on Study- Inquiry-Debate Continued 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Honourable senators, this matter stands in the name of Senator Andreychuk. 
I request consent to proceed today. 
I would then adjourn this inquiry in her name.  
Hon. John B. Stewart :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Therefore, the Honourable Senator Grafstein is free to speak.  
Foreign policy is a rippling reflection of domestic values and domestic preoccupations. 
To what extent can we, or should we, bring about change? 
Why make other than a synthetic effort? 
Is there a danger? 
Where do we start? 
Which students attended Canada's school of "morality" in foreign policy? 
Indeed, did one ever exist?  
Protecting the "pure laine" became an obsession of the governments of the Province of Quebec. 
Eayers differentiated between the values of the new and the old world.  
He went on to state: 
The world was still wide. 
What more was required? 
Who indeed was the enemy. 
"Canadians care more about Alberta than Abyssinia," he declared. 
During the Abyssinian crisis in 1935, Canada had a change of heart. 
These missionaries were singular, selfless and courageous. 
Such was the case until September 1939.
