Thursday, June 3, 1999 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Normally the names of the petitioners are not revealed. 
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have another petition concerning rural mail couriers.  
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would ask that all questions be allowed to stand.  
ALLOTTED DAY-NISGA'A TREATY 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I think you would find consent for the following motion: 
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Therefore it is not protected by the constitution. 
It is not a constitutionalized third order of government. 
The Nisga'a treaty is not about that. 
It is primarily a self-government arrangement. 
The concept of it has been around for about two decades now. 
This was not an aboriginal-non-aboriginal divergence of views. 
This was a man who was leader of the Liberal Party for almost two decades. 
The government does not get it. 
It immediately adopted an inherent right policy. 
It was in its red book. 
We never got an answer. 
I want to get into some of the specifics. 
I quote Chief Justice Rinfret: 
Chief Justice Kerwin further wrote: 
The federal government did not consult Canadians on this matter. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
In fact they made financial contributions to the latest general assembly of the Nisga'a. 
Has he listened to those people? 
Mr. Speaker, the minister asks if I have talked to the Nisga'a people. 
Yes, I have talked to the Nisga'a people on many occasions. 
As a matter of fact I am talking to them all the time.  
I would point something out for the minister's benefit. 
The minister also asked about the support of the mayor of Terrace. 
That is hardly a surprise.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Responsible government is a term that has been used throughout our nation's history. 
These are very serious consequences that require explanation. 
Tell us a name and the members across the way call us it. 
-the feds habitually describe aboriginal peoples as ``nations''. 
I have always refrained from using the term first nations for a couple of reasons. 
Canadians are tired of it. 
Based on the information they have received, the majority are against the treaty.  
These results tell me a few things:
The federal Liberals have shamefully used it 53 times since coming to power in 1993. 
Is that not simply responsible? 
What could be more reasonable?  
Lastly, I would like to move an amendment to our motion. 
That the motion be amended by inserting before the word ``urges'', the word ``strongly''.  
The amendment is in order. 
Debate is on the amendment.  
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
I have two questions for my colleague. 
There were a number of mini referendums conducted in different municipalities. 
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is the truth.  
That is why I stand here and speak out against it.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
They want to understand the treaty process and why we are engaged in that. 
Treaties have long been part of the history of Canada. 
Fortunately chiefs and aboriginal people felt the same way. 
Treaties have been written in Canada since that time.  
In writing treaties we are not changing the constitution. 
We are giving modern life to section 35 of the constitution. 
Why are we taking this approach? 
What is it all about? 
It is not and it needs to be changed.  
We should get rid of it.  
Believe me, no one understands the Indian Act. 
It is wrong and we can do better. 
The Nisga'a treaty gives us an opportunity to do just that.  
Let us turn to the Nisga'a treaty. 
What is in the treaty? 
Their corporations will be paying corporate tax. 
They will have authority to manage their resources such as timber, fisheries and wildlife. 
It is set out in the treaty clearly. 
People can read it and understand the relationship.  
When we talk about governance, it is set out in the treaty. 
Fundamentally there are three categories of jurisdiction. 
Let us understand them.  
There is nothing to worry about. 
This is tremendously important to understand. 
The treaty sets that out. 
It makes it clear and it moves us ahead.  
We have worked very hard to negotiate this agreement. 
Public meetings have been held. 
They want to be part of Canada. 
This is not about leaving our great country. 
This is about being part of it.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not know where to begin. 
The minister makes a very nice emotional appeal. 
Is it not time that we resolved this? 
She is not answering the constitutional questions. 
She is not answering the charter questions. 
She only deals in the emotional appeal. 
That is all she is interested in.  
These are two very important issues. 
We have been to the courts on a number of occasions. 
They have said to us ``Would you please take the responsibility and negotiate. 
That is exactly what we are doing. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, there are a couple of things I would like to say in response.  
However it seems to be absolutely impossible for it to present alternatives, united or otherwise.  
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Was the democratic process legal and legitimate? 
My comments will primarily focus on that.  
This process, which probably began in 1880, has been a long one. 
I think a few strokes of the paddle were still necessary.  
This was a courageous democratic course. 
These people have also been very peaceful. 
They have always wanted to reach that land through negotiation. 
The Calder decision, in 1973, brought about many changes. 
It was agreed that there were probably some aboriginal titles that should be recognized.  
I was able to see what an extraordinary person he is. 
Finally, in 1976 the federal government began the negotiation process. 
The agreement in principle was finally reached in 1996. 
At this point Joe Gosnell said ``Finally, the canoe has come in''. 
They really do not want this canoe to reach its destination.  
A referendum is to be held among the Nisga'a. 
For the Nisga'a, the job is over. 
British Columbia's requirement has also been fulfilled. 
The Reformers made a big issue over of it.  
There were several issues.  
Naturally, we cannot agree with such a motion.  
The motion also refers to delaying tactics. 
We are also opposed because we think this is a red herring. 
I urge the Reform Party to follow my lead. 
Nor do we agree that a constitutional amendment is required. 
A number of legal experts have commented on this. 
There is one I would like to cite, for the record. 
I am referring to Mr. Hogg, of York University, who says, and I quote: 
I agree with the Court.  
It is therefore very clear. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am not surprised that the Bloquistes are speaking against this motion. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
What the Nisga'a want in this treaty is to join. 
I reject his premise that the Nisga'a need to be liberated. 
That is not the point at all.  
Aboriginal peoples everywhere are seeking liberation and self-government. 
They want to get off the reserves. 
For me, and for Quebec, this is also a step towards liberation.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
It is an agenda about dividing people. 
It is an agenda about creating fear and uncertainty. 
It is an agenda that creates red herrings and smoke screens.  
The Reform Party does not want clarification of this treaty by the supreme court. 
They do not want clarification. 
I find that appalling. 
All of a sudden we have a double standard.  
There is not a word. 
They are out there campaigning and upholding that kind of direction. 
It is no wonder there is a very strong response to this motion. 
I thought, what does that mean?  
I would challenge the Reform Party to dispute that.  
What will this treaty do? 
Let us get the record straight.  
I thought that was a curious thing to be coming from the Reform Party. 
More than that, D.C. Haggard, President of I.W.A Canada, stated: 
I attended many of those meetings.  
That comes from the labour movement itself.  
We have to be very clear about this motion today. 
If they get their way, what would happen? 
This is what we would have if we followed their agenda. 
We would have more economic uncertainty. 
They have to be joking. 
I urge the House to soundly reject this motion. 
Let us move forward and let us reject this motion.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
However, I want to ask one specific question. 
Which other municipality has the ability to extend taxation without representation?  
Mr. Speaker, I am glad that the member was restrained. 
I think that is something that the Reform Party is well known for, being restrained. 
Reform members are full of restraint.  
We are all intelligent people. 
I would again assert that the Reform Party has a different agenda.  
They are within the context of the constitution. 
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
I know that the member has spoken well. 
There are many members of parliament from British Columbia who support this deal.  
We have listened to this for some time. 
The member from Winnipeg made that point. 
Reform members have an opportunity to be at the table.  
They play on that uncertainty and fear which divides people. 
They play on peoples' emotions and set people against each other. 
We have to stand up and say that we will not tolerate it.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
All debate is legitimate. 
I am hoping to have the opportunity to meet with all members in the area.  
Moreover, it recognizes their inherent right to self-government.  
The PC Party supports initiatives that advance these objectives. 
This problem is obviously contentious and has been generating significant amounts of attention.  
On the other hand, the Musqueam park tenants are now faced with significant financial obligations. 
Is this a double standard? 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Does the hon. member agree with those comments?  
Mr. Speaker, I will answer the second question first. 
I would agree that both questions are good questions. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his concise answer. 
I think it is much more complicated than that. 
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
These terrible situations are symptoms of a much larger problem.  
Unfortunately that is not so in many cases across the country. 
Rank and file aboriginal people have not had that opportunity.  
We are not just talking about the people on reserve. 
She must help them.  
Money is not the cure. 
Political independence is not the cure. 
The Nisga'a deal is not the cure. 
At the end of the day, we must work together to build a stronger society. 
Separated we will sink; together we will survive and do well. 
That is not good and it needs to change.  
We hope that the government looks at this deal again. 
We hope it does not pass the Nisga'a deal. 
We hope it invests in aboriginal people. 
We hope it listens to the grassroots aboriginal people and not necessarily to their leadership. 
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for his comments. 
I know he has spoken on these issues before.  
I would like some clarification. 
Could he perhaps clarify for the House precisely what he meant by that?  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. parliamentary secretary for his questions. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
The province has the right to take the powers away. 
This is not the case in this situation.  
Those are the two clearest examples.  
The bottom line is not the pursuit of political independence. 
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Now some analysts are forecasting costs to exceed $20 billion.  
Native Indians have the worst statistics in the country. 
In the past, I offered some specific recommendations to both senior governments. 
The second point is finality. 
I will now talk about some specifics regarding the Nisga'a government. 
If Lucien Bouchard was offered all this, would he say, ``No thanks?'' 
This is a classic case of taxation without representation. 
It is racially based taxation.  
Would Jacques Parizeau not love to have that? 
Why would anyone want to perpetuate this difference constitutionally? 
A Nisga'a committee will review bloodlines to protect prospective citizens. 
Incredibly this is what we are entrenching in our constitution.  
There must be a better way.  
What would I do? 
I will summarize it this way. 
Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific), Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I have one question for the Reform Party. 
This is what this Nisga'a treaty is all about.  
We are quite aware of that. 
No one would argue the case.  
We are aware of the judgments that have occurred in the supreme court. 
It is a municipal style government. 
I have no difficulty at all in endorsing the Sechelt agreement. 
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
He can respond privately to me later if he likes.  
It is based on citizenry. 
Anyone can become a citizen of the Nisga'a place.  
Perhaps they are correct.  
Because they are racist.  
Madam Speaker, paragraph 11 of his lordship's decision affirms that the constitutional- 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Clearly the member from Coquitlam, in speaking out of turn was- 
Madam Speaker, that language is clearly unparliamentary. 
I would ask the Chair to ask the member to apologize.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I ask the member to withdraw his remarks.  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on the same question of privilege.  
The debate has been heated throughout the day. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
This is the last point of order on this. 
The hon. member for Langley-Abbotsford.  
Madam Speaker, let me put this into perspective.  
I think one of the ministers just said we say it. 
The fact is we do not say it. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Chair has already ruled on that. 
Mr. Richard M. Harris:
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The member from Port Coquitlam was not in his place. 
He uttered the word racist on two occasions and continues to.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Madam Speaker, I withdraw my comments.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Now we can proceed.  
Madam Speaker, thank you for your ruling. 
I do appreciate it. 
Mr. Richard M. Harris:
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
That word was used in the House. 
However I would prefer, if I may, to proceed with my comments.  
I know that he has to clarify that in the House and I appreciate that.  
They agree and we all agree.  
It is the House of Commons where we intend to do that. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
It is another level of government. 
I want to ask the question that the aboriginal people in my area ask me. 
I assure the hon. member those guarantees and protections will be there.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Do not the Gitksan and Gitanyow count? 
I am outraged by these reprehensible actions. 
This is an oddity, indeed.  
Those boundaries are protected within the Nisga'a area. 
They are not disputing them. 
They want to sit down and reasonably negotiate. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a question of privilege. 
They are very much my constituents.  
I do represent these people.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
We recognize the Nisga'a treaty rests on its own special historical facts. 
All the other treaties will have a similar factual record.  
They are provisions that preserve aboriginal rights such as they are. 
Let me make some comments on judicial review. 
I would not reproach that to anyone.  
Let me simply say that judicial review and judicial activism do not exist in isolation. 
We have reached the situation of how and when native rights are defined. 
It is not expected that the treaties are the last word. 
This will be done in the treaty making process.  
The law is not frozen once and for all, for all time. 
We have gone beyond provincial-federal constitutional compartment theories. 
However we do not do that in abstract. 
We do it in concrete cases. 
The case controversy is crucial.  
We have laboured with the Senate and others. 
Some things were left out, for example the status of native women. 
I would suggest to the members of the opposition that the motion is premature. 
Let it do its work. 
I invite all members of the House to co-operate in that process. 
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a very quick question for the member. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
My question is exactly the same as my colleague's. 
What is the difference between those two things?  
What Quebec may or may not propose is another matter. 
The Prime Minister has made his views very clear on that.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
By any definition that is a country. 
Mr. Speaker, once again we are using coloured language, coloured words. 
The difference is as between night and day in the two situations.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to be debating this issue today. 
What kind of votes did I get?  
The member for Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam is trying to harass me. 
Can hon. members imagine that? 
Boy, am I ever afraid of this fellow.  
You are talking about 38%. 
Did you not get 6% in Windsor-St. 
The feeling is mutual.  
We love you, Randy.  
I want folks who are watching on television to listen to this. 
Out of 156 members of the Liberal government, there are five sitting in the House.  
He is well aware of that. 
Mr. Speaker, I apologize. 
Here is what Richardson found on the analysis. 
Somebody might say that R. M. Richardson and Associates are wrong. 
How far wrong are they? 
Are they wrong by $1 billion? 
It does not matter to them. 
However, there is going to be a good dog fight in the next federal election. 
Perhaps there is something wrong and we should check it out.  
We should reassess the situation. 
It should not be reassessed by government or government employees. 
Let somebody else do the job. 
That is what we did. 
It was a fair assessment. 
There was no political ploy.  
I call on the government to listen to what we are saying. 
What about the Nisga'a highway? 
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
If he is an accountant, could he answer that?  
Mr. Speaker, let me clarify a couple of things.  
A parliamentary secretary in the House does what he is told on the government side. 
I am trying to address something very specific.  
It is a lot of money to the Canadian taxpayer.  
They should not just assess and take the word of the auditor general.  
The government should commission a number of organizations. 
We have managed to get this thing deferred until the fall. 
There is a lot at stake here. 
The government has time. 
Why not do it?  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Can the member for Langley-Abbotsford comment on that?  
There is no access.  
Just because it is remote, it does not mean there is less value to it. 
It probably means that there is greater potential value to it.  
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
There are so few, we would hardly even notice.  
That is the whole entire point.  
I attended a conference just last week on the Delgamuukw decision. 
We are asking if it constitutes an amendment to the Constitution? 
We want to know what it does does to individual rights? 
That is not so terribly much. 
It is about the bare minimum that should be available to people.  
Just recently, section 77(1) of the Indian Act was struck down. 
It was the department of Indian affairs. 
It was a denial of democracy.  
Mobility rights were denied by that section. 
The Liberal government is responsible.  
Liberals may feel their motives are above question. 
They may feel that their integrity in the process was above question. 
I think that is very important. 
However, I would like to take issue with that statement.  
These were people for whom land as such would have no value. 
We do not see landscapes in their paintings. 
I think that demonstrates a point. 
The important thing was use.  
It was a different type of society. 
To say that a collectivist approach works there speaks against the reality of the day.  
That was certainly an important and necessary action the Canadian government took.  
The House should refuse to deal with this treaty. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Thankfully not all members of the Reform Party agree with this.  
We also heard Herb Grubel a former MP counter this. 
That is what I would like to comment on. 
The situation in aboriginal communities is a predictable consequence of colonialism. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his intervention.  
There is no disagreement on facts. 
Anybody who has been on a reserve would not disagree with the facts. 
Anybody with eyes can see that things are terrible on reserves. 
Nobody has any question about that. 
They have done very well but they are not living on reserves. 
Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific), Lib.):
This is a treaty not based on race but based on rights.  
To me, it is the right thing to do. 
It is a balanced treaty. 
That is the merit of negotiation. 
We have to come to a balance.  
I support this treaty. 
The second thing I want to address is the legality of the agreement. 
It has tried to challenge this. 
It has joined the B.C. Liberal Party to challenge this issue.  
Members of the Reform Party always talk about the rule of law. 
They believe in the rule of law. 
They believe in the constitution. 
They believe in the rule of law, they believe in the supreme court. 
This is why they want to refer this issue to the supreme court. 
Very often they pick and choose what the supreme court decides. 
They pick and choose what the constitution specifies.  
Let us talk about aboriginal rights. 
They are specified in the constitution. 
Reform Party members say we should treat everybody the same. 
Then what about these aboriginal rights that are different for aboriginals? 
How can they say both at the same time? 
They are not the same. 
Aboriginal people have aboriginal rights. 
That is what the constitution says. 
It is going to be expensive; it has been proven to be expensive. 
This is the right thing to do. 
We have to move forward. 
The labour law of the province and of Canada would apply.  
I urge all members of this House to support the Nisga'a treaty.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Will it require a more rigorous and more lengthy process to amend the treaty?  
The issue of constitutionality does not exist.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not believe the hon. member answered the question. 
The constitution specifies the rights of different peoples. 
We do not need to amend it. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, that was how the treaty was negotiated. 
It was agreed by all parties. 
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
The signing of treaties is an opportunity for a fresh start. 
Recognizing the inherent right of self-government:
They could assist aboriginal people to identify the skills required. 
Aboriginal women and self-government:
Programs will require the inclusion of aboriginal women at all stages.  
Professional development in land, environment and resource management:
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for his question.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Paragraph 40 again refers to in the event of inconsistency.  
I could go on. 
Could the hon. member tell me what this means?  
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
This is an advantage and a plus for the Nisga'a. 
This is very important. 
We on this side of the House believe in them.  
With the agreement of members we will proceed to Statement by Members. 
It might give us a couple of extra statements today.  
KINGSTON COMMUNITY CREDIT UNION 
Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and Addington, Lib.):
Bravo to the Kingston Community Credit Union, an exemplary financial institution.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
This is clearly wrong.  
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
About one Canadian in three will be diagnosed with cancer during his or her life. 
On this celebration of hope, tune in. 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
As it turns out, the foe was not quite as formidable as we thought. 
In that case perhaps next time I will be the referee.  
Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Middlesex, Lib.):
This means every Canadian over the age of 18.  
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
The Bloc Quebecois members have every sympathy for the people of southwestern Manitoba. 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
We welcome progress toward a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Yugoslavia.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
In particular, they are fearful of the Nisga'a treaty. 
One law and one Canada. 
This should be our motto.  
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
Bernard Landry certainly learned nothing from the last Quebec referendum. 
More studies paid for out of the public purse.  
Twice now Quebecers have expressed their desire to stay in Canada. 
How many studies does the Parti Quebecois need before it gets get the message?  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Too many good jobs have gone south. 
Mr. Mulroney is measuring the wrong things. 
We will be judged on our willingness to co-operate and look after each other.  
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):
Today the bar represents approximately 18,000 lawyers, of which 40% are women. 
There are some very prestigious lawyers in Quebec. 
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
He has cut taxes. 
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
There are some frightening and constitutionally questionable aspects to this treaty. 
The Nisga'a creates a new level of government, the Nisga'a national government. 
Now the federal government is looking for a rubber stamp.  
LIBERAL PARTY OF CANADA 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Freedom to participate sits much better.  
The hon. member for Churchill River.  
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):

Member spoke in Cree ] 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We hope now that everything will proceed very swiftly.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We have already committed 800 people who have been moving there. 
Some are already there and the rest will go there. 
As it is going to be a peacekeeping operation we will inform the House. 
Happily there are no ground troops going there to fight. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, here is why controversy is swirling around the Prime Minister. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have to tell the hon. member the news from Shawinigan. 
What a very nice twist. 
I have never had better campaigners for my election than the Reform Party.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Go directly to the question please.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
That is why care must be taken not to move faster than necessary. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I am sorry to interrupt the Right Hon. Prime Minister. 
The hon. member for Beauharnois-Salaberry.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
This is an extremely significant event.  
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has used the word accused. 
He is an accused person. 
We want to be sure he respects this commitment. 
That is why we are still being cautious. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is a matter certainly upon which my colleague can respond.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
We cannot now, in any way, leave them without food or shelter. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
There will be a meeting of the ministers of foreign affairs to discuss it. 
We have accepted refugees. 
Canadians will be there, as we have always been in those circumstances.  
STANDING COMMITTEE ON INDUSTRY 
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not know why they are debating this. 
He has to put his assets in the hands of a trustee. 
He has been informed of every operation. 
I do not know why they are insisting. 
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Debbie Weinstein is appointed and governed by this code. 
I find that question to be out of order.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I keep saying the same thing. 
I have followed all the rules for 36 years.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Ownership was never transferred for those shares. 
The Right Hon. Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I sold my shares before I became Prime Minister. 
I know that the people of Canada do not buy it.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
We will comply with the law in Quebec. 
The hon. member for Mercier.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, the option they prefer is to withdraw.  
I defy the Bloc- 
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Can he not see that?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The hon. member for Calgary-Nose Hill.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I sold the shares in November 1993. That is the end of it.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
This agreement reflected British Columbia's concerns.  
My question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
Mr. Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois is not up to speed.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Who is the minister defending: the provinces or the U.S. government?  
Mr. Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois is not up to speed. 
All these issues have been debated and discussed. 
I do not know where it was when this was going on.  
The agreement it thinks it has discovered was signed by officials. 
It was not an agreement between governments.  
The hon. member for Skeena. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
The Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development is aware of this. 
As a matter of fact she has been aware of it for over a year. 
She promised to help. 
I will permit the question because they work directly with the minister.  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Absolutely not, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
They had no trouble supporting him.  
Or is it just going to throw Wing Construction to the wolves?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
That partnership has dissolved.  
There are outstanding issues. 
I would encourage both parties to work together in that regard.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam, Lib.):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
The hon. member for Langley-Abbotsford.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, he should get a life over there. 
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
The hon. member for Vancouver East.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
There has been no action, no plan, no dollars.  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
It is a federal, provincial and municipal problem and we have to work together. 
The member should wait for the report.  
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let me first correct one major word. 
The deal does not divide the communities, it brings the communities together. 
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
Mr. Speaker, let me ask the minister:
Is there a conservation fund in the agreement?  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The hon. member for Kootenay-Columbia.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this happens to be an internal matter of the RCMP. 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Cote-de-Beaupre-Ile-d'Orleans, BQ):
The member for Beauce was in attendance and reported to me.  
The hon. member for Regina-Lumsden-Lake Center.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
However, Mr. Prince denies ownership of the shares and so does the Prime Minister.  
Canadians want to get to the bottom of this.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not have any shares. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Can the Minister of Finance tell Canadians how much the subsidy will cost? 
If he cannot, how can the government responsibly enter into an agreement?  
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the discussions about the adjustment package are ongoing. 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
I believe that is a direct violation of the rules. 
I want to quote from the article. 
The member for Vaudreuil-Soulanges said: 
I believe my privilege has been violated.  
I am not cutting the member off. 
He has a serious point. 
However, the hon. member for Vaudreuil-Soulanges is not here with us today. 
The second question of privilege will not be brought up.  
I am not going to take it any further. 
I am addressing myself to the hon. member for Mississauga South. 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
I would like to ask the hon. member one skill testing question on history. 
He might reflect on that historic question.  
We were anticipating going until about June 18 or 21. 
I would like to ask him if it will continue.  
I want to congratulate the hon. member too. 
I think it is a wonderful feat and a good example for all Canadians.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
There will be another Liberal government re-elected a third time. 
I will start with the business for the next week.  
I understand that these bills may proceed rather rapidly. 
Monday and Tuesday shall be allotted days. 
Let me give the following outline to colleagues.  
We will then consider Bill C-54. 
Hopefully we can arrive at a consensus on that.  
This could take us to Friday of next week.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Will there also be legislation coming in with respect to water exports? 
This is something else that was promised by the government.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member for Winnipeg-Transcona is on a point of order. 
We will finish with this one and then get back to the hon. member. 
The hon. government House leader.  
All members will recognize that. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Last time I noticed that there was another Thursday question asked. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, it certainly is on the agenda. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
This was an issue that was brought before committee yesterday. 
Is that going to inspire the government to move on this very important issue?  
Madam Speaker, procedure before committee is just that.  
I would like to ask for unanimous consent to send the bill to committee.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I hope you did not miss the point. 
My colleagues are ready to ask questions. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Today we have made a few exceptions. 
ALLOTTED DAY-NISGA'A TREATY 
The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the amendment.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
There are a good number of aboriginal communities. 
We are not talking about 60 treaty agreements, we are talking about many more.  
People can say it is just the non-aboriginal people who are concerned. 
No, it is not. 
How can we possibly ratify this agreement with those four cases before the courts?  
I would suggest that the reason is quite simple. 
It was never done by forming another level of government. 
I refer to the Musqueam Band and the Semiahmoo Band. 
The Musqueam Band has raised rents extraordinarily, out of reason. 
It now has no value at all.  
There are too many questions left unanswered in this final Nisga'a agreement. 
Nobody can predict what the courts' reaction and decisions will be.  
We cannot ratify this agreement. 
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
The answer to her comments and concerns is no.  
It therefore follows that there is no need for a constitutional amendment. 
Again we point out the contradictions of the Reform Party. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member across the way for some of his comments. 
I honour their suggestions and their directions.  
That is not so. 
It will take the agreement of all three parties for any changes to be made. 
If it is there it means something. 
If it does not mean anything then it should not be there.  
They want to know exactly what it means. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
I am quite shocked at the level of debate from these two parties in particular.  
Yet that is what the agreement will do in several ways if it goes ahead.  
I am also concerned about that.  
From those people I obtained nine recommendations. 
I will start by explaining a little about the process very quickly. 
It was a three stage process. 
About 70 aboriginal people attended one of the public meetings in St. Paul. 
We had an excellent discussion on some key issues.  
The first recommendation is in the area of financial accountability. 
The first recommendation has not been dealt with in the agreement.  
This was stated by George Forsyth, the administrator of the Onion Lake Band. 
Does the Nisga'a agreement deal with this? 
That is a problem. 
A budget would actually be approved in advance. 
There is nothing to ensure that in this agreement that will be dealt with.  
The recommendation is getting at something that was heard from participants quite often. 
The fifth area of accountability was in terms of having fair elections. 
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the concerns expressed by my colleague opposite. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
Things will not be made better as a result of the Nisga'a agreement.  
I fully agree with the member. 
I do not see any indication that this agreement will ensure that at all.  
Mr. David Iftody (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
There are those guarantees and the member is wrong.  
However, I would ask him to come up to the Nass Valley. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit:
Madam Speaker, I would really love to do that. 
I have been on reserves. 
I know the conditions. 
Things are not going well on their reserves. 
The leadership is not accountable. 
The money is not getting to the people for whom it is intended. 
That is a concern I have. 
The answer is very short. 
This was from Mr. Gosnell himself. 
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
A relationship built on trust, mutual respect and reconciliation. 
A relationship that acknowledges the mistakes and makes amends for past wrongs. 
That ultimately is what the Nisga'a final agreement is all about. 
It is a crucial step on the path to a better future.  
Those rights have been confirmed again and again by the courts.  
The key word here is fair. 
Everyone will continue to be subject to the Criminal Code of Canada. 
It reconciles modern Canadian realities with the traditional aspirations of the Nisga'a people alone.  
The days of discussion and negotiation are over. 
Therefore I urge the House to vote against the motion.  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
There was one instance that particularly peaked my curiosity. 
Could the hon. member define the word all or the word everyone in this instance? 
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell:
We have concluded our land claims agreement. 
The land claims agreement is for specific Nunavut beneficiaries.  
It depends on area. 
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell:
The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms applies to every Canadian.  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Was the hon. member aware of that fact?  
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell:
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
I hope some of my remarks will complement what she has said.  
The other founding people were the aboriginals. 
That special place as reflected in the constitution has to do with territory. 
I submit that is very wrong and it is also very costly. 
It is ultimately the right way to go.  
Many of the C-31ers are university educated and have jobs. 
I see I am out of time. 
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
It has created quite a mess.  
However, let us go on to the Nisga'a agreement. 
Part of what the member said pertains to some of this. 
Madam Speaker, I am not sure exactly what the question is.  
The real fault is with these other bits of legislation like Bill C-31. 
I think it really needs to be revisited.  
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and Youth), Lib.):
I think they deserve a great deal of respect and gratitude.  
It is a very complicated process. 
We could have 13 categories of Indian people under different pieces of statutes and legislation. 
The system was a man made designed. 
However, we do not know that. 
I do not know that, because I have processed many applications.  
I was adopted when I was nine years old. 
I lost my status. 
My grandfather signed treaty 11 as a chief. 
It took me a long time to get my status back.  
There are many people out there. 
It is just a technical issue. 
For that very simple fact, what happens to those people?  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
The Nisga'a people have not had a treaty. 
It is good that they do have a treaty. 
They have negotiated for many years and they have negotiated well. 
That is not clear right now. 
The first issue is about democracy and the business of accountability. 
I am going to put democracy or democratic accountability close together. 
It seems to me that there are four characteristics of a democracy.  
This is a very interesting concept.  
The other part of that is that we are equal. 
Madam Speaker, you and I are different. 
I think that is desirable.  
I want to quote an analysis that was done by Gordon Gibson. 
I want to get into some detail here: 
The Nisga'a state will control so many things. 
Is this in any way an aspersion on the Nisga'a? 
Sometimes that is not the case, but usually it is.  
It works both ways. 
So much for democratic accountability. 
I have just touched the surface on the whole question of democracy.  
I want to briefly discuss the issue of citizenship. 
Voting is on that basis. 
Only Nisga'a citizens may vote. 
It is a birth right which allows them to vote under this treaty. 
That does not exist anywhere else in Canada. 
That is a fundamental principle.  
Both of these groups have the right to vote. 
In effect it creates two classes of Nisga'a citizens.  
That is not all it does. 
We should not create separate citizenship questions.  
This is just the beginning. 
I encourage the House to give very serious debate to these issues. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Carol Off is a credible journalist with the CBC. 
I did not say that in my opening remarks.  
We have freedom in this country; freedom to speak and freedom to associate. 
I was speaking very personally. 
I have no intentions of becoming associated with that movement. 
We want that as much as anyone else.  
This is the deep concern that I have. 
I extend that to my hon. colleague as well.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
We were in for something of a surprise. 
We were informed that there were certain issues that we could not discuss or question. 
We were told that it was politically incorrect.  
Politically incorrect or not, we were determined to create positive change. 
I will reflect for a moment on comments made by my colleague who preceded me. 
That was desperately unfortunate. 
There were many issues that required and continue to require open, honest and candid dialogue. 
Finally, I agreed to hold a town hall meeting last November. 
None of them chose to attend. 
There were aboriginal residents from all five bands in the constituency who attended. 
It will not allow the voices of British Columbians to be heard. 
The Nisga'a had a referendum. 
First let me make a couple of points on the topic of self-government. 
I support the goal of aboriginal self-government as I previously stated. 
Yes, but they can be worked out. 
The parliamentary secretary says that is not true. 
It is the only reasonable and responsible thing to do.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and Youth), Lib.):
We are not from the same party. 
I believe the Nisga'a agreement is something Canada should embrace. 
They are only getting 10% of the land they asked for. 
That is only 10% of their traditional territory. 
The Nisga'a have ceded much.  
It has not just been an agreement that was struck overnight. 
They will not be here because it is not complete. 
Is it a democracy that just comes from western based civilization? 
Is it a democracy that is just Eurocentric and ethnocentric? 
Maybe the traditional laws have something to say about that. 
Why are members afraid that the Nisga'a might succeed? 
The Nisga'a can be fair, judicious, generous, sharing and giving like they have been. 
Many millionaires were created off their territory. 
Very few of them- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sorry but I have to interrupt.  
It is an interface of these two things.  
We do not have a solution.  
There is no solution as long as there is no broad popular support. 
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, people have asked about financial accountability. 
Those are the facts.  
There are many merits to this treaty.  
Theirs was a sophisticated society. 
Through the millennia the arrival of the Europeans put and end to that lifestyle. 
They were prevented from publicly practising their religious beliefs. 
Their children were sent to distant residential schools. 
They lost their language and their culture.  
Finally we have put that system in order. 
We have put things right for the Nisga'a first nation.  
The constitution is the highest law of this land. 
We can learn from these people.  
They have made it clear that these rights have real meaning and must be upheld.  
This has been a long time in coming. 
This relationship is built on trust, on recognition, on respect and on responsibility. 
It is a relationship that demonstrates the mutual benefits of sharing. 
The key components of the treaty demonstrate these clear benefits.  
The Nisga'a treaty is the first of its kind in Canada. 
It covers a land claim and self-government in one single package. 
It establishes a full and final settlement of all outstanding Nisga'a claims. 
These funds will stimulate the local economy and spur economic development. 
Jobs will be created. 
For all the right reasons we will finally do the right thing. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to the member's intervention. 
Does she think it is in line with the rest of government in Canada?  
It is the member who has talked out of both sides of his mouth.  
He asks what our policy is with regard to aboriginal people. 
I ask the member opposite what is his policy with regard to aboriginal people. 
Members of the Reform have never been clear. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
And the hon. member will not be levelling them through the back door either.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
I thank her for pointing out some amazing facts that we should keep in mind.  
I took part in the Charlottetown aboriginal hearings. 
Everybody shook their heads and said that was terrible. 
Then she said that the men were not allowed to vote. 
That is just one example.  
As a point of clarification, I have a question for the hon. member. 
Could the hon. member clarify some of those things for the House?  
Mr. Speaker, all but a few of us are immigrants to this land. 
His respect for human rights comes through loud and clear.  
Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member spoke at some length about fiscal accountability. 
I would ask the hon. member a very simple question. 
Perhaps a whole attitude adjustment would be appropriate. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Is there something happening today that I am not aware of? 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
That seems like a very good idea. 
We will start all over again.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The party received very few votes.  
One is named Jean-Marc Lalonde and the other Alain Lalonde. 
As hon. members are aware, illiterate people have trouble voting. 
There are many services for the disabled in Quebec and in Canada. 
Like us, those who are illiterate are entitled to vote. 
The Government of Canada must give them an opportunity to do so. 
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
In countries where there is a high degree of illiteracy it would make sense. 
Canada is not a third world country. 
Will there be a similarity test? 
He did not indicate that. 
Surely the picture would only add to the confusion.  
The other valid factor is sociological. 
What would happen in that case? 
Publishing their picture in that case could be detrimental to their electoral chances.  
We are all very much aware of that. 
I do not know if the hon. member would agree with that line of thought. 
It would only add to his chances of not getting elected. 
Simply put, I do not see any pressing need for this change. 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
I must admit there is great uncertainty with the bill. 
That differentiates one candidate from another.  
We are asking for people to take advantage of that situation. 
It was done for a reason. 
What constitutes a picture of the candidate? 
I do not see the reason for it. 
Another issue should be considered. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
We believe, however, that there is a problem here. 
They deserve all our support, for this is not an easy undertaking, we know.  
Obviously, this is a principle we would be able to apply to many institutions.  
You know that the National Assembly was the first parliament in North America.  
I therefore invite him to consider expanding the scope of the bill. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
I think everybody here would agree that would be fundamentally wrong. 
My name is one that could be used for a male or female. 
Many people with the name Pat are from both genders.  
The members opposite are chuckling. 
They might vote that way. 
There are other things such as ethnic background. 
What about people with obvious physical disabilities? 
There are ways to tamper photographs to one's advantage. 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
This bill addresses a real problem in Canadian society. 
And yet, we have a real problem. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Madam Speaker, I did not mean to cast any aspersions. 
I want to assure him that he is a very good looking person. 
That is the first thing.  
The member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve is also good looking.  
Luckily, we have a system in which we have signage and billboards. 
It would have been very difficult. 
I had billboards all over my riding. 
I think that is in fact what we have. 
In my own riding, there is considerable socioeconomic diversity. 
The percentage of residents living on welfare is rather disturbing. 
I will come back to the point raised by the hon. NDP member. 
I think all the parties in this House should support this bill. 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
It is our view that, in its present form, Bill C-405 is totally unacceptable. 
I will make a motion to that effect at the end of my speech. 
For example, let us take my first name. 
For many anglophones, my name is a woman's name. 
There is no doubt that this is an interesting bill. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, this just goes to show that there is a complexity of problems. 
The questions that are raised here are quite important.  
We need to find a way to help them.  
The addition of photographs has been proposed by the hon. member for Verdun-Saint-Henri. 
Who knows how that would have affected all of our chances.  
The committee of this House did not arrive at a consensus.  
There is an absence of empirical studies. 
There are a number of questions that have not been answered. 
What would be the cost of the proposal? 
What would be its impact on the electoral calendar? 
Are there technical dimensions associated with its implementation?  
It would be a serious strain on the already very short timeframe.  
Elections Canada has not had a chance to answer these questions. 
We do not have that many parameters in Bill C-405. 
They can best identify the solutions. 
We need to have a bottom-up solution. 
More analysis needs to be done.  
On the issue of accessibility, all of us in the House support that. 
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my colleague's bill. 
But at the same time, this is precisely why we have House committees. 
It would only make sense.  
We do not know whether all illiterate people are reached through these organizations. 
How many people want to belong to these organizations in the first place? 
Witnesses have come to me personally at meetings.  
One day something clicked in her mind and she sought an association. 
She went to school at a very late age. 
She even tried to hide from her own children that she was illiterate.  
People like that do not venture forward. 
We have decided this for driver's licences. 
We do it for our passports. 
We do not use just any picture for our passports. 
It has to be stamped and certified.  
I do not think the cost would be outrageous. 
That is what he is asking. 
It is well worth our support. 
I strongly support the bill my colleague has brought forward. 
He can make amendments in committee. 
I have discussed with my colleague what he would like to do. 
He does not want to just accept piecemeal amendments at this stage. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Obviously there are a lot of concerns about the bill. 
I know we have had some speakers on the bill. 
We have had some obvious input. 
We certainly want to see it get to committee. 
The Liberals do much talking and introduce a lot of PR jobs. 
The Liberals have had five years to look at. 
Now they are talking about taking five to six years to implement it.  
That is the problem. 
It is a lack of money. 
It is not putting it there fast enough.  
There is very little being spent on young offenders.  
I do not think that is acceptable to most Canadians. 
We also are not spending any money on rehabilitation. 
This government will not do that because it does not want to spend the money.  
This country has a serious problem with crime, a serious problem with young children. 
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Let us include things like the national child tax benefit. 
In those cases the presumption is that publication bans could not apply.  
The government believes in an open justice system. 
However, we must remember that youth are more vulnerable than adults. 
Their chances for rehabilitation are greater.  
Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):
Is it working for criminals like Yvon Duhaime? 
Is it working for admitted fraud artists like Pierre Thibault? 
Is it working for Liberal Party financial donors like Claude Gauthier? 
Is it working for Saint-Maurice? 
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Let me set the record straight. 
This contract is between the Government of Mali and a Canadian company. 
It was awarded through an open competitive process. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
(The House adjourned at 6:32 p.m.)
