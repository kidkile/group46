Wednesday, November 24, 1999 
The Senate met at 1:30 p.m., the Speaker pro tempore in the Chair.  
I assume that all senators have received this notice. 
The Late Jeannine Seguin The Late Omer Deslauriers 
Hon. Jean-Robert Gauthier :
This year has seen the departure of two great defenders of the Ontario francophone community.  
In the spring, we lost Omer Deslauriers. 
We mourn today two people who have left their mark on our community.  
Tenth Anniversary of Pledge to Eradicate Child Poverty 
Hon. Erminie J. Cohen :
Approximately 460,000 more children are in desperate need. 
Our efforts to eradicate child poverty have been deplorable.  
Poor children awaken every morning to face the same bleak reality. 
They are robbed of a carefree childhood. 
The rate of poverty in Canada is almost a scandal.  
Deficits were eliminated at the expense of social programs. 
They deserve much better. 
We owe it to them and we owe it to Canada.

Committee Authorized to Meet DuringSitting of the Senate 
Hon. Leo E. Kolber :
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
If we are to do our job, we believe we should start our study quickly.  
It puts us and the witnesses in an embarrassing position. 
The work of senators is primarily to be in this chamber. 
We also have a responsibility to get the work done. 
There are few days left in which to do that work. 
For the most part, these witnesses are well-known experts in their field.  
Honourable senators, I am in your hands. 
If he does not wish us to do our work, so be it. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Energy, the Environment and Natural Resources 
Notice of Motion to Authorize Committee to Study Matters Related to Mandate 
Honourable senators, I give notice that tomorrow, Thursday, November 25, 1999, I will move: 
That the Committee report to the Senate no later than March 31, 2000.  
Notice of Motion to Authorize Committeeto Engage Services and Travel 
Honourable senators, I give notice that tomorrow, Thursday, November 25, 1999, I will move: 
Honourable senators, I give notice that tomorrow, Thursday, November 25, 1999, I will move: 
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
In part, we discussed appropriations to the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I would appreciate that very much.  
We have asked officials from the Treasury Board for a response in that regard. 
That makes a real nice residence.  
Cost of Gun Registration Program-Responsibility of Minister 
Even I was shocked at the amount, which was $309 million.  
The figure is now $309 million, with no end in sight. 
Why does he not accept that responsibility, then?  
I realize that difficulties have been identified with respect to the registration process.  
They were identified three years ago.  
Three quarters of all of the recommended service improvements have been implemented. 
We are now seeing an increased efficiency in the processing of applications.  
Honourable senators, this is what always happens. 
The officials said it is the minister. 
If he does not resign, he says, "I am not responsible." 
That is possible, too. 
Why has he not resigned? 
If he is not responsible, who in the bureaucracy is responsible? 
Honourable senators, I have a supplementary question. 
Surely, the government now has an idea of what the overall cost will be. 
Will it be $600 million, $800 million, $1 billion? 
Could you not tell this chamber the final estimated costs?  
Quebec-Possible Conditions of Referendum- Impact of Government Initiative 
Hon. Jean-Claude Rivest :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I do not know how the Canadian government perceives his initiative. 
There is much being said about a clear question. 
They must not be given arguments to the contrary.  
Jean Charest and the Quebec Liberal Party would not really know which side to take. 
I hope that this unfortunate incident will be forgotten by January or February 2000.  
His view with respect to referenda and separation is beyond question.  
On that fundamental issue, there is no disagreement.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton , Leader of the Opposition:
We have received mixed signals. 
The word "clarity" comes up repeatedly. 
In the final analysis, who will determine which question meets the test of clarity? 
Will it be the Government of Canada or the National Assembly of Quebec? 
Three answers were given, "No, no, no." 
In my opinion, that, sadly, gave legitimacy to the separation process. 
I believe that that went beyond the mandate of the Supreme Court.  
What is the question that the Government of Canada believes should be asked of Quebecers?  
It is hoped that such a process will never arise. 
Purchase of Major Companies by United States Firms-Government Policy 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Last year, the government turned down the proposed merger of Canada's leading banks. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
There has been a corresponding flow of substantial investment by Canadians into American firms. 
Investment flows both ways across the border. 
Other sectors of our economy would be very glad to have investment from any source. 
Will the Leader of the Government initiate such a debate?  
How does the government intend to proceed? 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, it is clear that some action is being seriously contemplated by the government. 
I can add no more to what the Prime Minister said.  
Quebec-Possible Conditions of Referendum- Involvement of Other Provinces 
Honourable senators, my second question concerns what the minister referred to as the "ongoing discussions". 
Specifically, I should like to know whether these ongoing discussions involve the provinces. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, the 30-minute Question Period is now over. 
Is leave granted to continue?  
1994 White Paper-Government Policy 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Replacement of Sea King Helicopters 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, I should like to ask a general question, then, of the minister. 
Has there been any policy change? 
I am concerned about helicopters.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Certainly, it is an initiative that I support and encourage. 
You tell us that it is a priority. 
Why will the minister not make a decision? 
Is it because there has been a change in defence policy? 
An office has been set up to deal with the matter. 
What is the answer?  
Honourable senators, I appreciate the concern of the honourable senator on this issue.  
No, I do not think you do.  
The Sea King's life expectancy ends in 2005. 
There are a number of options. 
Will they borrow some helicopters from the United States navy? 
Hopefully, the matter will be brought forward as quickly as possible. 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
At that time, I was not able to pursue the matter any further. 
However, I am offended by that excuse. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I have a final supplementary question. 
I do hope that the minister will look at this issue seriously. 
I regard it as the most beautiful city in the world.  
What is wrong with Ottawa?  
Have you found the pews yet, minister?  
Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I rise to speak to Bill C-6. 
Then, if other honourable senators wish to comment on what I will propose, fine. 
If deemed appropriate, leave can be obtained from honourable senators. 
This is how I would suggest we deal with this bill.  
It is not something that I expect to do often. 
I am not moving that motion at this time. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
That being said, I am not clear on one point. 
Did the deputy leader suggest a reporting date for the committee?  
That is what I was afraid I heard. 
This is always difficult.  
Honourable senators, others may wish to speak to this matter. 
The government is concerned about the progress of this legislative. 
Honourable senators, those are the parameters of the situation as I see them. 
The chairman or other members of the committee may wish to speak at this time.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Regional affinity is much stronger than party affinity in some cases.  
The reality is that many witnesses have asked to appear before the committee. 
We are happy to do either.  
That was the rationale behind my notice of motion.  
On balance, I am in agreement with Senator Murray. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
We are cognizant of the parliamentary timetable involving the other house. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
I do not know what we are trying to achieve here.  
Is this heading in the direction that the government intends it to?  
Honourable senators, perhaps I could answer that. 
There are technical aspects to this. 
We have a majority on this side, but you have tools on your side. 
It appears that it is going very well. 
I would hope that we could expect a motion. 
That committee would hear witnesses just as if the bill were before it. 
That committee would report to the Senate.  
Right, and there are precedents for that.  
No, they are not limited in that respect.  
It is all a facade, is that what you are saying?  
It is a procedural device.  
I do not know who is best served by it. 
I do not understand that part of the procedure.  
It is the same bill.  
I am not here to help the government. 
I am here simply to understand the procedure and to facilitate it.  
That is good enough for me, then.  
Honourable senators, from time to time, a bit of creativity is always helpful. 
The Honourable Senator Hays has attempted to contribute a bit to the creativity. 
Many opportunities lay before the committee. 
This is a creative way of dealing with the matter. 
Perhaps Senator Hays would now like to move his motion.  
Subject Matter Referred to Committee 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, notwithstanding rule 58(1)( e ), I move: 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Honourable senators, I wish to ask a question for the purpose of clarification. 
I have no intentions of holding up this matter. 
Does this require a unanimous vote or simply a majority vote?  
Honourable senators, "leave" anticipates unanimity. 
In effect, it requires unanimity.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
Social Affairs, Science and Technology 
Committee Authorized to Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, I rise to make a small point. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
I leave that with the government as a suggestion. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Income Tax Conventions Implementation Bill, 1999 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
He opened an interesting and important area of inquiry.  
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Honourable senators, I have a question for the honourable senator. 
He is focusing on one country. 
Honourable senators, I thank Senator Grafstein for that question. 
I reluctantly accept the doctrine of constructive engagement. 
In this particular instance, we have a specific tax treaty. 
It is a bilateral matter. 
We have chosen not to follow that model. 
We have assiduously chosen not to engage in linkage. 
I commend the honourable senator opposite for raising this matter. 
There must be a more thoughtful and broad-based policy. 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Honourable senators, I should like to add to what my colleague Senator Kinsella has said. 
I concur with him. 
Honourable senators, I believe we should look at this matter. 
That is another aspect that we should examine more closely.  
I do not feel that we never received answers to those questions.  
Hon. Lois M. Wilson :
Honourable senators, I am pleased that the Leader of the Opposition raised this issue. 
There seems to be an ad hoc manner of responding to these concerns. 
Sometimes sanctions are applied; sometimes constructive engagement. 
There may be different strategies for different countries.  
I am of the opinion that the Senate needs a forum to explore these issues. 
They must be explored, either here in full debate or in committee. 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Why would we maintain a treaty arrangement with that country? 
That is the place, I submit, for those questions to be put.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
That bill dealt with Vietnam, Croatia and Chile. 
It was also referred to the Senate Banking Committee. 
It is not a bill received from the House of Commons. 
We have some extra flexibility in that regard. 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Honourable senators in this chamber all understand the task. 
Either committee could do the job and respond to the questions we have raised.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
I learned about the debate over the past few days.  
That is a principle with which our Foreign Affairs Committee has been seized. 
I think that would be exciting and forward-looking. 
This is part of the thrust of our debate here at second reading. 
Some valid points have been raised. 
Do you want to bet a lunch?  
I am not a wagering person. 
I believe I can amend my motion with leave.  
With leave, you can.  
I would make the motion in that form.  
Hon. Lois M. Wilson :
Is there some assurance that that will be done?  
One relies on one's Senate colleagues to read Hansard. 
Hopefully, he will read it. 
I would encourage the honourable senator to perhaps have a discussion with him.  
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
If recommended by the Banking Committee. 
That part is out of order. 
It must be an order of the Senate.  
I will go along with my earlier recommendation. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
We are now at the third draft.  
We have been very careful to avoid any publicity with respect to our deliberations. 
All drafts were marked "draft" and "confidential". 
As I have said, our report is not finished. 
There are still a number of points to be discussed. 
The citation also provides the following: 
I have an immense respect for the members of the committee. 
This is why I am so surprised that such a thing could occur. 
I have no idea how this leak could occur. 
I do not know if it was intentional, accidental or through negligence. 
I ask you to rule accordingly. 
I will then be able to move the following motion: 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, I support the motion which is presently before us. 
That is not a comment on anything. 
Honourable senators, I agree with the comments made by Senators Bacon and Forestall. 
There is a bug in the system. 
Again, that member of Parliament was suspended for 10 days without pay.  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I should like to add a few words. 
Honourable senators, I, too, wish to speak in support of the motion of Senator Bacon. 
The culprit lies at the source and not in the publication.  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, I should like to add a very few words to the debate. 
We should be crystal clear on what precisely the debate is about. 
I note that, on September 14, Senator Andreychuk raised a similar question. 
I believe I spoke in that debate. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Honourable senators, if no other senator wishes to speak, I will give my ruling. 
I therefore accept the question of privilege raised by Senator Bacon.  
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Religious Freedom in China in Relation to United Nations International Covenants 
Without a shadow of a doubt, some of those are accurate. 
That is the dark side to the life of religious communities in China. 
The situation for Catholics is different. 
Then there are the cults. 
China promulgated a law on cults on the last day of our visit. 
Our delegation took no position on the teachings of Falun Gong. 
When and how will "normal religious activity" be clearly defined? 
We think it a more productive approach than a confrontational one. 
On motion of Senator Wilson, for Senator Austin, debate adjourned.  
Hon. Charlie Watt , pursuant to notice of November 23, 1999, moved: 
2. the mechanisms of implementing such new structural relationships; and 
Social Affairs, Science and Technology

That the Committee report no later than June 29, 2001.
