Friday, December 12, 1997 
The Senate met at 10:00 a.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Business of the Senate 
The Hon. the Speaker :
We will proceed in that fashion.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, much work has been done since we met last night. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
May I be permitted to ask a question, honourable senators, of the two deputy leaders?  
As honourable senators are aware, I have raised a certain question of privilege. 
I would confirm that any such questions will also be deferred.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Green Caucus of the Senate 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
All interested senators are cordially invited to attend.  
Importance of Oral History in Treaty Negotiations 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
The Supreme Court has now validated the procedure followed by our committee.  
Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
Unfortunately, I was unable to address the matter on Tuesday. 
Article 29 reminds us that rights carry responsibilities. 
It reminds us that everyone has duties to the community. 
By accepting that duty, we will avoid the tragedy of the commons.  
Fiftieth Anniversary of Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
Honourable senators, I, too, wish to make a statement on human rights.  
That declaration enhanced the freedom of peoples around the world. 
Artists are the fire-keepers of a nation's culture. 
In many totalitarian states, artists are among the first victims of repression. 
Artists deserve the utmost protection of civilized people around the world. 
Copyright recognizes that artistic works are owned by their creators. 
Business of the Senate 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The rules provide for oral notice.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
I believe that would satisfy Senator Tkachuk if he wanted to proceed today.  
Honourable senators, it was my understanding that application of the rule would be suspended. 
Frankly, I am somewhat confused.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
However, I am content to rely on the agreement we have reached.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Bill to Amend-Report of Committee 
(For text of report, see Journals of the Senate of this day.)  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Orville H. Phillips :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I will certainly bring my honourable friend's suggestion to the attention of those responsible.  
I would remind him, however, that new helicopters are not bought at Canadian Tire. 
They take some time to be manufactured and delivered.  
Letter from Minister-Request for Particulars 
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Can the Leader of the Government share that information with us?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
As I understand it, the letter was directed to the Leader of the Opposition.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
That is not a point of order.  
I know, but I still object.  
It may be embarrassing, but it is not a point of order.  
There is nothing that is embarrassing. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
The number of lives lost is listed as 161. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Again, I shall make representations in that respect.  
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
My question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
That appeal was rejected in a laconic, one-sentence decision. 
The rest of Eastern Canada would like to be piped into that resource.  
The federal cabinet will be making a decision shortly on this project. 
Senator Simard presumes it will be taken during the winter adjournment.  
Is there a question?  
Is there a question?  
Just hold on a second.  
You did so once. 
I am glad you learned from that experience.  
That is an excellent idea.  
In any case, I ask you to be patient. 
I think you will agree that the matter I raise is one of national importance.  
All I am saying is that the government should give those areas a chance. 
Otherwise, you might as well forget your regional development programs.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I recognize the concerns of my honourable friend. 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
The signing is now expected to take place in Brussels before the new year. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I will bring that information back to the honourable senator as quickly as I can.  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
My question concerns Marine Atlantic. 
We will perhaps let the representations continue. 
It will give us a better informed decision.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I know that discussions have been ongoing. 
I would anticipate that the decision will be made early in the new year.  
Honourable senators, I have a supplementary to that question.  
Honourable senators, I am sure that consideration has been given to that suggestion. 
The responsibility for that decision, of course, lies directly with the Minister of Transport.  
Honourable senators, I am not sure. 
We live in a country where we all want to be fair. 
Honourable senators, my question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate.  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the crash in Manitoba was a tragic event. 
Our thoughts are with those involved and with their families.  
Bad weather was a key factor that hampered everyone's efforts. 
They happened to be there at the right place and at the right time.  
Those decisions have to be made based on years of experience.  
Honourable senators, my intention is not to embarrass the Armed Forces. 
That is my only concern. 
I will defend National Defence as strongly as does the Leader of the Government. 
I followed the story and I know they were doing their utmost. 
Youth Unemployment-Response to Problem-Government Position 
Honourable senators, my question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Quebec-Proportion of Taxes Raised Controlled by Province-Request for Particulars 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I do not know that any commitments were made, honourable senators. 
Certainly, discussions were held between the provinces. 
Many provinces were represented at the Kyoto conference. 
That is a question of interest to all honourable senators. 
Depository Bills and Notes Bill 
Hon. Michael A. Meighen :
The investor rarely takes physical delivery of the security. 
In committee, we will ask officials of the government if that is the case.  
Hon. Nicholas William Taylor :
Honourable senators, may I ask the Honourable Senator Meighen a question?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
If the Honourable Senator Meighen agrees, absolutely.  
Yes, I will entertain your question.  
Worldwide, banks and private institutions have been very stable. 
It merely facilitates handling of the instruments electronically.  
That is the only answer I can give him today.  
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Canada Pension Plan Investment Board Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
In fact, this bill goes in the other direction.  
That conference was sponsored by Status of Women Canada. 
That picture is not comforting. 
In fact, it is appalling. 
Thankfully, poverty among elderly women is on the decline. 
Women are society's caregivers. 
CPP is the only pension available to most of these working women. 
Women are far less likely than men to be making RRSP contributions. 
Women who marry generally outlive their husbands. 
Many of the figures I have given are based on averages. 
Averages are easy to discount. 
In 1994, almost one-quarter of married and single senior women lived in poverty. 
Their numbers have not declined in almost two decades.  
It is important that it be available when she is self-employed. 
In addition to other flaws in that plan, it would disadvantage women. 
However, the loss to the woman on retirement will be far greater. 
We need to regain perspective. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
May I have leave to continue?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The truth of the matter is that CPP is a very modest public pension plan. 
Our pension outlay is approximately 4 per cent of GDP. 
The Caledon Institute made the point several times at its conference:
It recommended other changes to help women. 
None of those bold steps was taken. 
Canadians have been persuaded that the CPP is in crisis. 
The first step must to restore public confidence. 
That is the political reality. 
Ken Battle of the Caledon Institute put it well when he said: 
On motion of Senator Kinsella, debate adjourned.  
Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
Fourth, Bill C-5 strengthens membership rights. 
Members also have the right to put a proposal to a meeting of the cooperative. 
These rights were not available under the existing legislation.  
Only one substantive issue was raised. 
This could potentially jeopardize the capital base of a cooperative.  
Honourable senators, the cooperative movement has been very active in my region of Atlantic Canada. 
In conclusion, honourable senators, I urge your support of Bill C-5.  
On motion of Senator Kinsella, for Senator Eyton, debate adjourned.  
Legal and Constitutional Affairs 
Notice of Motion to Authorize Committee to Meet During Sittings of the Senate 
Leave having been given to revert to Notices of Motion: 
Honourable senators, I move: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF CANADA 
Paragraphs (1) to (4) of section 93 do not apply to Quebec." 
2. This Amendment may be cited as the Constitution Amendment, year of proclamation (Quebec).  
This is in no way sufficient, however I will do my best.  
Since debate on this resolution started, I have been repeating the same message. 
I intend to say it a few more times before I am finished speaking today.  
Unfortunately, honourable senators, this is obviously not the case. 
Honourable senators, almost everyone in Quebec would like linguistic school boards. 
This is not where we have a problem. 
Governments are not limited in any other way. 
They are free to legislate to give other denominations similar schools. 
However, this liberty to legislate is put into jeopardy by the removal of section 93. 
Honourable senators, let me be blunt. 
All publicly funded religious schools will cease to exist. 
The people of Quebec are unaware of the danger. 
Before then, it enjoyed a very limited release. 
Once again, I will read from the famous letter. 
However, in a short letter to Mr. Dion they add the following to their endorsement: 
In order to rectify the situation, the Catholic committee suggested the following: 
The committee felt safe with the government's assurances. 
Honourable senators, the question of who really represents whom is difficult to answer.  
Another important example of this phenomenon has crossed my desk just this week. 
They got not response. 
I can hardly believe that, honourable senators. 
These individuals are also very passionate about this issue. 
Their dedication to this cause and to the values they hold dear is noteworthy. 
I commend them and I urge all honourable senators to do the same.  
I find this evidence compelling.  
They should not be overlooked.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is leave granted?  
We all know how easily frustrated the exercise of a right can be. 
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
In my opinion, that is disrespectful. 
The petitions ought to be laid on the Table of the Senate.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
A point of order has been raised that the petitions should be on the Table. 
Is there room on the Table?  
If it is the wish of the Senate, they can be placed on the Table. 
The Clerk advises me that the group of documents on the Table are symbolic. 
If it is your wish, honourable senators, we can do that.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I suggest that it be deemed that the petitions are on the Table.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Please continue, Senator Wood.  
The writing is on the wall, honourable senators. 
One need only consult the Statistics Canada census figures released last week. 
English-speaking Quebecers are now a minority within a minority. 
However, that offers no consolation to me or to English-speaking Quebecers.  
That, honourable senators, will not happen.  
That is the section that deals with language of instruction.  
I do not think this is the case.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I regret to interrupt the honourable senator, but her 15-minute time period has elapsed.  
The Quebec government had the perfect opportunity to correct this discriminatory practice. 
It did not and it will not. 
The federal government had the perfect opportunity to ask that this discriminatory practice be abolished. 
It must act to protect all its minorities from an erosion of their rights. 
This does not justify the outright removal of denominational education rights. 
We all know that the task of governing is a difficult one. 
However, rights are entrenched into Constitutions to protect them from incursions of the state. 
This debate has not occurred yet. 
It sets a very bad precedent.  
Honourable senators, the stakes are high. 
Honourable senators, these are monumental decisions we are making.  
Honourable senators, nothing could be further from the truth. 
The most we can do is invoke our suspensive veto. 
We owe them that much.  
Honourable senators, would Senator Wood entertain a question and a comment?  
Senator Wood, you tabled in the Senate 250,000 petitions. 
I am sure you have examined those. 
Can you tell me if collectively they represent the views of one group? 
Do they come from one region? 
If they are broadly based, do they represent various religious faiths? 
There was an attempt made to table them with the Quebec government. 
These petitioners and correspondents say that they did not have a voice. 
These letters come from all over the province of Quebec. 
They were offered to Minister Marois, and she refused to accept them. 
That is how the petitions arrived at my office.  
On motion of Senator Beaudoin, debate adjourned.  
The Hon. The Speaker :
Hon. C. William Doody :
Her speech was filled with quotations from the many witnesses who appeared before the committee. 
Nevertheless, it was a comprehensive dissertation.  
That is what this is all about, honourable senators. 
But "fundamental" to whom? 
Religious education rights are certainly fundamental to thousands and thousands of Newfoundlanders. 
This is even more true of Seventh-day Adventists. 
Quite the opposite is true. 
I fear they are being lost in the shuffle.  
Let me go back to the geography. 
There are many other Roman Catholic communities scattered throughout the island. 
However, a large part of the Roman Catholic population is concentrated on the Avalon Peninsula.  
That is pretty close to the referendum question language. 
This was a process set up by the Government of Newfoundland.  
This number represents almost three-quarters of the school population of the province.  
They also attend single community schools. 
Therefore, they voted "yes." 
The question on the ballot paper reflected the system that was already in place. 
Let me read the question to honourable senators: 
But where did the question come from? 
Four or five questions or variations of questions make a short list. 
The questions are run by the groups. 
Transcripts of the discussions are carefully examined. 
Honourable senators, the population was asked to confirm a system already in place. 
Honourable senators, this is a breathtaking concept. 
The Government of Newfoundland is going far beyond that. 
This quotation is vintage Smallwood. 
It is completely and utterly false, definitely and finally false. 
Wholly and undeniably false.  
Confederation will not make a particle of difference in our school system. 
I know what I am talking about. 
I will go further. 
If they themselves say they want out, that is fine with me. 
You will not hear another squeak out of me. 
It has been my position ever since, and it will continue to be my position. 
Honourable senators, we have come to this. 
Sadly, we were wrong. 
In the meantime, I think I have made my case. 
Hon. John B. Stewart :
Will the Honourable Senator Doody help me by answering a question?  
I want to thank Senator Doody for an eloquent and succinct statement of his position. 
The question now before the Senate is a difficult one. 
If so, what are those shortcomings, and what remedies would he prescribe?  
Are there such difficulties, Senator Doody, in your view? 
If so, what remedies would you apply?  
Honourable senators, of course there are difficulties. 
That still presents some problems because there is still some duplications. 
They are undoubtedly right. 
I believe that there are 400 students involved in this case.  
Other duplications do exist. 
It will not be done by the denominations themselves.  
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
Would the Honourable Senator Doody accept a question?  
The French-speaking people were never given a school board before. 
It is my understanding that it is completely aside from these considerations. 
Was it an accident? 
It certainly was not an accident. 
Hon. Jean B. Forest :
I am not aware of what advantage that would have.  
The parents still have their representatives on the board. 
As a matter of fact, they have a majority of the representatives on the boards. 
There may be a member of some teaching orders represented on the boards. 
I cannot tell you exactly. 
It is now a more democratic system than it was.  
You must think of this whole situation in the context of its development. 
The priests were holding religious instruction out in the woods. 
You find those in many areas.  
From that system evolved this denominational system. 
I want to clarify that that is so.  
That has always been the case, senator. 
If they want to go to school, they must go to a denominational school. 
However, no one is forced to attend religious instruction classes.  
That practice is frowned upon in some circles under the Charter because it is discriminatory. 
I am told they would have a Charter problem with that. 
I am glad to say that I voted against the Charter, too, in 1982.  
Could the honourable senator give us some details?  
Honourable senators, I attempted to do so in my remarks. 
What they got was an elimination of denominational education.  
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
Honourable senators, I would request permission to ask a question of Senator Doody.  
Hon. Philippe Deane Gigantes :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is that a question, Honourable Senator Gigantes?  
I should like to ask Senator Doody how he manages to be so likeable?  
Perhaps it is because I am not an agnostic.  
Hon. P. Derek Lewis :
I bow to my seniors.  
Senator Doody has described how the rights of the church schools were enshrined. 
None of these rights is enshrined forever. 
It is as simple as that.  
However, the Pentecostals had no rights then.  
That debate has been going on for a long time. 
In Newfoundland, the debate never reached that point. 
The Pentecostal people were never asked to vote on their options regarding future education. 
They have their own system worked out and it is fine. 
That would not be a major challenge. 
It would be similar to the American system where people identify themselves in the primaries.  
These numbers, honourable senators, are exactly as I remember them. 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Honourable senators, I would ask a question of clarification from Senator Doody.  
Would it not be treated better as a result of the amendments proposed today?  
I congratulate them because they deserve it. 
They feel they will better off with their own school boards. 
It is their decision, their recommendation, and they are getting what they requested.  
However, honourable senators, I am not about to defend the system. 
On motion of Senator Kinsella, debate adjourned.  
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration 
Consideration of Seventh Report of Committee-Debate Adjourned 
As much notification as possible was given of this.  
Honourable senators, this is a culmination of a series of events. 
As far as I am aware, he did not do that. 
That being the case, it is appropriate that the Senate act.  
These are strictly my personal views.  
In my humble opinion, that maximum ought to be drastically reduced. 
That kind of arrangement does not strike me as being right or proper at all.  
There is no definition of "public business." 
Perhaps that is possible. 
I think it will be quite difficult. 
I am prepared to be persuaded by an adequate definition. 
The penalty for exceeding the maximum should also be revised. 
It has not been revised for many, many years. 
I am speaking of calendar years. 
I think of Senator Ottenheimer, Senator Balfour, Senator Jean-Robert Gauthier and Senator Lucier. 
One approaches this subject with considerable hesitation. 
I find those kinds of suggestions somewhat distasteful. 
I am reluctant to support a suggestion of that kind. 
One thing is certain:
This is more than an Andy Thompson problem that we are facing here. 
I am now in my nineteenth year here. 
Hon. John B. Stewart :
Honourable senators, I hope Senator Murray will not be saved by the clock.  
There is no clock!  
Senator Murray raised the whole question of new limits on absence. 
Has he considered the problem raised by the size of the country? 
Honourable senators, I am aware of the problem. 
The physical beating that some of these people take is quite remarkable. 
That is the short answer to the honourable senator's question.  
If someone is sick, that is not our business. 
It is a doctor's business. 
I do not know about Senator Thompson. 
I cannot go to him and ask him how sick he is. 
At any rate, I believe that we do a good job in the committees. 
That is up to him.  
That is my concern, honourable senators.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I thought Honourable Senator Adams was going to ask a question. 
He was making a statement.  
Are there any other questions of Senator Murray?  
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
I must ask, however, whether he has taken two factors into his calculations. 
How we measure up against other legislatures, I simply do not know. 
We have not been elected. 
We are not accountable in that sense.  
Perhaps Senator Murray could confirm that.  
I am frequently reminded of the fact that we are not elected. 
Quite frankly, that is a poor excuse advanced much of the time. 
Honourable senators, I think we should be proud of ourselves. 
The media reports to date have been restricted to attendance in this chamber.  
It should not be counted as a day off.  
There is a record, Senator Murray, of public business. 
The Clerk is provided with it. 
There is no such requirement.  
Who is saying no? 
Stand up and tell me that it is not true.  
Hon. Orville H. Phillips :
What rule are you quoting?  
It is fairly simple. 
I have seen the reports go in. 
It is there and it is in the Rules of the Senate . 
If you have not reported public business, then you have been docked a day. 
It is as simple as that.  
I thank the honourable senator. 
I welcome his comments. 
As always with Senator Phillips, I will listen to his comments very attentively. 
I suspect we are not too far apart in our views.  
I was saying that public business divides itself into two categories. 
Senator Stewart, I am pleased to address that issue. 
It is a vexing issue which affects a significant number of our colleagues. 
It is one that I have spent a lot of time considering. 
I thought that paper had some value and some merit. 
This was an effort to try to accommodate that concern when people come here.  
In that way, we would reduce the amount of travel for senators. 
We parted on that note.  
It did not, honourable senators. 
The Senate kept attendance from the very first day it opened. 
I think most honourable senators will admit that they have done that occasionally. 
The various professional societies have such a committee. 
That is only fair. 
Someone must improve that situation. 
We sent them the program. 
Can they not read it? 
Can they not correct that?  
They are probably too young to know what Vimy Ridge was.  
That is probably part of the problem. 
They have probably never even heard of Vimy Ridge, Senator Gigantes.  
There must be some allowance made for that.  
The question arises as to what is public business. 
Would you have received an invitation to participate in that function as Orville Phillips? 
Or did you get that invitation because you were Senator Phillips? 
Did you attend because you were Senator Phillips?" 
I support his suggestion of a five-day week. 
Honourable senators, I request some discretion on the part of my colleagues. 
When speaking to the press, let us not jump on one another. 
Let us not behave as a fish gobbling up another fish. 
He later denied making that statement. 
When I heard that, my blood pressure shot up beyond the safe limit.  
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
Honourable senators, I move the adjournment of the debate.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Do I hear objections?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
There is no agreement. 
I heard some "nay" voices. 
Therefore, I must call for the "yeas" and the "nays."  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, would those opposed to the adjournment of the debate, please say "nay."  
The Hon. the Speaker :
In my opinion, the "yeas" have it.  
On motion of Senator Corbin, debate adjourned.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Motion Requiring Attendance of Senator Thompson-Debate Adjourned 
Hon. Colin Kenny , pursuant to notice of December 11, 1997 moved: 
Honourable senators, I will be brief. 
On motion of Senator Carstairs, debate adjourned.  
The Senate adjourned until Monday, December 15, 1997, at 2 p.m.
