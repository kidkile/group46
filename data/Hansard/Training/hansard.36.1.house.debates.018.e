The House met at 2 p.m. 
Members sang the national anthem ] 
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
No search was initiated.  
Does the minister think spending this $30,000 is somehow unimportant?  
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville, Lib.):
It is fall and therefore it must be the start of hockey season. 
Clearly hockey is Canada's great unifying force. 
THE LATE DOROTHY LAM 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
MEMBER FOR VAUDREUIL-SOULANGES 
Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):
The reverse is true.  
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member. 
The hon. member for Malpeque now has the floor.  
CANADIAN VOLUNTEER ADVISERS TO BUSINESS 
Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mrs. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga Centre, Lib.):
This passed at NATO.  
NATIONAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY WEEK 
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Our economic future depends on our ability to rise to the challenge of international competition.  
Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):
Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):
People who view pornography are affected in different ways, but they are all affected. 
Child molesters have been shaped by the pornography they view. 
This breeds unfaithfulness to one's spouse and is therefore destructive to families.  
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Canadians know about global warming. 
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
Unfortunately, Inuit artists are not the only ones profiting from these opportunities.  
This clearly must come to an end.  
MOTHERS AGAINST DRUNK DRIVING 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, a young west coast student. 
An east coast athlete. 
A mother and her son in Ottawa. 
Each was killed on a Canadian highway by a drunk driver.  
And this will happen again tomorrow and the next day.  
It is a fact that alcohol significantly increases the risk of motor vehicle crashes. 
It is also a fact that alcohol increases the severity of traffic collisions.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Is that not putting the cart before the horse?  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, comparisons are odious.  
I spent a day long session with my provincial counterparts discussing this issue. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Canadians have to be told where those moneys are going to come from. 
Are they going to come from fuel taxes? 
Are they going to come from carbon taxes? 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
There are also important opportunities for this country attached to addressing this issue.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
We always try to improve the system. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Whenever there is a contract that has not been following procedure we know about it. 
We make sure the rules are followed.  
Every day and every year we are improving it.  
FRANCO-QUEBEC ACCORD ON CHILD SUPPORT 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, this is fantastic. 
The hon. Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this statement is wrong, very wrong.  
That is Quebec's problem.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.  
Mr. Speaker, the Bloc Quebecois is contradicting itself. 
That is the fundamental issue.  
I merely point out to him that he is mistaken.  
I ask all members to be very judicious in their choice of words. 
The hon. member for Beauharnois-Salaberry has the floor.  
He should withdraw what he said.  
Tell him he lied.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs lied.  
I will deal with this matter at the end of question period.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Canadians are paying a terrible price for the finance minister's cuts to health care. 
They are paying with their health and they are paying with their pocketbooks. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
That is not a ceiling; that is a floor. 
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
The provincial counterparts will determine who will fill the two to three positions.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
We were not realistic at the time. 
CANADIAN INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCY 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
I have done my homework today. 
I believe it is.  
I do not know that this question deserves an answer.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
They deny even having this information.  
FRANCE-QUEBEC AGREEMENT ON COLLECTION OF SUPPORT PAYMENTS 
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.  
It is, however, nothing of the sort. 
I did not say that the member for Beauharnois-Salaberry had not lied.  
I will now answer the question. 
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
Will it be $100, $200 or $300 more?  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this is exactly the problem. 
The government is saying nothing about this issue.  
The Liberal government will bankrupt Canadians with massive tax grabs. 
We hear about dialogue with the provinces. 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
They know that I am in dialogue with them.  
There are opportunities associated with what Canada will do. 
We welcome it because there will be global dialogue on a global problem. 
That's good but it means all of us have to sacrifice''.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
When will his anti-tobacco legislation be amended? 
What are you waiting for, Mr. Minister?  
I would remind my colleagues to always address the Chair.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We will table the legislation when we are in a position to do so. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
It is that simple.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, our commitment is very clear. 
Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Fanshawe, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence.  
Will the minister give us the facts? 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
The hon. member for Calgary Northeast.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there are no new cuts. 
Those are still being carried out and will be completed by next year.  
There will be pay increases this year for the Canadian forces. 
They are a high priority with this government. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Will the minister instead restore hope to Canada's youth and commit to reducing- 
The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I am sorry to hear this because this is a very serious issue. 
This government is acting in a responsible way. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, that is not enough. 
Most of them even think that the situation will continue to worsen.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We continue to work very hard. 
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the solicitor general.  
He has been trying to get answers. 
He has been trying to get justice, and he deserves it.  
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question. 
I know how deeply he feels about this.  
Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland-Colchester, PC):
Hon. Andy Scott (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. 
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
This government has a comprehensive family violence initiative. 
The hon. member for Qu'Appelle.  
Mr. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
Mr. Taylor referred to social spending in this country. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We have discussed the issues of service charges. 
We have looked at their adequacy. 
Incidentally, Allan Taylor is no longer the president of the Royal Bank.

Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Tony Ianno (Trinity-Spadina, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
We will continue to support the efforts of small business.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
The medals have been authenticated by many historical authorities. 
The people of Canada have contributed over $25,000 to this.  
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
In this instance the family has questioned the medals. 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
However, the matter is being looked at very carefully. 
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Canada helped to suspend Nigeria from the Commonwealth.  
Everyone agrees the suspensions have not worked.  
What kind of coercive measures is the minister talking about?  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
I propose to address myself to an incident that occurred during question period. 
Most members seem to think this is a good thing.  
Would the hon. member please withdraw the words ``il a menti''?  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
I understand, from his words, that the hon. member for Beauharnois-Salaberry has withdrawn- 
No, it is the one on the other side who must withdraw his comments.  
Dear colleagues, there is no question of setting conditions. 
I intend only to deal with one matter at a time. 
I will deal with other matters after I have dealt with this one. 
My colleagues, I always caution you that we are dealing with the institution of Parliament.  
The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is seeking the floor.  
I have a transcript of what was said. 
All I want is a yes or a no from the hon. minister.  
The hon. minister is said to have said: 
I merely point out to him that he is mistaken''.  
Yes, Mr. Speaker, I withdraw all these words.  
I think we have invested enough of the time of the House in this interchange.  
Your Speaker always takes advice from his colleagues. 
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
I will not go into all the details here. 
I can explain it to you later. 
I have not introduced my third point.  
Does he agree to that?  
I have undertaken to get back to you at another time.  
I would like you to hold off until we can come back.

It reads: ``That the repeal of section 745 will not be retroactive''. 
An original advocate of the clause no longer has a seat in this House. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
This bill will give them that power, a much needed bill.  
We have lost too much of our heritage. 
Let us go back to our roots of the Dominion of Canada.  
Mr. John Cannis (Scarborough Centre, Lib.):
Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):

Of course I would take it one step further.

The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
CANADA CO-OPERATIVES ACT 
These two organizations played a key role in the development of the legislation.  
Co-operatives are an important vehicle for community based economic development. 
They are locally based and provide services locally. 
Co-operatives have been around for a long time.  
In 1996 eight of them had revenues greater than $1 billion. 
Today a majority of co-operatives are located in urban areas. 
These include housing co-operatives and credit unions.  
The co-operative movement reaches into every sector of the Canadian economy. 
They will also have new opportunities to raise capital.  
The decisions of co-operatives reflect the interest of the communities in which they operate.  
A new Canadian co-operatives act is another important tool to help make that happen.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We would then go back to the regular rotation.  
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Chair thanks the the government whip for clarifying the situation.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
It is quite fitting that we were speaking about co-ops. 
That is a long time for a young person like me. 
Of course I joined the credit union and co-operative movement many years ago.  
Some producer and marketing co-operatives have been very successful. 
In 1995, 617,000 people belonged to agricultural co-ops alone. 
They are very significant players in the economy.  
I raise some examples of co-ops. 
As one of the three engines it is a very key sector.  
No doubt we will hear more detailed views at that time.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
I would even encourage you to elevate this standard as need be. 
So please pass those comments on.  
They recognized the need for change in its industry. 
They recognized the need to be increasingly competitive. 
They have to achieve some measure of increased efficiency if they are to survive.  
They also realized they needed access to investment, investment dollars and capital. 
The co-operatives through all of this were dealing with reality. 
I want to speak about dealing with reality for a minute. 
He is not dealing with reality. 
I can remember a day in Canada when interest rates were almost 20%. 
We have a debt that has an interest rate of around 7% or 8%.  
I think the likelihood of those interest rates going down is very small. 
The potential for them to go up is real. 
I read recently that there is already pressure to move in that direction.  
But we are not dealing with reality. 
We are celebrating an almost balanced budget.  
How much is the interest on a $600 billion debt? 
It is $45 billion a year. 
How much is that? 
We talk so much about the importance of secondary education. 
That is how much that is and we pay that out in interest every year.  
We talk about the need for health care. 
No, we get a throne speech with 29 new spending initiatives. 
I heard lately it is 31.  
Canadians are crying out for less government, not more government. 
We are asking the government across the floor to hear this.  
There is something else that the co-operatives demonstrated. 
They demonstrated they have the ability to plan for the future. 
Instead, what do we get? 
Where is the money? 
Nobody seems to know where it is.  
It is a flowthrough system. 
There is no pot of money available. 
There is a $560 billion unfunded liability there. 
It is a flowthrough system.  
Canadians are even losing faith in this system. 
They have lost faith in this program. 
What is the government's answer? 
That is the largest tax increase we have seen. 
The government has an answer for us. 
This money is earned by Canadians. 
It is not a tax. 
It is meant to be there when they need it at retirement age. 
Let them own it and manage it. 
This concept is being applied around the world with outstanding success. 
There is another dimension of the co-operatives bill. 
Even as I speak it in this House I am overwhelmed again with the facts. 
Surely the light is going to come on one of these days.  
It is not really savings. 
It is misleading Canadian people.  
Members know where I am going and where he went. 
Canadians are burdened with government, taxes and all that comes with them. 
Canadians are a stoic bunch. 
We tend not to be complainers. 
We tend to buck up and do it. 
There is a bright note in all this. 
They allowed co-ops to plan for their future.  
Let us emphasize that. 
The government has demonstrated that it can listen. 
It is almost too late. 
It is a critical time. 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, may I congratulate you on your appointment.  
Co-operatives, I must point out, are vital in Quebec. 
There are various types of co-operatives. 
But a few problems remain.  
That is not how it works. 
This is a far cry from a business corporation.  
No doubt there is room for improvement. 
An improvement that could, one might say, be made fairly easily. 
The reasons for the refusal to do so remain to be seen.  
The bill also contains some worrisome elements. 
This is, one might say, hard to understand. 
It could open the door to all sorts of abuse. 
The committee has its work cut out. 
Hopefully, it will have the time required to do it.  
We agree that the legislation must be updated. 
Quebec has done it. 
I imagine the other provinces have also done it or will do it. 
Other countries have done it. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
I have some previous experience with co-operatives in Canada. 
Bill C-5 contains the recommendations which the industry requested.  
Bill C-5 will modernize the legislation affecting co-operatives in Canada. 
It will strengthen this vital component of the Canadian economy.  
For example, co-operatives will be allowed to access capital markets directly. 
Co-operatives will continue to be able to raise capital from their members. 
Bill C-5 also includes definitions of the duties, liabilities and responsibilities of directors. 
It addresses the governance of the board of directors. 
We rely on her sage wisdom. 
She has seen almost every flat footed, maniac antic of Tory and Liberal governments.  
This situation is unacceptable and almost unbelievable.  
Madam Speaker, I have a civil question. 
I can understand that. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
For a surprise, we are looking into this matter. 
This is a matter for accountability. 
I will go to my debate.  
The Liberals have, in fact, very little to do with this bill. 
It is given to them by the co-operative themselves.  
Their whip does all those things for them.  
Most sectors of the Canadian economy have co-operatives. 
Co-operatives have been a very successful component in our economy. 
In fact, many co-operatives are non-financial co-operatives. 
We want to do everything we can to create jobs. 
We want to ensure fair treatment of the small business community and our co-operatives.  
Canadians co-operatives compete head to head with national and international businesses and corporations. 
Most jobs in Canada are created by small business. 
That is not what the Liberals believe. 
How can they do it?  
The Liberals have reduced the deficit by increasing taxes. 
It is a miracle.  
These are the same Liberals who cancelled the Somalia inquiry. 
Income tax take has been rising steadily in this country. 
The Liberals are balancing the budget on the backs of Canadian taxpayers. 
We are interested in the opposition's views on co-operatives. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I would remind the hon. member to please keep the debate pertinent.  
These are bitter truths. 
I am not making up these figures.  
Those are the reasons why we have to mention these things. 
They are the ones who are not creating jobs. 
Bill C-5 is a lesson for the Liberals. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to answer the hon. member's question. 
He did not read Bill C-5. 
On this side of the House we keep completely in touch with our constituents. 
We meet with them frequently. 
We have a free right to vote on this side of the House.  
I will be putting forward their concerns in the House.  
Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):
The bill before us deals with non-financial co-operatives. 
Survival in this marketplace depends on innovation and flexibility. 
These co-operative associations work closely with their members. 
They discuss their draft model act within the co-operative movement. 
I hope we see more of these examples in the future.  
One-third of the board can be from outside. 
In each case it is the members who decide.  
In short, this bill gives co-operatives the best of both worlds. 
I hope hon. members will join me in supporting this bill.  
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
As of 1995 there were over 617,000 members of agricultural co-operatives in Canada. 
These co-ops were responsible for almost $16.3 billion in sales. 
It has 4,500 members and 2,200 employees.  
Agricultural co-ops also include those involved in production and services. 
It has come a long way.  
Those co-ops are fewer in number today. 
Consumer co-operatives are also having an influence on the rural economy. 
In 1995 it earned $2.1 billion in sales. 
Their strength lies in their people. 
We can find a number of success stories in the fishing sector.  
It has 250 employees and in 1995 had $14 million in sales. 
Forestry co-operatives are enjoying phenomenal success. 
They are doing particularly well in Quebec. 
By 1995 there were 76 aboriginal co-operatives in Canada. 
They are big businesses that pursue the interest of their members as a whole. 
The bill gives them these tools. 
I urge the House to pass it.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, everyone is interested in co-operatives. 
Could she clarify this for us? 
I await her reply.  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.  
There are many differences among the different types of co-ops. 
They all have slight differences.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member made a very eloquent speech on co-operatives.  
Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I ask for your direction, Mr. Speaker. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member is quite correct. 
We have to keep the debate relevant.  
I give the remaining time to the hon. member for Essex.  
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
This is my first speech in the House, after having asked a couple of questions.  
Tomorrow I will be making a real speech about some Newfoundland issues. 
My critic responsibility is industry where the co-operative legislation lies. 
Thus today I will debate the bill on co-operatives.  
Bill C-5 is a good piece of legislation. 
It will be supported by all colleagues in the Conservative caucus. 
Co-operatives come from the grassroots movement. 
It started back in the 1800s with the Mutual Farm Insurance Company. 
Today agricultural co-operatives play a major role in the Canadian economy.  
Agricultural co-ops supply 36% of fertilizer and chemical sales. 
They have over 221,000 members and employ 18,000 people full time. 
There are also many fishery and forestry co-operatives. 
They formed their own co-operative. 
There are many consumer co-operatives in Canada. 
In 1995 there were 437 day care and nursery school co-ops in Canada. 
Co-operatives in many areas play a very major role in our economy.  
There are also housing co-operatives. 
The number of housing co-operatives has been on the rise since the mid-1970s. 
I talked to the participants of the project which I visited that day. 
In 1995 there were 225 of these co-operatives, with about 14,000 members.  
Our role in the House is to do what we are doing today. 
I am sure we can do that in committee at a future time.  
This point has fueled the necessity for change in this legislative environment.  
Thus it is called enabling legislation. 
Finally the principle of education is also emphasized.  
I would like to point out that Bill C-5 is not a controversial bill. 
I believe a reasonable compromise was reached. 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
I also want to welcome him to the industry committee. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question.  
I mentioned the Petty Harbour co-op. 
The Canadian banking establishment does not aggressively get involved in the Newfoundland business community. 
I hope to see it grow over the years.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I also support this bill.  
Under CMHC it has been very successful. 
I hope that members of the government will take a look at that program. 
We see the need as well.  
I just hope it continues to put some emphasis on those types of programs.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
I am sure I can stay in the House and hear his words of wisdom.  
These are 1995 figures. 
They are a wholesaler. 
They have the Co-op Atlantic. 
You had better believe it or you won't be able to sit at all.  
That wouldn't be a bad idea, Elsie.  
I am learning, Mr. Speaker. 
Members were not in the House during that period, which is unfortunate. 
I believe sincerely that theme in itself speaks also to the legislation.  
The legislation allows a number of things. 
That is very important. 
They are members of a co-operative and have every right to do so. 
Again, it is very positive to have that dispute settling mechanism.  
Bill C-5 makes changes to the rules governing a corporation. 
As a result they are awarded the same rights and privileges as natural persons. 
Traditionally co-ops have looked only to their members to finance their operations. 
This is probably the most important aspect of the legislation that has been put forward. 
It is very positive.  
I did not talk about CPP or OAS. 
I do not plan on doing that right now. 
I congratulate the government. 
We will be supporting this piece of legislation. 
Mr. Joe Comuzzi (Thunder Bay-Nipigon, Lib.):
I have visited Castlegreen on many occasions.  
I would like to express exactly what I see when I drive into Castlegreen. 
First there is the pride of ownership among all the residents. 
They have the community spirit that I do not see in any other communities. 
It is due to the residents who live there. 
They are non-voting shares. 
I talked about dissenting rights. 
So it has been very positive for them.  
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
In various areas of the country there are small and large co-operatives. 
Has the member had any feedback or any comments?  
Mr. John Harvard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
That speaks well of the government's work.  
There is a mentality that goes along with co-op membership. 
They place a priority on meeting the needs of the community. 
Rather it distributes its surpluses on the basis of patronage within the co-operative itself.  
By pooling their resources in a co-operative, members reduce their individual risks. 
The co-operative structure provides a limited liability to its members. 
Traditionally a co-operative gives each member one vote in conducting its affairs. 
It does not generally allow proxy voting.  
Co-operatives are different. 
They contribute to the Canadian economy because of those differences. 
At the same time most co-operatives are run like businesses. 
They charge members a price for services. 
They return some of the profit to members. 
Indeed some of the larger co-operatives are integrated both vertically and horizontally. 
Some have joint ventures with corporations. 
Some even own corporations.  
I also visited their terminal facilities in Vancouver. 
It is doing well for all its members.  
These co-operatives compete directly with business corporations, whether Canadian or foreign. 
In the meantime co-operatives have continued to change and evolve.  
Let me give an example of that. 
This method of legislative reform is expensive. 
It enhances the ability of co-operatives to carry out business fairly, efficiently and effectively.  
Co-operatives are a powerful form of business organization. 
They were explicit and we tried to respond to their suggestions.  
The paper presented a number of key suggestions as guidelines. 
Before closing I would like to review some great co-op success stories. 
There are a number of them. 
They are not all federally incorporated co-operatives. 
By 1994 the co-op had grown to 1,234 members and 500 employees.  
In Alberta electricity and gas distribution co-operatives have been quite successful. 
I could go on listing a number of other success stories. 
There are a lot of them out there.  
The co-op movement is very successful. 
We can all be very proud of what has taken place in that field. 
We expect further successes in the future. 
I look forward to further examination of the bill when it is before committee.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the house to adopt the motion?  
CANADA CO-OPERATIVES ACT 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, Manitoba has many co-operatives. 
I will leave that aside for a moment. 
At some point it will be offered for sale to the federal government. 
I am not sure what the federal government's intentions are when that is done. 
Mr. Speaker, I too am a member of a co-op. 
I just pulled my membership card out of my wallet. 
I have also been a- 
It is in my wife's name. 
If it has expired she takes full responsibility.  
I am quite sure he could get the technical answer to the question.  
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
The Mouvement Desjardins is a jewel in Quebec's economic crown. 
The consul, Mr. Rawlinson, praised it highly, and without prompting.  
I will read it rapidly: 
There are, however, two exceptions to this. 
There is no explanation. 
Perhaps this could be explained in committee soon.  
Here again things seem a bit arbitrary.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Hon. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent to call it 6.30 p.m.?  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Despite this announcement Canadians remain deeply concerned. 
Let me give four quick reasons for that concern.  
Third, the drug research lab remains closed. 
There has been no attempt by the government to address that issue. 
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
They will also be submitted to a science advisory board. 
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
The minister chose to answer a question that was not asked. 
It is true this problem has been known for 10 years. 
My question is very clear and I would like a clear answer in response.  
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Health, Lib.):
In fact, that abuse occurs in a very limited number of cases. 
No one wishes to condone any abuse.  
I emphasize this is a complex problem. 
Abuse exists but it does so in a very small percentage of cases. 
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville, Lib.):
They were promised free access to the large market to the south. 
Has Canadian productivity increased as a result of NAFTA? 
Two respected columnists in two different newspapers have said no. 
Canadians agreed to the free trade agreement as a leap of faith. 
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
The negotiations have been taking place for the last three or four years. 
Those negotiations will not begin until next January.  
Provincial officials are now consulted through regular meetings. 
There are conference calls. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted.  
(The House adjourned at 6.41 p.m.)
