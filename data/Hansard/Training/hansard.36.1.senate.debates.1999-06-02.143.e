Wednesday, June 2, 1999 
The Senate met at 1:30 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
The Honourable Archibald Hynd Johnstone 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I, too, would like to set the record straight. 
Archie met his old friend Orville Phillips in the Air Cadets. 
The report was a monumental effort. 
Hon. Norman K. Atkins :
Senator Johnstone has been successful throughout his career. 
We wish you and Phelicia all the best as you continue your lives together. 
Hon. Catherine S. Callbeck :
Honourable senators, I, too, should like to pay tribute to Senator Archie Johnstone. 
Archie Johnstone has done much for the province of Prince Edward Island. 
He has worked hard at what he felt was a personal mission. 
Senator Phillips and Senator Johnstone have known each other for going on 60 years. 
I would not dare.  
I want to thank him most sincerely for his participation in our work. 
His questions and comments have been always perceptive and constructive.  
He has earned many times over his senatorial stipend. 
I trust he has invested it shrewdly. 
You have worked very hard on behalf of Canada's veterans. 
Your good nature and your sense of humour have been unfailing. 
I know your lovely wife, Phelicia, was downright confused by that description.  
Archie, you are the ultimate entrepreneur. 
I know there will be more development of tourist attractions in your future.  
Archie, I thank you for your friendship. 
However, I know that the Island will be richer for your return. 
Long life and good health, Archie.  
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
If I may, I should like to add a couple of words of my own.  
He has made it very clear. 
He is a fair-minded individual who has kept an open mind on issues. 
I think that is good for the Senate.  
May you enjoy a long life.  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
I did not know Senator Johnstone before he came to the Senate. 
He would have fit so well with us here. 
I have enjoyed having known Senator Johnstone. 
I have met the honourable senator's family. 
If he needs a key, I will give him one. 
That is the trust that I have developed in him.  
I regret that time passed so rapidly. 
It was a great moment for me to have known you.  
Honourable senators, listen to my words. 
I say something different about every person who retires. 
I do not have one speech prepared for any departure.  
Senator Johnstone and I worked together in difficult circumstances. 
He produced a good report on behalf of our veterans. 
In the old days, Senator Marshall was champion of the veterans. 
I will be happy to give that name soon. 
We will never forget your mischievous sense of humour. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
That is not so. 
He did much more than that. 
He will be greatly missed.  
Not only that, but all his mannerisms are identical to those of my dad. 
He is absolutely fastidious.  
I do not know whether my grandfather spent any time in the Maritimes.  
Best of luck and good health!  
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
Honourable senators, I wish to pay tribute to Archie also. 
We will soon be losing Senator Maloney, too. 
Archie, I will not compare you to my father. 
All the air crew were issued silk underwear, but the navy got scratchy woollen stuff. 
I was always jealous about that.  
Archie, you have indeed made quite an impression on the Senate. 
Thank you for blessing us with your presence. 
We should be looking at that whole question. 
Archie, I wish you all the best. 
I hope to drop in on you and see how the lobster feeds are. 
That, in itself, was an achievement.  
He has seen value in this institution. 
He has made a contribution of great value to it.  
Our friend Senator Johnstone is one such citizen. 
We are talking about a section of our citizenry which needs a voice. 
Senator Johnstone's has been one of those voices. 
Senator Johnstone heard somewhere that I was an honorary colonel. 
I have felt privileged to sit in this house with you.  
I wish you and your wife, Phelicia, the very best of futures. 
The work you have done here never stops. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable Senator Johnstone, is it your wish to speak to the Senate?  
Hon. Archibald Hynd Johnstone :
Honourable senators, I have wondered what you might say today. 
I did not expect such tributes. 
I have enjoyed your comments and I have enjoyed the exaggerations. 
However, there are a few things that I must say.  
We sat side by side for a few days.  
She has made great friends in Kensington. 
You can tell her that it is much used and much appreciated. 
It was sometimes emotional but we were well rewarded for the work that we did. 
Then they would all want to talk. 
All they said was, "Thanks for coming. 
We thought we were forgotten."  
They just wanted to thank us once more, just for coming. 
That was all the reward we needed.  
I hope that we in the subcommittee may have done some good.  
It has been very enjoyable. 
I met a great many of you. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I draw your attention to some distinguished visitors in our gallery.  
May you have an enjoyable stay in our country.  
Introduction of Genetically Modified Organisms into the Food Chain and the Environment 
Hon. Lois M. Wilson :
Universities are under siege these days. 
It services a growing aboriginal community of students. 
It boasts a forestry program unique in Canada. 
National Access Awareness Week 
Hon. Therese Lavoie-Roux :
Over 4 million Canadians have some degree of disability. 
For instance, in New Brunswick, a poster contest is being sponsored. 
In effect, the week no longer exists. 
This report contained 52 recommendations arising from consultations carried out across the country. 
I will close with a few quotes from the report from one of these consultations: 
People with disabilities are found in all levels of society. 
They are our seniors' population. 
They are all of us.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Does Senator Lavoie-Roux have permission to continue?  
Senator Lavoie-Rou x: 
What do we do with them?

Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Canadian Environmental Protection Bill, 1998 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Canada-France Inter-Parliamentary Association 
Review of Anti-Drug Policy 
Notice of Motion to Establish Special Senate Committee 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Honourable senators, I give notice that on June 10, 1999, I will move: 
Business of the Senate 
I am aware that a number of committees are scheduled to meet this afternoon. 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
I ask the Deputy Leader of the Government to reconsider.  
I, too, have a supplementary question regarding this matter. 
On our side, we are asked to be responsible and respond. 
Is the deputy leader telling me that I will be able to present this motion?  
I will not try to block a return to Notices of Motion. 
I am simply explaining the importance of the second reading speeches coming down this afternoon.  
We might even be out of here much sooner than anticipated.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I agree with my honourable colleague, and I support her suggestion. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is there agreement to move immediately to Delayed Answers, honourable senators?  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
That was to allow committees to sit on Wednesday afternoons. 
Now we are being told that that convention or understanding is no longer valid. 
We are saying we can review it.  
I will then ask leave of the Senate to revert to Notices of Motions.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Social Affairs, Science and Technology 
Committee Authorized to Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
Leave having been given to revert to Notices of Motions: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
That system worked for a long time. 
I will not initiate a debate on our arrangement as such. 
Honourable senators, there is an even more radical solution possible. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Committee Authorized to Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Committee Authorized to Meet During Sitting of the Senate 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted to permit the Honourable Senator Comeau to present his motion verbally?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
They are a group of parliamentary interns from Western Kentucky University. 
This year, for the first time, we have two interns placed with senators. 
Kelly Rich is with Senator Losier-Cool and Rebecca Ellmore is with Senator Comeau.  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
It deals with improving the safety of our children and other vulnerable people. 
Allow me to give honourable senators a bit of background. 
This does not expunge the conviction, nor does it erase the record. 
The conviction is a matter of historical fact. 
That is what Bill C-69 will help us to do.  
This bill is rendering official steps that have already been taken. 
More than 700,000 searches have been conducted to date.  
Obviously, that is exactly what is intended by the Criminal Records Act. 
For most purposes, these records should be invisible. 
All 10 were adopted. 
Ministers of Justice from all jurisdictions have supported this principle. 
Consent of the applicant will always be required. 
Finally, the Solicitor General must agree that disclosure of the record is warranted. 
At present, automatic revocation applies only to indictable offences. 
Honourable senators, these are important changes. 
They are based on experience with earlier and effective measures already instituted by the government. 
They received the unanimous support of all parties in the other place. 
For those reasons, I believe that Bill C-69 merits our support.  
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
The regulatory power referred to in the bill is a matter of policy. 
What lies behind the government's policy?  
We should be able to agree on these definitions. 
What is the government policy? 
That will avoid further complication and further legislative difficulty.  
On motion of Senator Nolin, debate adjourned.  
Public Sector Pension Investment Board Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
Clearly, therefore, inaction is not an option.  
Unfortunately, a final agreement became impossible. 
The bill deals with surpluses in the following ways:
First, it ensures the gradual reduction of existing surpluses over a period of 15 years. 
Any such increase would be limited to 0.4 per cent of earnings per year.  
They will be beneficial to all stakeholders. 
The time to act is long overdue. 
On motion of Senator Stratton, debate adjourned.  
Canada Travelling Exhibitions Indemnification Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
The cost of circulating a major exhibition can be exorbitant, sometimes prohibitively high. 
However, all citizens should have access to their cultural heritage. 
That is not a new idea. 
That is a concept that is already well established. 
A program of indemnification will allow travelling exhibitions to hit the road. 
The United States is not an isolated case. 
All other countries with an indemnification program report similar results.  
Risk for the indemnifier is at a minimum because there are stringent eligibility criteria. 
There are other benefits that are equally important in this equation. 
Hon. Jean-Claude Rivest :
Honourable senators, unfortunately, I was not here. 
On motion of Senator Rivest, debate adjourned.  
Income Tax Amendments Bill, 1998 
Third Reading-Debate Continued 
Honourable senators, our current tax system is broken. 
It is complex and unfair. 
It inhibits savings, investment and job creation. 
I will pay it all to the government anyway, so why work more?  
It would restore fairness to the tax law by treating everyone the same. 
It would lower taxes. 
Would the rich benefit? 
A person with 10 times the income would not pay the least. 
His income tax would be 10 times as high.  
On motion of Senator Kinsella, debate adjourned.  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
We are now in a position to support these important amendments. 
Bill C-79 builds on these provisions and enacts additional reforms. 
Let me take a moment to highlight the provisions.  
Another important provision is victim safety. 
The amendments add a specific reference to the victim. 
The code provision will make it clear that the offender "shall pay" the surcharge. 
However, in practice, some victims have been discouraged from making an oral statement.  
They have a need for information. 
They have a need for safety. 
They have a need for their voice to be listened to and respected. 
Victims must be able to benefit from these amendments as quickly as possible.  
On motion of Senator Kinsella, for Senator LeBreton, debate adjourned.  
Foreign Publishers Advertising Services Bill 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I have not received the ruling as yet. 
However, it is at the translation stage. 
There is, however, a bit of business that we might complete. 
The motion was not moved yesterday. 
The point of order was taken first on the Orders of the Day. 
If you wish, I am in your hands in that regard.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Subject to the Speaker's ruling.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
This order will stand, awaiting the Speaker's ruling. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
In my view, we must wait until the Speaker's ruling has been given. 
If it is in order, we can then have the motion.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Debate suspended to await Speaker's ruling.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
