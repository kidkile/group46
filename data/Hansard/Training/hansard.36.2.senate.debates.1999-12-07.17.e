The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
HIS EXCELLENCY MR. FARES BOUEZ 
Lebanon-Member of Parliament for Kesrouan 
Hon. Pierre De Bane :
We are delighted to welcome Mr. Fares Bouez. 
He will also meet with researchers at the Institute of Strategic Studies. 
I would like to mention the exceptional contribution made by this community.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, the three minute period is up. 
Does the senator have leave to continue his statement?  
Canada strongly supports the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon. 
In conclusion, honourable senators, Lebanon embodies the exemplary values of tolerance, generosity and tenacity. 
It is a model for the whole world. 
Hon. Calvin Woodrow Ruck :
Honourable senators, we have come a long way since the days of slavery. 
My ancestors were slaves. 
We were supposed to live in areas comprised of "visible minority persons only." 
Human rights legislation rectified that. 
Hon. Lois M. Wilson :
Violence Against Gays and Lesbians 
Hon. Erminie J. Cohen :
As a Jew, this blatant act of hatred appalls me. 
I find this type of racism and discrimination deplorable. 
By ignoring the problem, we license them to practise. 
Canada-United States Relations 
Problems at Border Crossings 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Two-way trade has quadrupled in the last decade. 
Long, costly delays are the order of the day. 
All of us brought home forcefully, each in our own way, the same message.  
Our American colleagues have awakened to the problem. 
Massive investments in road and real infrastructure has just been allocated by Congress. 
This priority of investment has not been matched by the Canadian side. 
It is a matter of national pride.  
Canada plays a key role on the international scene. 
Ottawa regularly welcomes heads of states from all over the world. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
I will not abuse this privilege today. 
I will come back to this matter. 
Ottawa is the capital for all Canadians.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Mr. Bouez is accompanied by His Excellency the Ambassador of Lebanon to Canada.  
Income Tax Conventions Implementation Bill, 1999 
Report of Banking, Trade and Commerce Committee 
Tuesday, December 7, 1999 
The Standing Senate Committee on Banking, Trade and Commerce has the honour to present its 
Bill Referred to Foreign Affairs Committee 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Bill 
Tuesday, December 7, 1999 
Add the following after line 2: 
""Personal health information", with respect to an individual, whether living or deceased means: 
(a) information concerning the physical or mental health of the individual; 
(b) information concerning any health service provided to the individual; 
(a) Add the following after line 4: 
(d) Add the following after line 7: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Canada-United States Interparliamentary Group 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Appointment as Honorary Officer of the Senate- Felicitations on Retirement 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
This is a bittersweet occasion. 
It is sweet because he is so young. 
Even so, Richard has been in this place for a remarkable 44 years. 
May you have a long and happy retirement. 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
One-third of them have passed under his scrutiny. 
He has attended to 14 speakers and counselled nine Governors General.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
With that, my role would be to move adoption of the motion.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
It was moved by the Honourable Senator Boudreau, seconded by the Honourable Senator Lynch-Staunton: 
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators to adopt the motion?  
Pages Exchange Program with the House of Commons 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, my question is to the Leader of the Government. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I thank the honourable senator for the question. 
Obviously it is a matter of concern, particularly in certain areas of Atlantic Canada. 
Honourable senators, where I live is approximately 120 kilometres from Deer Lake. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
I said, "Why do you want to know where I will be?" 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Prudence is always a good element of any such program. 
As part of the overall planning, it simply demonstrates a level of prudence. 
However, I do not think it should set off any alarm bells.  
If he has, would he give some credence to that possibility?  
My supplementary question is directed to the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
We can always hope that she will fail to work after December 31.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Therefore, I am afraid I cannot help him with the matter.  
That is an honest answer, honourable senators. 
Who in the government is in charge of finding a solution to the problem? 
Certainly, Minister Manley would be the lead minister in this regard.  
Yet, Minister Manley has no clue about it. 
The responsible minister does know anything about the plan. 
How does one arrive at a solution to a problem such as this?  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I am sure the honourable senator would be aware of that.  
Honourable senators, I appreciate that. 
I am not trying to rush things. 
Plight of Homeless-Status of Government Strategy 
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson :
At that time, there seemed to be great urgency. 
A government source is quoted as follows: 
We just haven't delivered. 
Not everyone is happy about it. 
I do not want to rely solely on this article. 
"Shortly" is always a very strange word here.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
I can assure the honourable senator that this process has not been stalled. 
Honourable senators, I thank the leader for that answer. 
In the meantime many people are suffering.  
It is clear that they do have a role to play. 
Honourable senators, my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
This is a pretty poor performance for the number one country in the world.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I recognize the report to which the honourable senator refers. 
Plan to Establish Coherent Foreign Aid Policy 
Hon. Lois M. Wilson :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
It remains an important objective of the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade.  
Honourable senators, I would hate to be that definitive. 
Composition of Budget for Foreign Aid 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Honourable senators, the Prime Minister has indicated that the aid budget will be increased. 
The aid budget has been depleted to a 30-year low. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Our peacekeeping role has been expanded dramatically. 
Perhaps I could enlighten the minister. 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
Is that a change in the Liberal government's position? 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Is there a record of that meeting? 
Honourable senators, the answer is yes.  
Honourable senators, I am not Senator Kolber. 
I do not know what was in his head. 
Therefore, I gave no response to that request.  
A member of the committee then moves a motion in that respect. 
Authorization is thereby given, if that motion is carried, to the chair to present it. 
We need clarification on those two matters.  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I should like to speak to this point of order.  
I have listened to Senator Kinsella. 
I am not sure whether he is concerned about three matters or one matter. 
I was given a copy.  
You were the only one, then.  
I received that while coming into the chamber. 
I will not get into that, however.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
The committee decided to report the bill. 
I request confirmation of that.  
No, that was not done.  
I do not see the link that the Speaker can make. 
It is a report to the Senate; it is not a Speaker's report. 
I do not know what this term "special order" means. 
The Speaker acted on our behalf, without explanation and without warning. 
It is also possible to interpret it the way Senator Lynch-Staunton interpreted it. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Perhaps I could explain why I wish to speak at this time. 
Senator Kinsella raised an interesting point. 
The same was true of Senator Kirby. 
Senator Kirby and I had no steering committee. 
Together, we were the steering committee, and that arrangement worked quite well. 
I wonder if Senator Kroft was made aware of this. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
They are wrapped into one. 
This situation is not of our making, by the way.  
Honourable senators, there are several elements to the point of order.  
The report was not presented by the chair nor the deputy chair. 
All these issues should be canvassed.  
Honourable senators, we may be jumping the gun a bit. 
We only had a report presented. 
We have not taken that report into consideration. 
However, I find Senator Kinsella's point most interesting. 
The Banking Committee was to deal with the bill first. 
The language we used at the time anticipated that study. 
If that is done, all of Senator Kinsella's concerns can be addressed. 
To do that we need both committee reports before us at the same time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
If not, I will take the matter under advisement. 
There is no motion and no amendment at that point. 
There is no discussion. 
That is the situation we are in now. 
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Bill 
Report of Committee Adopted 
Bill C-6 stems from that commitment.  
The government has authored what can truly be called a masterpiece of electronic commerce. 
They came before us arguing for a variety of amendments. 
Let me just give you some illustrative examples.  
Last Thursday, we heard from a series of health care witnesses. 
We had many hours of hearings. 
That, honourable senators, is essentially the background to the report. 
I would urge honourable senators to read that.  
That, honourable senators, is the background behind the bill. 
The amendment was passed unanimously by the committee. 
Therefore, honourable senators, I would urge your adoption of the committee's report.  
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Would the honourable senator accept a question?  
What instructions does the honourable senator have to ensure that this does not happen again? 
Here, you are amending a bill and sending it back to the other chamber. 
What went wrong with this process?  
I can only speculate on that. 
Senator Oliver's question is a good one. 
That is what we normally think about it. 
Labs is the obvious one. 
There are also occupational therapy services and some diagnostic services. 
Therefore, I think there was an honest and early oversight. 
Honourable senators, what occurred here was a series of inadvertent things. 
That leads to my second question. 
That is a good question. 
The problem with that option is that you cannot do it quickly. 
They all have different privacy codes. 
Honourable senators, I begin where Senators Oliver and Kirby left off.  
I do, however, wish to flag one other matter in the bill. 
We have been told, "Well, they cannot simply be disclosed. 
There must be some reason for it. 
All this is very subjective, especially 20 years after the person has died.  
The government can take very considerable pride in having forged that consensus.  
I am also strongly supportive of the amendment. 
They are not particularly happy with our amendment. 
They wanted us to go in a different direction. 
They testified to the committee that they wanted us to strengthen and toughen the legislation. 
I agree with them. 
I would also like to see much stronger protection. 
Some witnesses spoke only to the e-commerce sections of the bill. 
In fact, they were glowing in support of this bill. 
I, for one, was not prepared to give them a total exemption. 
Surely, that is not informed consent. 
Honourable senators, the involved parties needed to have their feet put to the fire. 
The testimony heard by the committee members was divided and confusing. 
That balance does not exist in this legislation. 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Honourable senators, I have a short question. 
I alerted Senator Carstairs to this question earlier today.  
The honourable senator has identified our dilemma. 
Others said it would not do that. 
In that way, we will not be harming research. 
Our researchers have done a good job of doing that in the past. 
Thus, we need to develop protocols. 
Frankly, however, we need the time to do it.  
Another sloppy job in the other place.  
They did a sloppy job in the other place. 
To be fair to them, they did not do it deliberately.  
They were told, "It is an e-commerce bill. 
It does not impact on you." 
That is exactly what they did.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Motion agreed to and report adopted, on division.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Bill to Amend-Report of Committee Adopted 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Honourable senators, I shall try to be brief. 
One offence is one too many. 
I will not name the city involved, because criminal charges are pending. 
In 1985, a prominent man in a city in Quebec established a daycare centre. 
This was the only daycare centre in the city, located near Montreal. 
It is not a miracle solution. 
I support this report.  
Such important definitions cannot be relegated to the regulations. 
This is a fundamental value of our system. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall the bill be read the third time?  
Canadian District of the Moravian Church of America 
Private Bill to Amend Act of Incorporation- Second Reading 
This time, nothing has changed. 
Therefore, I would ask honourable senators to move this bill forward.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and bill read second time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Honourable senators, with leave, at the next sitting of the Senate.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable Senator Taylor, bills are normally sent to committee. 
That is the normal practice.  
I know that, honourable senators, but this is not a normal bill. 
It is the third time that it has been before us. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I am in the hands of the Senate, of course. 
Then I will move a motion to that effect. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I am sorry, I have a motion before me now. 
Then, honourable senators, I will move an amendment to the motion. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion in amendment?  
Motion in amendment agreed to.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion as amended?  
Energy, the Environment and Natural Resources 
Committee Authorized to Engage Services and Travel 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
I wish to suggest that we deal with this matter now. 
I invite Senator Spivak to comment on that modification.  
I hope that satisfies the honourable senator on that count.  
I think it is very useful to the work of the committee. 
In the normal course, that committee does just that. 
That is the only answer I can give Senator Robichaud.  
Honourable senators, I am prepared to modify it. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
No, just the words "and outside Canada." 
Those are the words that should be taken out.  
No, just the words "and outside."  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is there consent that these words be removed from the motion?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, we are back to the main motion, as amended. 
Shall we proceed with the question?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion, as modified?  
Motion as modified agreed to.  
Review of Anti-drug Policy 
Motion to Form Special Senate Committee- Debate Adjourned 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin , pursuant to notice of November 2, 1999, moved: 
I did so amply in my remarks on June 14.  
These people came from all walks of life. 
I also participated in a number of open line programs during the summer. 
Despite very busy schedules, many students put themselves out to take part in the discussions. 
They expressed surprise that such an initiative could come from the Senate. 
The law's view on the non-medical use of drugs is one such issue.... 
Senators would perform a public service if they did the job on their own.  
They are the level of government closest to the citizen. 
Like all of us, they are looking for alternative solutions to these social problems. 
I certainly support the motion you brought forward to the Senate. 
Let us return now to the work of the committee. 
It would be hard work. 
We want to provide transparent and objective information checked by committee members. 
Why do I use the word "morality", honourable senators? 
Because there is a great deal of research in the field. 
Each committee member would have responsibility for one facet of the examination. 
This could easily take close to two years. 
There will be a federal election along the way. 
On motion of Senator Kenny, debate adjourned.  
Committee Authorized to Study Matters Related to Its Mandate 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau : pursuant to notice of December 2, 1999, moved: 
That the Committee report no later than December 12, 2000; and 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
Senator Nolin is asking for one on illicit drugs. 
Senator Kirby is asking for one on health services. 
Some of these may go on for a year or two. 
In Senator Nolin's case, it will be three years.  
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I wish to ask a question of the Honourable Senator Comeau. 
I think I know the answer, but let me confirm. 
I shall come to that in a few moments. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, no other senator wishes to speak. 
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Committee Authorized to Permit Electronic Coverage 
Hon. Gerald J. Comeau , pursuant to notice of December 2, 1999, moved: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Committee Authorized to Engage Services 
Committee Authorized to Permit Electronic Coverage 
Hon. Lise Bacon , pursuant to notice of December 6, 1999, moved: 
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
This requirement has become superfluous. 
Committees should be left to make up their own minds in this regard.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, are there any other senators who wish to speak?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Committee Authorized to Engage Services 
Hon. Lise Bacon , pursuant to notice of December 6, 1999, moved: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Senate adjourned until Wednesday, December 8 at 1:30 p.m.
