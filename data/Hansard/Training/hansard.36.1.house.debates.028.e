Wednesday, November 5, 1997 
The House met at 2 p.m. 
WINNIPEG BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB 
Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):
They removed some 400,000 sandbags. 
They did a superb job. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, why strike a subcommittee to study sports in Canada? 
Is it because our national passion, hockey, is going south? 
The study is either a waste of time or a blank cheque.  
Why are we doing it? 
Canadians are proud of their athletes but this study will do nothing to support- 
The hon. member for Parkdale-High Park.  
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
As well, my constituents would like to see continuing support for small business.  
They are not willing to pay this huge price for political pandering.  
Mr. Maurice Godin (Chateauguay, BQ):
We salute you all.  
Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):
May they rest in peace.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
LIEUTENANT COLONEL BILLY BARKER 
Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin-Swan River, Ref.):
Billy Bishop called him the deadliest air fighter who ever lived. 
PREMIER OF NOVA SCOTIA 
Mr. Joe McGuire (Egmont, Lib.):
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
But what is going on, really? 
The hon. member for Vaudreuil-Soulanges.  
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
Montreal is, to all intents and purposes, under protection.  
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
The Liberals have done it again. 
It is another sneaky backroom political deal.  
Mr. Guy Saint-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabasca, PC):
Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe-Grey, Lib.):
Talk about representing a special interest group.  
Reformers should be ashamed. 
There is no end to their hypocrisy.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
I would like to ask the prime minister this question. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the affirmation of the hon. lady is not true. 
We have followed Canadian regulations. 
The law permitted us to do what we did.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this government bypassed the entire process. 
The deal has already been approved for these reactor plants. 
It does not matter what the government does.  
What a double standard.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, again the Reform Party is up in the House of Commons. 
They did not want to have anything at all. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Ensuring a healthy environment for Canadians is a major foreign policy goal''. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am happy to know that they are against nuclear energy. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Let us take a look at his damn, China's Three Gorges Dam.  
Can the prime minister explain his own government's damn hypocrisy?  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, nice answer, but it is completely irrelevant. 
I was asking about Three Gorges Dam.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, again they do not have a position.  
We want to do what is important for Canada. 
The only thing the Reform Party is proposing is to do nothing.  
We will not listen to the Reform Party. 
We will do what is right.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, obviously things are getting seriously diluted.  
Every day, it looks for significant problems. 
Today, the focus is water. 
It is truly bizarre.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
I repeat my question to the plumber of health. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We have fully respected the jurisidiction of the provinces.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question to the Minister of Health will be clear and simple.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the answer is yes.  
That is the answer given by the Quebec health minister.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Bill C-14 was introduced last Friday.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I plan to share the contents of this letter with the hon. member. 
I have a copy here for him.  
I would ask you not to do that.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the prime minister.  
As a matter of policy AECL conducts an environmental analysis of all its projects.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I hope the prime minister will address this question.  
Now he is at it again.  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Second, Canada has sold thus far nine nuclear reactors. 
The Canadian public has not lost one cent on any repayment. 
The hon. member for Sherbrooke.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We always respect the law.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
I guess he just does not support the practice. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
I ask him not to evade it or avoid it but to just answer it.  
Which will it be? 
How is it going to pay for it?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have a very good record. 
Therefore, we know how to manage the affairs of the nation. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Why will the Prime Minister not tell us- 
We are pushing the envelope a little bit today. 
How is the government going to pay for it? 
All of those will be part of the equation. 
Canada will have a position that works.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Does the minister know how to read? 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the plumbing is still plugged.  
It is too late now to protect the Bloc's position. 
They made an enormous mistake. 
We obtained the prior agreement of Quebec and of all the other provinces.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, let's be serious. 
We are in this House and we are speaking to the government. 
Dear colleagues, I would ask that you refrain from showing letters. 
Letters may be quoted, but you are asked not to display them like that.  
I would ask the hon. member from Roberval to pose his question.  
Mr. Speaker, my question is very simple. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is really strange. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
The report contained 11 recommendations.  
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
We just received Mr. Bissett's report. 
It includes some very interesting recommendations and we intend to follow up on them.  
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my supplementary question is for the same minister. 
Does the minister know today where the triad gang leader is? 
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
That technology has proven to be efficient and safe and is respected.  
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Environmental specifications were a part of the bidding process imposed by Turkey.  
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, Albertans mourn the untimely death of Senator Walter Twinn. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we were for an elected Senate. 
Reformers want to have it both ways. 
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this does not require constitutional change. 
May I remind the Prime Minister that in Alberta the precedent has already been set. 
The late Stan Waters was elected as senator to the Senate in 1989. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
SEARCH AND RESCUE HELICOPTERS 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Public Works and Government Services.  
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
It hires young people to help small business- 
Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel:
Mr. Speaker, they are not interested in jobs.  
It has created almost 500 jobs.  
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Why the double standard for British Columbians?  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I am from British Columbia, just like the minister of fisheries. 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
What counts is an agreement with the Americans. 
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
I want to ask a question of the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
Will he support their proposal and not give us more rhetoric? 
What will he finally- 
The hon. Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I think it would be irresponsible to pit one region against another and make comparisons. 
I think the member will grant that. 
The hon. member for Bras d'Or.  
Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Natural Resources.  
The hon. Minister of Natural Resources.  
The study is being conducted by the auditor general. 
I will take the hon. member's request under advisement.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the government is committed to legally binding targets in Kyoto. 
We are dealing with every partner in this country in reaching our goals and timetables. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question was quite precise. 
That was the question I asked.  
When will they know the agenda? 
What will be discussed? 
The hon. Minister of the Environment.  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
The agenda for that meeting is known to them.  
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
The Customs Tariff Act is currently before the House. 
The hon. Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
The minister has two choices. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the President of the Treasury Board.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
The hon. member for Sherbrooke.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister. 
It has to do with the west coast fishery. 
I see he has just stepped out of the House. 
I hope he will be able to join us again.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
There was no provision in it for continuing those annexes or for settling disputes. 
His party signed that defective treaty which is the cause of our current problems.  
Strangway and Ruckelshaus are able to report when they wish. 
I have two groups to introduce to hon. members today. 
Let us welcome, dear colleagues, these teachers who are educating future generations of Canadian citizens.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
I hope that that process does not occur again.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
The hon. House leader for the Reform Party is accurate in what he says. 
If ministers quote from documents, they should be tabled. 
I urge him to have these tabled before the end of today's session.  
Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre-Rosedale, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise pursuant to Standing Order 34(1).

Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to present petitions today.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
They ask that all violent offenders are excluded from conditional sentencing. 
I am happy to support that.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have the pleasure to present three petitions.  
Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):

Mr. Eugene Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester, Lib.):
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
For that I salute her.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
It has to do with the abolition of nuclear weapons. 
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
They want to protect section 43 of the Criminal Code.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
It is with great honour that I present these two petitions.  
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have three petitions to present today. 
The first ones has to do with the family.  
LABELLING OF ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the second petition has to do with the issue of alcohol misuse.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
They also point out that the public mourns those losses.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
All the petitioners are from the Kamloops constituency.  
They are asking for a repeal of section 43.

The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Speaker, I think you will find unanimous consent for the following motion. 
That the necessary staff do accompany the members of the committee.  
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.) moved: 
That the Committee present its final report no later than November 30, 1998; and 
That a Message be sent to the Senate to acquaint that House accordingly.  
For other parents, however, this is a difficult task. 
They may vie for the loyalty of their children.  
There can also be genuinely complex issues that need to be resolved. 
I believe this is very important. 
This can be done if the committee is steadfast in focusing on children. 
I urge all members of the House to support the motion. 
Unfortunately, because of prior engagements, I have to leave the House in a few minutes. 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am also pleased that the Minister of Justice is still with us. 
There have been deliberations among all the parties about this subject matter.  
I believe I have the consent of the House for the following motion: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
The groundswell was enormous and powerful. 
In fact, public support for the position taken by the Senate surprised the government.  
That was widely held across the country by most Canadians, men and women.  
The House of Commons concurred with the amendments the next day. 
The Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada said: 
In the last election our party made a commitment to make families a priority. 
We would ensure that agreements concerning access to children are respected an enforced. 
We also said that we would make families a priority. 
I quote from our literature: 
Family time is not a luxury. 
It's time to make families a priority again.  
He says in part: 
The manipulation of time becomes the prime weapon in the hands of the alienator.  
Such devolution, she believes, would result in joint custody after a divorce.  
She apparently was not in support of it. 
The terms have been read out by the Speaker. 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Is there any area more provincial than water? 
Things are getting more and more complicated with the government over there. 
So there you are, what a fine great country Canada is.  
Finally, we address a subject similar to this motion. 
But when they divorce, this is federal legislation. 
I hope they will find enough of them awake to fill the positions. 
I will give you a few examples of this. 
The federal government has nothing to do with it. 
The federal government has nothing to do with this. 
Then there is the federal government's unwarranted intrusion in the lives of individuals. 
What is the federal government doing in this area? 
It is provocation, pure and simple. 
It has no business in this area of jurisdiction.  
They are supposed to be.  
Yes, they are supposed to be, as one of my colleagues said. 
But, perhaps we should look at the background to this motion.  
What is this motion about? 
It concerns both divorce and separation. 
It is much broader. 
The problem between Canada and Quebec would have been settled 35 years ago.  
I argued matrimonial cases before I was elected to office. 
This model takes into account the income of both parents and the length of custody. 
And all this has been in effect since May 1, 1997.  
They are talking about family mediation as though it were the discovery of the century. 
We can dream, but we know the federal government will not do it. 
And that is what we shall do.  
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
I don't think there is much to be proud of in this respect. 
He often makes reference to the senators. 
It is important that he realize this.  
I have a question for the hon. member. 
That was my comment and my question.  
I think that the hon. member across the way is completely unaware of this.  
What happens with separations? 
No. Because the provinces have passed legislation which reflects what they are.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
It is one that I have some particular interest in.  
I am pleased to support the structuring of this committee. 
I welcome its views. 
The courts then revised that and dealt with the status quo doctrine.  
It is with that difficulty that these tests have been developed.  
It is not good for the children to have constant upheaval.  
The tests that I have indicated filter down into provincial legislation. 
My hon. colleague in the Bloc talked about the jurisdictional problems. 
It is extremely difficult. 
There has been some indication that this committee will look at all of those questions. 
I would support the committee and the creation of the committee. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
That is pretty clear, as press releases go. 
So I am forced to answer in English. 
I would see an opportunity at the federal level. 
What is the role I see for the federal government. 
I will use as an example my own province. 
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Some people are opposed to joint custody.  
Money is important, but the quality of the relationship is even more important. 
Many people have grown up in poor environments but are still happy. 
Money is important, but it is not the only thing. 
The quality of the relationship is still more important''.  
Its approach is not in the children's best interests. 
It could, and should, attach more importance to parent-child relationships. 
States shall render appropriate assistance to parents in the performance of their child-rearing responsibilities''.  
I have raised some of the questions I wish to see the joint committee examine. 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Ms. Diane St-Jacques:
It should be set up.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I did not quite understand the hon. member's approach. 
Ms. Diane St-Jacques:
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed listening to the speech.  
I wonder what the member's thoughts are on these types of issues. 
It is one of the serious injustices that we have.  
Ms. Diane St-Jacques:
But our preference goes to joint custody.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
The father who had legal custody could not have access to the child. 
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Divorce, however, under the Canadian Constitution, is a federal jurisdiction.  
That was my question.  
Ms. Diane St-Jacques:
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a few short comments to make on this topic.  
Maybe this is what is contemplated. 
Many of those couples stay together for a while. 
It is heart wrenching to see the children being jerked around.  
That is a noble goal.  
Sometimes we land up with built-in prejudices and biases. 
That may not necessarily be the case.  
Once again the children are the ones who suffer.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Unfortunately, we had rather different views on many matters. 
But that was part of the debate, and each one presented his arguments.  
Madam Speaker, I never was on the justice committee. 
Is it provincial or is it federal? 
Madam Speaker, I wish take the opportunity to set a matter straight for the member. 
We sat together on the ethics code committee. 
I believe that the answer is obvious, it is the provinces.  
There is already a lot of social legislation to assist families. 
But my question is the following:
There is absolutely nothing wrong with that idea.  
We need to make them our focus. 
There is a great need there. 
Personally I think we ought to emphasize more the stabilization of families. 
In this country we are nigh taxed to death. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
With the House's consent, we can resume the debate.  
Does the House gives its unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The motion, in part, reads as follows: 
The subject of children strikes a chord. 
Separation is a provincial matter as well.  
We have no business messing about where we don't belong. 
There are provisions already in place''.  
They say that the purpose of this is to clarify things for people.  
Yes, I can imagine. 
I thank the hon. member opposite. 
Sometimes you have to grab their attention.  
I think this is inexcusable intrusion by the federal government in family matters. 
I find that outrageous.  
In the past year, Quebec has passed two laws. 
I will identify them and then we will discuss them a bit. 
What does this mean? 
It is already set up. 
The important thing in all this is that people are doing something. 
I see some movement across the floor. 
That is the purpose of my speech this afternoon. 
I want people to know that.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
(Division deemed demanded and deferred) 
DRINKING WATER MATERIALS SAFETY ACT 
Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain, Lib.):
We want to keep it that way. 
Why do we need to do this? 
Because safe drinking water is an essential resource. 
Because Canadians expect their water to be protected. 
Indeed we have some of the best drinking water in the world. 
Since 1968 Canada has published these guidelines for safe drinking water. 
They recommend maximum levels of many chemicals, micro-organisms and radioactive substances. 
Other provinces are enforcing them through their own provincial mechanisms.  
This partnership has been working extremely well but we must do more. 
Home water filters are a good example. 
This is a growing industry. 
These devices are just one area of concern.  
This is simply unacceptable.  
This bill will do that. 
This legislation will make good on these promises.  
I urge members of the House to give their wholehearted support to this legislation.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
On a point of order, the hon. opposition whip.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent to call it 5.30 p.m.?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
They do not have to be a member of the government. 
Joyriding is no longer a joy. 
It is now very much a serious crime. 
It is not a victimless crime. 
In the city of Montreal there are 40,000 auto thefts every year. 
They do not do it for the money. 
They do not do it to sell the cars. 
They realize that if they get caught there will not be serious consequences. 
So they steal cars.  
The average joyrider causes $4,000 in damage per car. 
That is not a joyride. 
This section of the code is unfortunately tailormade for young offenders. 
The courts allow some discretion for judges. 
That is why this bill is before us today.  
There is only $3.5 million a year stolen in bank robberies. 
I do not think we should continue with that.  
He stopped and helped the kid. 
He had driven off the road, down into a creek. 
His friend, who was in the car, had a broken back. 
My brother got on his cell phone and called for an ambulance and the police.  
They took the other fellow down to the police station. 
He waved at him and said ``see you around''.  
He did that every weekend. 
It seemed as though there was nothing the police could do. 
They caught the guy. 
Nothing could be done. 
That is very unfortunate.  
An RCMP officer gave a presentation at that meeting. 
ICBC was there as well, our local insurance company. 
They also went through some of the things we could do. 
It is more than just the $4,000 in damages. 
It is a national problem. 
This bill would address that problem. 
It would give direction to the police and to the courts. 
My bill would make this a serious offence under the Criminal Code. 
It should be treated as a serious offence.  
The parent might say ``What can you do with these young people? 
Jimmy steals cars and that is the way she goes''. 
Therefore we are going to hold you responsible for some of the damages''.  
I hope people here in the House recognize the seriousness of this problem. 
It also affects the young people themselves.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member has asked that his bill be made votable. 
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mr. John Maloney (Erie-Lincoln, Lib.):
I would like to commend him for his work in this field.  
However, these changes will result in a more draconian law. 
The difference lies in the intention of the person who takes the vehicle. 
The difference lies in the intent of the taker. 
An obvious concern arises here. 
The courts have provided us with the answer. 
Each case must stand on its own facts. 
For example, how long did the offenders keep the car? 
How far did he drive it? 
Did he make an effort to return it? 
Did he drive the car recklessly? 
All the circumstances must be considered.  
This is what I am asking the hon. member to ponder. 
What about the youth who has no previous record? 
I quote the first principle: 
The amendment deals with the responsibility of occupants of the vehicle.  
This amendment shows that the government does take the section of the code very seriously.  
The amendment in Bill C-209 is not really necessary.  
Let me give a quite different example. 
This is an Alberta case. 
The offender admitted to taking the vehicle for purposes of joyriding. 
Of what was he convicted? 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Unanimous consent was not received. 
This is for the record.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Let us call a spade a spade. 
What does this subsection say?  
This is another offence which, while not being as serious as theft, is also punishable. 
They created two separate offences, each with its own characteristics. 
Each situation would have its own section in the Criminal Code. 
The goal would be to limit the judge's discretion as much as possible. 
It undermines the Young Offenders Act. 
I think we will never succeed in sharing the same views on this matter.  
There is an attempt to increase the penalties for this offence.  
Let it be clear, I do not want to minimize that. 
Are not all young people at that age attracted to cars? 
On a whim, the young person used a car. 
Does this make that child a criminal?  
That child, on a whim, used a vehicle. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
It should lead us to understand that these approaches have failed.  
We need to ensure we are investing in education. 
This is no answer. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
I also appreciate his thoughtful and rightful initiative in doing so.  
It is not a joyful ride. 
It should be called a painful ride. 
We do not know who will be a target tomorrow in our communities. 
The hon. member for Erie-Lincoln said even he was a victim of this crime.  
In my riding 27 cars are stolen every day. 
As a result of this, insurance premiums are increasing. 
What else will help to reduce this type of crime?  
Let us consider the record of other countries, such as Singapore. 
Young criminals know that the penalties are tough. 
That is the way to control these crimes. 
Someone has to be held responsible for these painful rides. 
Who else will be held accountable? 
These young kids are stealing cars and going for joyrides. 
Why not hold the parents responsible?  
This is an excellent bill. 
We need to bring about these changes. 
Someone has to take the initiative. 
I appreciate the initiative of the hon. member for Fraser Valley. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I recognize the hon. member for Fraser Valley. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it has been an interesting debate. 
It is almost like a take note debate. 
I went through the list. 
The trouble is we cannot put all of that in the Criminal Code. 
Of course I cannot put all of them into this bill.  
That is an initiative which works well in our area.  
To prevent the crime of course is far better.  
Citizen patrols have been very successful in my riding. 
It almost entices someone to steal.  
All of this I believe is Reform Party policy as well. 
They are well aware of the consequences of their actions. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I regret, but the time has expired.  
The adjournment proceedings are to start in seven minutes. 
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Canada falls short in this regard. 
Canada falls short in other tangibles as well. 
The government has not done enough. 
Hon. David Kilgour (Secretary of State (Latin America and Africa), Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank my hon. colleague from Winnipeg Centre.  
The conference was hosted by the Norwegian government in conjunction with the ILO and UNICEF. 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
I found the answer of the minister very interesting when he said: 
We are looking at a number of options for rail service across the country. 
Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Consultations with stakeholders and local community leaders have been ongoing since 1990. 
Let me assure my hon. friend that his concerns have not gone unnoticed. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
We are waiting for the federal government's decision. 
Mrs. Sue Barnes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question.  
These are being actively reviewed. 
The government is treating Quebec's request as top priority. 
Quebec will soon be advised of the federal government's position on the matter.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.41 p.m.)
