Monday, December 15, 1997 
The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Business of the Senate 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Noel Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, that is also our understanding.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, is it agreed?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Under our rules, these should be presented orally during "Senators' Statements." 
Honourable senators, I have a question before we proceed. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The matter is simply frozen in time, as it was last Friday. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
We welcome you to the Senate of Canada.  
Role of Parliament in Setting Parameters 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the judges made an interesting ruling. 
It is necessary for legislators to speak. 
Reaffirmation of Commitment of Senators 
It belittles a cornerstone of our constitutional democracy. 
We hear far more about the perception. 
The Senate represents a huge collective wealth. 
A Canada in microcosm, which looks after the interests of all Canadians. 
Senator Cools put it aptly when she said: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable Senator Poulin, your three minutes have expired. 
Are you requesting leave to continue?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
We have identified what ails us. 
Percentage of Visible Minorities in Public Service 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
This report was released quietly, without any public fanfare. 
After reading it, it is not hard to determine why. 
Unfortunately, progress has occurred only at a snail's pace.  
Canadian society is adapting at a much quicker pace. 
That is the target set by the Government of Canada. 
How far have we come in 10 years? 
The situation is worse when we look at the executive group level. 
They do not need this bill. 
We have a serious problem and it will get worse in the years ahead. 
Our departments must make extra efforts to recruit from the visible minority population. 
They must reflect the face of Canada.  
Noticeably absent from this list was the Department of National Defence. 
It is unfortunate that the Department of Defence will not follow that practice.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I would ask for leave to continue.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Cape Breton Development Corporation 
Final Report of Special Committee Tabled 
Hon. John G. Bryden :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Canadian NATO Parliamentary Association 
Second Report of Forty-Third Annual Session held in Bucharest, Romania, Tabled 
Notice of Motion Proposing an Amendment 
Hon. Duncan J. Jessiman :
Special Committee Authorized to Extend Date of Final Report 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Business of the Senate 
Delay in Tabling Answers to Order Paper Questions-Request for Answers 
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Why on earth is the government taking so long to give us these basic facts?  
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I understand the concern of my honourable friend. 
I also congratulate him with the initiative he has taken with respect to alternative fuels. 
We have been pressing the government officials and the appropriate authorities responsible for responses.  
We will continue to try to make progress.  
Future Imposition of Federal Tolls on Highways-Government Position 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, the Constitution of Canada is such that highways fall under provincial jurisdiction. 
There is no doubt that there was some controversy with respect to Highway 104. 
I believe the figure was $55 million. 
Further Imposition of Tolls on Trans-Canada Highway-Government Position 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Indeed, there has been speculation that it would be done entirely through private financing. 
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I would be happy to do so. 
It can attack anyone, seniors and others.  
Delayed Answers to Oral Questions 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
(Response to question raised by Hon. J. Michael Forrestall on December 2, 1997) 
Safety is Transport Canada's first priority. 
Study of Health Effects of Gasoline Additive MTBE-Government Position 
(Response to question raised by Hon. Erminie J. Cohen on November 6, 1997) 
Answers to Order Paper Questions Tabled 
Defence-Costs of Destroying Land-mines 
Business of the Senate 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
However, I can wait until tomorrow.  
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
Hon. B. Alasdair Graham (Leader of the Government) :
I am concerned about what is happening with the workings of the Senate. 
Canada Pension Plan Investment Board Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
I rise today to discuss Bill C-2. 
Unofficially, many Canadians have a different name for this bill. 
They call it the largest tax grab in Canadian history.  
Otherwise, why not allow a full debate and adequate study? 
Honourable senators, Canadians will learn about it. 
They do not have time for further study. 
They have a deadline to meet. 
They have to deal with the provinces. 
Canadians need to know that not all provinces agree. 
Why, then, is this government in such a rush? 
They are left to speculate as to the government's true motives. 
Canadians are asking themselves whether this, too, can be politically motivated. 
We simply do not know.  
This country has only begun to move out of the last recession. 
Jobs are still hard to find. 
Lay-offs are still a common occurrence. 
Included in this category are farmers, fishermen, doctors and consultants. 
They are another target of the Finance Minister.  
For example, a self-employed individual earning $35,800 now pays $1,890 in contributions. 
This bill is supposed to help Canadians, yet it punishes the poor. 
This bill will punish our younger workers. 
They have a much more immediate need. 
One of the government's departments agrees with them. 
These are the Canadians who will be hardest hit by this new tax.  
The government is not willing to consider any other options.  
What will be the damage this time?  
The Finance department tells us that it should be neutral, with no major impact. 
There are other areas of concern. 
What are the long-term implications for this in the corporate sector?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable Senator Oliver, the 15-minute time allotted has expired. 
Are you asking for leave to continue?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
Hon. Duncan J. Jessiman :
As months went by it became clear that it was unrealistic. 
We started out flying blind and we are still flying blind. 
We can then decide whether this is good legislation for our country. 
If there are, are they better than the present bill?  
By that, he means the young people of Canada. 
The principal beneficiaries of underfunding are those of us in Generation XS - 
You can make that "S" mean "senior" or "selfish." 
He goes on to state: 
We should also trim some of the CPP's frills. 
For instance, we still allow Generation XSers - 
And by that he means seniors - 
This makes no social policy sense:
Later, Mr. Courchene points out: 
The underfunded liability is a "sunk" societal cost. 
Let the Senate do the work it is mandated to do. 
Let this bill have a reasoned, sober, second thought.  
On motion of Senator LeBreton, debate adjourned.  
Linguistic School Boards-Motion to Amend Section 93 of Constitution Adopted 
AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF CANADA 
Paragraphs (1) to (4) of section 93 do not apply to Quebec." 
2. This Amendment may be cited as the Constitution Amendment , year of proclamation (Quebec).  
The debate on the resolution is nearing the end. 
First, we may regret that the delay was so short. 
All arguments for or against the resolution have been considered, I would say.  
That is the essence of the right to equality. 
The situation is no longer what it was in 1867. 
Since then, Quebec has gone through the "Quiet Revolution." 
Modern government legislates more and more in the field of education. 
That subject is not only important, it is vital. 
After the amendment, Quebec will have to legislate on education. 
I repeat, I am not a great fan of such clauses.  
This is part of our values. 
Quebec, Canada, and the other provinces are all free and democratic societies. 
Our judicial system is strong and impartial. 
Hon. Anne C. Cools :
Honourable senators, I rise to speak against this resolution. 
Mr. Brassard and I have a duty... 
And we will work together...  
Minister Dion is reported as saying: 
We have said that again and again and again.  
Obviously I did not hear it. 
No doubt about that.  
As you know, this position is highly unusual in the international community.  
I would submit that that is highly unusual in Canada. 
This is most disturbing. 
The child is the adult in formation. 
The school is the centre of human growth. 
A school is an institution for the vital, systematic, and critical assimilation of culture. 
Honourable senators, the purpose of school instruction is education. 
Education is the process of the development of human character and human formation. 
This debate is emerging in this country, and what we are voting on 
today will hasten the debate. 
In her 1954 book on Dante's works, Dorothy Sayers wrote: 
Back in the 1940s, she accomplished an enormous feat. 
She transformed the scriptures into a play for BBC broadcast. 
The result was astounding. 
I shall vote against it.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
In so doing, some citizens may be losers as the majority benefits. 
Quebec is basically a fair and tolerant society. 
Hon. Gerry St. Germain:
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Honourable Senator Lynch-Staunton.  
The honourable senator says that there will be a consultation process. 
The honourable senator is a Quebecer. 
Can he explain it to me, please?  
That is outside of this debate.  
However, the Liberal Party also supports it.  
It favours open consultation. 
The consultation which will take place in Quebec will be open and widespread. 
Remember, too, that 80 per cent of Quebecers are Catholics. 
The need for religion is still strong in Quebec. 
That is something no government can afford to ignore. 
At the same time, the Protestant minority will also be heard. 
To my mind, it will receive consideration.  
"Favoured" is the word. 
The tragedy is that only two faiths are being favoured. 
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
Honourable senators, I should like to address a question to the Honourable Senator Lynch-Staunton.  
Perhaps Senator Beaudoin could answer my question.  
Dissentient schools existed outside those two cities. 
Perhaps Senator Beaudoin can now respond.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Let us give Senator Beaudoin leave to respond.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
If the honourable senators agree, however, we can do as you wish.  
Honourable senators, I would ask that an exception be made. 
Senator Beaudoin does have this legal and constitutional knowledge. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Could I pose another question to the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I have a supplementary question, honourable senators. 
`Dissentient schools' are identified as being Catholic or Protestant. 
If they were part of the majority group, they did have representation within the majority. 
The only religious right lay with the dissentient or minority group. 
As I understand it, section 93 is interpreted and applied in each province differently. 
Dissentient schools applied elsewhere in the province. 
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
As a Canadian, I do not believe that secession is an option. 
It is a non-starter in any way, shape or form. 
I am wondering, senator, whether there is any correlation between these statements. 
All of a sudden we have adopted this attitude. 
Are we being driven to this by the separatist forces in the Province of Quebec? 
It has taken all this time to come to agreement. 
It is unfortunate, perhaps, that it is being sponsored by a separatist government. 
However, both parties have contributed to where we are today.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I must interrupt the debate. 
The sitting of the Senate was suspended.  
The sitting of the Senate was resumed.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, I apologize for the inconvenience. 
Honourable senators, I understand that we have concluded the debate on the motion.  
AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF CANADA 
Paragraphs (1) to (4) of section 93 do not apply to Quebec." 
2. This Amendment may be cited as the Constitution Amendment, year of proclamation (Quebec).  
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those honourable senators in favour of the motion please say "yea"?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Will those honourable senators against the motion please say "nay"?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
In my opinion, the "yeas" have it.  
And two honourable senators having risen.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I am advised that there will be a 20-minute bell. 
The vote will take place at 5:10 p.m. 
Motion sustained on the following division: 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
The proposed section 17(2) states: 
I would also ask you to refer to the proposed section 17(3). 
The letter, addressed to all members of Parliament and senators, says, among other things: 
We have recently been informed by the Clerk of the Committee - 
They go on to say in their brief: 
And who will teach these courses? 
They are saying that government cannot provide for courses in religion.  
Rather, a very wise accommodation was reached by the people involved in that province. 
In my judgment, it is a very dangerous hybrid. 
The Seventh-day Adventist community is of the same view. 
How do we determine what the protected group desires? 
Can we come up with a formula? 
The Hon. the Speaker :
May I have leave to continue, honourable senators?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
The Catholic community did not turn out in great numbers. 
People are not obliged to participate in that association of Catholics. 
That is not how that community determines its dogma or its teaching.  
Apart from the Roman Catholics, of course, are the Pentecostals. 
For the record, this is what he said: 
On motion of Senator Murray, debate adjourned.  
Bill to Amend-Report of Committee Adopted 
Honourable senators, I have the honour to move the adoption of this report.  
The bill was reported with three amendments.  
Two of those amendments concern the definition of the word "pollutant."  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
She has indicated to me that she does not wish to speak to this bill. 
On motion of Senator Kelly, debate adjourned.  
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration 
Hon. Eymard G. Corbin :
Honourable senators, I enlist your patience. 
The first paragraph of this report reads as follows: 
Three disciplinary measures are then listed. 
The report closes with the following words: 
In this particular case, a record of attendance was examined. 
What is the reason for this register? 
To my knowledge, it was never intended to be used for disciplinary reasons. 
The register does not mention the reasons why a senator is absent. 
This is, in my opinion, a sound rule.  
This is where such practices could lead.  
The Senate may appeal a Speaker's ruling. 
Ultimately, therefore, it is the assembly which decides on questions of privilege.  
This committee is authorized, first of all: 
f )(iii) states that the committee is empowered: 
(iii) to consider the orders and customs of the Senate and privileges of Parliament.  
This, in my opinion, must be understood generally, and not specifically.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
That is where the problem lies.  
Rule 93 makes this possible. 
That is how I understand the rules.  
Finally, I quote rule 96.(7), which provides: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable Senator Corbin, your 15 minutes are up.  
I think I said what I had to say, honourable senators.  
Honourable senators, I listened with great interest to my learned colleague Senator Corbin. 
He has, as always, researched the issues thoroughly and well. 
I would like to make some observations.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
I do not believe so. 
The senator is raising a point of order, and I am replying to that.  
Hon. Gerry St. Germain :
Is it a point of privilege or a point of order?  
The Hon. the Speaker :
It was a point of order that Senator Corbin raised.  
I did not think it necessary to repeat it at the end of my remarks.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Then it is a point of order.  
All the words before "but."  
It has delegated them in particular ways. 
That committee is making a report to this body which is the ultimate authority. 
Rule 86(1)( f )(ii) states: 
The same applies to the Rules Committee. 
I certainly believe that Senator Rompkey's report is in order. 
Honourable senators, I have a question to ask of Senator Kenny. 
I refer to rule 43(1) which states: 
The preservation of the privileges of the Senate is the duty of every Senator. 
Action to ensure such protection takes priority over every other matter before the Senate. 
I believe that that would be the proper way to proceed.  
I am not certain, and that is why I am seeking clarification. 
That is my concern, honourable senators. 
That is my main concern.  
I believe that we should be proactive rather than reactive. 
Honourable senators, I can only restate the facts with which I am familiar. 
At that time, the budget of the individual involved was limited. 
He was not given the authority to proceed as he intended. 
That information was communicated to him. 
I believe that is pretty good protection. 
The rule reads, and I quote: 
What exactly does "the internal management of the Senate" mean? 
I am not sure at all.  
Your answer is that the Senate will decide. 
I am not sure at all of that. 
These things are not cut and dried. 
However, some things are very clear. 
However, rule 86(1)( g ) states: 
Perhaps this is a broader interpretation. 
I think it is accepted that there are two possible interpretations.  
Having said that, there was a problem facing the Senate. 
This issue has continued on now that Parliament is sitting. 
It started on that basis, and this is a continuation. 
Therefore, I think all is quite appropriate.  
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, we are on a point of order. 
Senator Kenny has not made a speech. 
Senator Kenny, therefore, cannot answer questions on a point of order. 
A point of order has been raised about the rules. 
Honourable senators, I do not object to that at all. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration 
Eighth Report of Committee Adopted 
Honourable Senator Rompkey, P.C. ) 
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Conduct of Business-Inquiry 
It has been a long day. 
Will I get a chance to make this speech before Thursday night? 
If not, I will make it now. 
Hon. Sharon Carstairs (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
Much of what I am about to say will not surprise you.  
Let us for a moment consider this proposition.  
Committee sessions take place outside of this chamber. 
Then there is third reading debate and a final vote. 
I have always found this particular exercise somewhat unusual given the nature of this place. 
Such is not the case in the Senate. 
Honourable senators, I know that you know all of these things. 
The Senate is truly a chamber of sober second thought. 
I cannot possibly mention them all. 
In business, we have Senator Kolber, Senator Eyton, and many others. 
We have Senator Lavoie-Roux, Senator Milne and Senator Fairbairn. 
My point is that we cannot have it both ways. 
Hon. Jerahmiel S. Grafstein :
Will the honourable senator allow a question or two?  
It is difficult to be precise. 
I was re-elected four years in a row to the OSCE. 
I use that only as one specific example. 
In the Senate, it is at least that.  
Hon. John B. Stewart :
Honourable senators, I should like to ask Senator Kelly a couple of questions. 
Of course, the attendance must be more than just "reasonable." 
I have a second question. 
Some of my Liberal friends have heard me talk about the "TOM club." 
The "TOM club" is composed of senators from Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal. 
Honourable senators, it is very easy to agree with that statement. 
If he were in Vancouver, they would not do that.  
Honourable senators, I have a question for Senator Kelly, if he will entertain it.  
Honourable senators, Senator Kelly was the chairman of two special committees on terrorism. 
That was the first half of my question, senator.  
The second half had more to do with the example using Senator Grafstein. 
I would work in the evenings. 
The Hon. the Acting Speaker :
Hon. Joyce Fairbairn , pursuant to notice of December 12, 1997, moved: 
Approximately 70 years ago, honourable senators, I would not have had such an opportunity. 
There would have been no seat to rise from. 
The right for women to vote federally came in 1918. 
Her father was a frontiersman who travelled the plains. 
Why not five famous men? 
Honourable senators, that is a good question and there is a simple answer. 
Our male compatriots never had to break this fundamental barrier. 
It did not exist for them. 
Each of the Famous Five had both of those qualities in large measure. 
She married a clergyman at the age of 19. 
Following the death of her youngest daughter, she moved to Alberta in 1903. 
She was a writer and an advocate for the property rights for married women. 
Finally, Henrietta Muir Edwards grew up in Montreal and settled later in Alberta. 
She was the co-founder of the Victorian Order of Nurses. 
She put out a call for help. 
Women became eligible for summons to and membership in the Senate of Canada.  
Not one of the Famous Five ever received the call. 
I hope there will be many more of us in this chamber in the future. 
All of us are strong in our convictions. 
I believe their service deserves a special and a lasting tribute. 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, would the honourable senator take a couple of questions?  
I believe it was a man who wrote the letter. 
I believe one of the persons whose views he was concerned about was Nellie McClung. 
Does the honourable senator have any comments on that?  
I should like to see it before I comment on it, Senator Kinsella. 
It is hard to separate the two.  
I say that answers our question. 
We do not know our Canadian history. 
Honourable senators, I rise in support of the motion introduced by my colleague Senator Fairbairn.  
This celebration, of course, has taken place every year since.  
The contribution of these five women is significant. 
I am sure they would enjoy the company.  
The number of women running small businesses is increasing every day. 
We have seen a Canadian woman go into space. 
There is no place in society from which women are excluded. 
We are persons in every sense of the word.  
Therefore, I move the adjournment of the debate.  
On motion of Senator Kenny, debate adjourned.  
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
