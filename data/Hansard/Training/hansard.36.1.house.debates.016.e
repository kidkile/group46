EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 16 
Monday, October 20, 1997 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
INCOME TAX CONVENTIONS IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1997 
Mr. Speaker, I intend to be very brief this morning. 
With these three new treaties we will be up to 64. 
That taxing power was exercised only in the country of residence. 
This was not equitable and not fair.  
On the other hand it did not work so well going the other way.  
This is a desirable and hopeful result.  
There is also one other amendment that deals with capital gains. 
In a modern world this does not make a lot of sense.  
This is a desirable result. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
That really is not the full picture. 
It put many of the lowest income seniors there into terribly dire straits.  
The government was wrong then and it is wrong again today.  
As a result there was a lot of political heat felt by this government. 
The Liberals call this fairness. 
They say this is revenue neutral. 
If more seniors pay more taxes than they used to, that is a tax grab.  
I know this government has a problem when it comes to accounting. 
This is a very serious matter and I hope the government listens closely. 
Instead they get a 70% tax increase.  
Liberals must be happy that seniors have to get shaken down.  
That is what they are doing under the seniors benefit. 
They are doing very much the same thing under this bill.  
Everybody should be treated the same.  
There is a difference here. 
They are not included as taxable income.  
The U.S. government treats its taxpayers differently. 
They are taxed at source on those payments. 
There are no taxes for low income seniors on their social security benefits. 
There is progressivity and fairness. 
This government loves to lambaste our American friends for unfair taxes. 
This is not just a number, not just a figure. 
It was not fair, not right. 
The government grabs more. 
They call that fairness? 
Why do they have to pay 85% of their income into this system?  
That seems reasonable enough to us. 
So that they do pay their fair share but not a penny more.  
This government's idea of tax fairness is that everybody pays more. 
The government calls that a record of economic growth. 
I call it a record to be ashamed of. 
And today again it proposes yet another tax increase.  
The finance minister admits it.  
Whether he knew it or not, he did not tell the whole truth.  
Is it fairness or is it an increase? 
Is it a tax cut or is it a tax grab? 
I have a question. 
Surely they know what the dollar figure is. 
I call on my colleagues opposite to look at this bill.  
They are given their speaking notes. 
They have not read the bill. 
Why will members opposite not look beneath the surface? 
That is the challenge of representation. 
That is the economic record of the government.  
They are very sly. 
The Liberal government is very slick. 
I put the government on notice today. 
That is what it tried to do, but it will not get away with it.  
We will take it to committee. 
We will draw out debate. 
Those Canadians will not tolerate this kind of completely irresponsible approach to democratic deliberation.  
I say again that my hon. colleagues opposite should take a look at the facts. 
I was talking to a representatives of the organization today. 
That is a good question members opposite will have to answer.  
The government will be hearing from people like them.  
Who is forced to pay for it? 
That is where the money is going. 
I say shame on the government for having its priorities so desperately wrong.  
I was made aware of the problem as far back as 1995. 
Our interventions on this date back to 1995. 
He got it debated on several occasions, both in committee and in this House. 
I have some constructive criticism, given the importance of the subject. 
But Bill C-10 also includes other conventions. 
In other words, Canada has a great many tax treaties like this.  
We heard a lot about that during the 35th Parliament. 
Shall I talk about that? 
I will talk about them after all, as I have the time.  
They pay then with what they get through existing legislation. 
It's quite legal, nothing is illegal. 
Simply to avoid paying taxes, or to pay as little as possible. 
It is rather clear. 
These are two very important examples. 
How many employees work on these treaties? 
Probably several of these have already been signed.  
A hundred, twenty-five, twelve? 
Fortunately, this is a full time job. 
However, he is alone, and billions of dollars are at stake.  
I believe there must be international treaties. 
The Bloc Quebecois initiated it in 1995. 
To conclude, the Bloc Quebecois supports Bill C-10. 
Mr. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
It also amends tax treaties or conventions with the United States and the Netherlands.  
The bill is fairly lengthy and detailed. 
It also prevents fiscal evasion by citizens. 
In the main we support the direction in which the bill is going.  
What is happening to them is unfair because it is being done retroactively. 
That is the part of the bill which we as parliamentarians should look at changing.  
That is a system that was in use in this country for many years. 
That is what it was based on.  
That bill introduced a very important change. 
The protest continued for a fair amount of time. 
Last April the government made the announcement that there would be change. 
Indeed that change has been made in the bill which is before the House today.  
This is very unfair. 
This was done without properly consulting the people who are affected.  
It has lobbied on this issue. 
These citizens were not properly consulted. 
They certainly did not approve the change. 
For these people the change is not good enough. 
They did their planning based on the rules. 
The rules were changed after the game was played. 
It is extremely unfair.  
They have already budgeted for their groceries and clothing. 
It is a different situation altogether. 
That would be a good step in the right direction toward tax fairness. 
That is the kind of thing that should be done.  
What a shame, they pay more than their fair share of taxes. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the member a very simple question. 
He is so interested in fairness. 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
The government wanted to do the same thing with Bill C-10. 
Would they get a pension? 
It is another sneaky hidden one.  
We heard members this morning from the opposition and the government sides. 
I made some notes with respect to the speaker from the government side. 
I agree with the comments of the hon. member for Calgary Southeast. 
I would like to know what that number is. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
They provide mechanisms to avoid double taxation and prevent tax evasion.  
A key problem these treaties address is that of double taxation. 
Preventing double taxation helps facilitate investment. 
Limits on withholding taxes in the country where the income is earned are set. 
To prevent tax evasion the treaties provide for the exchange of information. 
Previously the country of residence taxed that income.  
The change is retroactive. 
A refund cheque will be issued. 
About 50,000 people will be affected.  
The Progressive Conservative Party would like a firm commitment from the government. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I commend the hon. member on his comments.  
I wonder if he could illuminate me and the House.  
Mr. Speaker, our concern is that of double taxation and of tax evasion. 
That is why the discussion went forth as I presented it.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
The past government was the Liberal government that is in force now. 
I am flabbergasted by how long they can look into the past. 
We have to look to the future and make changes as required.  
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
Unfortunately the United States does not have a similar system of refund.  
Statistics Canada says that low income cutoffs for people are about $25,000. 
Clearly Mrs. Mowat would be considered to be in poverty. 
It goes on and on. 
In fact they are entitled to a refund of their taxes.  
I will address some of the other issues presented today. 
One is the income inclusion amount in Canadian taxes. 
We should think about what it means. 
Many would suggest it should be higher.  
The law came into effect on January 1, 1996. 
What has happened in the interim? 
Taxes have actually been held back. 
Who are Reform members talking about protecting? 
That is with whom the Reform Party is siding.  
What does the Reform Party say to Mrs. Mowat? 
It will somehow delay the legislation. 
Tell me how that is being responsible.  
The Reform Party talks about the progressivity of the system. 
We have a progressive system. 
I have worked with the Canadian Association of Retired Persons. 
It will drag its feet through parliament.  
I did not hear them asking how they could help these poor people. 
The Reform Party is a great wall of silence. 
When does the Reform Party become interested in this issue? 
He said it was, at most, 10,000 who may see their taxes increase. 
It is those 10,000 who the Reform Party is concerned about. 
Most people can see what the real issue is today. 
You want to get it in your own hands.  
How much fairer can you be? 
These people are desperate. 
They are not making $85,000 like the member over here. 
They are making $15,000 and they need their money. 
Mr. Jean-Guy Chretien (Frontenac-Megantic, BQ):
I have three questions for my colleague from Durham. 
When can retired people expect to receive their American cheques in their entirety?  
My third question is not a question but a comment. 
I think I understand why the Reform members are so strongly opposed. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question.  
I am surprised by the member. 
It is his constituents who are out the money. 
I am surprised that the Bloc would support the Reform Party.  
These people are desperate for their money. 
They realize the demoralizing effect it has on Canadians.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I find the remarks of the member for Durham quite remarkable.  
Who was in power in 1986 when this tax treaty was promulgated? 
He talks about the terrible problems these people are suffering. 
I talked about the very same problems in the majority of my speech. 
I do not know if he was listening or not.  
Now it is trying to blame us for the mistake it made. 
They all ended up paying more taxes.  
I have one question for the member. 
Who was in power in 1986? 
Did he vote for the treaty?  
We do not want to drag out this debate. 
Why does the member not agree to do that? 
He says that this will increase taxes for everybody. 
Will the member support us in getting such an amendment passed today?  
These people will see 85% of their income included on their tax returns. 
Who are these people defending? 
It is not low income seniors.  
Bloc members should be ashamed of themselves too- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Elk Island.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, mine is an academic question. 
Is that true or is that not true?  
We are talking about inclusion rates. 
Is he saying that people who have low incomes will not be taxed?  
Mr. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
We have a progressive taxation system. 
The agenda of the Reform Party is a flat tax. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
It has the fastest growth rate of any city in Canada. 
We have a diverse population in Surrey Central. 
Many new immigrants to Canada have chosen Surrey as their new home. 
Let us look beneath the surface of Bill C-10. 
We are anxious to oppose this tax grab by the Liberal government. 
The Liberals did not want to be held accountable for their actions. 
This is very serious. 
The truth is that the Liberals stopped the Somalia inquiry from finding the truth. 
They are using Bill C-10 as another opportunity to raise taxes. 
The income tax take has been rising steadily in this country. 
The Liberals are balancing the budget on the backs of Canadian taxpayers. 
Let us see how strong the backs of Canadian taxpayers are. 
These revenues are right on track to increase to $70.4 billion in 1998-99. 
Canadian living standards were lower in 1996 than they were in 1989. 
In fact, it is underperforming. 
The election is over now. 
Canadians are tired of these games. 
Let us get serious for the next millennium at least.  
The Liberals are placing a burdensome tax on the backs of our youth. 
Where is the fairness? 
Where is the hope for the future?  
Taxes are going up again. 
He was dead wrong. 
Everyone who earned less than $70,000 paid more taxes. 
They are well aware of the mistakes they have made.  
The Liberals cannot seem to get it right. 
Canadians want a reduction in the amount of government interference in their lives. 
The Liberals are continuing to raise our taxes. 
They are balancing the budget through tax increases. 
They have not stopped government duplication. 
They have not stopped waste. 
They have not stopped mismanagement. 
In fact it was held right here in the House of Commons. 
They will use any opportunity to increase taxes. 
Bill C-10 is unacceptable. 
Mr. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
By imposing more tax on them we are making the lives of seniors miserable. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
His constituents should be proud to be so well represented in the House.  
Hopefully we will not do the same thing. 
Mr. Speaker, the member for Calgary South has explained it very well. 
We support the notion which he tried to express.  
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend the hon. member on his maiden speech. 
He mentioned during his speech that this is a democratic Chamber. 
I have a couple of questions I would like to ask the member.  
He was duly elected in his constituency by the taxpayers of Surrey Central. 
They sent him here to have his say. 
On behalf of his constituents. 
The hon. member for Surrey Central.  
Mr. Speaker, it is a good question. 
I came here with ambitions and aspirations. 
I had lots of things to say about the CPP and Bill C-2. 
I was astonished when I saw that there was taxation without representation. 
This was a unique situation I found myself in. 
I never expected this kind of situation would arise. 
This situation should never occur. 
The members on the opposite side should take a serious view of it.  
Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a comment on the issue of hypocrisy. 
It included the Government of Alberta which has basically signed on to the amendments.  
When is the Reform Party going to get its act together?  
We have to give them tax relief at this time. 
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
And renegotiation takes time. 
The other half of the benefit was tax free. 
There are some of those living in Canada. 
The minister realized the problem. 
The sicker she got the more she had to pay. 
There seems to be some allegation that this change is only about seniors. 
It is not just about seniors. 
I want to make that clear to the members of the Reform Party. 
I can speak to this from my own personal experience.  
This proposal was negotiated with CASSE. 
It was put forward before CASSE. 
That is what seems to escape the Reform Party in this whole debate today.  
Those are the people who are complaining about this change. 
They are still going to get a break. 
We all have to pay for our health care system.  
Those are the ones the Reform Party members are speaking for today. 
Even those who pay more will pay less than their Canadian neighbours. 
Where were they during the rallies in Windsor in 1996? 
I was there, but I did not see any Reform members. 
Where have they been throughout the discussion? 
I heard the member for Surrey say that we should not end the debate. 
I told her that this would be coming before the House on Monday. 
We do not have time.  
They had members in this House in the last two years. 
They had the opportunity to raise this issue over and over and over again. 
They want the proposed new rules to come into effect. 
They understand that it may not be what they thought was the perfect solution. 
We are not going back to the old system. 
They knew that from the very first time I met with them. 
They were told up front that we cannot go back. 
This is negotiated between two countries. 
Finally, I want to emphasize one last time the fairness this change will effect. 
This change will be retroactive for people living in Canada. 
I want to conclude by saying that the change was a mistake. 
Those in need will get that money back. 
Those living on a tight income will finally see some relief that they need.  
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
He continues to take bites out of our wallets.  
This is not what this is all about. 
It is about arithmetic and the numbers do not add up. 
There are tax provisions that we wanted to implement. 
It is another tax grab.  
I ask them to show us the numbers. 
The Minister of Finance can show us those numbers. 
I am sure it is another tax grab by the government.  
It is not an issue of the rich and the low income earners. 
The numbers are out there, if the hon. member cares to know. 
Someone with a $14,000 income or lower will pay no tax. 
Does he care about those people? 
I am starting to wonder.  
They talk of $30,000 as some magic cut-off. 
It took with one hand and it took back with the other. 
Why will those teachers go out on strike? 
Because the province of Ontario did not listen to them. 
Tax relief is not necessarily what it implies.  
We are talking about fairness, fairness and equality for all Canadians from coast to coast.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the remarks of the hon. member for Essex are shameful. 
I am sure that before the 1997 election they were asked about it. 
The deputy prime minister said no, that it would be revenue neutral. 
He misled those people. 
She asked where we were in 1986. 
Why are we opposing this measure today? 
Why is it falling on me to represent her constituents? 
Shame on the government.  
I represent the majority of my constituents. 
They want this change and they want it now. 
However, there was a group of numbers that was missing. 
We have recognized that error. 
There was no misleading in any election campaign. 
The statement was made after the campaign. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
My second question is with respect to the retroactivity. 
The government claims that its bill is going to be retroactive. 
These are two very serious questions and I would appreciate a response.  
As it is almost two o'clock we will proceed to Statements by Members.  
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this week is Small Business Week.  
Small business is the engine of our economy. 
Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Middlesex, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the people in the riding of Perth-Middlesex. 
I am honoured to pay tribute to the city of Stratford.  
Stratford was in tough competition. 
Stratford's finish is certainly impressive. 
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this past summer Strategis went platinum. 
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, some people say that all Canadians are apathetic. 
Today I have an example that proves this is not true.  
Kevin is in the gallery today. 
I salute him for his fortitude, his dedication and for his willingness to speak out.  
Mrs. Judi Longfield (Whitby-Ajax, Lib.):
The Government of Canada takes poverty very seriously. 
We have consistently responded with compassion.  
GOVERNOR GENERAL'S AWARDS 
Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
LIEUTENANT-COLONEL JOHN MCCRAE 
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, national treasures ought not be marketed to the highest bidder. 
They belong in our nation's museums for public viewing and contemplation.  
Few examples of inspirational significance have been born by the horror of human conflict. 
The House should listen to these words.  
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
Separatist MNA Andre Pelletier is still holding up approval of these 1997 projects. 
Mr. Gerard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
The east coast population is shrinking. 
Liberal policies have created a nation of migrant workers. 
The member for Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans.  
COMMISSION NATIONALE DES PARENTS FRANCOPHONES 
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I feel very sad today. 
But now I am depressed. 
The man who proclaimed himself l'homme du peuple, the populist, wants to be alone.  
The Leader of the Opposition can't stand people anymore.  
Stornoway will never be the same.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Mr. Speaker, today marks the beginning of small business week.  
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):
The people of Durham have courage and character. 
They maintained the beauty and quality of their town despite the adversity.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
The budget is almost balanced but 1.4 million Canadians are still out of work. 
My question is for the finance minister. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, one slight correction in terms of the Canada pension plan. 
One should understand that. 
I would hope the leader of the Reform Party would take that into consideration. 
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
My question is for the tax man. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let us understand the tax plan of the Reform Party. 
Let it be very clear. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
They cannot relocate their assets in low tax countries. 
They cannot escape the tax man. 
One million families in Canada make $30,000 a year or less. 
Most of them pay federal income tax. 
The hon. Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Middle income Canadians depend on health care which Reform would cut. 
What would happen to the senior citizens on fixed incomes?  
Why will Reform not tell us- 
The hon. member for Edmonton North.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, let us examine some Liberal scandals.  
Hear, hear, Mr. Speaker. 
Let me ask the same government House leader the question today. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
That was wrong, and she still has not apologized.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, let us look at the facts for just a minute.  
Sometimes I do not know exactly where an hon. member is leading in a preamble. 
I would like the hon. member to go directly to her question.  
Why, who, when, what? 
They can answer any question they like. 
Who was the cabinet insider giving Corbeil the inside track?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
It is not peanuts.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member should look at what the government did. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
It is easy to give money that way.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, again the hon. member should look at what we did. 
When we came to office we reduced employment insurance contributions. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
That is the drop the Liberals are responsible for.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, that is where the federal government's problem lies. 
It understands everything backwards, that is its problem.  
How many provinces will it take, before it gets the message?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We did so, and the results are there.  
The hon. member for Halifax.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my supplementary question is for the Minister of Finance. 
There is more unemployment. 
There is more poverty. 
There are more personal bankruptcies. 
There are more families losing income.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the leader of the NDP ought to look at the facts. 
She talked about interest rates. 
Our interest rates are lower than those in the United States. 
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Last week, charges were laid by the RCMP-a very serious business. 
The missing link could be sitting across the way.  
Mr. Speaker, the RCMP has concluded its investigation. 
The hon. member for Pictou ``Antigonish'' Guysborough.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, a lot of questions remain unanswered about this matter. 
I would direct my question to the President of the Treasury Board. 
With that in mind, I am going to permit the question. 
If the President of the Treasury Board wishes to answer it, he may do so. 
That was against Mr. Corbeil. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
I will put the question again. 
The minister at the time hand picked a short list of contractors.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
She no longer remembers her answer.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, perhaps the minister does not remember.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the aftermath of the Somalia report is far from over.  
Why is the minister afraid of creating an accountable, independent inspector general? 
What is he hiding?  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Nothing is being hidden, Mr. Speaker. 
In fact we want more open and transparent operations. 
We did not agree with one specific recommendation. 
We agreed with 83% of the recommendations. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
National defence gets one bad report card after another and what does the minister do? 
He turns a blind eye. 
Our troops deserve better.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
We do not need a super structure. 
We have put in place an independent ombudsman and an independent external grievance board procedure. 
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
The hon. member for Saint-Jean.  
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
Canadians want and expect straight answers.  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
The hon. member for Nanaimo-Alberni.  
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
Our governments are sending mixed messages all over the place. 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
SECURITY IN GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Public Works.  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is a question directed to the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
As this House knows, the Prime Minister of Canada is in Russia today. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health.  
Canadian troops in Somalia were administered the experimental drug mefloquine. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the facts are not yet clear. 
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
We do need refinements to the current system.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
I remind the hon. member that all questions are put through the Speaker. 
I ask the hon. member to please put his question.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Absolutely not, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
Last year the deficit was $8.9 billion. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question.  
The hon. member for Brandon-Souris.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
The hon. Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, a lot has been done. 
Second, centres of excellence have been financially stabilized. 
We are this week celebrating science and technology week. 
Everyone can help to appreciate it.  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
The priority is definitely the deportation of criminals.  
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
What concrete action does he intend to take to repatriate these children?  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have spoken frequently with the Egyptian Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
I will call out their names and ask them to stand. 
I ask members to withhold their applause until I have finished.  
SECURITY IN GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Most of the victims of this terrible tragedy were older people. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
We wish the survivors a rapid recovery.  
Mr. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
We are hard pressed to find the words when such tragedies occur. 
Highway safety is everybody's business. 
Everyone in this country must be on the watch. 
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
I ask, Mr. Speaker, that the all questions be allowed to stand.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
INCOME TAX CONVENTIONS IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1997 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
The main purpose of this bill is to prevent tax evasion. 
This is more or less what the bill is all about. 
Such countries are called tax havens.  
Canada Steamship Lines does business there.  
In Liberia, there is no tax on ship operations. 
It is very unfortunate. 
Paragraph 11.12 reads as follows: 
Paragraph 11.13 states, and I quote: 
Because there are discussions between these people; information flows between them. 
He goes on to give examples of delays. 
We can see the practical repercussions on the tax base. 
The changes are still under consideration.  
That was in 1989: ``The changes are still under consideration''.  
In 1991, changes to the rules dealing with tax shelters were requested. 
These have not been finalized.  
Paragraph 11.15 is very interesting, and I quote: 
Interest payments on the loan may also be loaned back to the donor. 
This is tax evasion. 
He went to the offices of Revenue Canada in Toronto.  
In paragraph 11.25, the report states: 
Only one referral was made by its large business tax auditors in Toronto- 
The Reform Party ought to be thrilled to hear that. 
And for what reason? 
Things are not going well in this country. 
The Canadian tax legislation is very clear. 
Mr. Jerry Pickard (Kent-Essex, Lib.):
It is a bill that is wrapped in fairness. 
I would like to compare Canadians from 1984 onward who worked in the United States. 
Maybe I could explain the reason why that structure existed. 
That is not the case in the United States.  
Here is the scenario that the United States implemented. 
That was very unfair. 
They could not file to get the 25% back. 
There are things that we did to try to correct that policy. 
As your income is lower, so is your tax percentage lower. 
Those refund cheques will go out as soon as this bill becomes law.  
That is why there is an urgency to move the bill ahead quickly now. 
Many Canadians will get a refund and will be better off. 
Those will primarily be low income Canadians. 
There are many avenues by which these benefits will be calculated and paid back.  
All Canadians will be treated fairly rather than unfairly. 
That is a really important issue. 
I have received several telephone calls from people about the tax rule. 
Bill C-10 corrects that.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
The Liberals are going after the elderly in this bill. 
They are taxing people who have the least ability to pay. 
These people cannot go back into the workforce. 
How can they justify it?  
I am astonished at his viewpoint.  
When we talk about fairness it is not that we have changed the rate. 
They bellyache about how they think this is fair. 
I believe that taxation should be fair and equal for equal incomes. 
We are not talking about low income or high income. 
Middle income Canadians will pay less than they paid before. 
The point is that all Canadians should pay approximately the same tax rate. 
There is no question but that Reform members missed that.  
Are you telling your neighbours next door that? 
If you are, listen to their answers.  
I think that is wrong.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to hear the Liberals talk about fair taxation. 
A fair tax is our policy. 
We move away from the point of looking at how taxes work. 
Taxes are paid but Canadians benefit greatly from the taxes we pay. 
We make certain that those tax dollars are spent wisely.  
We have been world leaders in social policy. 
You cannot deny that, nor can anyone else.  
We have run the country extremely well. 
Mr. Brent St. Denis (Algoma-Manitoulin, Lib.):
He makes it easier for me to pursue this subject.  
I applaud their efforts in bringing this issue to his attention. 
This is an example of a government which listens. 
This government cares about the people it serves.  
There could be a million or there could be ten. 
In most cases this group has been worried about the health care system. 
Yes, changes are taking place at the provincial level. 
I grant this is not something that will happen overnight. 
As we approach the next millennium no Canadian will be left totally behind. 
No country anywhere should stop its effort to build. 
This country is no different. 
It comes with being responsible for governing the country. 
These people got caught inadvertently in a trap. 
It is incumbent upon us as a government to continue to listen to the people. 
By that process we know what people are saying. 
I certainly get complaints from time to time which are justified. 
No government is perfect. 
I am proud to be part of the government.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
I just want to see if I can get a commitment from the government. 
Mr. Brent St. Denis:
We had an alternative method in the previous system. 
The U.S. government was the taxer and our citizens were inadvertently the victims. 
We have corrected that. 
Government members seem to forget that the tax on life insurance premiums were extended. 
That was just the last time.  
Mr. Brent St. Denis:
Is the excise tax on gas a tax loophole? 
Mr. Brent St. Denis:
The litany of tax measures he talked about were things his own party called for. 
If we throw enough mud at the wall some of it will stick.  
By way of a reminder, it is an investment. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I think I am beginning to understand what this is all about.  
I think we said that a tax is an investment. 
Mr. Brent St. Denis:
Mr. Speaker, I think I am getting through. 
When they talk about the super RRSP, they talk about people investing. 
They do not talk about the rate. 
I will tell members what the rate will be. 
I have a sense that some understanding is coming into their minds on the issue. 
It is nice to be holding a flashlight for them.  
Payments to CPP are an investment.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
I could begin with the people in Atlantic Canada who are seasonal workers. 
I will now move directly to the bill. 
They will have their say on it before too long.  
We can support those parts in principle.  
We may be able to find our way to support those.  
They are justifiably concerned and justifiably outraged.  
I admire the hon. member for Essex for her tenacity. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
I will also ask a question. 
Mr. Speaker, I have given my views on the harmonized tax. 
The hon. member is correct. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Take the example of an automobile inventory for a car dealership. 
Let me make the specifics of what we are talking about crystal clear for him. 
These are the assets, the wealth we are talking about. 
I welcome a real question. 
They might find it in their hearts to adopt some of them.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
It is a simple answer to a simple question.  
I will ask the question again and I am looking for a very specific answer. 
There are many people who have minimum income salaries. 
We are talking about wealth.  
I ask the member the question again very specifically. 
They may be considered wealthy Canadians in other parts of this country.  
You earn $64,000.  
These members ought to understand that as well. 
I think those people would not be opposed to a fair taxation system.  
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Mr. Speaker, perhaps I am in the wrong debate in this House. 
I particularly enjoyed the comment about housing prices in the city of Winnipeg. 
I would like to bring this back to C-10. 
Apparently the two governments are working together in this regard.  
Our government should undertake to do that forthwith through the GIS system.  
This is another step in the right direction. 
We in this House do not condone that action.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Where do they stand on this? 
Are Conservatives in favour of a tax hike or not?  
There are some good things within the proposed legislation. 
I am sure even the hon. member would agree with that. 
Unfortunately there are inconsistencies in the bill, particularly the one with respect to the inclusion.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
I address my comment and question to the member who just spoke. 
A treaty is in the process of occurring. 
We have a bill before the House. 
I accept that some members may feel it has some inadequacies.  
Mr. Speaker, my answer is unequivocally yes. 
We thank you for that. 
The unfortunate part is that there are still unknowns.  
That is democracy and I do appreciate that.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
I congratulate them on that.  
He was bellyaching about not enough money being given to them. 
How is he going to pay for that?  
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member confuses a lot of issues. 
If we wish to talk about health care, I can do that. 
But this is Bill C-10.  
It does not speak to Bill C-10. 
I believe that this legislation must stand on its own.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
On the other hand they want to get the money. 
They cannot suck and blow at the same time. 
You cannot ask for programs but then say you do not like taxes. 
Where do they stand on this?  
Those inefficiencies could be cut and save dollars in certain areas. 
Perhaps things like fences around Stornoway need not be developed. 
Those dollars could go into areas such as health care and education.  
We will continue to oppose any types of tax increases of this nature. 
We should be giving dollars back into the pockets of those people who pay.  
We are in favour of decreases in taxes. 
We believe in efficiencies. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
A number of my colleagues and I went to the Minister of Finance. 
We stated, in a very strong way, that this was not fair. 
This area can be a very dry topic. 
That is why these initiatives will avoid double taxation.  
The Canada-United States double taxation agreement is a case in point. 
That meant that one-half of the benefits were tax free. 
However there will be no retroactive tax increases for that period.  
However while the number of amendments is small the benefits are very real. 
The provisions would then apply on the first day of January subsequent to the exchange.  
The proposed convention does not reinvent the wheel. 
Of more interest than structure are results. 
However, as of January 1, 1996 Kazakhstan ceased to apply that treaty. 
Its provisions will apply on or after the first day of January 1996.  
The penultimate country included in the legislation is Denmark. 
The revised convention provides for the opposite. 
The 1955 convention also does not contain any rules for the taxation of capital gains. 
As a result they are taxable in accordance with each country's respective legislation. 
There are other modifications to the convention as well. 
I know the legislation will positively affect the taxpayers of my riding.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Is this not an indictment of his government? 
The movement under the finance minister was a bad move.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member opposite for the question.  
We cannot have everybody coming out in a net-net-plus position.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
These people were therefore seeing their meager pension incomes being made even more meager. 
I await the answer of our colleague across the way.  
Mr. Speaker, I must thank my Bloc Quebecois colleague for his comment.  
This will be extremely beneficial. 
It is one advantage in being the government of the day. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
I see it the opposite way. 
Perhaps this is what differentiates Reform members from Liberal members. 
I see the glass as half full not half empty. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
First, these are people who cannot go back to work. 
They cannot make up this shortfall any other way. 
The government should be ashamed.  
I would also like to talk about how many people this affects. 
Eight five thousand Canadian residents receive U.S. social security. 
This affects a lot of people. 
It is not even a question of numbers. 
What about the job spin-off as a result? 
They do not express any concern about that.  
And now they are coming before the House to try and rectify it. 
That is exactly what the Liberals across the way are doing.  
They said they did not understand.  
That is the way it went. 
Then they blamed the previous government. 
And now they are blaming the seniors.  
I would also like to quote the Minister of Finance. 
That is Liberal fairness, Liberal tax equity. 
It is a back door tax grab.  
I reiterate, two wrongs do not make a right. 
What about those who fall through the cracks? 
What about those people? 
What about those people who have died? 
What about those people who have moved? 
The government will keep that. 
That is a joke.  
It has done it on numerous occasions before.  
They like the Minister of Finance but not much else.  
First, who wants it? 
No. It is the finance minister who does but certainly not the seniors.  
How much is it going to cost? 
That is another question that we have to level at the Liberals today. 
If it affects 85,000 people at $2,000 each, that is $170 million.  
Does it solve the problem? 
Would it pass a referendum? 
Would it pass popular consent? 
Would it carry the consent or the will of the people? 
Would it pass the judgment of fellow citizens? 
Does it have democratic consent? 
The Liberals have often talked today about how taxes are investments. 
Taxes are not investments. 
The young people can't. 
We cannot buy their election promises because they break them right, left and centre.  
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a very tough question for my colleague. 
They have had to do a complete revision. 
Those are the middle income people. 
The concern I have in this instance is with the people at the bottom end. 
Those are the people who were approaching me in my office. 
Why in the world would he have waited so long?  
They see only as far as the next election. 
It makes me think. 
Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon-Souris, PC):
Mr. Speaker, when there is bad legislation a party should oppose it. 
There is a direct relationship with what is happening today. 
However, I am not going to make it again.  
Liberal, Tory, same old story.  
We are opposed to it. 
They were a little confused about it this morning, we are not.  
Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):
I guess they do not. 
It gives them the hope of saving something. 
The government said no, it is for the rich. 
I look at all tax as legalized theft. 
If the mafia had this government as an example- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
You are quite correct. 
They could not have learned anything from this government. 
No, I do not think any of these things are investments. 
They are tax hikes.  
Where is all the money going from these tax hikes? 
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
Therefore, pursuant to Standing Order 26, I move: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Will those members who object to the motion please rise in their place?  
And fewer than 15 members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The motion is deemed to be adopted.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I move: 
That the question now be put.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
We have, within Canada, an understanding that democracy stands like a three-legged stool. 
It stands on the principle of people, politicians and the press. 
When this happens we drive the cynicism toward the entire political process. 
Cynicism ends up building apathy.  
I would never accuse the Liberals of deliberately trying to undermine democracy. 
The problem is not with this side of the House. 
The government is doing it in a very sneaky way. 
How do you cook a live frog? 
This is the kind of action that is going on.  
I object in the strongest terms to the action that the government is taking.  
I do not blame the people of Canada. 
I believe they respect the fact that we have a democracy here. 
I blame the Liberal government. 
Why were Bloc members here? 
They were here at the behest of the Liberal government. 
Why did they have the role of vice-chair in all the committees? 
Why were they put into an exalted position in this Parliament?  
We have obtained our role democratically from those who elected us to office.  
That is why we were the official opposition 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We are debating Bill C-10.  
Mr. Speaker, I believe a motion was put.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member is quite correct. 
It was this government that goofed.  
Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth-Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I heard the remarks of the member opposite. 
They made a very serious situation.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye:
I would like to say two things. 
Second, we are no longer the official opposition. 
We are not the party with the second largest number of members. 
The party with that distinction is the Reform Party. 
They have 60 members. 
It is up to them to assume their role, through their presence and their numbers. 
This is their role now. 
We assumed it when it was our turn, and now it is theirs.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye:
If one of the legs is shortened, the stool will fall over.  
We are talking about people, politicians and press. 
They have been bedfellows before. 
I am sure they will be bedfellows again.  
Mr. Pierre de Savoye:
This time, however, we are. 
That is entirely possible. 
Now they are trying to clean it up as quickly as possible.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Chair would also like to correct the record. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Let us remember what we are doing. 
Only four parties out of five are in favour of it. 
Shame on the Reform Party.  
So this is what is before us today. 
We have not voted yet.  
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member across says he has not voted yet. 
There is still time to repent. 
Members opposite can do that. 
I know that a large number of them rose in their place. 
They were against extending the debate. 
Maybe that means they are in favour of closure. 
They are against extending debate.  
That is the position of the Reform Party. 
How could that be reasonable?  
It is very wrong and it needs to be corrected.  
That is what all of us want.  
Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport-Montmorency-Orleans, BQ):
That is the first thing.  
In Quebec, we have a wonderful motto:
That is how to make oneself heard.  
We have no lessons to learn from the Reform Party.  
I think it was the proper approach.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Do you honestly feel that five hours of debate is adequate?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. House leader for the government.  
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
And now we have to debate this all night. 
I think back to last year when we were debating a thing called family trusts. 
Mr. Speaker, I have a couple of points. 
This issue is not on the agenda of the House for tomorrow.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have found the conversation to be quite interesting. 
The member is quite right. 
We do know the rules of the House. 
That is the issue here. 
They are worried and concerned because they are the most vulnerable people in our society. 
What is the rush? 
The fear and concern of our seniors are real. 
That fear and concern are often based on lack of knowledge and understanding. 
Why is the government always changing the rules on us? 
I cannot tell them why.  
One would ask why that mistake was made in the first place. 
Who has it consulted? 
In what way has it consulted? 
They need the opportunity to understand what the effect will be on them.  
In essence the government has closed the debate. 
It will continue this evening before running out of time. 
It will not be resumed two days hence. 
That this debate do now adjourn.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Would you mind explaining why it is not in order?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I do not believe I heard that the debate not be adjourned. 
The motion from the member from South Surrey was that the debate be adjourned.  
Mr. Guy Saint-Julien:
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I rise seeking clarification. 
Standing Order 25 is very specific. 
It specifically says there shall not be a motion entertained to adjourn the House. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Chair will not recognize any further points of order on this subject. 
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
The issue is very significant. 
What are the implications for those who are in a medium income tax bracket? 
What are the further ranging implications? 
They did not ask that question.  
The government provided us with legislation on the Canada pension plan. 
It did not indicate either what the implications would be to RRSPs.  
That is the danger behind this legislation before us today. 
What is this government really all about?  
Canadians will find out. 
What's going on here?''  
They call it an income tax. 
They call it a surtax. 
They call it a clawback. 
They call it a reduction in benefits. 
They call it a shift in emphasis. 
It confuses the people. 
In fact it was written last spring. 
In the letter he referred to the excise tax for gasoline. 
Guess what he said? 
In fact, $100 billion were added.  
What did the Minister of Finance say in Vancouver just last week? 
He said that the deficit would only be $8.9 billion. 
That is what the government is giving Canadians and it does not help.  
What did they discover? 
We have to shut up. 
That is the truth. 
That is going on here.  
I decry that kind of thing. 
It should not happen. 
Are there certain provisions in the proposed legislation that could be supported? 
It does not treat them fairly. 
As a consequence we have to vote against the bill.  
Is it the truth? 
Does it treat people fairly? 
Liberal member and opposition members need to develop that kind of orientation in parliament.  
It confuses and misleads the people of Canada. 
That is missing this afternoon.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The motion is in order. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House divided on the motion, which was negatived on the following division:) 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
They were told to vote and they did. 
We have a system of doing business here in the House of Commons. 
It starts at a certain time and ends at a certain time. 
We have an orderly calendar. 
One day of debate, seven hours of debate, and it is finished. 
It is shuffled off. 
If the government had its way, the bill would be shuffled off and forgotten. 
It is just the end of the debate. 
They are not given a full hearing in the House. 
They are told ``too bad, no debate in the House''. 
What have the Liberals done today? 
They have pulled another procedural stunt. 
At the last hour of debate the government can stand up and move a motion. 
Is that too much to ask? 
Of course it is not.  
What happens over there is that the government says ``We cannot have that. 
One day is enough. 
One day is all you get''. 
That is not orderly business. 
Honourable ladies and gentlemen.  
However, they could ask how many members want to speak. 
How many speakers can there be? 
Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. 
If he tells us who is not- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
So far the government has a perfect record. 
We will rise to the challenge. 
We will not let the government ram this stuff through.  
The idea of co-operation which makes this House work well will instead become confrontation. 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
The Reform Party member claims that they will rise to the challenge. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
And now we have today's situation.  
Oh well, it is not very valuable anyway. 
The real decisions are made in the private sector. 
This is where people talk. 
That is what Parliament means, parl-iament. 
This is the place where we come to talk things out. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
This piece of legislation was introduced today. 
We cannot read this as we read a book.  
It will be through to the Senate before we know it. 
Now we have a very simple situation. 
I draw the parallels to this document, all 138 pages of it. 
We have not had the opportunity to go through it in detail. 
We have not had that. 
It will become law because those members deem it will become law. 
That is not the way democracy works. 
Should we take a stance for or against this piece of legislation? 
Is it good legislation? 
Is it legislation that needs amendment before we can call it good legislation? 
Is it legislation that we disagree with entirely on principle?''  
That is why we have to take a stance. 
We tried to take a stance on Bill C-2. 
We registered our opposition by refusing to be counted on the vote.  
That is why it will be a long four or five years. 
Has anyone else on the government side? 
We are not here as stooges to do what the government tells us. 
Unfortunately I look forward to a raucous four years. 
I am going to do my bit to be heard in the House.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
We took that on good faith. 
Seniors took that on good faith. 
Members of the government know this is true. 
That is why we are debating this bill today. 
That is why we are trying to amend the mistake it made.  
I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We have a quorum.  
The government presented amendments which were supposedly innocuous and benign in their effect. 
That is why we need to take these bills seriously. 
That is why we cannot rubber stamp them. 
These debates must be taken seriously.  
It is ultimately here that the buck stops. 
We cannot shirk that responsibility.  
We are not standing up using these tactics out of some whimsy. 
We ought to take it to committee eventually and have witnesses appear. 
That is what taxation with representation is all about. 
That is what the democratic traditions of the House are all about.  
Forget the advice you receive from finance department officials. 
I want to correct one thing the members opposite have been saying. 
That is not at all what we are proposing to do.  
My colleagues and I have a prerogative. 
We have a privilege and indeed an obligation to do that.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
That is what is presumed here. 
I am insulted by it and I am hurt by it. 
Our respect for the parliamentary process and for this institution is being reduced. 
We have an obligation to maintain the integrity of it.  
We can just call it a cabinet and let them run the show. 
Let us call it what it is, an elected dictatorship between elections. 
That is what it boils down to.  
This is really despicable.  
It is being eroded big time. 
This is an affront to us. 
That is not good enough.  
It is a sham and it is a shame.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this should be a very peaceful and articulate presentation. 
It should be but maybe it will not be. 
At least it will be articulate.  
Is there a quorum in the House?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Speaker, with regard to Bill C-10- 
Mr. Speaker, listen to the rabble over there. 
The people at home should hear what is going on in the House. 
What are the Reformers doing behind the curtain? 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
These folks across the way have some distorted understanding about taxes. 
They think tax is an investment. 
It is not considered an investment. 
I want hon. members across the way to understand that.  
I have not been asked. 
The problem is not just today. 
How will these folks opposite operate for the next four years? 
An individual can only take so much. 
I think members across the way are running out of brownie points. 
That is just arrogance from the Liberal Party. 
I am here to speak my piece.  
I wonder what the government is thinking.  
It is not democracy.  
It is not democracy. 
Is that what we are talking about? 
It is not right the government should limit such debate.  
The message is becoming very clear. 
The message is coming to us loud and clear. 
We have requests from the government to fly all over the world. 
We can cancel their votes in the House of Commons. 
They are going to wonder why they were not well informed. 
That is the real answer to all of this. 
I am looking forward to that day.  
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
I can talk about Bill C-10. 
I have read it. 
I admit that I am a new member in this House. 
I have been here only a few weeks. 
I had my maiden speech prepared on Bill C-2. 
My constituents asked me to speak on it. 
It is a huge concern in the riding where I come from. 
I am saying this from my heart because I really do believe this. 
We have been here only a few weeks. 
I say this very sincerely from my heart. 
That is a dictatorship. 
There is no other word for it.  
On Bill C-10 we could go into the technicalities of it. 
Prior to 1995, 50% would be included in your taxable income. 
This is not rocket science.  
We can debate this bill. 
I am sure the government knows how much extra revenue this will create. 
What is even worse, it will not even allow debate in this House. 
What I see in this House is wrong, wrong, wrong. 
It is absolutely deplorable what this government is doing. 
It is silencing the opposition. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The vote stands deferred until tomorrow at the end of Government Orders.  
(The House adjourned at 8.46 p.m.)
