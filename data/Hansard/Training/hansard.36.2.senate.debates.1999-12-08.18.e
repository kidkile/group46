The Senate met at 1:30 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
As well, the cost is half that of IVF. 
What wonderful news for the couples who will be able to take advantage of this!  
However, where does society fit in all this? 
However, it is not that simple. 
Who should benefit from this technology? 
Who has access to this treatment? 
What do they need to know before undergoing this treatment? 
The commission was supposed to do several things. 
Finally, it was supposed to facilitate intergovernmental cooperation in the field.  
Unfortunately, this recommendation has not been acted upon by the federal government. 
Regional Restructuring Legislation- Proposal to Declare Ottawa Officially Bilingual 
However, Ottawa is a municipality unlike any other. 
It is the national capital of this bilingual country of ours.  
First Report of Standing Joint Committee Presented 
Wednesday, December 8, 1999 
The Standing Joint Committee on the Library of Parliament has the honour to present its 
A copy of the relevant Minutes of Proceedings ( Meeting No. 1 ) is tabled.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
First Report of Committee Tabled 
( For text of report see today's Journals of the Senate.)  
( For text of report see today's Journals of the Senate.)  
First Report of Standing Joint Committee Presented 
Wednesday, December 8, 1999 
The Standing Joint Committee on Official Languages has the honour to present its 
The Committee held 28 meetings and heard 47 witnesses.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this report be taken into consideration?  
Hon. Brenda M. Robertson :
Honourable senators, I have a question for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
However, the Fredericton airport has another problem besides this uncertainty. 
The federal government is negotiating to turn the airport over to local authorities. 
However, the chickens are coming home to roost. 
This neglect has been going on for a long time - approximately 20 years. 
There are even questions about the main runway being too short.  
When or if this happens, the local authority is left with little opportunity to succeed. 
The odds of a new operator succeeding are even poorer.  
In my opinion, this is a matter of fairness. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Certainly, the precedent has been set. 
I am prepared to convey the senator's concerns to the minister in question.  
Their needs seem to have been met rather well. 
We look forward to your response on this matter.  
Fredericton Airport-Inability of Runway System to Accommodate Certain Aircraft 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I have a supplementary question. 
Currently, that runway can only handle turboprop equipment flying in. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Hon. Jean-Robert Gauthier :
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
According to Premier Harris and company, the capital of the country would be unilingual English. 
For Canada to have a unilingual national capital is unacceptable and intolerable. 
We would be the only capital in the world rejecting institutional bilingualism. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
It is the capital of our country. 
Honourable senators, the Prime Minister has spoken out publicly on this issue. 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
Honourable senators, I understand the government's position. 
Any constitutional issue is complicated and usually requires clear study.  
Honourable senators, my question is for the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 
That is another problem entirely.  
However, the message has clearly been given. 
It is being taken seriously by the Government of Canada and the Prime Minister. 
One hopes that it will be taken seriously by the Premier of Ontario.  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
I am asking that Ottawa reflect an ideal.  
I am Canadien francais du Quebec.  
Honourable senators, certainly we will reflect on that suggestion. 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
That is because it is a CP story.  
The Transport Committee of the House of Commons has tabled their report.  
They did not deal with section 47, though.  
I am aware of the reason for the delay in the Air Canada offer. 
Air Canada-Increase in Air Fares 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, we have seen Air Canada take its second step. 
They always go up, and never come down. 
No one seems to know why they cannot come down.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
If fuel prices come down, we will watch to see whether fares decline as well.  
Social Affairs, Science and Technology 
Honourable senators, I will deal with the last question first. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Ontario sent officials and their Assistant Deputy Minister of Health. 
The minister did not appear.  
Air Canada-Increase in Air Fares 
Hon. Donald H. Oliver :
Honourable senators, my question is about Air Canada and the increase in air fares. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Status of Holocaust Memorial Museum 
If so, when can we expect to see some activity on this file?  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Unfortunately, I cannot comment on it in detail today. 
Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Bill 
Third Reading-Motion in Amendment-Debate Adjourned 
I move, seconded by Honourable Senator Doody: 
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
How much time do I have to speak?  
The Hon. the Speaker:
Thank you, Your Honour.  
Honourable senators, I refer you to clause 7 (1) which says: 
I should like to deal with this issue en passant. 
I think it is about time we drew the line. 
Am I correct in my reading of that?  
There are still a number of tests. 
A little later, she said: 
I went back to the bill to see what she was talking about. 
I then went to Schedule 1, the so-called purpose clause. 
Thus, I went to that clause, and what did I find? 
I found another one which states: 
This clause is basically for historical purposes and archives. 
You obviously have not heard yet from the archivist and historian community.  
Why would we need to? 
Their interests have been taken care of.  
Nevertheless, some information is of historical interest. 
Cut up your Bay credit card, honourable senators.  
Those were company records. 
Let me come back to that.  
I say it is none of our business. 
I say that this kind of personal information is none of anybody's business. 
They would have us save every last scrap of paper. 
They insist that it is theirs. 
I do not think they had focused on it. 
I do not think we have an official position on your question. 
It has nothing to do with the census. 
We are talking about commercial matters.  
My intuitive response is that 20 years is not a long time. 
Why it has been chosen as 20 years, I do not know.  
Then a bit later he said: 
Perhaps my colleagues have something to add. 
I do not understand the justification for that. 
The figure of 20 years strikes me as being not a long time.  
I am speaking about how we consider the interests at stake. 
Think about it, honourable senators.  
I differ with Mr. Lawson in this regard. 
She went on to say: 
It is a question of the appropriate time limit. 
I am not uncomfortable with a time limit. 
It may be that 20 years is not an appropriate time limit.  
She is not taking a position on principle. 
To her, it is a question of the time limit.  
I asked him to justify this provision. 
I will read you the exchange. 
Justify that for us.  
We had a lawyer tell us that today.  
I take a different view. 
This argument, as we both know, is coming up in another context. 
I do not draw a distinction between any kind of information. 
It is what the owner thinks about it, senator. 
The question is why?  
Any disclosure would still have to comply with the rest of the code. 
I do not think he quite understood the issue that I was raising.  
That has been the experience to date. 
I hope that we will draw the line and strike this clause from the bill.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Hon. the Speaker :
You may speak on the amendment.  
I move the adjournment of the debate.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it agreed, honourable senators?  
I will not read the letter, although I am prepared to make it available. 
That, in essence, is what Alberta is seeking.  
If not, what should we do about it at this stage? 
I thank Senator Murray for that reply. 
As for the others, three years is provided for consultation and discussion. 
I understand that Alberta is drafting a bill, as we speak. 
They are not left simply to guesswork. 
On motion of Senator Kirby, debate adjourned.  
Bill to Amend-Third Reading 
It was before us in the last session and it is again before us. 
We take the integrity of the pardon system very seriously. 
These are serious safeguards.  
Pardons for all other offences will remain sealed. 
Definitions which are now in the bill have been greatly improved. 
Definitions of "children" and "vulnerable persons" are now in the bill.  
The Estimates, 1999-2000 
Report of National Finance Committee on Supplementary Estimates (A) Adopted 
Hon. Anne C. Cools , for Senator Murray, moved the adoption of the report.  
I would say that this report is the committee's best commendation. 
Having said that, honourable senators, I recommend this report for your adoption.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Motion agreed to and report adopted.  
Medical Decisions Facilitation Bill 
Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Honourable Senator Lavoie-Roux) 
Hon. Rose-Marie Losier-Cool :
The Hon. the Speaker :
Is leave granted, honourable senators?  
The health demographic is, without a doubt, constantly changing. 
With us [in New Brunswick], it is part of the system. 
That is our objective, at any rate.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Canadian District of the Moravian Church of America 
Private Bill to Amend Act of Incorporation- Third Reading 
Motion agreed to and bill read third time and passed.  
Business of the Senate 
Point of Order-Speaker's Ruling 
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
The Hon. the Speaker :
What committees do is up to committees. 
I must depend upon the committee chairman to have done that.  
Hon. Leo E. Kolber :
I could have done it today, but not yesterday. 
The desire was to have it done yesterday. 
The rule is quite clear. 
It is not the chairman who delegates, but the committee. 
His Honour just quoted rule 97(1).  
The Hon. the Speaker :
The rule states that the designation is made by the chairman. 
Honourable senators, I do not wish to delay the study of this bill. 
The Hon. the Speaker :
The Bill was then read the second time.  
The question being put on the motion as modified, it was adopted.  
Honourable senators, I must say that this is a most unusual procedure. 
After all, how is that done?  
The committee studied the bill and no amendments were proposed.  
The bill was reported back. 
I must refer you, then, to rule 97(4), which states: 
That is what the Senate decided. 
We have decided to send it to committee." 
I felt that the Speaker bypassed the Senate. 
Senator Hays clarified the situation on the second day. 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
The point I wish to make is that this circumstance is unusual. 
I believe that is where the potential confusion lies. 
I think the solution that came from His Honour was a good one. 
However, it is one that we have tried. 
I am not sure we will ever try it again.  
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Honourable senators, I should like to draw your attention to rule 101, which states: 
The Hon. the Speaker :
I do not see the bills when they are presented. 
I am sure the Table checks to see if they are signed. 
The chairman was not here. 
Therefore, it was signed by another member of the committee.  
Honourable senators, I will be happy to sign it.  
Senator Kinsella has noted what may be a deficiency. 
Senator Kolber's suggestion is a good one.  
My interest is to protect the rights of the minority in this place. 
Most of the chairmen of committees are senators on the government side. 
Rule 101 refers to a bill that has been amended.  
We want the government side simply to respect the minority.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
It must go immediately to third reading. 
That was the difficulty in which we found ourselves.  
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m.
