The House met at 10 a.m. 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
ATLANTIC CANADA OPPORTUNITIES AGENCY 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Could he tell us that please.  
I would rather not get into a discussion on that point of order now. 
PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS COMPENSATION FUND 
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to present two petitions this morning. 
These petitioners feel that more stringent guidelines must be given to the courts.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
The petitioners ask this House to heed their words and I concur.  
Mr. Speaker, I suggest that all questions be allowed to stand.  
SMALL BUSINESS LOANS ACT 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
It is an inefficient and ineffective program. 
The objective is to increase the availability of loans. 
It is a very broad objective. 
They had met the criteria and were qualified to get the loans. 
Through this program the government is not successfully helping entrepreneurs or small businesses. 
Therefore those businesses have abused the system by millions of dollars.  
The department has not been checking it. 
There are many other observations. 
Income tax implications are very complicated under this act. 
They have not been addressed. 
The job creation record is not good either. 
There is potential for an active displacement effect. 
Industry Canada has no yardstick. 
There are no procedures in place to measure the performance results of this program.  
It creates further implications in the program.  
The department lacks adequate forecasting techniques. 
Up to now, a complete cost based analysis has never been done.  
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
The member also knows that a total comprehensive study is in the works. 
Mr. Speaker, this is not political rhetoric that I put in front of the House. 
These are solid facts and figures. 
It was not doing what it was supposed to do. 
Unfortunately this act has failed small businesses because it was not properly designed. 
There are many things that need to be improved in this act.  
Based on the facts, there is room for improvement and modifications to the act. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Most of those businesses actually have access to capital outside of this loans program.  
We need to make the system efficient and effective so that it can work. 
It is up to the government to operate this switch.  
Mr. Speaker, I did not get my answer earlier. 
I thought I had asked a very clear question.  
Unlike question period when we ask questions.  
How do you like it?  
The member perhaps should address the Chair.  
Let the government review the program carefully. 
At the same time we have these pittances. 
This is one of them. 
Are the members opposite saying that we should waste another $1 billion? 
I cannot do that. 
I cannot betray the trust of the Canadians who have sent me here.  
This program has proven to be detrimental to small business.  
It all speaks to the lack of priorities.  
I think of all these things, of the lack of priorities. 
It does not make any sense.  
Mr. Speaker, we are very reasonable people. 
We are very co-operative. 
We want to make the system very productive. 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
For Quebec, for my region, this means mainly New England.  
Right now, such access is not readily available.  
The recommendation could be extended to a business's entire working capital. 
There is not enough of this in the government's approach.  
What tools do our businesses need? 
This may be less impressive in political and electoral terms. 
In the end, the government decided to merely make technical adjustments. 
These adjustments were necessary. 
It was important to make the program more accessible. 
It is bad for self-esteem.  
There is no particular direction behind what the government is doing now. 
It is letting the market decide. 
People are sent where the jobs are and terrible vacuums are created.  
I have just come back from a quick trip to the Atlantic provinces. 
I saw difficult situations in Newfoundland that illustrate this point. 
I would like to give one last example. 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it was interesting to hear some of the comments of the speaker opposite. 
I want to deal with a few points.  
He mentioned the lack of things being done in the small business area. 
The member opposite is not a new member. 
He mentioned caisses populaires. 
I was not quite sure of the point he was making. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his remarks.  
In a way, he shares my objective. 
We can see, however, that this voluntary action is not enough.  
There is nothing like this in the legislation.  
Do we have up-to-date tools? 
Work needs to be done in this area. 
There is nothing original in the legislation. 
Business people in the regions want something new.  
What is needed is some incentive. 
Does the bill promote job creation? 
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
There is this 70 cents gap.  
A similar philosophy applies to the budget. 
I will conclude on this. 
I think that there are indeed innovative approaches that could be put forward. 
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
We are supposed to make our decisions based on that.  
This to me is a shocking disgrace.  
However, I do have some other information regarding the program. 
It is a whole chapter. 
That is the philosophy. 
Why did this happen? 
Why did the write-offs rise astronomically? 
It is all in the auditor general's report. 
If we take a look at exhibit 29.1, 
I am going to go out and use it and make some money''. 
They have no risk involved. 
That is the type of thing that should not be happening.  
I have to give the government its due. 
However, the losses continue to grow and the write-offs continue to grow.  
What does the auditor general have to say? 
That is why the Reform Party says not at this time. 
The government should do its homework. 
It makes simple sense to me yet it is not being done. 
I talked about the taxpayer being on the hook for these things. 
Where is it going to get the money back from?  
Who is left holding the bag? 
It is obviously not the government because it is on a cost recovery program. 
That is why I scratch my head. 
That is what is amounts to.  
We call this help for small businesses. 
The other thing we found out was this concept of what is called incrementality. 
Bank profits are not at risk. 
I did not think that was the idea.  
That is not the idea.  
I come back to my original point. 
Next Tuesday the Minister of Finance is going to bring down a budget. 
But scrape away that very thin veneer and what do we find? 
We find that money is being spent frivolously. 
There is no control on the management of programs. 
Small business is creating jobs in spite of high taxes and overregulation. 
Yet we are still able to compete and succeed to some degree.  
We must take our hats off to the business people in this country. 
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is very simple. 
Then we can make an intelligent decision. 
In the meantime we have no information. 
The deputy whip has posed a rhetorical question. 
The auditor general is specifically telling the House that we need more information. 
His assessment is that this program must be fixed before it is expanded.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
I agree 100% with him on that statement. 
In my riding of Halifax West there are numerous small businesses. 
Many are experiencing difficulties. 
All we can do to try to offset those difficulties should be welcomed. 
We must do more than just take our hats off to small business. 
I support this bill. 
The member said he wanted to support this bill. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
We find that there has not been appropriate analysis of this program. 
We do know that the intent is a full cost recovery for the government. 
Therefore they are in it and it will not cost them anything. 
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
That is a contradiction.  
A contradiction in terms of being a thoughtful member of the Reform Party.  
So it is totally irrelevant.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
The auditor general has repeatedly said that the SBLA needs revamping. 
Sound constructive principles are continually put in these very good documents of the auditor general. 
Does the government listen to them? 
No. Not only no, but virtually never.  
I find it unfathomable.  
This is not neurosurgery. 
Many of these ideas are not difficult to implement. 
Why should the taxpayer be subsidizing the lenders which are the banks? 
Does this make sense? 
It does not have to happen.  
It is a good idea.  
It is a waste of taxpayer money.  
That is not useful. 
I would like to add some constructive suggestions to those that have already been made. 
Second, it is important to define the expected level of incrementality. 
In other words, is the SBLA doing what it is supposed to do? 
Again there is no analysis.  
Third, there should be full cost recovery. 
Fourth, Industry Canada should assess whether the lender is exercising due care. 
The lender is the bank. 
The claim from the lender must be assessed. 
It must be shown that the lender is exercising due care.  
Fifth, the interest paid to lenders is too high. 
That is not fair. 
It is taking advantage of the taxpayer.  
Therefore it is important that we decrease the interest rates being charged by lenders. 
I am sure that is something the government will be very interested in. 
Some banks look to the program as a cash cow.  
Sixth, better information on the performance of the SBLA is required. 
Parliamentarians must have the information to assess the SBLA. 
That is an important criticism by the auditor general.  
I would like to make some general comments about the economy. 
We must decrease taxes. 
They are not acting upon it because of a failure in leadership. 
I conclude by saying that we disagree with Bill C-21. 
Is the House ready for the question?  
The House has heard the terms of the motion. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
And the bells having rung: 
Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I think there is a collusion of interest here.  
I would ask Your Honour to review what was said by the hon. member. 
I believe that language is unacceptable. 
Mr. Speaker, I am using the word potentially. 
I think the hon. member has made his point. 
Perhaps he said potentially. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the government House leader for his intervention. 
As usual, the hon. member for Charlotte is confused and misled.  
The same applies to pleasure vessel owners. 
Canadian contributions to the international fund are paid from the ship source oil pollution fund.  
I therefore strongly urge this House to consider this important legislation expeditiously. 
The sooner Canada can accede to the new regime, the better.  
I urge others to do so. 
Their strong support of this bill has been very gratifying for all those involved.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I concur with what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Transport said. 
That really bothers me. 
Whether we like to admit it our not, we are dealing with millions of dollars. 
This is nothing small. 
We are talking about liabilities up to $270 million. 
That was totally unnecessary. 
The Senate was restricted from originating money bills in 1867. 
It is not that we are going to oppose this bill. 
We are not going to oppose the bill.  
That is the good part. 
There will probably be some more.  
It has doubled to the point of $270 million.  
This bill provides for a substantial increase in shipowners' liability limits. 
The bill creates a procedure for rapid amendments, and that is a good point. 
A million dollars liability insurance. 
Is that $1 million per person? 
I am not quite sure what is meant by that. 
We need to take a look at that.  
We agree that the clauses as they relate to that become very, very important.  
It is certainly not too high. 
I believe that is within this bill and we can support it on that merit.  
Bill S-4 appears to be a sound bill. 
It is questionable that a bill with such ramifications should indeed come from the Senate.  
We can clean up an oil spill. 
It is very costly but eventually we can clean it up. 
We cannot totally erase the damage. 
They come into Canada and find their way into the U.S. market.  
The hon. member may say that is not relevant, but I believe it is. 
As a Canadian citizen I was hurt when I watched that program.  
Reform will be supporting this bill. 
However, I would like to reiterate that it should not have originated in the Senate. 
Please introduce legislation in this House.  
Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne-Blainville, BQ):
This bill will improve our liability regimes for maritime claims. 
This helps neither claimants nor shipowners. 
It is very difficult for a shipowner to assess his potential liability. 
It will now be easier to amend the limits in the international convention.  
These are primarily claims for salvage, etc. 
This is a very significant increase.  
We are obviously in favour of increased responsibility. 
We still have the memory of the unfortunate Irving Whale episode fresh in our minds. 
One can see how ridiculous it all got.  
Such situations must be avoided in the future. 
Legislation must be therefore put in place to avoid such incidents in future. 
Hydrocarbon pollution is not the taxpayer's responsibility. 
This measure detracts a great deal from the competitivity of Canadian and Quebec ports.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
The NDP believes it is time to modernize the Canada Shipping Act. 
That is understandable since 1957 was more than 40 years ago. 
Inflation was very high periodically during those years. 
In the late seventies inflation hit more than 15%.  
We support many aspects of this bill.  
The hon. member for Souris-Moose Mountain made a point I agree with. 
That may seem kind of odd. 
He is already wondering what this point is.  
The government is introducing more and more legislation from the Senate. 
I think that is a real affront to democracy. 
Why should we be debating this piece of legislation which does not originate here?  
Its members are there from when they are appointed to the age 75. 
I think that is a real affront to democracy.  
That is exactly what the Canadian people are asking for.  
Senator Thompson is only a catalyst, the tip of the iceberg. 
He is not the only Senator who is not elected. 
No wonder some people think this place is a farce. 
The people are telling us to abolish that unelected place. 
The people of Canada want their say and they want to speak out. 
We should just stop right now in protest. 
That this House do now adjourn.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The hon. member has moved for the adjournment of the House. 
Does the hon. member have the consent of the House?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Pat O'Brien:
Madam Speaker, I was in the Chamber well before I was required. 
The bells were still ringing. 
I was here in plenty of time.  
Madam Speaker, I think the record will show that I was here for the vote. 
My vote has been recorded. 
I just left to go out into the hallway afterward.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
We will accept the word of the members.  
(The House divided on the motion, which was negatived on the following division:) 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I declare the motion lost.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
It is very unusual.  
The bill began as Bill C-58 in 1996. 
There are important changes contained in the legislation. 
This point is important. 
That is important and is long overdue.  
In summary, we are pleased to support the legislation. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
It is long overdue and I am pleased that it is here. 
It is not just the Reformers who are saying it. 
We should have continued on with the debate. 
This has tugged at my heart. 
Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
It was introduced in the House. 
We dealt with the marine sector in our dealings with the Canadian port authorities.  
That is why we dealt with that bill first. 
We have waited a long time. 
We can see them out there with the oil rigs. 
We are saying that this is long overdue. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
That is why we voted to adjourn today. 
If the member does not like democracy in action, that is just too bad.  
The Senate could have made amendments anyway you dummy.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Chair did not hear any unparliamentary language.  
I am sorry the Chair did not hear it. 
The hon. Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport.  
Yes, Mr. Speaker, I must admit, but it was a term of endearment.  
I will consider the matter closed.  
Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Ind.):
This is the elected House of Commons. 
The Prime Minister and the government must show some leadership and begin the process. 
I believe abolition of the Senate is the will of Canadians. 
Why could the bill not have been introduced by the government?  
It should be the elected members of this House who determine public policy.  
There will be others that will come, but it goes through a normal process.  
There was an opposition there that worked extremely hard. 
I would say they did not play party politics in the Senate all the time. 
They did what they thought was best. 
So there is a time when there is a need.  
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I would like to go through the math of this for a second. 
I think it is pertinent. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The debate is not germane to the bill.  
On a question, the hon. member for Mississauga South.  
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
The Chair has ruled that the motion appears to be entirely admissible. 
The motion does not state any reason for the referral. 
In the opinion of the Chair, the motion is admissible.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
Why has it not been passed into law yet? 
I am shocked by this. 
The message it is sending to them is discouraging.  
He was not elected, of course. 
Then, if the polls seem favourable, an election is called and shipping is forgotten altogether.  
I am like everybody else. 
Generally things are not at their fastest in the Senate. 
It would be almost impossible to get any slower. 
It has come to that. 
This is almost a distress call.  
We know what the Irving Oil disaster cost taxpayers. 
There were other incidents in the St. Lawrence. 
There was the Exxon Valdez . 
Twice ships have run into the Quebec City bridge. 
We managed to avoid any catastrophes. 
The Senate is sending the Liberal government a wake-up call.  
You have to be pretty low.  
Very low indeed, as the member for Trois-Rivieres has pointed out.  
And we should not be worried.  
This is the time to be building new ships. 
Fortunately, in this instance, we have the senators. 
For once in their lives, at least, they will have proven their usefulness. 
The senators are trying to get the government to wake up.  
He urged the federal government to take action in the shipping industry. 
The parliamentary secretary comes from that region. 
I know that he is interested in this.  
Shipping is actually the cheapest mode of transportation. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my colleague mentioned the maritimes. 
There is an important point to be made on preventive action. 
We hope that would be taken into consideration.  
The fewer terms of endearment used, the better. 
That way we will accomplish things in the interests of all.  
In fact, he comes from a region that is greatly affected by it. 
I did not, however, understand his reference to birds. 
I do not know what he meant.  
We will now proceed to Statements by Members.  
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):
Tomorrow we will meet the award winners of the Mathieu Da Costa awards program. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
10. Make all airline tickets to Mexico one way only.  
9. Just do an honest job evaluation.  
8. Cut off the supply of Geritol.  
7. Cut off the supply of alcohol.  
5. Take away the senators' crayons.  
4. Allow the bells to ring during nap time.  
3. Make them try to justify their existence to an ordinary taxpayer.  
2. When we are talking about ``attends'' we are not talking about a brand name.  
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
A person using a white cane is no different from anyone else. 
There are thousands of Canadians who know firsthand the significance of the white cane. 
Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk-Brant, Lib.):
Since that time, training and equipment costs have gone up. 
I believe one of the top priorities should be to encourage volunteerism- 
The hon. member for Nunavut.  
Mrs. Nancy Karetak-Lindell (Nunavut, Lib.):
Our men's hockey team will be playing for gold. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this year there will be at least eight seats vacant in the Senate. 
Canadians want an equal, effective and elected Senate.  
The hon. member for Drummond.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
A young woman from my riding was on this team:
Nancy Drolet from Drummondville.  
Nancy's record is impressive. 
On behalf of my constituents, I congratulate you, Nancy. 
Your determination is something else. 
We wish you all the best in your future endeavours.  
Mr. Bernard Patry (Pierrefonds-Dollard, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Her name is Zoie Gardner. 
She has been doing this labour of love for 60 years.  
By the age of 21 she had 10 kids in her care. 
She is still mothering four disabled adults in their thirties and forties. 
Two of them were her kids since they were six days old.  
At 79, Zoie keeps on mothering. 
She said ``I like kids and I enjoy working with them. 
I have to be busy. 
I do not mind growing old, but I sure mind growing useless''.  
The love of her kids keeps her going. 
Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Kent-Middlesex, Lib.):
Almost half of Canada's adult population score at the lowest literacy level. 
They are unable to reach their full potential as workers, parents and citizens.  
Canadians are taking steps to meet this challenge. 
Opportunities to advance Canadian literacy are being missed. 
Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):
I am sure they all have indelible memories of those days.  
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Does this mean that the NDP has finally woken up? 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, to be or not to be, a surplus or a deficit? 
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Speed skater Annie Perreault won the 500 metre short track.  
The people of the Eastern Townships are eager to see their champion.  
And congratulations to you, Annie, on your gold medal. 
We are very proud of you.  
Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):
For him it surely could not mean Senate elections. 
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
The cat is out of the bag. 
Colleagues, I am always loathe to intervene when people are applauding for another member. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
He said relief would come ``once the budget has been balanced''. 
There is nothing here about down the road, nothing here about over the mandate. 
Now the finance minister says he is not constrained by that promise.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I have the red book here. 
It is exactly the same thing.  
The Reformers are afraid of the next- 
The hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
The Right Hon. Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is going to be done over the mandate. 
The budget is coming. 
The Leader of the Opposition is just jealous.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The Minister of Finance, as I said, over the mandate- 
The hon. member for Edmonton North.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is amazing. 
We are not the Reform Party. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, that is right. 
What is a little contradiction? 
Just like the GST was a little contradiction.  
You can seen over and over again.  
My colleagues, I ask you to stay away from the word lies. 
I do not like it used in the House of Commons. 
I assume you do not either.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, perhaps they will understand better if I explain it in French. 
Our term of office is four or five years. 
The hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Despite the evidence, the Prime Minister is denying the facts.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we keep hearing the same things over and over. 
The ethics counsellor testified before the committee. 
The hon. member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot.  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member sometimes attends sittings of the Standing Committee on Finance. 
So, they try to hit the Minister of Finance below the belt.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
He never talked about it with anyone. 
The opposition did not even notice it.  
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
That is clear to me. 
It is no secret. 
It is public knowledge.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
This is very good news.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have a youth employment strategy that is working. 
I am confident we will get to 70,000 again this year.  
The government likes to deliver on its promises. 
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, whenever I talk with the president I always refer to this problem. 
I hope the American government will be able to help us find a solution.  
Canada is willing and was willing to make an agreement. 
I hope this will result in an agreement. 
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
He supported Canada's position.  
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Yves Fortier was our negotiator on this file for four years. 
We had full confidence in him, confidence which was repeatedly expressed. 
Finally, I would add that deputy minister- 
The hon. member for Battlefords-Lloydminster.  
Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords-Lloydminster, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the finance minister is the owner of Canada Steamship Lines. 
The more money it makes, the more money he makes. 
My question to the Prime Minister- 
My colleagues, I ask you to be very judicious in your choice of words. 
I would like the hon. member to go right to the question.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
It is very clear. 
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister is twisting the facts. 
Here are the facts that Canadians know.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The file was given to the Secretary of State for Finance. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I am not the one sponsoring the bill. 
According to the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for Financial Institutions is. 
Let him ask his secretary of state.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, since the bills at the Department of Finance are very complex- 
It is an omnibus bill. 
This is a practice that has been around for a very long time.  
In this particular case- 
The hon. member for Langley-Abbotsford.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
No, he called the companies themselves. 
Surprise, surprise, the finance minister's own company exonerated itself.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
He said that very clearly in front of the committee.  
That will neither affect the Minister of Finance nor the Canadian public. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
They said they would appoint an ethics commissioner who would report directly to parliament.  
Well, they did not. 
Their so-called ethics counsellor reports in secret to the Prime Minister. 
Scandal after scandal and the ethics counsellor always has enough whitewash for the job.  
I have a question. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
He did not refuse to go there. 
He said very clearly that there was no conflict of interest.  
Opposition members are desperate. 
REFERENCE TO SUPREME COURT 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice. 
No, the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
No, the Prime Minister of Canada.  
In addition, Mike Harris, the Ontario premier, is openly criticizing the federal government's strategy. 
The list of those opposing the reference is growing longer.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The court will examine the matter and give its decision. 
I respect the court and leave it to do its job.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, it seems that Ottawa has fewer and fewer arguments.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
That is not illegal but it says a lot about taxes in this country. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have already done it in the last budget, reducing taxes. 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I think the Prime Minister is missing the point here. 
I have a question for the Prime Minister on behalf of my constituents. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
We want them to keep in very close contact with all the embassies. 
ASSISTANCE TO ICE STORM VICTIMS 
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):
Do we believe this stuff or do we treat it with contempt? 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
It was the prudent thing to do, to agree with the ethics counsellor.  
It is clear that the Minister of Finance followed all the rules.  
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Both times he denied my request, each time for a different reason. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Winnipeg South Centre, Lib.):
They do not include political people. 
We told him that we would keep him informed.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):
Whose opinion is accurate in this case?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is not quoting either Mr. Farber or myself correctly.  
Canada Steamship Lines I understand is not incorporated in Canada.  
Therefore there is no contradiction.  
The hon. member for Winnipeg North Centre.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Health. 
Would you withdraw those words.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
Now I would ask the hon. member to please go directly to her question.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have already started to reinvest. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  
This government has destroyed the fishery on the east coast. 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
That answer, Mr. Speaker, does not help one single fisherman today. 
When will this government come to a clear decision? 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. David Iftody (Provencher, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, international trade is a cornerstone of the Canadian economy. 
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the figures are so good. 
Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):
Ms. Helene Alarie (Louis-Hebert, BQ):
Hon. Martin Cauchon (Secretary of State (Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec), Lib.):
What I announced last week was the result of this peer assessment.  
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
We all know that. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The best way to make these changes is to have the agreement of the provinces. 
It needs to be repartitioned.  
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
They do not understand that without fish you cannot have fishermen. 
This critical fact is completely ignored by the member. 
Mr. Gary Pillitteri (Niagara Falls, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, today is literacy action day. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
My department is supporting the international adult literacy survey.  
COMMENTS DURING QUESTION PERIOD 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
My basic point is correct. 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
I wish to designate Monday as an allotted day. 
Mr. Joe Comuzzi (Thunder Bay-Nipigon, Lib.):
My colleague, your point of order is well taken. 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, that is an excellent question. 
They do not come any slower.  
Is the House ready for the question?  
The question is on the amendment. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the amendment?  
All those in favour of the amendment will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
And the bells having rung: 
It is for the labour and management stakeholders who are affected by its provisions.  
That similarity is not without good reason.  
Jurisdiction is mainly dependent on the nature of the work being performed. 
These industries often cross provincial and international boundaries. 
Canada has had such labour legislation on its books for most of this century. 
The group managed to reach agreement on a number of key issues. 
The task force report was called quite appropriately ``Seeking a Balance''. 
It is important to understand the history of this bill. 
It is substantially the same as its predecessor. 
The proposed amendments are in their total endorsed by the main stakeholders. 
The details are best left for our committee hearings. 
We are introducing changes to representation and successor rights. 
Let me assure members that I have listened to these concerns. 
The employer retains control of operating the system.  
A primary objective here is to reduce delays in the collective bargaining process. 
The most controversial area was the use of replacement workers. 
We have added particular provisions pertaining to disputes related to grain handling. 
The government's commitment to ensure this amendment works remains. 
However the agency has found a more effective way of collecting information. 
Statistics Canada proposes to obtain its information directly from Canadian workers. 
These are the principal amendments proposed for part I of the Canada Labour Code.  
I have outlined its history. 
The amendments proposed are the end result of many hours of consultation. 
It is not time to reinvent the wheel. 
It is not time to go back to the beginning.  
We have the task force report. 
In short, this is balanced legislation. 
It is up to date. 
It is time to get the job done.  
Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):
It is widely acknowledged that high taxes kill jobs. 
Even the finance minister of the Liberal government agrees with that.  
Take the recent postal impasse for instance. 
Weeks of uncertainty over whether or not there would be mail delivery created havoc. 
Customers and business would be assured of a reliable mail service. 
It is fair because it does not favour one side over the other.  
Here is how it works. 
For disputed issues each party would be required to submit a final offer for settlement.  
The arbitrator's decision would be binding on both parties. 
Was it back to work legislation or was it final offer selection arbitration? 
They have to bring in final offer selection to resolve that. 
There is the precedent for the very thing we have been asking for.  
A costly interruption of government business is not required. 
In fact it will actually complicate and hinder the bargaining process.  
That is how we see it, too. 
The inclusion of consent in this bill is crucial.  
How can that be?  
That can be found at the Wal-Mart in Windsor, Ontario. 
If they are opposed, membership should not be forced on them. 
The workers should be empowered to make the decision, not the Canada Industrial Relations Board.  
Where was the benefit in this to the Canadian taxpayers? 
Let us look at how the board operated. 
The things he said leave out nothing. 
That is a pretty condemning statement. 
I applaud the auditor general's courage in making it.  
I sent a formal request to the committee clerk last summer. 
It would have provided MPs with the opportunity to question the chairman. 
It also would have given Mr. Weatherill the opportunity he wanted to publicly defend himself. 
That reason is still unknown to me.  
The government has to answer for the longstanding mismanagement at the CLRB. 
The board's decisions are for all intents and purposes final. 
Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivieres, BQ):
Second, streamlining of the conciliation process. 
This is a situation similar to that of the RCMP. 
Job security too is very important. 
It is a huge structure with many levels. 
I will read paragraph 42(2.1) in order to illustrate my point: 
It would have been so easy to follow Quebec's example. 
Management is obviously not keen on the idea. 
It is a question of balance of power, however. 
But fortunately the legislation was passed in 1977. 
In its wisdom, the Bourassa government decided not to follow his advice.  
Members have heard of the wonderful supreme court. 
That is very significant.  
These are signs of civilization. 
The definition of unfair practice is an important one. 
The hiring of replacement workers should be recognized as an unfair practice. 
Let me read two paragraphs in the brief submitted by the CSN at the hearings: 
I will continue reading Mr. Tremblay's letter.  
The paragraph that follows is very significant. 
This reputation for quality is surely the best guarantee of our jobs. 
They had contributed to the UI plan during all these years. 
Workers do not enjoy being on strike. 
That is why we want- 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
I concur with many of the remarks made by the Minister of Labour. 
By all accounts it was truly comprehensive and thorough. 
Even the most subtle interference by an employer can intimidate an employee in these situations.  
It is simply the right thing to do.  
We are certainly not satisfied that we have done enough in this regard. 
This provision falls well short of true anti-scab legislation. 
The empirical evidence is easily available from as close as the province of Quebec. 
Obviously we wish this language were much stronger. 
It is not meant to be in this round of amendments to the labour code. 
This is one of those things not meant to be in 1997.  
The jury is in on this one. 
There can be no doubt of the basic fairness of this issue. 
Those two things were key and paramount and had to be dealt with.  
It is not a no-strike clause. 
However, in the case of Bill C-19, we are doing better than average. 
We will often have negative people saying this. 
The actual facts do not bear it out.  
They do not know the facts and figures like the numbers I just gave.  
Therefore measures are not necessary to try to address that. 
This is simply not true. 
We cannot tolerate it and we should not be tolerating that kind of an attitude.  
In Manitoba there are fatal workplace accidents every year. 
It is a graphic illustration about how unsafe our workplaces really are. 
Maybe I am hypersensitive about this particular issue. 
As a result we were covered with the stuff. 
One part per billion is too much asbestos. 
That is the kind of example we are dealing with. 
We do not know how many substances are like that in workplaces. 
We have WHMIS legislation. 
We have the right to refuse unsafe work. 
I speak again from my personal background. 
Normal workers do not have that protective umbrella. 
We urge the speedy passage of Bill C-19. 
My colleagues, we are going to have questions and comments for 10 minutes. 
I see two members standing so we will split their time.  
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
There are countries in Europe that are currently proposing banning asbestos. 
That would be devastating for asbestos workers across Canada. 
I would ask the member to please check his facts on that.  
We have had this debate before in this House very briefly. 
It has to do with final offer selection arbitration. 
I think we should pause and reflect on these proposals by the members opposite.  
There is no safe level of asbestos. 
I know a lot about asbestos. 
She wound up with asbestosis after the 20-year incubation period. 
It is not a solution. 
It is not a magic bullet. 
It is nowhere near a new idea. 
It is not even a very good idea. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
I have a couple of questions. 
He is from Manitoba.  
So what if he is from Manitoba, that is an agricultural province is it not? 
The member does not fully understand. 
The changes to this are making his argument for him. 
Yes, it is true. 
The grain will be loaded onto the ships and it will be shipped out.  
I do not think he really understands how labour relations work.  
The province of Manitoba does have a great agricultural industry. 
You haven't done yours.  
You are absolutely wrong.  
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Unfortunately, the government chose to make half-hearted changes. 
We know how important the proposed changes to the Canada Labour Code are. 
For instance, this is what Nancy Riche of the Canadian Labour Congress had to say: 
These arguments still ring true in Bill C-19. 
Furthermore, an article in the Financial Post expressed the following concerns: 
What this means exactly isn't entirely clear. 
By minimizing these concerns, the minister could justify sweeping them under the carpet.  
Unfortunately, these amendments do not appear to be enough. 
In Bill C-19 the legislation remains unchanged on this point.  
What was the unfair labour practice? 
What were they supposed to say? 
It will ensure the quality of the legislation passed by this House.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I was interested in the member's comments. 
They deal with the old board with a new name.  
In other words, there is no appeal, for the most part. 
I am curious about the member's opinion on that point.  
Again, there is a fair amount of power associated with that kind of decision making. 
I am wondering what the member thinks of that.  
And there are lots of them over there.  
It takes away the responsibility of the minister in dealing with the issue at hand. 
In other words, he is no longer accountable. 
When the board makes a decision, its intents and purposes are supposed to be final. 
What is the recourse that an employer would have? 
What is the recourse even that an employee or group of employees would have?  
I agree with the hon. member. 
What is the recourse for the employees who did not want it?  
There are other vehicles that we can put in place. 
In every strike, where it starts is exactly right there. 
Would it pass legislation anyway?  
Madam Speaker, I asked a question of the member for Winnipeg. 
Being from the legal profession, that gentleman answers from that point of view.  
This legislation fits into that whole scheme of things.  
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Clause 87.7(1) states: 
Madam Speaker, I am not from a grain area, I am from New Brunswick. 
I would also want to look at other industries. 
Hopefully it applies to all ports and all unions. 
That is my understanding. 
I do not know if it is his understanding. 
They are all federally regulated.  
The comments of the hon. member are well taken. 
I certainly approve of that.  
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Would there be consent for me to do that?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Does the House give its consent?  
Madam Speaker, I appreciate the niceness of my colleagues this evening.  
Rather, it seeks to bring the code more into line with present realities.  
Both of these objectives are very timely.  
They are now regulated by the code. 
In the face of these changes, unions have generally been on the defensive. 
The economic impact of work stoppages prevented by the FMCS is incalculable.  
This bill deserves all of our support.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
NATIONAL HEAD START PROGRAM 
They were incarcerated for the nth time in this institution. 
They were individuals who had endured many years of suffering. 
Their parents were prostitutes. 
One young woman was found murdered at the end of a lonely road. 
We see the children who are affected by the problems in our society. 
We look at those who are in custody in detention centres. 
We have to move our thinking and engage in a paradigm shift. 
We have to change our thinking. 
The motion is based on a few programs. 
She has done an outstanding job.  
I would also like to pay credit to my colleague from Saanich-Gulf Islands. 
This program recognizes that there needs to be parental involvement in the development of children. 
The Moncton head start program demonstrated that very conclusively. 
It decreased crime rates. 
It decreased the incidents of those children running afoul of the law. 
They stayed in school longer. 
It also demonstrated a $6 saving for every dollar that was put into the program.  
The Hawaii head start program has been in existence for quite some time. 
These were dealt with in a co-operative arrangement. 
The outcome was a 99% drop in child abuse.  
The last program has actually been in existence the longest. 
This is a win-win situation. 
It also demonstrated a massive saving to the taxpayer.  
There are good things and bad things. 
If this motion is to become a reality, it requires a leader. 
I will be the first to admit that. 
Some of them are good and some of them are not. 
The left hand does not know what the right hand is doing.  
In that way there is no overlap. 
There is also the national children's agenda that exists. 
I argue that this is a motion that transcends party lines. 
There is the increasing epidemic of crime. 
This is not an isolated incident. 
That needs to happen for certain people and we need to do that too. 
FAS is the leading cause of neurological damage in this country. 
People with FAS have an average IQ of 68. 
An unfortunate number of those individuals go on to commit crimes. 
It is a tragedy when any of these children come to see you.  
I will speak personally of my work in emergency departments. 
You have a scared, emaciated child sitting in a corner. 
Now the child is a bubbly, chubby, smiling, gregarious, playful little one. 
It is the system. 
Who knows where they will end up? 
They will end up in a place none of us would want to be.  
That is the best asset any child can ever have.  
This is the first hour of debate on this motion. 
There are two hours left. 
In advance I thank my colleagues for spending the time to do the investigation. 
Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Children and Youth), Lib.):
We cannot legislate love. 
We cannot legislate proper nurturing. 
We can provide the tools for families, individuals and communities. 
Child development is a complicated issue. 
These initiatives include the community action program for children. 
This is a very successful program. 
The aboriginal head start we have found so successful that we have expanded on it. 
We have doubled the funding. 
I would like to see a further expansion.  
This adds much to the self-esteem of the individual once they have that basis. 
The Canada prenatal nutrition program is another one that talks about early head start. 
We believe we have a head start when it comes to this initiative. 
It is extremely successful, not only with the children but also with the parenting. 
The federal government has very clear jurisdiction. 
We went forward and instituted $72 million. 
All Canadians will be invited to help shape this agenda. 
This is one approach. 
This is one effort.  
We are doubling the funding.  
I congratulate the hon. member. 
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
It is critical and comes at a critical time in our development. 
We do not have the ability to stay home and look after our children. 
It is a very sensitive issue both culturally and individually. 
I have worked with people who have had their children taken away from them. 
Extreme trauma is suffered by both the children and the parents.  
When Reena Virk was killed we all felt horror and outrage. 
Where did we fail? 
The motion is an attempt to look at where we failed. 
Through every gesture which shows care and protection we show love. 
It is up to us to do that.  
For children sporting events are difficult situations. 
We can teach how to love and how to care. 
We can set the example.  
A lot of it is poverty. 
We have to intervene when there is abuse, whether it is physical, emotional or verbal. 
Again that relates to teaching.  
That does not have to be part of our society.  
We should remove stress from families. 
Once again I would like to say it is not just about money. 
It is very difficult to be left alone with many young children. 
We need to help each other in bringing up our children. 
It benefits us all, or it will be to the detriment of us all.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
This disdain of workers has its limits. 
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
They will also be less likely to commit serious crimes. 
I think we must do everything possible to prevent crime. 
As they say, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  
Both children and their parents must be educated.  
It is difficult to turn around problems of this nature later in life.  
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
All these are issues we are all looking at. 
It can often be traced back to childhood experiences, the reasons for aggressive behaviour.  
Their research has revealed that resilient children generally have certain characteristics. 
It should look at ways of implementing it. 
Never mind the name, never mind the party. 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I thank the member from the other side. 
This is a very serious issue. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Does the hon. member have unanimous consent?  
Madam Speaker, I thank the members present in the House.  
There are programs out there and he would like them to work together. 
That is what this is all about.  
We must go beyond crime management. 
We must shift to crime prevention. 
They have a devastating effect on children.  
They were easy to identify. 
I know we could debate that.  
The Reena Virk case is an example. 
I probably saw some of these youths in the courtroom when I was practising law. 
It is the very courtroom I practised in. 
It brings tears to our eyes. 
The worst part is that this is not an isolated event. 
These are not isolated incidents.  
We as parliamentarians have a responsibility to co-ordinate. 
I do not believe the member is asking for a big wheelbarrow full of money. 
These examples prove to us that the earlier years in life are so crucial. 
This is a very small investment with a huge return. 
It is like an RRSP, the benefits are just enormous at the back end.  
They go right back to when the woman is still pregnant. 
If assistance is needed at that time it is provided. 
There is also a program in Michigan which my colleague has spoken about. 
These programs are working and that is the most important part. 
The long term savings to the taxpayers will be absolutely enormous. 
It works out to roughly $6 in dividends for every $1 invested. 
This is going on the statistics from these other programs. 
That in itself is something we cannot ignore.  
The Reform Party stands for tougher laws. 
I practised in the criminal courts myself and of my own choosing. 
Sometimes we would get the family in there. 
We would send them off to counselling, probation, all kinds of programs. 
It almost brings tears to one's eyes.  
That is what they went through.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
The minister's answer was very instructive. 
Only the government can do that. 
But then he said the Government of Canada stands behind that. 
Is that not reassuring?  
Guess who the Government of Canada gets its money from. 
That is not very reassuring.  
I hope people who are watching these debates at home will answer the same question.  
Now I need your advice. 
I have heard about a good new investment. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am sorry but the hon. member's time has expired.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Those who say otherwise are mistaken and those who wish otherwise are wrong.  
Ultimately this is about values. 
You either believe in the CPP or you do not. 
The Reform Party does not. 
Which taxes do the Reform Party want to increase to pay these outstanding obligations?  
This type of statement is incorrect. 
Young people will receive $1.80 for every dollar of contributions. 
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
I too have children. 
They are not really children any more. 
They want to know about opportunities for advancement. 
They want to know about training opportunities.  
It is about 12% for young people. 
Recently the minister approved a program known as Ice Youth. 
These young people will be trained and given class b refrigeration licences. 
We are going to give you a trade. 
I hope the parliamentary secretary can reassure me an my constituents- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am sorry but the hon. member's time has expired.  
Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for his very important question.  
Much remains to be done. 
They reiterated the need to work together.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.49 p.m.)
