EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 239 
Monday, June 7, 1999 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
That is exactly what Bill C-251 is designated to deliver. 
I call that double discretion.  
I have listened and I have learned from their advice. 
Let the judges do their job.  
Let me be clear once again. 
We know that it will not cost one cent for ten years. 
Second reading occurred not yesterday, but seven months ago. 
More debate is yet to come in the Senate. 
It is a decision that should be respected.  
Is it liberal to initiate this kind of change? 
What they found did not surprise me.  
That is the message I got at the door in my riding. 
Their outrage is not political; it arises from the people's sense of justice.  
With judicial discretion, that number would surely increase to an even higher level. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-251. 
It deals with individuals who are already in prison and who unlawfully go at large. 
That is only one facility out of the seven in the area.  
In other words, there is no extra time. 
Once he is out he robs a bank. 
He receives the same amount of time.  
This is about people who commit severe crimes, multiple crimes, multiple murders and rapes.  
They will have to relive this all over again. 
They are asking whether the punishment fits the crime. 
In this case we have serious rape offences and multiple murders. 
What we have to deal with is whether Bill C-251 is an appropriate bill. 
I sincerely believe it is. 
The second issue is how we get it through the House of Commons. 
It is time to stand up and be counted.  
That the question be now put.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
I am going to address three things. 
In the haste to move those amendments, I have some concerns about the drafting. 
There has not been time to adequately review them in the way we normally would. 
How can offenders serve more than their life?'' 
That is the question to ask. 
A member of the Reform Party is yelling at me, saying that is not it. 
We are adding two or three life sentences.  
Is that the direction in which to go? 
If we say there should be multiple life sentences then I ask that question. 
I respect and believe this comment. 
Can I judge that? 
If I cannot, can I ask the judiciary to do it? 
I will turn to the comments made by the mover. 
Again I say I respect her opinion. 
Perhaps we have taken more from the offender. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
He raised some very soul searching and gut wrenching questions in his commentary.  
It will not be retroactive. 
It is extremely unfortunate. 
I suggest quite the opposite. 
There is no mandatory minimum or maximum reflected in this change.  
Clifford Olson is serving 11 concurrent life sentences. 
Pedophile John Roby was convicted of 35 counts of sexually abusing children. 
It would be a shift in the right direction. 
It is also a welcome example of what can occur with co-operation. 
Fifty years ineligibility would be a more reflective response. 
This greater discretion should be encouraged and embraced by members of the House. 
I encourage all members present to support Bill C-251.  
Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):
There are many issues that should be studied. 
There are some factual errors. 
For instance, what is a sentence for first degree murder? 
The motives for this bill are certainly commendable. 
Everyone empathizes with the plight of victims. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
It being 11.50 a.m., the time provided for debate has expired.  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
All those opposed will please say nay.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The first to vote will be the mover of the motion. 
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi:
Mr. Speaker, I want to vote in favour of the motion.  
Were you here when the voting began?  
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi:
You will be recorded.  
I am addressing the hon. member for Charlesbourg. 
How do you want to vote?  
Mr. Speaker, I am voting for the motion.  
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried. 
The next question is on the main motion.  
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the yeas have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
Then we will start with the fifth row and come forward.  
(The House divided on the motion, which was agreed to on the following division:) 
I declare the motion carried.  
(Bill read the third time and passed) 
ALLOTTED DAY-AMATEUR SPORT 
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ) moved: 
The Bloc Quebecois is introducing the following motion on its opposition day: 
Members will, I am sure, get that same impression.  
Yes, I was a competitive figure skater. 
I focused on my studies and then went into politics. 
Do members know what is serious here? 
Nothing has changed in the past 15 years. 
We are far from an improvement. 
In fact, I would call it a backslide.  
The facts would certainly seem to bear us out. 
The assistance now provided by Sport Canada falls badly short. 
This is not a good sign.  
Every study conclusively shows that athletes often live below the poverty line. 
Even the hon. member for Bourassa agrees with me on that issue. 
There is a shift toward centres such as Calgary and Toronto. 
In her letter to the head of the committee, the minister wrote: 
Such a convincing demonstration that the minister is going to wait a while yet. 
She is not too sure. 
I will give one example: the skaters Isabelle and Paul Duchesnay. 
And the government is doing nothing to resolve the situation.  
This simply makes no sense.  
The government must become a decisive player and correct things now. 
In this case, why not let Quebec have its own banner? 
Quebec could do sports as it understands them. 
We could manage our federations properly and really give priority to our athletes.  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
The member, Suzanne Tremblay, was with us- 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
I had to put those remarks on the floor of the House of Commons.  
I also have to say that the government is passionately committed to amateur sport. 
It is an unprecedented response.  
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
I think he made a substantial contribution to amateur sport. 
That is not true.  
She wants to invest money, but does nothing for amateur sport.  
He is welcome at any time.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Yet the future of professional sport is not so- 
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
Mr. Pierre Brien: -promising. 
It will never be what it once was. 
Perhaps they would give more time to covering amateur sports. 
This would focus more attention on the unprecedented success stories.  
I recently attended a boxing match. 
What goes on there can very easily happen in amateur sport. 
It is a very good illustration of how things are. 
A fighter's career can be over in a matter of seconds. 
Do we give them enough support? 
We certainly agree with that.  
There is a strong pull from Calgary in amateur sport. 
They deprived Quebec of a number of sports facilities. 
Imagine what is going on in the wings.  
It would be extraordinary and something else.  
There was a team from Quebec, and it was great to see the game. 
The competition was really interesting.  
The government should, among other things, increase its financial involvement with all the federations. 
There should be a review of all of them.  
The selection of those federations that are currently getting help is highly questionable. 
Several need support but are not getting it. 
The government should quickly look at this issue. 
Amateur athletes do not have that luxury. 
I have a much greater respect for amateur athletes than for some professional athletes. 
We are all proud of Gaetan Boucher, Myriam Bedard and Sylvie Frechette. 
That is not the goal. 
The goal is to support athletes. 
If we keep that as a goal we will be on the right track.  
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
Where did he get this idea and what would be the effect?  
Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for her question.  
It was not just the sovereignists saying so. 
For example, this is already possible in the Francophonie games. 
We have extremely capable athletes. 
Where I come from we have Denise Julien, in badminton, who is a great athlete. 
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
Madam Speaker, I cannot help but smile at the hon. member's grandstanding.  
They have not done a single thing to help the people in amateur sport.  
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
I have been working on this issue for two years. 
This is an important point.  
The Bloc is taking a position against professional sport. 
I will never invest in Montreal's Expos. 
I will stop talking about professional sport, because they have understood nothing.  
What does that mean? 
I want to talk about specific and important issues. 
It is true that opposition parties did not support all of the report. 
They would have liked to go further on some recommendations. 
That is my first point.  
This means it will take some time. 
This means we will be talking about the sport issue. 
We decided to take a stand on amateur sport. 
Some things must be done about taxation. 
It is not to the gang on the other side. 
Let us be serious. 
We heard remarks a while ago about the Canadian Olympic Association. 
We have suggested alternatives. 
This recommendation provides for a sports summit.  
What happened with it? 
I do not care what the other side may think. 
We can do things together. 
They want to help athletes. 
They want to help parents''.  
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
It would be good for him to keep that in mind.  
I did indeed apply pressure regarding official languages. 
By contrast, what members across the floor decided to do- 
If only they listened, it would help them.  
We really want to work toward solutions and solve problems. 
From the start, they have tried to use personal attacks and demagoguery. 
They have tried to say that the sport millionaires contribute to slush funds. 
I do not know what funds they are referring to, or which sport millionaires. 
Of the 69 recommendations, 53 have been accepted. 
That is what is important to us.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Madam Speaker, usually the member for Bourassa makes me laugh. 
What he says often has to be taken with a grain of salt. 
Today, however, I do not find it funny at all. 
First of all, things have to be said in all honesty. 
Madam Speaker, it is not the first time that I complain. 
Way back when I talked to the commissioner. 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to rise to debate this particular topic. 
I would like to completely change the tone of where we have been.  
The report itself is an excellent report. 
The work of the people involved in generating the report is good. 
There have been some good suggestions. 
That is worthy of consideration.  
So there was a concession there.  
There is a lot of money within the system as it presently sits.  
The point is that this was, unfortunately, all predictable. 
Hockey is a high profile issue. 
It is, after all, our Canadian sport. 
This is a way in which we can build our society. 
This is a very healthy outlet for young people today.  
In that respect I agree with the motion of the Bloc. 
Unfortunately, we may have to re-invent the wheel. 
It brings us together in good, healthy competition and camaraderie around events. 
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Does he support that? 
Madam Speaker, that is certainly a very thought provoking question. 
I happen to think that $1.8 million is a grotesque amount of money. 
I cannot imagine earning that kind of money in the first place. 
That is too big a difference.  
Do you support the tax cuts?  
Yes, I do support the tax cuts.  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
However, because he spoke today he obviously read the report. 
The House is about dealing in hope. 
Why does the member repeatedly say things that he knows are not factually correct?  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to join in the debate this afternoon. 
I support the Bloc motion, which states: 
I wanted to acknowledge that because it is very important.  
As a citizen of Canada I have participated in a number of amateur sport activities. 
It promotes physical fitness. 
It provides skills in personal achievement and motor skill development. 
It is a very healthy focus for competition. 
It provides a sense of belonging and camaraderie. 
It enhances communication and interpersonal development for our youth. 
I support, as does the New Democratic Party caucus, a number of issues. 
I might add that in Saskatchewan we have gone one step further. 
They also play a very important role in developing the sports organizations in our province.  
How do we facilitate these youngsters getting more experience in the sport world? 
Perhaps we could provide tax deductions for them.  
We think that would be a good opportunity to broaden financing for the sports world.  
As the New Democratic member on the subcommittee I issued a minority report. 
Let us take hockey, for example. 
There are 650 professional hockey players in the NHL. 
The average income is $1,187,000 U.S. or $1,800,000 Canadian. 
That is the average income of the 650 players. 
Now it is being spread out to the hockey players and their families. 
That is competition, but it is hurting Canadian hockey teams. 
We do not have a problem with that.  
The NHL does not do that. 
In Canada it is the same time situation. 
The Montreal Canadiens pay $11.2 million a year in property taxes. 
They are the ones charging the taxes. 
I would support that.  
I say let the municipalities address the issue. 
The Montreal Canadiens pay more in property taxes than 21 U.S. franchises combined. 
Do we want the Canadian taxpayers to subsidize Montreal further? 
I and other Canadians think not.  
We have a few other issues here. 
Should they get tax breaks? 
It is unfair and we should look at this situation.  
The Liberal government has failed to act on those recommendations. 
I support the motion of the Bloc. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
That money goes into the treasuries.  
These NHL teams are not being subsidized. 
Madam Speaker, the member makes an interesting point.  
I am not saying it is wrong. 
Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I have to say to the hon. member that I heard more than one no.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak in support of the Bloc motion.  
I know the work of all the members was appreciated.  
Members of the subcommittee on sport heard hours of testimony. 
The most contentious issue was obvious. 
The Montreal Expos have experienced problems. 
This comes from a parent.  
This is where I would like to see my tax dollars directed''.  
Eric Mott wrote the following words: ``Our national athletes receive zero dollars. 
Imagine having to pay to train to represent your country''.  
It is obviously not just professional hockey. 
Mr. Wayne Gretzky has a bit of spare time on his hands now. 
My colleague, I will interrupt you now. 
It being nearly 2 p.m., we shall move on to Statements by Members.  
INTERNATIONAL YEAR OF OLDER PERSONS 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):
Our national theme for 1999 is ``Canada, a society for all ages''.  
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
See you in the Cariboo.  
Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):
That was 55 years ago. 
The liberation of Europe was under way.  
On that day 340 Canadians died, 547 were wounded and 47 were taken prisoner.  
GOVERNOR GENERAL'S FOOT GUARDS 
Mrs. Judi Longfield (Whitby-Ajax, Lib.):
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
THE LATE LEON LAJOIE 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
``Our captain is gone'', commented parishioners as they were coming out of church.  
Everyone trusted Leon Lajoie. 
Leon Lajoie, is worthy of all our admiration. 
Let us hope we can learn from his example.  
Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Kitchener-Waterloo, Lib.):
This event celebrates the excellence of Canada's young people.  
Congratulations to all the weekend's participants.  
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
We are all proud to say with her ``Mission accomplished''.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it is decision day in New Brunswick. 
He has pulled ahead in this race with the finish line in sight. 
Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne-Blainville, BQ):
The next day they understood. 
Deliverance was at hand. 
The landing had just begun. 
The mysterious coded message was a warning to the French resistance.  
Let us never forget.  
Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):
We are proud of Julie and welcome her home.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Today, he is continuing his rehabilitation.  
I say ``Bravo'', to Jean-Francois and thanks for that example of courage.  
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Lucien Bouchard has decided to play tough in recent days. 
Worse still, he is also appropriating the definition of Quebec's identity.  
This is the model people want.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Each day our military personnel risk their lives by flying these outdated military aircraft. 
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):
They have been awarded first prize in the prestigious Toshiba/NSTA Explora Vision Awards program. 
Their science project is intended to combat osteoporosis. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, our position is clear. 
Certainly the NATO military people are ready to resume discussions. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
I am sure he is carrying them out with great skill and with great vigour.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is no conflict of interest. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, those arms get pretty short.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
The Prime Minister does not own the shares in question. 
They were sold before he became Prime Minister. 
The Prime Minister does not need to clear his name. 
There is no conflict of interest. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Now we have a minister of homelessness with no budget. 
Hon. Claudette Bradshaw (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
I was at the FCM meeting. 
I met with the FCM executive. 
We are going to take its report and look at its recommendations. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
The municipalities have made homelessness a priority. 
They have done their homework and produced a detailed plan of action.  
When will the government show some leadership?  
Hon. Claudette Bradshaw (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the government started when it appointed me as a conciliator. 
It appointed 19 different departments that we are now working with. 
We have done something.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Not everyone is on the same page here.  
My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
That is where the answer lies to the hon. member's question.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I am afraid that is far from it.  
We do not need another Somalia. 
Are they to be disarmed or not?  
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
There was no conflict of interest. 
There is no conflict of interest.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
In this case it is the Prime Minister and the taxpayers.  
The conflict comes in when there is a direct opposition to those two interests. 
They are in conflict. 
Everyone can see that they are in conflict.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the premise of the hon. member's question is wrong. 
The Prime Minister made no such admission.  
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau-Mirabel, BQ):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau-Mirabel, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I would have liked to hear what the Prime Minister had to say.  
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Who is telling the truth?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
The article quoted her as saying that Mr. Prince still owns the shares. 
She should admit that and apologize for it.  
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
She was wrong, wrong last week and she is wrong, wrong, wrong today.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
They concern his trust. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Look how far we have sunk.  
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
The Canadian navy currently has 12 new frigates. 
It has 12 new maritime coastal defence vessels. 
We are waiting to take delivery of four new Upholder class submarines. 
We are working on a procurement plan to replace our Sea King helicopters.  
The Canadian navy served in the gulf war and it continues to do so. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, of course the Liberal government is going to disagree. 
It cut 25% of the budget to the military. 
What is the Minister of National Defence going to do to correct this deficiency?  
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):
This creates a lot of problems for Canadians.  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
We have implemented a regulation that was proposed last year. 
We are the leading country on this continent with regard to these reductions. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
That contractual relationship has dissolved.  
Surely the hon. member would not ask me to do otherwise.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member's question is completely inappropriate and wrong. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
The United States brought its tribal councils to the table and its state governors. 
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Strangway-Ruckleshaus recommended the government negotiations. 
We undertook those negotiations. 
The hon. member for Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, we know that the minister signed a 10 year deal. 
All questions must be addressed to the Chair.  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
The endowment fund helps science and helps habitat. 
We have moved fish to Canada. 
There have been 4.1 million more fish for Canadians.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
When the various reviews are done, that information will be provided.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Labour. 
I did not get an answer, so I will ask the question again.  
Hon. Claudette Bradshaw (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, both parties are at a crucial time right now. 
My staff is working both with NavCan and CATCA. 
It would jeopardize the situation if I commented any further. 
We are in crucial negotiations. 
I hope to see and end to this dispute soon.  
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
The issue of women's equality has been at the top of our agenda. 
We continue to fund women's organizations. 
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Therefore he may still own them.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has said he does not own the shares. 
They were sold before he became Prime Minister. 
The shares belong to a Mr. Prince. 
The Prime Minister's trustee is helping Mr. Prince to find a buyer. 
That does not mean that the Prime Minister owns the shares.  
I am shocked to hear the NDP say that someone has to prove their innocence. 
The NDP should be ashamed of themselves for abandoning this basic principle.  
TANCOOK ISLAND FERRY WHARF 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry.  
Canadians often hear the words knowledge based economy. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Communities across the country need the opportunity- 
The hon. member for Langley-Abbotsford.  
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
Since the Minister of Finance- 
The member for Laval Centre.  
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral:
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Frankly, this is beyond comprehension. 
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status of Women), Lib.):
That is what I can speak about.  
TANCOOK ISLAND FERRY WHARF 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the Chester ferry debacle gets worse and worse. 
Tancook Island residents have parked on this federal property since that time.  
My question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. 
How could that be done?  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
STANDING COMMITTEE ON FISHERIES AND OCEANS 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
In no way did I wish to jeopardize the work of the committee.  
This question of privilege was raised. 
The hon. member has apologized to the House and we accept his apology. 
The matter is closed.  
I have received notice of a question of privilege from the hon. member for Sherbrooke. 
Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, not the one of today. 
It concerns the member for Vaudreuil-Soulanges and the Finance subcommittee.  
Maingot states in chapter 2 at page 229: 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The individual concerned was not in the House. 
Does the hon. member have permission to put the motion?  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Your committee requests that the government table a comprehensive response to this report.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I know the hon. member for Kamloops is knowledgeable of procedures in the House. 
MISCELLANEOUS STATUTE LAW AMENDMENT ACT, 1999

Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):
This is from a UNICEF report.  
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
The petitioners are asking parliament to follow through with action concerning nuclear disarmament.  
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
It is signed by a number of constituents right across the country.  
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
CIVIL SERVICE PENSION PLAN 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
The petitioners are asking parliament to take some kind of action. 
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, NDP):
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
They believe that it violates international law and undermines the United Nations.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Is there unanimous consent to revert to Tabling of Documents?  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
It should in fact have been no less than 20.  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Is there unanimous consent?  
Mr. Speaker, Question No. 238 will be answered today. 
Question No. 238- Mr. Rob Anders: 
Year-1995-96-1996-97-1997-98-1998-99 
Direct Jobs-7,000-7,500-10,000-9,700 
Indirect Jobs-2,800-3,000-4,000-3,900 
Total Jobs-9,800-10,500-14,000-13,600 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
Shall the remaining questions stand?  
ALLOTTED DAY-AMATEUR SPORT 
The House resumed consideration of the motion, and of the amendment.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
I think the report highlights the importance of putting emphasis on Canadian sport. 
The debate taking place today is certainly one of great importance. 
It also comes down to priorities. 
I congratulate the Bloc for having the foresight to bring the matter forward again. 
Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to what the member had to say. 
I know about the seven national sports centres. 
I know about the Canada Games. 
I have been involved with those. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
I have always felt that he was a very good sport.  
That is my reading of it.  
The chair of the committee might be able to provide that information. 
This is what we are at a sticking point on.  
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
The motion reads as follows: 
What does the report say? 
Let us talk about the wages. 
It would be doomed to bankruptcy.  
We all know what is going on in Pittsburgh. 
Tampa Bay is short $20 million. 
These people come to Ottawa to complain about their situation. 
His behaviour is unacceptable.  
On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. Speaker, I wish to raise a question of privilege. 
I did not hear the remarks attributed to the hon. member for Lotbiniere. 
I brought this evidence here this afternoon. 
This is another nice gift from the Minister of Canadian Heritage. 
It rubs them the wrong way. 
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I am happy to see the true face of the Bloc. 
I have a question to ask based on a quotation. 
Quebec prefers to pay rather than accept Ottawa's partnership''. 
Is he in agreement with this decision?  
A maple festival was held in my riding. 
Plessisville had a Canada Place tent imposed upon them. 
The government is a propaganda specialist. 
Before they rise to speak they ought to get their facts straight.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Some are not getting a cent at the present time. 
That was even one of the recommendations of the subcommittee. 
If the member for Bourassa has amnesia, that is not our problem.  
How did this lack of support go over in the Quebec City region?  
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Once again, I do not believe this is a point of order.  
Mr. Speaker, I must say that Quebec City was very disappointed. 
This is the way the government works.  
They accept the decision, but they know where the Liberals come from.  
Amateur athletes were horrified. 
Quebecer Jean-Luc Brassard raised the following question: 
Should we perhaps in the future march behind our sponsor's flag?  
It is a black day for amateur sport. 
Amateur sport has been cheated.  
These NHL teams are playing in a small market.  
However, we are still waiting for a definition of small market. 
Over a five-year period, we are talking $300 million.  
I have a few suggestions for the Minister of Industry. 
Such deductions amount to tens of millions of dollars.  
What gets professional clubs into trouble is players' salaries.  
That is what Mr. Aubut said and I think he is right.  
Our millionaires in hockey and other professional sports are truly spoiled. 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
How could we give amateur sport greater priority?  
But what good would that do? 
We had a sport department when the Conservatives were in office. 
Things would be the same as they were then.  
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
They had a tremendous showing in the Memorial Cup. 
The hon. member does not want to go out of order in his remarks.  
Mr. Speaker, I am just making a valid point. 
The Belleville Bulls had a very successful year.  
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
First, is the minister aware of the fact that this is not enough? 
I would like to hear what he has to say on another point. 
What does the minister think of all that? 
Does he agree, yes or no?  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, quite frankly I wish I had a little more than 10 minutes. 
That is something that has slipped today.  
I only want to read two paragraphs from it but it is very important: 
I believe this is a part of the report that we are not focusing on. 
That is the essence of the report.  
We talk in the House about fiscal priorities. 
The professional system in the country depends entirely on the amateur development system. 
I am saying something on top of that point. 
Only one in 250,000 young kids becomes a professional athlete. 
I thank all members who worked on the committee for their co-operation. 
We will continue to move forward.  
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, first of all, I wish to thank my colleague from Broadview-Greenwood. 
I share some of his points of view.  
He has a lot to say about the recommendation on professional sport. 
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
That was never part of the deal.  
We also put on the table some areas where we thought moneys could be generated. 
I see great hope for that in the future. 
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
I am also a very strong advocate for and supporter of amateur sports. 
What recommendations are we addressing regarding the qualifications of the providers?  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills:
We have appealed to the Minister of Human Resources Development Canada. 
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
To talk about sports is to take a look at society. 
Naturally, there is a difference to be made between the two types of sport.  
I was speaking earlier about identification with teams. 
It is currently the case with sport, and this in many respects. 
We are not alone. 
We are investing in sport teams that pay incredible salaries to their employees. 
Such a societal issue cannot be resolved in 10 minutes. 
Still, I am concerned and I wonder where it will stop. 
I think that professional sport is a prime example of that.  
Earlier I mentioned education, as did the member opposite. 
This is also a worrisome phenomenon. 
I could mention other worrisome phenomena, such as the invasion of Nintendo games. 
However, I am pleased to have taken part in the debate.  
Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood, Lib.):
When I say the amateur sport fabric I am not just talking about hockey. 
We have over 550,000 registered soccer participants, boys and girls, in this country. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
They are trying to juggle truth and fiction.  
They already have all of the tax deductions. 
They already have all of those breaks. 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
I think that the member for Ottawa-Vanier is a bit confused. 
Subsequently, if the member has intelligent questions to ask, he may do so. 
This is the questions and comments period. 
It was not up to him to answer.  
It is now the turn of the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean. 
It is directed at him, and I have nothing to say.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
My colleague's motion reads as follows: 
The priority is to promote national unity, which is a propaganda mandate. 
We are strongly opposed to using sport to promote national unity.  
The federal government is in urgent need of re-examining its priorities.  
This is what all members of the public are opposed to. 
Once again, the facts seem to bear this out.  
There is considerable consternation in the world of amateur sport at this time. 
This is a black day for amateur sport. 
Amateur sport has been cheated.  
Compared to other G-7 countries, our athletes are second class citizens.  
Will we have to parade behind our sponsors' flags in the future?  
They have made it a political issue more than ever before. 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
In fact, the opposite is happening. 
These budgets were slashed. 
The member for Bourassa boasts about working a lot for amateur sport. 
I believe he is actually working much more for professional sport. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my hon. colleague from Berthier-Montcalm for his question.  
No, it is not normal. 
They are doomed to oblivion because their funding was abolished.  
It should encourage and support our amateur athletes.  
I want to give another example. 
This is very upsetting to us.  
Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):
It is a pleasure for me to rise today to speak to this motion. 
I want to congratulate the mover of the motion. 
I also want to talk about the government's continued commitment to sport in Canada.  
Sport is culture and sport promotes healthy lives. 
Sport is the point at which the game and fitness merge. 
We as Canadians have a long tradition of sport.  
That is why I consider this subcommittee and its mandate to be so important. 
I have a true appreciation for amateur sport. 
I think that is a result of being from a maritime province. 
Sport involvement is vital in improving the chances of youth at risk. 
I have often wondered where our inactivity comes from. 
Technology has now made it possible for us to choose to lead less active lives. 
Street hockey has been replaced by video games. 
The Internet is making us more insular. 
It all points to a more insular and less active society. 
Frankly, this scares me.  
This sort of inactivity is deadly. 
These diseases cost the Canadian health system millions of dollars each year. 
How do we increase the number of active Canadians? 
Increasingly this is not the case. 
The government understands the benefit of increased participation.  
These groups include aboriginals, women and athletes with disabilities.  
The Government of Canada will continue its policy and funding support of sport in Canada. 
Like coaching, the government is also committed to creating competitive venues for amateur athletes. 
Canada's amateur sport is celebrated when the Canada Games convene. 
I understand the value of sport- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I am sorry but the hon. member's time has expired.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question will be a short one.  
What it said was as follows: 
On the international scene English is the international language. 
We did make recommendations that all these sporting events be made bilingual.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Seriously, though, my question has to do with federal support of amateur sports. 
The way it is right now we are taxed to death at every turn. 
Governments at all three levels spend 50% of our earnings. 
We put that in our report. 
I think we will see it come to fruition in the days to come.  
Mr. Murray Calder (Dufferin-Peel-Wellington-Grey, Lib.):
Nothing could be further from the truth. 
We have kept that promise.  
Indeed that is what Canada is all about. 
The athletes are at the centre of our expenditures whether directly or indirectly.  
We needed to provide additional support to developing athletes and we have done that. 
I agree with the hon. member behind me, it is good.  
The second area of the new funding is coaching. 
Access to qualified coaches is a key ingredient for athletic success. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
There is one thing I would like some clarification on by the hon. member. 
What is the government doing in that regard?  
We have worked with minor sports in our area. 
The member asked what is available for families. 
There are tax issues where we are working for low income Canadians. 
If it happens to be sports, then that is what they do.  
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
During the same period, funds given to amateur sports were dangerously reduced. 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member across the way talks about contradiction. 
We had close to $600 billion of accumulated public debt. 
Cuts were made to amateur sports. 
Cuts were made to everything to get the government's books back in line. 
We have done that.  
We are living up to that commitment.  
Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):
It has a lot of good things in it. 
We are bureaucracy crazy. 
Everything is run by bureaucracies. 
The Liberal government seems to be study crazy. 
Another one is legalized betting on sport. 
Just scrap that whole idea.  
I have spent many years of my life educating and coaching our youth. 
There can be little doubt in anybody's mind that this is a good idea. 
To promote sport is an excellent means of preventing crime by our young people. 
The program needs to teach good citizenship and good health. 
Those are the things that are disheartening, the very basic type of ideas. 
What do we expect of our athletes and sport people when they are in schools? 
They had a mutual respect for one another.  
We do not address those things in our sporting areas. 
Money is not the answer to sports. 
Availability is, making it possible for all to participate. 
That acceleration will happen in spite of what goes on. 
I encourage the committee to continue to look at this report. 
Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to what the member had to say. 
I use the Canada Games as simply one example. 
The federal government commits $60 million to sports. 
A part of the budget goes toward supporting the Canada Games. 
Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of young people have tried out for the Canada Games.  
Tens of thousands tried out for the Ontario Summer Games. 
Mr. Speaker, I understand what the member is stating.  
Two years later we had the Alberta provincial winter games. 
There were great celebrations. 
I am certainly proud of the Canadian amateur games. 
If we are to talk about amateur sport, let us not narrow the scope. 
Let us keep it broad and available to Canadian children everywhere.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
I also congratulate the member for Longueuil for her fine intervention today.  
This is a very important motion. 
We have seen much excellence and heroism among our Olympic athletes. 
I would argue there are things we can do. 
We can make sure that money gets directly to the athletes. 
The money should not be invested in a bloated bureaucracy.  
We have to make choices. 
We have talked about tax incentives for investment from the private sector. 
Those are the things that can be done.  
Sports are good for our health. 
This will give us a health dividend. 
We not only must convince the youth, but we must convince their parents. 
I also want to address the aspect of professional sports. 
We cannot and we should not.  
I am glad the problem was brought up by the professional sporting groups. 
They are also having a problem because the Canadian dollar is so low.  
It does not address that. 
In the words of Lord Alfred Tennyson, in his poem Ulysses , he said: 
To strive, to seek, to find and not to yield.  
This is the motto of many Canadian athletes. 
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
There are a couple of points I want to make. 
Does he support the current tax situation for professional hockey teams? 
Does he agree with that?  
Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the whip of the NDP. 
However, what we do support are across the board tax breaks for everybody. 
That is the issue here. 
It is only hurting the ability of these teams to stay in the country.  
I thank my colleague for pursuing this initiative because it will be productive. 
Maybe some day the government will listen to us.  
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is not quite a question, but a comment.  
He was actually chastising them for distancing themselves from the Kanata Senators. 
Let us make sure we have the facts straight on the issue.  
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
This is the way things work.  
He is the youngest gold medal winner at the Commonwealth Games.  
In my view, he has managed to pull away from the prattle offered to him. 
Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for others.  
Let us get back to the subject. 
They have often proved it.  
However, talent cannot bloom and flourish in a vacuum. 
They need our support.  
Canada is also making its mark on the international sport level. 
This is not a recurring expenditure.  
The result of these measures is the following.  
Some of these recommendations can already be implemented. 
These requirements will be included in the accountability agreements with the centres.  
It mentions all the policy obligations and more. 
I thought is was important to mention this.  
We will try to establish governmental partnerships in this regard.  
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
I would like him to tell us about it.  
What does the government intend to do in that regard? 
I would like to hear what the parliamentary secretary has to say about that. 
How can he explain that?  
How can the parliamentary secretary justify this? 
Is this conceivable for the parliamentary secretary?  
The whole envelope of Sports Canada is used for amateur sport. 
I hope that the member will acknowledge that. 
People may not all have the same opinion, but everyone has one. 
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
He spoke about amateur sport throughout most of his dissertation.  
It is all words and no action.  
It has taken a very bad action.  
The member for Ottawa-Vanier referred to the Kanata Senators. 
All of a sudden they are the Kanata Senators when it is a tax issue. 
We have a very serious municipal tax problem.  
How much is that costing taxpayers?  
I like the Ottawa Senators. 
I am saddened to hear him say that he voted against that. 
On that basis alone, his question and his reaction to that are rather inconsistent.  
I am not from western Canada but the member is. 
Yes, we do concrete things. 
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part in this debate. 
In my view, first and foremost for health reasons.  
Is the present federal Liberal government really looking after our athletes? 
Quebecers are particularly good at this sport. 
The performances were outstanding.  
I talked to the athletes and coaches. 
They told me how the competition had been funded. 
Guess how much money the federal government put into those Canadian championships. 
What would that mean? 
The proposal was turned down. 
It would have cost $2.2 million.  
I do not have much time left- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  
This is obviously a point of debate. 
With a third of the associations threatened, he has every reason to react.  
It reads as follows: 
PUBLIC SERVICE PENSION PLAN 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
This fund belongs to the members of the plan. 
Some 670,000 members of the pension plan are affected. 
The allocation of any surplus should address the contributions of those over half million Canadians.  
One legitimate reason exists. 
That cheap political trick was nonsense.  
We realize over 670,000 members of the plan are affected. 
The people who contributed to the plan are also taxpayers. 
We must look at their benefits and their rights. 
This is a democratic principle. 
Who are we affecting with the legislation? 
We are affecting the Canadian military, the people who are fighting over in Kosovo. 
While they are protecting society, who is protecting their pension fund? 
It is certainly not the government.  
That is quite a little play on words. 
Canadian taxpayers have taken all the risks. 
Canadians have funded all the deficits. 
Clearly and simply they deserve to enjoy the surplus that now exists.  
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
We are talking about medical devices licensed for single use only. 
What has the federal government's response been? 
Does that not just blow us away? 
We are at a loss for words in terms of that response.  
Other countries have taken action. 
France and Sweden forbid the use of disposable medical devices. 
In the rest of Europe equipment must be certified. 
Why not in Canada? 
Why has the government forsaken health protection? 
Why does it not act on a study that is five years old? 
Doctors want national policies. 
Why does the government not act and act now? 
All of this points to confusion regarding the dangers of this practice.  
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.41 p.m.)
