Thursday, May 27, 1999 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I will be brief. 
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
What the Speaker has heard this morning is politics and just politics. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
One is a direct corollary of the other. 
This is not rocket science. 
We will find that out on June 9 when we get to that stage. 
There are a number of differences. 
The standing order is quite clear. 
However, this is a different proposition altogether.  
Colleagues, I find this to be a serious point. 
With your indulgence, I would like to inform myself more. 
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
AUTOMOTIVE POLLUTION REDUCTION ACT 
This would take effect on July 1, 2003.  
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
It is out of order for the hon. member to read petitions to the House. 
In compliance with the rules, he may give a brief summary of the petition. 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
The Inuit find housing arrangements in Nunavik to be extremely disturbing. 
The situation is deemed to be absolutely intolerable. 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):
I agree with the petitioners.  
I know he will want to comply with the rules in that regard.  
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):
QUESTIONS PASSED AS ORDERS FOR RETURNS 
Question No. 159- Mrs. Michelle Dockrill: 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
CANADIAN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ACT, 1999 
The details concerning these changes are available at the table.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
The committee review presented an interesting dynamic. 
I am aware that we are on Group No. 1 amendments. 
Group No. 1 removes the phase-out of the worst of toxic substances. 
It removes the achievement of virtual elimination. 
The NDP supports the principles of pollution prevention and polluter pays. 
We think that it can be a difficult task. 
We are not against industry. 
We are against polluters who place our environment and our human health at risk.  
Again, it is not their fault. 
The fault lies with the manufacturers of these chemicals that poison our shared environment. 
The bells will ring to summon members back to the Chamber.  
(The sitting of the House was suspended at 10.33 a.m.) 
The House resumed at 10.51 a.m. 
We have to ask about the guiding principle.  
They will still be emitted into the environment. 
We were able to do that. 
They said that they would go out of business if we did that. 
They screamed foul and they started a fear campaign. 
Is the House ready for the question?  
The first question is on Motion No. 1. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The vote on the motion is deferred.  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The vote on the motion is deferred.  
The next question is on Motion No. 26. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The recorded division on the motion stands deferred. 
The recorded division will also apply to Motion No. 83.  
The next question is on Motion No. 61. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The recorded division on the motion stands deferred.  
The next question is on Motion No. 62. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The recorded division on the motion stands deferred. 
The recorded division will also apply to Motions Nos. 63 and 68.  
The next question is on Motion No. 71. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The recorded division on the motion stands deferred.  
The next question is on Motion No. 84. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it. 
I declare the motion defeated.  
(Motion No. 84 negatived) 
The next question is on Motion No. 85. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The recorded division on the motion stands deferred.  
The next question is on Motion No. 87. 
Is it the pleasure the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The vote on the motion is deferred.  
The next question is on Motion No. 89. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Is it agreed that the motion is defeated?  
(Motion No. 89 negatived) 
I therefore declare all four of those motions defeated.  
The next question is on Motion No. 90. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion, the nays have it.

And more than five members having risen: 
The recorded division on Motion No. 115 stands deferred.  
The next question is on Motion No. 117. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
I declare Motion No. 117 defeated.  
(Motion No. 117 negatived) 
The next question is on Motion No. 122. 
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
All those in favour will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The recorded division on Motion No. 122 stands deferred.  
All those in favour of the motion will please say yea.  
All those opposed will please say nay.  
In my opinion the nays have it.  
And more than five members having risen: 
The recorded division on the motion is deferred.  
The next question is on Motion No. 130.

That concludes the divisions on Group No. 1. 
I will now propose the motions in Group No. 2 to the House.

( b ) by adding after line 27 on page 209 the following: 
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Most of the Group No. 2 amendments focus on federal-provincial issues. 
We know that political borders offer no protection against pollution. 
Bill C-32 recognizes that co-operation is essential. 
All governments have a role to play. 
This is legislation that will benefit all Canadians.  
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
These amendments have all been proposed by the Bloc and the government. 
The provinces should not have a veto.  
The commissioner found that there was limited reference to environmental protection in the objectives. 
There were no stated requirements to assess the impact of agreements. 
Affected industries still face regulatory inconsistencies. 
We cannot in good faith support such an amendment.  
Many of the Bloc amendments are similar in nature.  
Obviously governments must work together in the interests of the environment. 
Such decisions should not be political. 
Clearly these decisions should be science based. 
Science should be the determining factor.  
There are 11 reasonable government motions which we will be supporting. 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
This is a very important group. 
The government has much to say about co-operation with the provinces. 
It says all manner of things in various forums. 
That disappointment carries over to third reading.  
In my opinion, this government is living in a bubble. 
This government is in a bubble that protects it from reality. 
What the parliamentary secretary has just said on behalf of her government is not accurate. 
That is not what we are hearing.  
In fact, the first level of government required to act is the municipality.  
I do not understand why we have to have national standards. 
What does it mean to have national standards? 
It means having a global vision of an entity. 
It is the opposite. 
It is a right to partnership between the federal government and the provinces.  
The government claims to be in partnership with this or that. 
I have never seen the government try to operate this way.  
This is the fact of the matter. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Could he clarify that point for the House?  
Mr. Speaker, that is precisely the point.  
The House has heard the proposal of the chief government whip. 
Is the proposal also agreed to?  
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
As we all know, we have much to answer to our children.  
They have all of these whys about the environment. 
Native people speak about the idea of making decisions for seven generations. 
They cannot just stop with a sense of shame, sorrow and powerlessness. 
We cannot just close that out. 
Pollution does not discriminate. 
After having read that, I had to ask myself what the spokesperson was saying. 
I could not believe that she actually said that. 
Julia Langer speaks well on that issue. 
She said that the trend toward the widespread findings are extremely disturbing. 
Let us think about the poisons going into our environment. 
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
These motions would mean a step backward and ought to be defeated.  
We are therefore very concerned about what is being proposed. 
This is a very bad move in terms of protecting public health.  
Then there is the issue of the precautionary principle. 
There are many definitions of the precautionary approach. 
We worked very hard in improving that.  
The proposed version now of the precautionary principle is not the only one available. 
This amendment comes like a bolt from the blue so to speak. 
It is brand new. 
It was not mentioned or proposed in committee. 
This motion as well weakens the bill.  
I think the motivation is very clear. 
It is one that puts the public health ahead of investments. 
It is one that motivates for the reduction of health costs in the long term.  
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
The process we have gone through to date has been a very lengthy one. 
Many members have commented on that. 
A total of 560 amendments have come forward on this bill. 
There are two main issues being dealt with in these amendments. 
It is not surprising since she is a member of a separatist party.  
In many ways the Reform Party can find its roots in this issue. 
It is things like this that have earned Ottawa the enmity of the provinces.  
The Bloc is a fruit of that situation. 
We believe that the federal government has a role to play in these issues. 
However recent developments have gone a long way in clarifying this constitutional vagueness.  
This is simply not true.  
These members have supported the budgets in which these cutbacks were implemented.  
However it is always better to use the carrot over the stick. 
Co-operation will always accomplish more than confrontation.  
I will briefly discuss the Group No. 2 amendments brought forward by the minister. 
The bill creates advisory committees made up of representatives from these affected groups.  
We as a party put forward one amendment. 
Public consultation is critical to the legitimacy of the bill. 
Our party is founded on the principle of grassroots participation. 
The bill hinges on the proper balance.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Essentially that is the origin of it.  
I understand where my colleague from the Bloc Quebecois is actually coming from. 
The concern the Bloc has put forward is indeed justified. 
I would like to cite two examples of the origin of this concern. 
The provinces stepped forward and gave a unified position on November 12, 1997. 
This slapped the provinces square in the face. 
I think it is a very prudent situation. 
The offer to consult was left open for 60 days. 
The door is wide open for 60 days. 
Once talks begin that would naturally be continued. 
The Bloc tabled these amendments and we are discussing them in the House. 
The provinces have a valuable role in implementing our laws. 
They deserve to have their rightful place at the table and to give input.  
We will be participating further in the debate as we deal with the other amendments.  
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
The other day, I mentioned about 12 of these groups. 
The major industry associations in Canada wrote long letters to the Canadian government. 
The fearmongering has been intense. 
We don't see this as having won. 
We see this as having lost a lot of ground and regained an inch.  
There is an article in the newspaper, not by Mrs. Lean, which says: 
Industry is not pleased with this. 
Unfortunately, I do not have time to cite them.  
There was one prosecution. 
What we need to do is beef up our legislation, not weaken it. 
What we need to do is beef up our regulations, not weaken them. 
Now it has been further compromised and further diluted. 
The Bloc and others want to dilute it further.  
We need to strengthen the pollution prevention plan. 
We shake in our boots and we weaken our laws. 
The fox is in charge of the chicken coop.  
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
They are relentlessly interfering in areas of provincial jurisdiction. 
The committee passed 160 of them. 
I have no idea where the Liberals get their concept of environment. 
Is it a virtual environment? 
The government wants harmonization with the provinces. 
Under the initial version of Bill C-32, the government was going to act. 
The word act implies action and taking decisions. 
The Canadian government made an effort to reach agreement with the ten provinces.  
Again I have to express my concern in that regard. 
They have trouble reading and understanding.  
Let us take a closer look at what this committee will do. 
A tradition exists, but, once again, it has been broken by this government. 
But this government has a way of setting up new levels. 
It has a hard time understanding. 
Pollution prevention becomes a national objective. 
The new legislation also creates a national centre. 
They know it will only be pseudo partnership. 
This is an arrogant government. 
It ignores the reality. 
We will do everything to defend this jurisdiction, Quebec and the environment.  
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):
Pollution prevention is a stated policy of the government. 
This is not true. 
There is no right or wrong definition of the precautionary principle. 
In fact there is no definition at all. 
Instead there are many articulations of the principle. 
It was enunciated as early as 1976 by the federal Government of Germany.  
Section 2(b)(ii) states: 
These people do not speak for business in Canada. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
We will be like dinosaurs.  
I would highlight the province of Ontario, in which the national capital is located. 
We will have to address it at some point in time. 
However industry and business representatives wanted one-stop shopping. 
Unfortunately that is not the way federalism has worked in the history of the country. 
Nobody is implementing these issues. 
Nobody is looking at what overlaps need to be addressed.  
They were never established. 
This has to be addressed immediately.  
Part of the fiscal measures have come about under CEPA. 
That is totally contrary to the essence of the title of the bill. 
This is the time for us to prevent pollution, not to control and manage pollution. 
This is the time to prevent pollution.  
The lack of enforcement is the other issue. 
This will come into play in future budgets. 
Bill C-32 is the new bill. 
Under this new bill there are additional responsibilities for enforcement officers. 
There are additional responsibilities for enforcement. 
In saying program review, it should have been financial review. 
We must look in our own backyard. 
Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne-Blainville, BQ):
I will start by speaking of the intrusion into the constitutional powers of the provinces.  
Ottawa has the power to decide, the provinces the power to implement. 
Let the hon. members listen to the following. 
This is taken from the preamble: 
Here we go again with the same old Trojan Horse of national standards.  
Members are still not convinced? 
We want to get rid of this too convenient term, endeavour.  
To illustrate my point, I will now read clause 185: 
( a ) after notifying the Minister and paying the prescribed fee; 
Who will pay the prescribed fee? 
The Canadian company that imports the waste to process it.  
The industry that processes the waste is an important factor. 
It plays a critical role in the protection of the environment.  
Obviously, the survival of the industry depends on the volume of waste it processes. 
But this is certainly not the case in Quebec where we have such legislation.  
The amendment reads as follows: 
The Governor in Council shall, by order, exempt from the application of subsection (1)- 
That is exempt from the fees.  
Mr. Stephan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):
I think it is always important to keep this in mind.  
There are very specific examples in my riding, including the zone known as ZIP. 
I find it interesting. 
I will now try to summarize Bill C-32. 
With this bill, pollution prevention will become a national objective. 
This bill replaces the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. 
The list of these substances is very extensive. 
And therein lies the problem.  
Environment is said to be a federal-provincial matter. 
Once again, there is the temptation to centralize power in this country. 
These are challenges here to which we must respond.  
This is a somewhat relative term. 
I believe everyone has his own definition of how much effort this entails.  
Will mere consultations be considered an appropriate effort? 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
It is important to make things clear. 
It would have allowed any province that wanted to assume full responsibility to do so. 
But this is not what is happening.  
This will create duplication again. 
This has major economic repercussions.  
This involves additional costs. 
Let us look at fish management policies for a moment. 
It was under federal government jurisdiction, but through standard application, through the- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I think the member has a prop. 
This is contrary to the standing orders of the House of Commons. 
He has something under his papers.  
I am sorry, I saw nothing, except the hon. member's notes. 
Mr. Speaker, it is my day planner.  
This has certainly caused a disruption in major fishing communities in Canada.  
I find it quite unbelievable that we have to defend this point of view. 
This is how things would be done throughout the country.  
At some point, we need to get interesting results at the international level.  
The government is violating the very constitution it claims to protect.  
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
The problems in the act are of several types. 
You can count on me to demonstrate it.  
We shall get back to that a bit later.  
The bill will give the government the authority to establish national fuels marks. 
What became of the provinces in this bill?  
This is a disaster.  
Let us talk about this reduction: 3% up until 2010. 
That is how concerned this government is about the environment. 
Is the House ready for the question?  
The House will now proceed to the debate on the motions in Group No. 3.  
This group contains Motions Nos. 6, 7, 137 to 139, and 148 to 150.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:
Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. 
I need some clarification. 
Are we not voting on the motions in Group No. 2 at this time?  
``versity through pollution prevention and the control and management of toxic substances;'' 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.) moved: 
That Bill C-32, in Clause 106, be amended 
( a ) by replacing lines 40 to 42 on page 78 with the following: 
( b ) by replacing lines 3 and 4 on page 79 with the following: 
``( a ) if the Governor in Council determines that the'' 
( c ) by replacing lines 8 and 9 on page 79 with the following: 
``made under that Act, the Governor in Council'' 
( d ) by replacing lines 13 and 14 on page 79 with the following: 
``( b ) if the Governor in Council determines that the'' 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.) moved: 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC) moved: 
That Bill C-32, in Clause 106, be amended 
( b ) by replacing lines 8 and 9 on page 79 with the following: 
``made under that Act, the Ministers and that other minister'' 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.) moved: 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC) moved: 
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, Group No. 3 amendments deal primarily with biotechnology. 
A couple of other motions focus on avoiding duplication when it comes to biotechnology. 
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
This is an amendment that was not discussed in committee. 
Risk assessment is part of the government policy. 
It is elaborated on in the toxic substances management policy. 
After all we have a well organized system under the roof of this parliament. 
That is what we did.  
This in a way bypasses the system. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak to this group of amendments. 
The motion deals with a preamble that states in part: 
I would like to inform the House of another preamble. 
These go hand in hand. 
I beg that members of all parties would listen to this. 
Let us stop doing that. 
This group of amendments is not a surprise. 
The products of biotechnology are highlighted in this group of amendments. 
Recently we have seen the evidence of cloning and genetic engineering. 
That is the essence of the human health and environmental concerns. 
Yes, my colleague, it seems like an appropriate time. 
Now we will proceed to Statements by Members.  
Mr. Janko Peric (Cambridge, Lib.):
God bless you, Fred.  
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE 
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
Special projects have been terminated. 
Last year all overtime was suspended. 
Informants are being paid with cigarettes and IOUs. 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi-Baie-James-Nunavik, Lib.):
This protection would take the form of a guaranteed minimum income.  
This is the true formula for abolishing poverty in Canada.  
CANADA'S WALK OF FAME 
Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):
Four more stars will be awarded this year by public nomination. 
CITIZEN OF THE YEAR AWARD 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Stoney Creek, Lib.):
My best wishes to the recipients.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage-Lisgar, Ref.):
That could put the survival of many farms in serious jeopardy.  
Estimates are that 3,000 farmers are affected. 
In fact, nine municipalities have been declared disaster areas.  
MANUFACTURING AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CENTRE 
Mrs. Judi Longfield (Whitby-Ajax, Lib.):
The importance of MITC for Canada as well as my- 
The hon. member for Argenteuil-Papineau.  
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau-Mirabel, BQ):
This support was evidence of their open-mindedness and compassion.  
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
In addition, the contract obtained by this Canadian company is worth celebrating. 
Here is an example of the Quebec economic model. 
The member for Surrey North.  
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
The question is why in 1999 do we need to be taking this action? 
Where has the government been over the last six years? 
Tonight in Abbotsford thousands of people will be ready to say yes.  
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
We watched the successful take off with bated breath.  
Today, a new star appeared in the firmament. 
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
The social union agreement is supposed to allow for national standards. 
The time has come for action. 
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
Space has fed the imaginations of many adolescents. 
Like many others, I dreamed of seeing a launch.  
This morning, I relived the strong emotions of- 
The hon. member for Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam.  
Mr. Lou Sekora (Port Moody-Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam, Lib.):
Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease affecting the respiratory and digestive systems. 
The most devastating damage takes place in the lungs. 
Everyone with cystic fibrosis dies of lung disease. 
There is no known cure. 
Approximately one in every twenty-five hundred children born in Canada have this deadly disease.  
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Alas, it was not to be. 
The Reformers are ready. 
We just hope the giants of journalism will answer the call.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, Slobodan Milosevic was indicted today for war crimes. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
To have a UN resolution does not depend on the assent of Mr. Milosevic. 
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
We know that the U.S. and Britain are talking about a ground war. 
The Russians are very concerned about the continued use of air strikes.  
Now Milosevic has been indicted for war crimes. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
The Reform Party cannot have it both ways. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are reviewing the situation. 
We will have more to say about it very shortly.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this is not a very reassuring reaction from the government. 
What further actions is the government planning to take to bring these two sides together? 
Do we have any influence left in these Commonwealth countries?  
Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific), Lib.):
We asked them to tone down the tension in the region. 
We hope both countries will find a political solution to the problem in Kashmir. 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
It concerns trade and nothing else.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
It is important for Canada and for all other countries in the world.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Under this agreement, that access is now limited to 18%.  
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  
Which is the case? 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is no disagreement. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
I want to ask a question of the Deputy Prime Minister. 
The hon. Deputy Prime Minister.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
By having this agreement we have a real victory. 
We are protecting Canadian culture. 
We have also strengthened whatever there was in the NAFTA agreement as well. 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we did not succumb to U.S. threats. 
That is what we have obtained.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Could the minister tell us where this money is coming from? 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
How many reports do we have to have? 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Why the united alternative?  
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that is totally false. 
This access has been reduced to 18% after three years. 
There will be an impact, we acknowledge this. 
A report will be submitted to cabinet once the discussions have been concluded. 
The members opposite will know the- 
The hon. member for Peace River.  
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
In fact, it is a very good resolution.  
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
This was a difference between our two countries which has now been settled. 
It has no other ramifications that should interest the WTO. 
The hon. member for Repentigny.  
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, that is very reassuring for Canadian publishers.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
DONATIONS TO POLITICAL PARTIES 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport. 
The members of those three commissions were all, naturally, ministerial appointees.  
Does the minister think that was a proper use of public funds?  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
I invite others to do the same. 
No answer has come to that effect yet.  
I am presently examining the situation and it is under review.  
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Does this ruling of the House leader apply to them? 
Does it apply to the commissions and the port authorities? 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, let me answer both parts of the question.  
I already indicated that the issue is under review. 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Ms. Colleen Beaumier (Brampton West-Mississauga, Lib.):
Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific), Lib.):
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
My question is for the solicitor general. 
Why was Clifford Howdle granted day parole?  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I take this grave matter very seriously. 
The investigation will be co-chaired by three former policemen from Lethbridge, Alberta.  
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Musquodoboit Valley-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Why does this country not have an industrial strategy for a comprehensive program of shipbuilding?  
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
We have met with shipbuilders from coast to coast.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
I respect the farmers in Saskatchewan and all across Canada. 
I worked with them to put the program in place. 
I continue to encourage them to fill out the forms and get them in. 
We will deal with them as quickly as we possibly can.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
These men do not want to leave Canada. 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Richard M. Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
Will it do it today?  
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
It is our hope that all parties across the way will do the same.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudiere, BQ):
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, may I repeat what I said before for the member. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the minister of the homeless.  
Aboriginal people make up a large component of the homeless population in major cities. 
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
We will continue to honour the transfer of social housing to the provinces. 
That will eliminate duplication and will create the opportunity to have more housing.  
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
The hon. member for Sarnia-Lambton.  
Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I will certainly take his question as representation. 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
We follow the law and we follow the ruling of the tribunal.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
My question is for the solicitor general. 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance. 
Guess who was Minister of Finance during those years?  
I know he is very close to Conrad Black but what about- 
I ask the hon. member to be very judicious in his choice of words, please. 
The hon. Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
These were required in order to get government finances in order. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
As everybody knows, the global capacity is at a very high level. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
He was very specific.  
This is debate and not a point of order.  
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his excellent question.  
This is our intention, in the hope of disposing of this very important government initiative.  
Thursday, June 3, shall be an allotted day.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
The bill is still before the other place. 
I do not foresee that it will be back here before another week. 
CANADIAN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ACT, 1999 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Farming is a major industry in terms of agri-food. 
Family farms and organic farmers are very dependent on economic survival. 
The long term effect takes time. 
The letter highlighted the inability of the government to protect us. 
The Ethyl Corporation filed a lawsuit. 
It is actually infringing on our sovereign right to protect our environment and our health.  
The grouping we are now talking about concerns provincial and federal responsibilities. 
At Kyoto it brought forward the eco-European bubble concept.  
Canada has to look at itself as a bubble. 
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
We are speaking to Group No. 3 amendments. 
I can use lead as an example. 
Lead is on the toxic substances list. 
It is the management of these substances that this legislation should deal with.  
This is consistent with the other sections within the bill.  
Our amendments address concerns that were brought to us by many parties. 
We listened and we acted on these concerns and introduced our amendments. 
Therefore, we will not be supporting the amendments of the Progressive Conservative Party.  
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
They should have been thoroughly studied by the committee.  
We cannot analyze an environment act every year. 
This law will be in effect in Canada for the next 10 years. 
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
Some of the amendments in this grouping could effectively change the bill and its effectiveness. 
I will just go through some of these.  
The preamble contains 14 separate commitments and goals of the government. 
Third, a recognition of the importance of an ecosystem approach.  
That is what the bill should do.  
There is a list of some 23,000 substances used by Canadian industry and manufacturing. 
It would be irresponsible for parliament to impose an additional burden such as this. 
That is what our amendment would do. 
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
In the same group of motions the government would split this preamble in two. 
However, the question is asked:
Why does it happen under the prompting of industry that this should be introduced?  
However, it sets a sense of direction as to what we are trying to do.  
None of the elements which are crucial to the legislation have been reinforced. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
In fact, even Reform voted against this particular proposal.  
The amendments that we have tabled within this section address the applicable situations. 
Now they seem to have changed their minds. 
They propose restoring the section to its original state.  
That is why they supported that initiative. 
They should be the quarterbacks. 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres-Les-Patriotes, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, here we are again. 
This is the third and even the fourth time I speak on this bill.  
This is totally unacceptable.  
The bill even goes further. 
As I said earlier, this is a totally unacceptable paternalism. 
Once again, ``Ottawa knows best''. 
We can in no way approve such an attitude.  
The job has already been done.  
It is the next $1,000 that are hard. 
This is a harder objective to attain.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
It is the executive arm of government. It is in effect cabinet. 
The entire cabinet will be responsible. 
They do not necessarily understand everything but they are certainly listening. 
They require some answers and they deserve some answers. 
Throughout the world we are witnessing an exponential growth in the technology field. 
Their concerns are shared by many across the country. 
Cost recovery for whom? 
All of us as children spent some time on a teeter-totter. 
Some of us in political life still spend time on teeter-totters. 
The process must be an open one. 
Canadian farmers are becoming concerned about the issue. 
We simply do not have the capability. 
It has to be based on science not on science fiction. 
I said I was going to talk very quickly about Europe. 
Genetically modified food is a hot political topic in Britain. 
I want to read a little of that editorial into my comments. 
There is a climate of growing public distrust in Europe. 
The companies that have created genetically modified seeds are generally against mandatory labelling.  
It could be viewed not as information but as a warning.  
As I have noted, and the editorial notes: 
To conclude the editorial, it further states: 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
The renewal of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act did not start yesterday. 
On December 15, 1995, the Liberal government proposed revising the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. 
Our vision is shared by many experts studying how federations work. 
Bill C-32 is not part of a decentralizing approach. 
With this bill, pollution prevention becomes a national goal. 
This is the second whereas in the preamble. 
The list of these substances is extensive. 
This bill gives investigators new powers. 
But it does not give them new resources for doing their work. 
That is what is ironic. 
It is a no go. 
We cannot protect the environment without resources. 
Now is the time to realize this. 
Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):
I can give you striking examples from my riding. 
They are fine beaches and have a fine shoreline. 
It destroyed roads, infrastructures and houses.  
There is another fact I remember very clearly. 
There were serious consequences.  
We ask the Minister of Transport and the Minister of the Environment to take action. 
Here is another example. 
The minister never did anything. 
The federal government boasts about recognizing Quebec's distinct nature. 
It should let us speak for ourselves when our interests are at stake.  
This amendment eliminates the federal loophole.  
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
The government did not do everything it should have. 
Once again, this will be because the government has not taken its responsibilities.  
This will come back to haunt us in the years to come. 
There is still no evidence to that effect. 
We therefore asked the government to do a study. 
It has not been done. 
Once again, our recommendations have been ignored. 
But this has still not been done. 
All this is costing a lot of money. 
And to what end? 
This is not how the environment works. 
We already have environmental legislation.  
Another example is that of environmental assessments. 
This bill was passed in the House during our last term of office. 
It is still very contentious. 
There is a case before the courts involving Quebec and the federal government. 
Now, the federal government is duplicating and overlapping what is already being done in Quebec. 
Environmental lawyers will have an opportunity to make a lot of money.  
Common sense must prevail in all this. 
I am sorry, but this is not the way things work. 
Quite the contrary, this will delay all the work that should be done now. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House will now move on to the motions in Group No. 4. 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.) moved: 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP) moved: 
``aboriginal people'' includes the Indian, Inuit and Metis peoples of Canada.''  
``respecting the cost-effective use of the powers provided for'' 
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
The government would like to see those remain deleted. 
Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquiere, BQ):
I am very happy. 
Bill C-32 is very important. 
We decided to take it out. 
Now I see that Motions Nos. 8 and 10 propose that the word be reintroduced.  
They have ensured that some progress can finally be made in terms of the environment.  
Why take a step backward when we can move forward? 
We made some commitments in Kyoto. 
With the bill before the House, we will fall behind in our commitments. 
And what happens when people quarrel? 
They are unable to move forward. 
Today, we witnessed a historic event: a woman from Quebec went up into space. 
This bill, however, won't make history. 
I believe we could have done better.  
The Bloc Quebecois wanted to move things ahead. 
However, this government is not doing what it should. 
This is not what people want. 
We always hear the same old story.  
This government is like a dog chasing its tail. 
It is as if they had hit the wall. 
They seem to be living in a virtual world. 
Everything that deals with the environment seems to be nebulous. 
We cannot look back. 
We must look to the future. 
We can build on past experience, but we cannot go back in time.  
It has no hope now and will have none in the future. 
As the hon. member for Davenport said, it is important.  
For us in the Bloc Quebecois, it is very important. 
I realize we missed the boat. 
When we miss the boat, it is very hard to move forward.  
Some, not many, are forward-looking.  
Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, on the subject of the precautionary principle there are many definitions. 
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York North, Lib.):
However, lack of full scientific certainty must not immobilize us. 
It must not impair our ability to act. 
The member for Davenport has pointed out why we need a strong precautionary principle. 
This has been a longstanding public policy issue.  
This is only one chemical story among thousands of others.  
Even the purest food, breast milk, contains residues of harmful substances.  
This should be a wake-up call to the world''.  
Children interact with the environment in very different ways from adults. 
We know these problems exist. 
They have been documented for decades. 
I urge members of the House to defeat this amendment.  
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
True to itself, it is once again taking the way of duplication.  
We worked very hard in committee. 
Therefore we have to work hard. 
It was also decided to create an advisory committee to manage environmental issues. 
I am a bit scared when I hear that a committee will be struck. 
The federal government is acting this way because of the upcoming WTO negotiations.  
Have we not talked enough about Bill C-32? 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
This NDP amendment is worthy of the support of the House.  
That is not quite true. 
There is another amendment which the Conservative Party will be supporting. 
We support that amendment as well.  
Again I applaud the efforts of my colleague from Churchill.  
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
We had cost effective measures that were highlighted in terms of the precautionary principle. 
We had powers that were diminished by the minister. 
We had pollution prevention. 
All of these balances were reflected.  
That is a major detriment to what we have to do. 
It is reprehensible that it would be considered at this point. 
The Liberal cabinet is very adamant about this. 
That is basically what is happening here. 
Now the Liberal cabinet is not satisfied with that process. 
I have some examples that I would like to share with members. 
It made headlines a year ago. 
It was on a railway bed. 
This toxic ooze was included on the priority substances list. 
What was cost effective? 
For $60 there was a fence. 
What is cost effective? 
It was a major embarrassment. 
Basically we have to get past this pulp fiction issue. 
We have to have substance. 
It was included in part 3 of CEPA. 
It is a clause which deals with information gathering. 
This definition did not have the support and the collaboration of the ministers. 
The parliamentary secretary played a role. 
A lot of people remember that historic moment. 
I believe that everybody deserves a pat on the back for making this happen. 
It was a win situation for all of us.  
Included in this group is the definition of aboriginal people. 
We overlooked this situation. 
Member spoke in Cree ] 
Aboriginal people should be defined as the Indian, Metis and Innu peoples of Canada. 
That should put us well on track for a good definition.  
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
This definition includes the notion of cost effectiveness. 
This is what the government had decided to do.  
At the same time, there is another way of looking at this amendment. 
I think it was a pity to reintroduce this notion of cost effectiveness. 
It was in the bill. 
There was no earthly reason that it should have been changed again. 
There is no notion there of cost effectiveness. 
This is a law of our own government. 
Why go back in time? 
Why sacrifice a gain, something which is positive, that was gained within our committee?  
Everything that goes badly is the federal government's fault. 
The same old song.  
Well, I would like to remind them of a couple of things.  
What did Quebec do? 
What did Quebec do? 
It sent warning letters. 
There was only one prosecution.  
The federal government is not always at fault. 
I have certain reservations about this bill. 
They are few in number; however, four or five are key.  
That would, by far, be my fondest wish.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
REFORM OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS 
The House resumed from April 19 consideration of the motion.  
Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
This is a timely suggestion. 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
I would like to read it back into the record. 
We did, we have and we should be thankful for that.  
It is an idea whose time has come. 
Now we are reaping the whirlwind. 
People come back with horrible eye witness accounts. 
When disaster struck in Rwanda people literally cried on television. 
The United Nations is just not geared react. 
That is why the motion is so timely. 
I guess it is a sign of the times. 
Why should it be votable, for example? 
Is it something of international significance? 
The answer in this case is an obvious yes. 
Money is not the answer in these situations. 
First, the motion meets the criteria of being of international significance. 
This initiative does not conflict with the government's agenda. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Strident voices and belligerent actions replace peaceful cohabitation. 
What will be remembered of this very sad chapter in the history of humanity? 
By its very structure, the UN is obsolete. 
It was built on the respect of the sovereignty of nations. 
On the other hand, the UN did not respond to such action. 
How can we tolerate such a blatant lack of co-operation?  
We avoid consuming outdated products. 
We update our old software. 
As previously mentioned the very nature of wars has evolved considerably. 
Today we face significant crises in both development and the environment. 
We must restructure and rework international environmental policies. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
There are tremendous challenges facing Canada in a global environment.  
Our chain of events in global events has been significant.  
I want to speak briefly about the IMF. 
Many people are critical of the IMF. 
The IMF in spite of some of its failures has had some very significant successes. 
I would argue that some of those conditions are very reasonable. 
These are reasonable demands.  
The debt issue in developing nations is extremely important. 
I believe that this type of meeting, this type of initiative is very important.  
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Certainly it has triggered quite a bit of debate and interest. 
We would have had a more meaningful debate.  
Canada on that front has done a tremendous amount of work. 
There is no international standard. 
Then corruption could be reduced and eventually eliminated.  
There are many countries around the world that do not issue financial statements. 
That is a major scandal internationally. 
Others are working on 1991 financial statements. 
Those very same countries have gone through very difficult and troubling economic times.  
I would bring in the International Monetary Fund as a part of that economic organization. 
CANADIAN ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION ACT, 1999 
BILL C-32-NOTICE OF TIME ALLOCATION MOTION 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
REFORM OF INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS 
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
I find it abhorrent that this government continues this practice.  
I cannot understand how government members can see any reason for not supporting the motion. 
I do not understand it.  
There are many reasons it is not working. 
We have the situation now where NATO is in the former Yugoslavia. 
However, the United Nations was not prepared to move. 
Even if it had moved, it is after the fact. 
Conflict has broken out. 
That is a powerful tool.  
A meeting of like minds is all the motion is suggesting. 
He showed them that it can work.  
I hope the Liberals will see fit to support the motion.  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
(The House adjourned at 6.30 p.m.)
