AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF CANADA (QUEBEC) 
EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 31 
Monday, November 17, 1997 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
A year or two ago home ownership picked up. 
Out of that 350,000 changes in home ownership 50,000 were new homes. 
That is another benefit in this bill. 
All these things are tax deductible.  
It looked at the issue of how much more money was put into the economy. 
I found an article written by Hugh Segal. 
I do not always like what he says. 
A lot of people have heard him. 
We must give credit where credit is due. 
I thought he made some good comments. 
This is what he said: 
Why should the tax system encourage one activity and discourage the other? 
Why is the family home a target? 
Why is it less important than an office, a warehouse or a piece of machinery?  
That was the way I looked at it. 
I thought that was a pretty good argument.  
That was too long anyway.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:
We can debate that argument when we are dealing with some other bill. 
Then he went on to say: 
That is the way I have looked at it. 
Why should a home be taxed? 
It is fundamental if one wants to raise a family as a unit. 
It is a lot better to raise a family under those conditions.  
They may have the intelligence to be an entrepreneur or to develop things. 
We know what that would do for job creation.  
It is interesting to see all the benefits. 
This is what the article said: 
That is from another sector of the economy. 
It is a job creation effort.  
Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner:
It is job creation, very true. 
In addition, it said: 
This was an added incentive. 
That is quite impressive.  
The bill also refers to co-op housing. 
What are we working for? 
If there are some amendments that improve the bill, I will not object to them. 
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
If mortgage interest rates were deductible, capital gains should be made taxable.  
A taxpayer's choice of accommodation, owning versus renting, is a personal choice. 
He is quite correct. 
Those who rent units do not carry on a business.  
The tax system does not allow deductions and credits for personal expenses. 
The proposed deduction would also be inequitable to taxpayers without a mortgage. 
Let us look at the present case. 
It's too simple.  
It is not too simple. 
Are you going to pay back all the debt you have created?  
We foresee the housing industry continuing to grow. 
In essence we feel the bill is unnecessary at this time. 
A bigger reason is the equity of the bill. 
We want to ensure a balanced budget. 
We will ensure fairness and equity for all Canadians.  
It is not affordable, necessary or equitable.  
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
Interest rates are now within the reach of most people. 
What have Reformers done about these destructive Liberal policies? 
I can think of nothing.  
Let us come back to the bill itself. 
Tax deductions are taken into account in the calculation of the taxpayer's net income. 
They allow him to benefit from tax savings. 
Tax deductions are regressive, because the higher the taxable revenue, the higher the savings. 
Tax credits are neutral. 
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
It is important that we all recognize the importance of encouraging home ownership. 
The Reform Party constantly sees complex things as simple. 
Some things require more sophisticated responses than that put forward.  
The question is how to do that. 
Let us talk about what this bill does or perhaps what it does not do. 
What about the way in which the bill works? 
We need to cost these issues out. 
As the parliamentary secretary indicated, this measure would cost $3 billion a year.  
That is money provided then by those who do not benefit from this particular provision. 
When was that fair? 
When was that acceptable? 
It is clearly simplistic, but when was it acceptable?  
What would happen if mortgage rates increased? 
That is not beyond the realm of possibility. 
Then the cost would increase even further.  
That seems to me to be not only patently unfair but patently absurd as well.  
We have to ask where would that money come from and how much is involved.  
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
I am extremely grateful for the trust they have given to me. 
Unfortunately many of them do not feel that their future is all that bright.  
Besides the unemployed there are the under employed. 
Hundreds of thousands of working individuals are under employed. 
I would just like to list some of those advantages.  
First is a considerably lower tax burden on Canadian families. 
It offers them more amenities. 
Those who are able to do something about it are not doing anything about it. 
It is not the tax dollars that have to be replaced. 
That is a well known fact.  
There is a dreadful lack of substance opposite.  
Owning a home is of great importance to families. 
It gives that extra little bit of room. 
Accessibility to home ownership is particularly important to our young Canadians. 
If we are not careful, home ownership will be another example.  
It is unfortunate because I think this is a very key issue.  
I can only urge the Liberals to recognize a good idea when they see it. 
I hope in the end they will support Bill C-223.  
Mr. John Maloney (Erie-Lincoln, Lib.):
This proposal, despite its worthy aims, has flaws.  
I do not find this prospect a pleasing one.  
Finally, we come to the issue of cost. 
The provinces would also experience a substantial reduction in revenues. 
This is a very hefty price tag by any standard.  
AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF CANADA (QUEBEC) 
AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF CANADA 
Paragraphs (1) to (4) of section 93 do not apply to Quebec.'' 
First, there is the issue of the amending formula. 
But what about the purpose of the resolution itself?  
Some people disagreed with the amendment on purely religious grounds. 
There are however a number of considerations that soften the impact of this change.  
That issue will be addressed in a separate public debate. 
These considerations have certainly not convinced francophone protestants. 
As a last resort, the Government of Quebec could invoke the notwithstanding clause. 
He is perfectly right. 
The joint committee shares our opinion on this.  
This point too warrants consideration.  
A number of groups and experts confirmed that during their testimony to the committee.  
The committee shares our opinion in this regard.  
A substantial consensus seems to exist among Protestants too. 
Many other groups testified before the committee. 
The vast majority of these groups supported the constitutional amendment proposal. 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
The first question I asked was of a legal nature. 
The second question I asked was political. 
The final question I asked was a moral one. 
In this case the single province is Quebec. 
It is an amendment that affects only Quebec in any direct and meaningful way. 
For this reason I believe that section 43 is applicable in this case.  
Let us move on to another point. 
That is really the crux of the matter. 
In fact, it could run counter to this objective.  
Is that how we want to promote freedom of religion in our schools?  
I am therefore in favour of this amendment.  
I urge them to vote for the proposed amendment.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
This amendment was the subject of numerous debates. 
Why do we think this is important? 
Claude Ryan is a respected intellectual in Quebec society. 
Everyone knows that Claude Ryan is a respected and respectable individual. 
He even submitted the issue to the Supreme Court. 
We all know that Montreal is in a very particular situation. 
Close to 225,000 immigrants come to Canada each year. 
About 80% of immigrants settle in Montreal. 
This is an objective that must be clearly understood.  
What we are speaking of is the end of denominational school boards. 
In due course, the issue will be debated in the National Assembly.  
We have also received all possible representations by eminent constitutional experts. 
As you know, constitutionalists have done roaring business of late in Canada. 
That is not insignificant in a democracy. 
This is very important. 
It will allow them to consolidate their network and, of course, the teaching resources involved.  
What did Mrs. Chambers tell us? 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
This motion is particularly important because it proposes a constitutional amendment. 
I had the pleasure of sitting on the committee responsible for studying the constitutional amendment. 
The minorities in question are the Protestants. 
In Quebec, there are the Protestants and the Catholics. 
In Quebec, Protestants were the minority. 
Those groups I heard in committee were minorities of minorities.  
As legislators, we often forget that we represent the people. 
We should never be afraid to consult the people. 
The proposed changes do not prohibit Catholic or Protestant schools. 
Rather they affect how schools are managed.  
I am concerned that acquired rights are being withdrawn to please the majority. 
Our children's education is a very sensitive issue. 
Furthermore, all other denominational groups have no protection under section 93. 
In spite of this fairly obvious consensus, our Reform friends would like a referendum. 
I had another concern during committee hearings. 
We must respect all the children attending our schools.  
I pondered carefully over what was said in committee. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
It is a good system that works well.  
This has not always been the case, however. 
I was simply called a Protestant. 
In my opinion, it has been a bad decision. 
Fortunately, things have progressed. 
Canadian history is a succession of negotiations and partnerships. 
These negotiations are still going on nowadays.  
The Quebec society is like the Canadian society, but with a little something extra.  
A lot was said about protecting the rights of English speaking Quebeckers. 
However, I will say again that I have much to learn.  
Accommodation and recognition of the need for accommodation predates 1867. 
There has always been negotiation in Canada. 
Indeed, that is what Canada is all about. 
Is it not the party of referenda?  
I was quite sure this must have slipped in there by mistake. 
However, defending minority rights is not what the Reform Party is known for. 
That leads me to number four.  
Reform says that it would prefer a provincial referendum. 
Is this some sort of joke? 
I inform the House of their concerns. 
I am in complete agreement with that statement. 
The other place has what is called a suspensive veto. 
This provides for the opportunity for revisiting constitutional endeavours. 
As long as there is a Senate there are no artificial deadlines. 
Thank goodness for the Senate of Canada. 
It suggests that a court decision would have settled the legal issue.  
That is what it means to be a legislator.  
In our caucus we have good legal advice. 
We have parliamentarians who meet their responsibilities head on. 
The Reform Party should have listened to him more closely. 
Maybe just another error. 
It obviously should not be me informing the Reform Party of this.  
There was a strong case made to amend section 93. 
I suppose the Reform Party was not watching. 
I am still learning in Ottawa. 
We are all here to better understand Canada and to make Canada better.  
I hope this helps the Reform Party reflect on its dissenting opinion. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
This hon. member stooped to pretty low levels in his comments.  
It is not just his country, it is mine as well. 
It is our country. 
I understand this history pretty darn well. 
The hon. member talked about consensus. 
What about those witnesses?  
It would not know what they had to say about this. 
And this member preens on members of Parliament acting responsibly.  
I will ask this member a question. 
Forget the partisan stuff. 
I do not understand- 
I never heard you, that's why.  
Do not forget I was last on the list. 
We had three senators there. 
The member does not really understand. 
That is why I will go back to the basics.  
What I am looking for here is the best for our kids in Quebec. 
Our school system right now in my area is linguistic. 
I know it is going to work. 
It is giving the minorities a chance. 
That is why the minorities were going there.  
They do have it in our area and it works. 
That is the bottom line as far as I am concerned. 
The hon. member's stuff is in here. 
I do not know why he is complaining about it. 
He wrote it down. 
This is dissenting opinion.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
This is very close to my work throughout my entire life. 
He suggests we do not know anything about this problem we have.  
It is a bad word. 
They do not want a repeat of history. 
The three prairie provinces are satisfied with their school systems. 
Even the slightest minorities are given an opportunity. 
I want to preserve that. 
Saskatchewan in total wants to preserve it. 
They are worried about the toe getting in the door once more. 
The minority rights they have enjoyed for three generations could conceivably go out the window. 
It is not just a one province debate. 
It covers all of Canada.  
We are only speaking about section 93 and how it affects Quebec. 
The member's party wrote the dissenting opinion. 
It really does not make any sense. 
We are protecting minority rights in Quebec. 
It is the only way we can do it. 
We cannot do it with section 93 in place. 
Finally I would like to add some personal reflections on the issue.  
We are in the process of ensuring those basic procedural requirements.  
Let us go beyond the basics of the procedural elements. 
The Quebec legislative assembly passed its resolutions unanimously. 
However, I feel we must look further for evidence of consensus. 
This conclusion is based on evidence I heard during the committee hearings. 
The Catholic bishops were not opposed. 
I would like to mention here the impact of this discussion on my own riding. 
I would like to address this concern if I may.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
He is undoubtedly sincere.  
I have a couple of questions for him. 
My final question relates to the position of the Quebec Catholic bishops. 
No one is suggesting that the consensus was unanimous. 
There is no question and nobody was trying mislead any member or the House. 
There is no question of attempting to mislead anyone. 
He is partly correct. 
However, they still favour denominational schools.  
I think the political realities will ensure that.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Therefore I have a major concern. 
I did not say that. 
They were saying that they were leaving that to the state to deal with.  
I believe that is what we are dealing with in this case.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
I want to be clear: the official opposition supports the idea of linguistic school boards. 
The third test is that the amendment must be in the national interest. 
We just heard from the parliamentary secretary that this is not the case. 
There seems to be a unanimous consensus in favour in Quebec from all quarters.  
However, the proposed amendment before us today has not had that kind of rigorous discussion. 
I suggest that what he really means to say is in the past year. 
The implications of this amendment have really not been seriously debated.  
What we are discussing here is not some administrative realignment of the Quebec school system. 
As I have said, that is something that we support. 
By my count, roughly half of those witnesses opposed the proposed amendment. 
These people were not lawyers, education bureaucrats or politicians. 
I see I am out of time. 
I will continue my comments after question period.  
It being almost 2 p.m., we will now proceed to statements by members.  
Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
We must act now. 
Ms. Sophia Leung (Vancouver Kingsway, Lib.):
The spread of AIDS is alarming. 
It has been described as an epidemic. 
Thankfully the government has recognized the gravity of the problem and has taken action.

Mr. Guy Saint-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):

Why carry the ball all the way down the field only to drop it?  
Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North-St. 
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, the anniversary of the death of Louis Riel was yesterday. 
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Middlesex, Lib.):
I am proud of these men and women, as are all Canadians.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
What kind of contact with the butcher of Bagdhad would the government find acceptable?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
How can the Reform Party object to that?  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
That is what we are talking about right now. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister is not supporting trade. 
I do not see why the Reform Party would oppose that.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this is unbelievable. 
Let us talk about trucks and medical supplies. 
They can be used for military purposes and military personnel as well. 
Our government knows it; Saddam Hussein knows it.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
It totally rejects that. 
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
The hon. member for Crowfoot.  
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is no cover-up here. 
As far as I am aware, ministers have no role in that process.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):

In response, Canada Post representatives left the bargaining table.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Mr. Rejean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):
In 1995, a negotiated agreement was signed.  
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of the Environment.  
Now we finally know where the prime minister stands, peering out from behind Bill Clinton.  
The government's latest Kyoto position is not good enough. 
My question to the Minister of the Environment is simple. 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
It is this Liberal government that has failed to live up to the Rio agreement. 
Is that good enough for this energy minister?  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
It will be totally transparent, reports will be made on a regular basis. 
As the hon. member knows, certain of its deliberations will be in secret. 
The hon. member for Sherbrooke.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate the minister for his answer today. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
In fact, there is joint stewardship. 
All its operations will be available for public scrutiny.  
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, let us get this straight. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not accept the premise of the hon. member's question. 
There is no cover-up.  
These are the words- 
The hon. member for Okanagan-Coquihalla.  
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
Again, let us get this straight. 
There is another $2 million for the lawsuit. 
Now there has been another $35 million lawsuit launched by Karlheinz Schreibner.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I reject the premise of the hon. member's question. 
There is no cover-up. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Environment.  
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Its report states that the current system is fundamentally unfair to future generations.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
The hon. Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.  
Mr. Speaker, I believe this is wishful thinking on the part of the member.  
Except for the separatist party, all parties in this House have agreed to it. 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Quebeckers want to stay in Canada and they are quite right.  
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
So far we hear nothing but scaremongering, fear, denial. 
What does this party represent?  
Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, our position is not important. 
You are the government. 
It is your position.  
Mr. Speaker, if you in fact have consulted and made progress- 
Put your question please.  
Mr. Speaker, this is an outrage. 
Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
They have the same position, the same reduced Kyoto position.  
The federal government drastically reduced its social transfer payments to the provinces. 
The Hon. Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member knows full well that these figures are wrong. 
Tax points must also be taken into consideration.  
Ms. Colleen Beaumier (Brampton West-Mississauga, Lib.):
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):

The parties, I understand, are meeting today. 
What we want is a collective agreement. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I think that my hon. friend should read Brian Mulroney's explanation. 
He signed it, he knows what is going on. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my supplementary. 
You ask a simple question, you get a convoluted answer.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
I think my hon. friend ought to study these minutes of settlement. 
It will help him in phrasing his questions in future.  
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, TPC is anything but a handout. 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):

They are in full conformity with the fisheries research board. 
We have followed science in all the decisions made.  
The hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.  
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
The same report states that the government has been much too permissive in this respect.  
Hon. Lucienne Robillard (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):
This is one of the actions we have taken. 
Several cases were investigated. 
I am sorry to interrupt the hon. minister. 
The hon. member for Palliser.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the minister of agriculture. 
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
Mr. Jean Dube (Madawaska-Restigouche, PC):
Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Minister of Labour, Lib.):
I understand the parties have met today. 
This government wants a collective agreement. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
My question is for the Parliamentary Secretary responsible for International Trade. 
If so, does he plan to do this?  
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for his question. 
It shows great insight into this issue.  
We are pursuing it with vigour.  
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
The local native communities never asked for those fish. 
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):
These boarding schools nearly wiped out a generation of natives in Canada.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
That is what they are doing today.  
They continue to negotiate. 
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
COMMENTS DURING QUESTION PERIOD 
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, on a point of order.  
Is it on the same point of order? 
It was asked in the House. 
I am going to give the minister one kick at the can.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I certainly understand your desire to arbitrate.

Mr. Speaker, I have two petitions today. 
The first petition has to do with the family.

QUESTIONS PASSED AS ORDERS FOR RETURNS 
Mr. White (North Vancouver): 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
The hon. member for Elk Island on a point of order.  
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
I believe under the standing orders he is required to table that document. 
We request that he do so. 
AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF CANADA (QUEBEC) 
The House resumed consideration of the motion.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
I think undue haste is the operative term.  
The amendment will replace constitutional guarantees with inferior statutory guarantees. 
They are bound to these precedents, as is the Supreme Court of Canada. 
This is a very important point. 
The judicial precedents are quite clear. 
The charter does not tolerate sectarian confessional education in the school system.  
This is very troubling.  
That is what the constitutional experts said before the committee.  
Previously the Leader of the Opposition stated in debate: 
It is this broader right that many parents would like to see safeguarded.  
This creates a worrisome precedent for other provinces such as Ontario. 
We will be studying a similar application from Newfoundland this week at a joint committee.  
I reiterate one very important point. 
Then they would all have access to the same rights. 
We do not equalize the playing field by levelling rights for some. 
It was not a political compromise for one time in our history. 
Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
There is a premise that no consensus has been established in Quebec. 
I listened very intently to the member's speech. 
The consensus is large. 
Let us be clear what we are talking about. 
I will be even more specific. 
We talk about consensus. 
The provincial Protestant Association of Teachers represents approximately 6,500 teachers. 
It represents 172 parents' committees.  
I said that half a dozen times in my speech. 
I agreed to that statement being included in the majority report. 
However, that has nothing to do with section 93. 
The government is implementing them. 
That is the challenge that this government has not answered. 
It is possible to do both. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
I literally said that six times in my main remarks. 
We make that clear two or three times in our dissenting report. 
Every witness who opposed the amendment made that clear in their submissions.  
Let me just make it clear for the member. 
I am in favour of the establishment of linguistic school boards in Quebec. 
The Reform Party is in favour of the establishment of linguistic school boards in Quebec. 
There is unanimous consensus in Quebec to this effect. 
The Quebec bishops agree with it. 
It said we could have both. 
We can do both.  
We can do both at the same time. 
At the same time, why not do it?  
Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard-La Prairie, Lib.):
As well, the first railway in Canada was at La Prairie.  
All of Canada can be proud of them.  
My riding is located on the South Shore of Montreal. 
Claude Ryan was the minister at the time. 
In the brief, I opposed the proposal for linguistic school boards.  
I have three examples. 
This protection does not apply in my riding.  
I personally know a number of them and they are moderate people. 
Therefore, I take their concerns all the more seriously. 
I must point out that section 93 does not deal with these other minority rights. 
Whether section 93 is amended or not, nothing will change in this regard. 
It is a fear that I want to encourage them not to have. 
One can see the absurdity of the situation.  
The solution is to elect a federalist government in Quebec as soon as possible.  
The schools and the communities complement each other remarkably well. 
Under these circumstances, I think it would be totally unacceptable.  
This human context can be preserved within the contemplated reform. 
Second: to allow transitional periods that vary according to the circumstances. 
Progress must not mean dehumanization. 
It is a real challenge, and I put it to the government.  
I know that the people of Brossard-La Prairie will rise to the challenge.  
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
That is the context in which Quebec initiated the current process.  
The Constitution Act of 1982 provides several possible amending formulas. 
Third, there is the place of instruction in the schools: what guarantees are given? 
Will amending section 93 affect Quebec's anglophone minorities? 
This went without saying in 1867. 
Because in the 19th century, denomination and language were practically interchangeable. 
The numbers speak for themselves.  
The numbers speak for themselves. 
I would like now to deal with the issue of consensus. 
Furthermore, the Jewish Congress for the Quebec City region stated: 
Several public hearings were held over the last ten years in Quebec. 
These figures speak for themselves. 
In the rest of the province, we would have had linguistic school boards only.  
The same situation would have occurred. 
I cannot make head or tail of it. 
That is what would happen.  
This is absolutely false. 
It is not section 93.  
The proverbial generosity of Quebeckers is recognized all over the world. 
I know that other issues were raised by various witnesses. 
Second, the act creates duties and obligations for school organizations as regards denominational provisions. 
Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
It is odd that the Government of Quebec has taken such a decision. 
I was wondering if the member from Quebec could answer two questions. 
Can the member answer these two questions?  
You asked me to answer your question, sir. 
We are still part of Canada. 
Let us not mix debates. 
I will stop here on that matter.  
Here again, a number of debates are being mixed up. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
I do not doubt that it is the majority. 
I have two questions.  
The hon. member will please address the Chair rather than the hon. member.  
I am sorry, Mr. Speaker. 
I know in my province there are three minority boards. 
They all have a petition. 
That is the concern in western Canada. 
My constituents are extremely interested in this.  
I hope I am hearing that incorrectly. 
In the history of our country we have had religion taught in the schools. 
I would like the hon. member to address those two questions.  
For other regions, it was a matter of dissent.  
In Quebec, however, there is consensus on this matter.  
I am sorry, but the time allowed for questions and comments has run out. 
The hon. parliamentary secretary on a point of order.  
I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
It was simply a point of clarification.  
Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
In the case of Newfoundland, we have looked at this issue twice. 
This is not the first time that this issue has been raised in Quebec. 
I think an interesting answer then was, yes.  
We should stress that often the truth is found in these exchanges. 
It is a dialectical give and take. 
The system is neutral on that point.  
That is a matter for the provincial political processes. 
Let me come back to the particular issue. 
The answer is that it has no implications for that at all. 
It is open to the political processes within the province.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, congratulations on your elevation to the chair. 
I commend the learned and honourable member for his presentation. 
I would however take issue with some of his conclusions.  
I have several questions for the hon. member in that respect. 
He said the matter had been considered for nearly 30 years in Quebec. 
Does he mean by that approaches to education which preclude confessional education? 
Does he mean more secular approaches to education?  
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his thoughtful series of questions. 
There were very learned studies. 
He raised the issue of what I referred to as new plural trends in education. 
Every province obviously is different from the other. 
This is one of the nice things about Canada today. 
There was a series of decisions in the fifties, sixties and seventies.  
Mechanically applied, I think those would be wrong decisions.  
The hon. member should address the Chair.  
You fill the role admirably in a very real corporeal sense.  
We are a different society. 
We have rejected the melting pot concept of total assimilation. 
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
I must commend him because I appreciated it. 
Historically I believe he is most accurate. 
Let us not tear away at something the rest of the provinces feel is valuable.  
I can reassure the hon. member on this point. 
The member may ask me what the relevance of that is. 
Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):
I feel, however, that amendment is understating the issue. 
They can start to see themselves in terms of their own place in history.  
In Canada it is something not done with ease. 
That is not such a bad thing. 
There are times when the glacial pace of constitutional change makes sense. 
They stem from a simple test consisting of three questions.  
First, does the constitutional amendment have the democratic agreement of the people? 
Second, does it conform to the rule of the law? 
Third, are the rights of minorities protected?  
On the first the answer is quite clear. 
There has been no public consultation in Quebec. 
The solution to this is reasonably straightforward. 
It needs to present clearly the implications of the amendment.  
The committee should be certain that what is being proposed respects the rule of law.  
Are we using the appropriate amending formula? 
The Government of Canada and some legal scholars say yes. 
Other voices have challenged the bilateral process. 
A court decision could settle the legal issue. 
The answer to the third question is crucial. 
When the dividing line is language, emotions tend to run high. 
Of course, this brings to mind one concern. 
I think it does and I am not alone.  
To sum up, I asked three questions. 
I was hoping for three yes answers but I received two noes and a maybe. 
It was hardly a passing grade. 
Let me be more generous and propose an easier question. 
The children of Quebec would still receive an education. 
Surely we learned this from Meech and Charlottetown. 
It can consult its citizens. 
It can hold a referendum with a clearly worded question. 
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
I have three pieces of information I want to give him. 
And it will continue to do so. 
Madam Speaker, I will answer a couple of the hon. member's concerns. 
That is the direction that should be taken.  
I believe we can make those improvements to the constitution.  
Let me speak to the consensus reached at the meetings. 
They had not polled their members.  
There has been a discussion on reforming the education system along linguistic lines. 
That has been a very recent phenomenon. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Madam Speaker, my question is for my colleague in the Reform Party.  
The Reform Party is suggesting that it is the separatists who want this. 
I find this a bit offensive. 
Does this mean the bishops of Quebec are separatists? 
The Anglican religion, or those religions, were in agreement. 
So perhaps it was their minority that was against.  
I would just like to ask him this question:
Would they go along with the 20%?  
It was in favour of reforming schools along linguistic lines.  
That is the consensus in Quebec. 
There is no doubt about it. 
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
That is not actually correct. 
However, for me there are several key issues here. 
The first one is the issue of provincial responsibility. 
When I look at Reform policy on this issue, it is very clear. 
As my colleague has mentioned, there is already a court challenge under way. 
To me that is a very powerful argument in favour.  
Second is one against. 
I am a firm believer in this. 
I was really puzzled by this. 
As I mentioned, I appreciated the eloquent arguments from members of my own side. 
A member from the NDP made the point that this change is affecting the minorities. 
It was more that he feels that there is probably consensus. 
I guess that is all I have to say on the issue. 
Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
Reformers seem to give much weight to a petition signed by 235,000 people. 
Minority language rights are not protected under clause 93. 
But their support now depends on a petition signed by 235,000 people.  
What factor is he going to use? 
I think that has been demonstrated time and time again. 
First I will address the question of referendums.  
Referendums cost money of course. 
There is a cost to democracy. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Questions and comments, the hon. member for Acadie-Bathurst.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NPD):
That is what I was driving at.  
I was on the committee that studied school reform to make schools non-denominational. 
This issue did not arise only three weeks ago. 
I think it was the best time for a party to score political points. 
But even the Liberal opposition was in favour.  
I think there is a consensus among Quebeckers on this issue. 
So I think we must be careful with this. 
This is a warning. 
We must also be careful with what we say in this House. 
If we want to keep Quebec in Canada, we must treat it with respect.  
I was having a discussion about the petition with my colleague. 
If the hon. member wishes to speak to me afterward, that is fine.  
Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I want to bring forward some concerns I have about this resolution. 
We have an awesome responsibility when we are asked to extinguish those rights. 
This is not so.  
The government has acknowledged the existence of this constitutional convention.  
In other words, those prejudicially affected by the resolution must consent to its passage. 
For this fundamental reason this House should not pass the resolution.  
In the Richard B. case, Mr. Justice LaForest, speaking for the majority, stated: 
The court went on to hold: 
International conventions have enshrined education as a basic human right.  
No person shall be denied the right of education.  
The answer to this question is clear. 
Parliament is the guarantor of minority denominational rights. 
The parents are the holders of the right.  
There is no novelty in this test. 
There is no other place in the constitution that protects them.  
They will fall within the next day. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I commend the hon. member for his very thoughtful remarks. 
Section 93 of the Constitution Act would not impair that ability whatsoever. 
I think that is wrong. 
Education of children ultimately lies with the parents. 
Our school systems should reflect that. 
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
We are talking about consensus; not unanimity, but consensus. 
I suggest to my friend across the way that we have a similar situation. 
There is simply none. 
Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question will be a very short one. 
It is a matter of administration.  
Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. 
I think the hon. member is premature. 
The Chair has no alternative. 
The debate is concluded if no member is rising to speak. 
I will put the question but I must deal with this. 
Is the House ready for the question?  
(Division deemed demanded and deferred) 
(The House adjourned at 6.02 p.m.)
