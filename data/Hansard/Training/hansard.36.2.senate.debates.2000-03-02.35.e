The Senate met at 2:00 p.m., the Speaker in the Chair.  
Arctic Winter Games 2000 
They will be participating in a multitude of events.  
All are sure to amaze any audience.  
Cultural venues are also not to be overlooked. 
I always volunteered when the games were held in the Yukon. 
I look forward to my visit home next week.  
Canada-United States Relations 
I should like to take this opportunity to set the record straight. 
First, I will update honourable senators on the facts.  
Several serious consequences could result from this project. 
We are not prepared to take this risk with Lake Winnipeg.  
These two rivers have been separate since the last ice age. 
Linking them could cause serious disruption to both ecosystems. 
Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission 
Hon. Jean-Robert Gauthier :
This decision must be changed.  
Changes to Rules-Effect on Parliamentary Democracy 
Many of us in this country are members of minorities. 
We know what it is like when the majority has unabridged power.  
There seems to be no end to the government's arrogance in this matter.  
The Estimates, 1999-2000 
Tabling of Supplementary Estimates (B) 
Bill to Amend-Report of Committee 
Thursday, March 2, 2000 
The Standing Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has the honour to present its 
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third time?  
The Estimates, 1999-2000 The Estimates, 2000-2001 
Bill read first time.  
The Hon. the Speaker :
Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second time?  
Canada-Japan Inter-Parliamentary Group 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
That the Committee submit its final report no later than December 31, 2000.  
The Budget-Allocation for Replacement of Sea King Helicopters 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, I had wanted to ask this question yesterday, but there was insufficient time.  
That leaves only about $1.7 billion over the next three years. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
We are placing them unnecessarily close to jeopardy. 
There is something morally wrong with that.  
The computers are there. 
The desks are there. 
The tables and chairs are there. 
Already we have lost a year, if not five years, from last fall. 
The plane should have been on the ground 10 years ago.  
Don't address it, answer it!  
But it is the case.  
I am sure the honourable senator is familiar with it. 
I was advised that that was not the case. 
What did you expect them to say?  
That is a bit of a disclaimer.  
It is simple, if it is the main priority of the government. 
I think he wants it. 
He knows about the troubles and he knows about the problems. 
Otherwise, it might have been dealt with differently. 
That is my conclusion. 
All you do is read Gallup polls anyway.  
I have repeated it here in this place previously. 
I will continue to address this issue with him. 
New War Museum-Possible Government Contribution 
Hon. J. Michael Forrestall :
Honourable senators, I have another question on a related subject. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Honourable senators, I cannot confirm that press item at this time.  
Air Canada-Effect of Bill Setting Out Obligations 
What kind of double standard is that? 
Should we be surprised? 
I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate:
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Like getting rid of the GST!  
Honourable senators, this situation is quite unusual. 
Some people may be of the view that the proposed penalty provisions are too severe. 
I will be interested to hear comments and debate from honourable senators on that issue. 
I can only assume that they intend to keep the commitments. 
The penalty, as I have said, should not be a problem for them.  
National Highway Policy-Government Position 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
This government has dedicated $150 million this year for highways across Canada.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
The Budget-Toll Funding for Highway Infrastructure 
Hon. Noel A. Kinsella (Deputy Leader of the Opposition) :
Those are the good old days.  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
What is the point?  
I suppose New Brunswick did not need the money.  
The rest of the highway was under construction. 
The highway in Nova Scotia was fully completed and in full operation.  
They made the choice to retain that revenue. 
It does not take any time at all to do that. 
That is a choice that the current government of the Province of Nova Scotia made. 
Hon. Lois M. Wilson :
Honourable senators, I have some questions for the Leader of the Government.  
First, why have our international commitments on this issue not been honoured? 
Third, why was this issue not addressed when the budget was presented?  
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
The tax cuts are substantial - $58 billion-worth. 
That is positive step.  
The leader has said he will consult with the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
However, it is Heritage Canada and it falls within their ambit. 
Perhaps the consultation should take place there.  
I thank the honourable senator for that information. 
I will certainly direct the question to that minister.  
Cuba-Efficacy of Quiet Diplomacy 
Hon. A. Raynell Andreychuk :
The government has consistently stated that this is paying off. 
However, we have seen just as consistently that it has not paid off. 
Can he give honourable senators any examples? 
Certainly, there is a litany of violations of that quiet diplomacy. 
Hon. J. Bernard Boudreau (Leader of the Government) :
Upon receipt of such a review, I would then share it with the honourable senator.  
Matters can only be helped by contact.  
I am not sure that is correct. 
Canada has become the largest point of origin for tourism in Cuba. 
That is absolutely right.  
We cannot go to Florida.  
Canada has become Cuba's number one source of tourism. 
Since the Cuban Revolution, the American government has taken a different tack. 
I am not so sure that was a great success. 
I personally believe that it was not.  
Minister Axworthy proceeded to apply quiet diplomacy. 
We have seen how they work in this whole visa episode. 
What is the government's position?  
I will pass along the comments of the honourable senator. 
In any event, I take the honourable senator's comment seriously. 
DELAYED ANSWER TO ORAL QUESTION 
Hon. Dan Hays (Deputy Leader of the Government) :
(Response to question raised by Hon. Mira Spivak on February 23, 2000) 
From this workshop a concrete action plan will be developed for the federal government. 
Second Reading-Debate Adjourned 
This legislation builds on our existing Elections Act while maintaining its core principles.  
Tie votes will be dealt with by calling a by-election.  
The threshold that the commissioner currently seeks injunctions under is in incidents of irreparable harm. 
This change is in keeping with the principle of electoral fairness.  
That includes ads which identify a candidate. 
The Supreme Court of Canada said in Libman : 
This bill extends that ban to third parties. 
Its application will include all electoral participants. 
Essentially, these provisions will level the playing field for electoral participants. 
The blackout will effectively prohibit the broadcast or publication of exit polls.  
This information represents the minimum requirements advocated by experts in this field. 
Bill C-2 was developed within the framework of a non-partisan process. 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin :
We can be proud of our electoral system. 
However, it must be improved when necessary.  
My other area of questioning is financing. 
Honourable senators, I believe the Elections Act has limited its reach to election periods. 
I was not briefed on the precise question that he has raised. 
However, that would be my assumption.  
I would say that it is not a forgotten matter. 
The honourable senator called it a black hole. 
It certainly is an overlooked area where we have potential concern. 
It is very transparent. 
It is quite transparent. 
Now we have it in black and white!  
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
That is not because I am giving up. 
They were promised by someone prominent, "Don't worry, boys. 
Don't be nervous. 
However, we did not scrap the bill. 
We defeated the bill. 
Now everyone is happy because it is a good bill. 
No, no, when we are in the Senate.  
Maybe we should take the appointment process away from the government. 
We will discuss that in committee.  
Years ago, Senator Nolin and I foresaw this danger. 
We had the guts to be friends. 
We went before the commissioners. 
We got what we wanted because no one else disagreed.  
I see many precedents taking place. 
Fewer and fewer people will register. 
Is that not true, Senator Nolin? 
They say they can register the day of the election. 
We will have to look into that, even though we changed the system of enumeration. 
That was an amelioration, but we will have to push it further along. 
Ours is a good political system.  
Is the honourable senator satisfied with the bill? 
If not, we will come back to this issue in committee. 
The Estimates, 2000-01 
That a Message be sent to the House of Commons to acquaint that House accordingly.  
Motion to Extend Term of Appointment Adopted 
The Hon the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
It would be valuable for him to come to us again.  
I know the latter are quite numerous.  
Honourable senators, I support that suggestion. 
In terms of standing this matter, I am not sure when his appointment runs out.  
The motion gives the date of May 1.  
The motion is effective May 1 for a further period of months. 
I assume his appointment does not run out until the end of April. 
However, I have no problem in pursuing what has been requested.  
I shall discuss the matter with my counterpart. 
Honourable senators, I have no objection to the reappointment of Mr. Phillips. 
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, I am pleased to see such full agreement on both sides. 
In my view, there are three sides in the Senate. 
I should like to endorse Senator Lynch-Staunton's suggestion that the commissioner come here. 
Senator Lynch-Staunton has my agreement. 
His is a good suggestion.  
I thank all honourable senators for their cooperation in this matter. 
The Hon. the Speaker pro tempore :
Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the motion?  
National Archives of Canada Act 
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Hon. Thelma J. Chalifoux :
That was the beginning of Western Canada as we know it today. 
Indian treaties and the railroads were completed. 
Migration to the west began in earnest. 
The aboriginal nations were mobile and followed the buffalo herds for their food supplies.  
These records are available today for genealogists, historians and families to access. 
In the meantime, time has passed. 
Five or six generations of families have come and gone since this act was passed. 
The early 1900s were really the era of mass migration to the west. 
Honourable senators, I shall give you another reason why I support Bill S-15. 
Let us take the example of employment equity initiatives. 
Western Canadian history needs to be told. 
On motion of Senator Chalifoux, for Senator LeBreton, debate adjourned.  
Bill to Amend-Second Reading-Debate Continued 
Honourable Senator Di Nino ). 
Hon. Consiglio Di Nino :
Honourable senators, I will not spend too much time on this issue today.  
I do wish, however, to make a few comments first.  
In one case, victims are robbed of their lives - in the other, their dignity. 
In some cases, it may very well be a harsher sentence than death.  
Not only is this not logical, it is not right. 
People like Bernardo are worse than the common criminal - far worse. 
I believe they deserve penalties that fit their crimes. 
I support this bill. 
Honourable senators, I support this bill for another reason as well. 
Canadians are losing their tolerance for crime. 
Honourable senators, what is this bill really all about? 
Let me tell you. 
It allows them to impose consecutive sentences of up to 50 years. 
I firmly believe that judges would be extremely careful in their use of this option. 
At every turn, she was criticized, attacked, maligned and disparaged. 
Honourable senators, Bill C-247 restores some fairness to the process. 
It is so courageous that a Toronto newspaper was moved to editorialize: 
Obviously, not everyone agrees with this bill. 
Others argue that consecutive sentences constitute undue punishment. 
The point is that justice is not about filling in the blanks. 
It is not about statistics. 
Multiple rapes and multiple murders are heinous crimes.  
Honourable senators, let us send this bill to committee as soon as possible. 
Honourable senators, would the Honourable Senator Di Nino accept a question?  
My question is very simple. 
How can it be longer than that?  
Obviously, we are talking about the eligibility for parole. 
That is what the issue is all about. 
That is what we are talking about.  
Is that how the honourable senator believes the Criminal Code works?  
Honourable senators, we trust the judiciary. 
This decision is not ours to make. 
By way of example, a fellow in Toronto recently killed two sisters. 
Do honourable senators know what happened? 
We believe that is wrong.  
Hon. Nicholas W. Taylor :
Hon. Marcel Prud'homme :
Honourable senators, I have a question for Senator Di Nino as well.  
That means it is not a burial. 
It seems that Senator Taylor is saying the same thing.  
This issue is close to me. 
It was called the Fleming-Prud'homme amendment. 
Why did I choose Jim Fleming? 
It was because I believe in alliances. 
The question is very simple. 
She is in a position to answer every question. 
Honourable senators, it is the same as with any bill. 
What we will be doing in committee is looking at the provisions of this bill. 
On motion of Senator Carstairs, debate adjourned.  
Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration 
Sixth Report of Committee Adopted 
Honourable Senator Rompkey, P.C. ). 
Hon. Pierre Claude Nolin moved the adoption of the report.  
Motion agreed to, and report adopted.  
State of Health Care System 
Honourable senators, I move the adoption of the report.  
Hon. John Lynch-Staunton (Leader of the Opposition) :
That was only proper. 
On motion of Senator Lynch-Staunton, debate adjourned.  
Hon. Peter A. Stollery , pursuant to notice of March 1, 2000, moved: 
Canada-United States Relations 
Leave having been given to revert to Senators' Statements: 
The potential for greater flooding of the Red River is significant. 
It is time for the Government of Canada to act. 
This is an international waterway. 
However, all require the ammunition that only an independent environmental assessment study can provide. 
I urge the government to act immediately.  
Leave having been given to revert to Government Notices of Motions: 
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday, March 21, 2000,at 2 p.m.
