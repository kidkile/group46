EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 57 
Wednesday, February 11, 1998 
The House met at 2 p.m. 
Members sang the national anthem ] 
Mr. Joseph Volpe (Eglinton-Lawrence, Lib.):
Cardiovascular disease is an area where we are making major health gains. 
The roots of heart disease and stroke are in the way we live. 
By investing in cardiovascular health, we can considerably reduce- 
I am sorry, but the hon. member's time is up. 
The hon. member for Selkirk-Interlake.  
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
The minister is consistent in at least two respects. 
First, he is dead wrong. 
Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):
Mr. Rene Canuel (Matapedia-Matane, BQ):
My thanks to the people of Matapedia-Matane for their great generosity.  
Hooray for community spirit.  
CITIZENSHIP AND HERITAGE WEEK 
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton, Lib.):
We want to ensure a bright future for the greatest country in the world.  
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington, Lib.):
People can make a difference and we did. 
I thank Guelph-Wellington.  
Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):
It certainly looks like one of those skeletons just appeared.  
One paragraph of that speech reads: 
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Mr. Real Menard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):
Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):
The issue is the year 2000 computer problem. 
Too many businesses are putting this off. 
Too many are ignoring the inevitable.  
We must take action and take it now. 
Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):
There is one person who can solve the Senate problem: the prime minister. 
No more lying sedate. 
We want them to debate.  
No more endless vacation. 
No more tropical showers. 
We want office hours.  
No more beachside recreation. 
We want them to review legislation.  
No more lying on a cot. 
We want some sober second thought.  
No more shopping in Mexico City. 
We want them on a subcommittee.  
No more playing and straying all day. 
We want them all to earn their pay.  
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
CN's purchase of this railroad will cost some $4.3 billion. 
More importantly, the purchase should increase the number of CN employees.  
No, it should not mean a cut in staff. 
This is great news for the economy of the Montreal region. 
This is truly a love story. 
Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, Canada's rail system continues to expand in the wrong direction. 
Yesterday CN purchased an American rail line. 
I hope they do not pull the rail lines out.  
REFERENCE TO SUPREME COURT 
Mr. Nick Discepola (Vaudreuil-Soulanges, Lib.):
CORNER BROOK-CANADA WINTER GAMES 
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Humber-St. 
That is the Corner Brook-Canada 1999 Winter Games. 
Mr. Speaker, you are invited.  
We are ready for these games. 
We will see them there.  
Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the finance department publishes a monthly newsletter called the Fiscal Monitor . 
It is full of statistics, including updates on the deficit.  
What is the finance minister's explanation of the disappearing surplus?  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this surplus is not the finance minister's money. 
It belongs to Canadian families. 
It belongs to Canadian businesses and entrepreneurs that create wealth.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Yes, it is the taxpayers'.  
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Why has the minister allowed the left to dominate the debate? 
Why is the minister not telling Canadians what this deal is all about?  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I do not know where my hon. friend has been. 
He must have been sleeping. 
We make no apologies for the team Canada trip.  
I am happy that it was obviously an overwhelming endorsement.  
Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):
Why is the minister not responding to those concerns? 
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
FEDERAL DISASTER RELIEF PROGRAM 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
It was Lucien Bouchard.  
It was a letter from the present minister, sent in 1996- 
He was not even there then.  
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the President of the Treasury Board.  
My question concerns compensation for the power grid. 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague knows full well that his statement is incorrect. 
The rule was changed in 1988. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence.  
Canada must not be so narrow minded. 
We must avoid war.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
We believe efforts should continue toward a diplomatic solution. 
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Mr. Speaker, we do want some information about the government's position. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
We are working very hard to avoid that. 
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Mr. Speaker, the UN resolutions were adopted in 1991. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
If he has not received it I will have to investigate.  
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
We know the minister has not contacted Mr. Starlight.  
The minister has not contacted Mr. Starlight. 
What contact has she had with the Liberal chief?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
With regard to this particular issue we have not discussed anything.  
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are also seeking a diplomatic solution. 
Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois-Salaberry, BQ):
In 1998, he has changed his tune. 
In 1998, that too has gone by the boards.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
Why will the minister not tell us the name?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Derrek Konrad (Prince Albert, Ref.):
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):
The minister is the sponsor of the bill. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there is no conflict of interest. 
There is no apparent conflict of interest. 
This was confirmed by the ethics commissioner, Mr. Wilson.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
We appreciate that, but there is something we would like to know. 
Who is he and what is his name?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this is just getting more and more unbelievable by the day. 
She thinks that there is somebody there. 
She says what a terrific fellow he is. 
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the investigator will make his report to me when he has completed it.  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
JACQUES CHIRAC'S STATEMENT 
Ms. Raymonde Folco (Laval West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, here is what the French president said: 
France is one country indivisible. 
France is diverse and this constitutes our wealth. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
The two theatres pose very different threats to the sailors aboard the ship.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Why is he afraid of the opposition on this? 
Will he make his policy statement on the MAI in the House of Commons?  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I find it ironic. 
We have given more information to members of Parliament. 
We have conducted round tables across the country. 
I have no problems debating with him anytime, any place, anywhere.  
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
I am looking forward to it.  
The minister did not answer my question. 
Why is he ignoring Parliament? 
Can he tell Parliament what he is going to say on Friday? 
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, to whom does he think a parliamentary committee reports? 
We are asking and answering questions in this House. 
The first question in four months was asked by the Reform Party. 
Obviously you have been agitated for the last number of days. 
We are not afraid to answer.  
As I said, we are encouraging more debate. 
It does not undermine the economy.  
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Today, Saddam Hussein has stocks of anthrax. 
American troops have been vaccinated against anthrax.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, those discussions are under way with Health Canada. 
Mr. David Price (Compton-Stanstead, PC):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
We want to protect our troops the best we can. 
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):
But we still favour a negotiated settlement.  
Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):
I will ask once again. 
Who is looking into the case? 
And why is she keeping it such a secret?  
Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, there are two things. 
First, I did not break the confidentiality. 
The name of the investigator is Mr. Newman.  
DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL DEFENCE 
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
This is saving money for the Canadian taxpayers.  
We have put in place extensive consultations. 
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Transport.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
That is good for all of us in Canada.  
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
I would like to know. 
Those men have not had their vaccination.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
In that period of time there are opportunities to provide for inoculations. 
The necessary protection will be provided.  
Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds-Grenville, Lib.):
I applaud this initiative.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
There will be more programs to help those people.  
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
The first is access to these stocks. 
Canadian fishermen have access to these stocks. 
The hon. member for Repentigny.  
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of International Trade.  
The Minister of International Trade.  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, that was indeed one of the recommendations included in the report. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
We want to keep it open. 
Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
MR. JUSTICE LOUIS MARCEL JOYAL-SPEAKER'S RULING 
I will keep the House advised of all further developments in this matter.  
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO PETITIONS 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Bob Speller (Haldimand-Norfolk-Brant, Lib.):
(Motion agreed to and bill read the first time) 
Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):
Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I suggest that all remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
My constituents have been waiting 139 days. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the member's impatience. 
Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver-Sunshine Coast, Ref.):
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
It appears as Q-21 on the notice paper.  
It is a very straightforward question.  
Mr. Speaker, my reply to the two hon. members is the same. 
I will look into the matters and get back to them as soon as possible.  
I ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The bill was passed by the Senate on December 11, 1997.  
The bill clearly responds to these recommendations.  
Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Coquitlam-Burnaby, Ref.):
Interestingly the bill was tabled by the government in the Senate.  
The bill largely says how the federal government will behave. 
Three pieces of legislation will be amended by the bill. 
On disability issues there is some background worth mentioning. 
That bill died with the dissolution of that Parliament.  
Certainly we have excluded many worthy jurors in the past.  
The bill also deals with the offence of sexual exploitation. 
The caveat is reasonableness.  
Clause 8 deals with videotaped evidence. 
It has been done in Ontario in this regard. 
There is controversy there.  
That is unacceptable to them. 
That has not been chosen in this bill and probably is too idealistic.  
It is good to see some accountability measure built in.  
The chairperson would respond by assigning a member of the tribunal to hear the case. 
In instances of complex complaints, perhaps a three member panel could be assigned.  
They could also deal with the addition of parties and interested persons to the proceedings.  
This situation would continue under the bill.  
This would not be used lightly.  
There will always be controversy on these matters.  
The passage of this legislation is helpful but it is not the whole answer. 
Good people can make poor situations work if they want to. 
We need to have balance and reason. 
Reformers care about people. 
Reformers are supporting this bill today. 
Peter Hogg in the Constitutional Law of Canada writes: 
Richard Van Loon and Michael Whittington in The Canadian Political System state: 
We all know how the Senate is currently in a state of flux. 
Do senators truly understand the needs of average Canadians? 
Who are they accountable to if they do not represent a specific constituency?  
That is without dispute. 
We even have senators with commendable attendance records. 
Reformers are not upset with the handful of hard workers. 
It is quite simple. 
It is next to impossible.  
Members of Parliament do not want to become rubber stamps. 
We do not want to rubber stamp Bill S-5. 
I want to conclude that we are supportive of the components of this bill. 
Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):
In June 1996, a federal task force on disability issues was formed. 
Clauses 2 through 8 of Bill C-5 amend the Criminal Code. 
Clause 2 creates a new offence. 
These are the only three criteria of excessive hardship mentioned in the bill. 
The first concerns the tribunal's independence. 
Clause 48.3 also raises some questions. 
This is a matter into which the committee must look seriously.  
As for clause 48.5, 
it reads as follows: 
This gives me food for thought. 
People with disabilities have all the rights of other citizens. 
Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):
It represents the perspective of persons with disabilities. 
It is critical that people with disabilities are consulted.  
It will only provide consultation. 
Input by disabled persons will also be included in the process. 
This will help to further establish their needs to fully integrate into society.  
The duty to accommodate with regard to employment is critical. 
We need to assess the needs of the individual. 
This is about fairness and equity, not cost.  
The bill is important but it still needs work. 
Accessibility complaints usually take two years for resolution. 
Usually resolution comes in the form of one person's complaint being answered. 
To resolve the issue a TTY service is installed in the airport. 
Do we need to lodge a complaint for every single airport in Canada? 
How do we ensure that all airports have a TTY? 
In other words, the bill does not deal with systemic problems. 
It is a complaint driven process.  
But there are still many more steps which need to be executed.  
I think all members of the disabled community are still waiting for that.  
In closing, I support Bill S-5. 
For that reason I am in support of this first step.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
I congratulate the senators for their participation in this legislation. 
I would like to move on to Bill S-5 as a whole. 
I am curious to see how this reaction will be taken by the members.  
The Reform Party members are opposed to the principle of special treatment. 
These aids were not always readily available. 
Again this is an important aspect of the bill. 
Persons with disabilities would also not be excluded from jury service. 
I use that simply as one example.  
The human rights commission would basically be the court of final analysis.  
These grounds of discrimination are listed at section 2 of the act.  
I would suggest that this is a common sense approach.  
Bill S-5 also provides for a number of administrative changes. 
I ask the question why.  
We have seen many tribunals and governing boards. 
I see you, Mr. Speaker, may have some doubts about that.  
I think this limitation should be studied again at the committee level. 
There may have to be some legislative fine tuning to define the parameters. 
We want to be very careful before we tread into this area.  
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
I add my support to the bill. 
I have been involved for many years with administrative law and was not a lawyer. 
I know mutual admiration and respect flow back and forth between those two individuals.  
His comments are very telling and very relevant.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
Let examine the history of the Senate. 
In the British system it is the House of Lords. 
Senators are appointed as opposed to members of the House who are elected. 
Senators represent the parties that put them into place. 
It is unlike members of the House who have to go back to their constituents. 
They are not accountable for the positions they take. 
We support the legislation. 
We are not talking about the legislation. 
We believe it should be coming from the House. 
I believe I have made my point. 
I wanted to get it on record. 
There are a number of other bills like Bill S-5. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. Speaker, I listened intently to the comments of my Reform colleague.  
Could my friend comment on that?  
We have the views of two parties as opposed to five. 
On the second question, we have already had an elected senator, Senator Waters of Alberta. 
Stan Waters was elected in 1989 in a municipal election. 
A lot of people say the costs are horrendous. 
The concept is that the people of Alberta chose Stan Waters. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
It is a very worthwhile objective.  
That seems on its face to be a harmless and sensible provision.  
I simply raise that as something for consideration. 
However, of course, it is an established part of our constitutional framework. 
It is something we have to work with. 
This is an important principle. 
We are the commons. 
We sit in this place representing the people of Canada with a democratic mandate. 
They are accountable to no one but themselves. 
The people in this House belong to five recognized political parties. 
The people in the Senate belong to only two recognized political parties. 
And so I add this caveat. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
CANADIAN WHEAT BOARD ACT 
BILL C-4-NOTICE OF TIME ALLOCATION 
Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House will now proceed to consideration of Private Members' Business.  
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC) moved: 
The company, Shaw Industries Limited, is a very respected company. 
He kept his word.  
The United States aggregate market is a very tough market to break into. 
However, it did not proceed because it was sensitive to the public outcry.  
Lo and behold, it did not have to go through any public tendering process. 
It did not have to submit a proposal. 
He was a minister at the time the Shaw group proposed doing this. 
Those doors were all knocked down for the Waterman group. 
Mr. Al Lacey was to lead their cause. 
I mentioned this in the House before. 
Lo and behold lies will eventually catch up with you. 
The government continued its sort of conspiracy of silence. 
There is no transparency at all in this process. 
They lied on their intention to take over the port. 
Their 40 page document amounts to nothing more than what I call economic blackmail. 
I will table it in the House for all to examine. 
That amounts to economic blackmail.  
It did not end there. 
They have actually achieved what I call the ultimate in economic blackmail. 
Now the province is entertaining selling them the lands. 
The lands in question are not federal lands. 
In other words, the life of this project would be 40 years.  
This sounds quite bizarre but it is accurate. 
That is absolutely bizarre. 
It is a deal made in heaven for these people.  
There was a complete conspiracy of silence in the province of New Brunswick.  
The minister of economic development refused to provide me with information. 
He does not correspond with a member of Parliament representing people living in that area. 
There is something wrong in the process when that happens.  
Who are these people? 
That is a big question. 
The government has been reluctant to do that. 
I do not think it wants to know the truth. 
The people in that area demand to know what is going on. 
They deserve full and complete transparency in that entire piece of business.  
Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
The project responded to a request from the province of New Brunswick. 
It would have created much needed jobs and economic activity in New Brunswick. 
It has received environmental approval.  
That is why I have to say what I have said here today.  
That is as far as our involvement goes.  
In the past Canada's port system was heavily subsidized by Canadian taxpayers. 
It suffered from overcapacity and too much bureaucracy. 
I think we heard that from the hon. member when he first spoke. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
Yet scarcely a month after leaving office Mr. Young was doing exactly that. 
He was selling his experience. 
In fact they declared war on the profession. 
Canadians were assured that the Liberals would just say no to lobbyists. 
Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am reluctant to interrupt the hon. member. 
Mr. Speaker, thank you for your intervention. 
I assure you I am leading to the heart of the matter.  
Right now he can only deal with transport matters.  
I feel a lot better.  
What exactly do they have to sell?  
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
I have actually had the opportunity to be there and it is a beautiful area.  
It is a vital element in the communities in southwestern New Brunswick.  
It is not protecting Canadians.  
This is why I am supporting this motion. 
There has been a lack of transparency in the quarry project. 
Were other companies allowed to bid? 
Have there been independent environmental studies? 
The people of New Brunswick deserve better than this.  
Paul Tellier, chairman and chief executive officer of CN.  
That is not all. 
Have I got a deal for you. 
It is hard to believe this is not a conflict of interest. 
Doug Young will be benefiting at the expense of New Brunswickers. 
Let us go back to the member for Charlotte's motion. 
To conclude, I reiterate my support for the member's motion. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):
Mr. speaker, I appreciate the members who spoke on behalf of my motion. 
It would not be uncommon. 
The member has engaged in that type of activity many times in this House.  
I think it is time he did his own investigative work on this project. 
Do you know what it would be? 
His name was Wayne Lockhart. 
In a public meeting he said to a citizens group there would be five jobs. 
That was not good enough. 
How are five jobs going to get the interest of any community? 
They went back to the drawing board. 
This is where the parliamentary secretary should have done his work. 
I carried this fight on long before I arrived in this House. 
I am working on behalf of my constituents. 
A former minister of the crown actually was the architect for the privatization act. 
The environmental process used in the province of New Brunswick is a flawed process. 
That is all they asked for.  
What do they have? 
Do members know what they found? 
It is absolutely bizarre.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Gordon Earle (Halifax West, NDP):
Our youth deserve a quality, accessible educational system. 
I asked the Minister of Finance about this. 
Accessibility should be a new national standard in higher education.  
Student aid should be based on need rather than merit.  
A national system of grants for post-secondary education should be a priority.  
Tuition fees should be frozen.  
It is time to say yes to Canada- 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance.  
Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, Lib.):
These are significant changes. 
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
They are still waiting for their money in 1998. 
When that did not work they put some money on the table. 
We see it with the Singer workers in Quebec. 
Did Mr. Mulroney have as much trouble getting his money? 
Why are they being paid and not the workers? 
Because government workers are ordinary Canadians, low and middle income Canadians.  
In December the President of the Treasury Board misrepresented facts. 
The government did not want to find a way to settle the dispute. 
Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it is time to set the record straight. 
We have nothing to be ashamed of when it comes to pay equity. 
The union leadership demands are in excess of $5 billion. 
Treasury Board has shown considerable flexibility in its negotiations. 
In April we tabled an offer valued at $843 million. 
This means further delays. 
It may require that the parties file for judicial review on the decision.  
Give the workers a vote. 
Let us not hide behind rhetoric. 
Let the workers decide now. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 5.52 p.m.)
