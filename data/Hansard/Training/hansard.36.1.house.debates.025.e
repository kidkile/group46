ACCESS TO INFORMATION ACT 
EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 25 
Friday, October 31, 1997 
The House met at 10 a.m. 
It is to that invitation that Parliament is asked to respond today.  
The system provides that such an authorization is required in the three situations listed below.  
The legislation also contains provisions concerning consequential amendments. 
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
That cost would have to be requested from the Supreme Court of Canada.  
Why not make it 8 months or 10 months? 
The Feeney decision undermines the traditional powers of the police. 
Now let us look at the Feeney decision. 
An 84 year old man was beaten to death. 
What did he do? 
What did that mean? 
What does it say to the people who live in that community? 
We always look for a reasonable balance. 
It was not even mentioned. 
What does ``outweighs the interest of the police'' mean? 
What is the interest of society in a case like this? 
This is what the bill attempts to deal with.  
They can only gather the evidence that is obvious before them. 
They will have to go through this rigmarole.  
In the bill is the authority for telewarrants. 
What is a telewarrant? 
I am speaking in the best interest of the safety of society. 
Are we to ignore that? 
What did she say? 
What did the supreme court judges say? 
They said the entry was legal. 
Yes, we will support this bill. 
We want to hear witnesses. 
We want to understand the fullness of the bill. 
The main thrust of the bill everyone will support. 
What does Madam Justice L'Heureux-Dube say about it? 
Let us apply that test to the Feeney case. 
What have we got?  
I stand with Madam Justice L'Heureux-Dube. 
She is expressing the common sense of the vast majority of Canadians.  
What did he do? 
This bill was designed over the summer. 
It has been introduced too late. 
It may not meet the deadline.  
What does that mean?  
That is a fair question. 
It is not there.  
We do not know. 
The police do not know. 
Is there a precedent? 
Is there a legal precedent that will guide them? 
We do not know.  
What about some of these other areas where tele-warrants are impossible? 
We are going to support this bill but we want it fleshed out. 
We want to hear those who support it. 
Those are some of my concerns. 
Those are some of my thoughts. 
The warning was clear yesterday that we must stand on guard over this particular issue.  
I could understand if they said it about the overall justice system. 
They have lost faith in our courts.  
What does that mean? 
They have lost faith in the decisions being made by our judges. 
To a large extent the old common law tools that they had are gone. 
That is why we are here debating this bill.  
This is the alarm bell which is ringing. 
We leave opened ended things like hot pursuit. 
This is what Stephen Bindman was talking about. 
Why leave it in doubt? 
Where do fresh and hot pursuit begin and end? 
We do not know. 
Do the police know? 
But they do not have that.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
I felt I have to point out this little fact.  
The bill attempts to clarify these rules.  
I wish to highlight the issues involved in this bill. 
What were the facts in this case? 
First of all, Mr. Feeney was suspected of murdering one Frank Boyle. 
Feeney was thus arrested without a warrant and evidence was seized. 
He was tried and found guilty of second degree murder. 
What were the applicable laws? 
First of all, there was the common law, on which our criminal law is based. 
This is an issue with which our courts were already familiar. 
Then, eleven years later, in 1986, came the Landry case. 
There are, therefore, two criteria: subjective and objective.  
There is not just common law, however. 
Now we have the charter of rights and freedoms. 
The party conducting the search must prove that it is reasonable. 
What did the court say in Feeney at the time? 
What effect did this have? 
It came as a bombshell as I said earlier. 
This is the subjective criterion. 
a) reasonable grounds to suspect-'' 
These are the exigent circumstances, as defined in the bill.  
This is the case of battering a door down.  
It is the case with regard to battering a door down.  
I will resume after oral question period. 
Mr. Speaker, you may proceed, and I will resume later on.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member will have approximately 25 minutes remaining. 
As it is now 11 o'clock, we will now proceed to statements by members.  
Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):
The list of achievements goes on.  
Sadly, during the rest of the year some do forget. 
They have not forgotten.  
Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):
It is a win for Winnipeg. 
It is a win for the Mint. 
It is a win for Canada. 
I thank the minister for his hard work in bringing this project to completion.  
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
The Sisters of the Holy Cross set up their first congregation in Ville-Saint-Laurent. 
Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau, Lib.):
Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, October marks the first ever national environmental illness month. 
Low cost, effective remedies exist. 
Through education, treatment and prevention these illnesses can be eliminated.  
It is everyone's right to be healthy. 
The connection between health and the environment should not go unrecognized.  
AND THE WINNER IS- 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the leadership horse race is about to begin.  
The Marlboro man has seen his leadership chances go up in smoke.  
Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga Centre, Lib.):
Banks have always considered small businesses extremely high risk. 
Consequently, established banks prefer the safe investment of large business. 
Small businesses, however, account for our most rapidly growing employment sector.  
Congratulations to Montreal, Royal and the National Bank of Canada. 
Mr. Maurice Godin (Chateauguay, BQ):
CANADIAN BUSHPLANE HERITAGE CENTRE 
Mr. Carmen Provenzano (Sault Ste. Marie, Lib.):
In fact, one well known newspaper columnist has named it the best museum in Canada.  
Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Coquihalla, Ref.):
This government is not at all shy about taxes. 
He says that the GST is a wonderful tax. 
Mr. Robert D. Nault (Kenora-Rainy River, Lib.):
By next year the budget will be balanced.  
It has created an environment for jobs. 
That is a record to be proud of. 
More important, jobs and hope are being restored to Canadians.  
Numbers are abstract, jobs are real. 
What a difference four years makes.  
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, gas company profits are up. 
Canadians are not happy when they are being gouged at the pumps. 
Hon. Sheila Finestone (Mount Royal, Lib.):
Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):
However, many fishermen are trying to stay afloat in the industry by fishing other species. 
One fishery that is being developed as a supplementary effort is our seal fishery.  
The federal government regulates the seal fishery. 
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Vaughan-King-Aurora, Lib.):
However restoring health to Canada's finances is not an end in itself. 
Your views are important to our committee. 
Let them be heard.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, you can check in Hansard . 
We just want an answer. 
That is why we have had to ask the question 50 times. 
It will take place 31 days from now. 
My question for the Prime Minister is this. 
What are those Liberal targets and how much are they going to cost Canadians?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Unlike the Reform Party, we will have a position. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Fraser Valley.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, here we go again. 
They are developing a position in secret. 
There has been no public discussion on it. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
What happened to the Reform principles? 
Have Reformers abandoned these principles? 
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
So I ask again, and please just give us an answer. 
How much is this Kyoto deal going to cost the average Canadian?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the fearmongering is being created here by the Reform Party. 
All Reformers are doing is talking about taxes. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
So my question for the government is this. 
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we are working on this as a team, unlike the Reform Party. 
Yes, the Reform members can ask questions. 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
The people who watch this are not stupid. 
They know a partisan evasion like that when they see one.  
On which side of the cabinet squabble does he stand?  
Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Two important figures clearly stand out in this dossier. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Our reform focuses on active return-to-work measures. 
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
A few weeks ago, anti-poverty groups gave a cry of alarm. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, our government is very aware of the poverty. 
I see and experience this poverty with my constituents.  
Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, let us take a specific example.  
Let us look at the case of Louise from Montreal. 
What is the minister's response to Louise's situation?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister for International Trade.  
The minister has been unwilling to give us a straight answer on this. 
Can he give us a straight answer on this today? 
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
We have sent packages to members of Parliament. 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
The minister talks about high standards and low standards. 
We want to know if he is seeking binding and enforceable. 
We want to know the answer to that question.  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
That is the wrong assumption.  
The question on the matter is that this is a negotiation with 29 countries. 
Canada is pushing for the highest standards. 
It is a situation that is evolving and we have to rally a consensus. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Sherbrooke.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Nothing new is on the table.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
That is what we are doing. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, 1995 is long before I became minister of defence. 
Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):
I remind the minister again, property was stolen and damaged. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. Minister of National Defence.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, they are really scraping the bottom of the barrel here. 
They are going back several years. 
CLOSING OF BC MINE 
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Tomorrow morning, 300 workers will be without jobs. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Odina Desrochers (Lotbiniere, BQ):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
It is a provincial initiative taken by the provinces. 
Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton-Strathcona, Ref.):
He made that commitment more than a month ago. 
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of International Trade.  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):
What does the minister intend to do to prevent England from following France's example?  
Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
We have been very forceful on this file.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Why has Taiwan been refused participation in this important economic summit?  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the statement of the hon. member is not accurate. 
Taiwan will be participating in the APEC conference.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, this government is coddling China. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have both an independent and an effective foreign policy. 
The key is to make it work.  
I take some exception to the hon. member's premise. 
I believe we will achieve success in that dialogue.  
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):
This is not the first time that I will have met with it.  
Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):
It is the application of the laws.  
This matter is also the subject of an appeal at the moment.  
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
That was over three years ago.  
Mrs. Claudette Bradshaw (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Cooperation, Lib.):
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, Canadians want accountability within the system. 
Mrs. Claudette Bradshaw (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Cooperation, Lib.):
Mr. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
The Canada pension plan is one important component of retirement income. 
Others are the old age pension and the GIS. 
They are both tied together and they are both scheduled for change.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thought the question was directed to my colleague in the finance department. 
Mr. Lorne Nystrom (Qu'Appelle, NDP):
The seniors benefit and the CPP are interlinked. 
The government wants to continue to try to abolish the universal old age pension. 
Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial Institutions), Lib.):
It is absolutely to the contrary, Mr. Speaker. 
Ninety per cent of single senior women will benefit under the package. 
It is one we are proud of. 
It is one that is sustainable.  
We feel it is a fair package. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
We are now facing an immediate stock crisis on both coasts. 
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
We have done that after talking with the fishing communities.  
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
Is the Department of Fisheries and Oceans now denying that responsibility?  
Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):
Conservation does remain a priority of the federal government in terms of the fishery. 
Mr. Bill Graham (Toronto Centre-Rosedale, Lib.):
Mrs. Claudette Bradshaw (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Cooperation, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, this is an unfortunate situation. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for West Nova.  
Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):
Mr. Speaker, this question has been addressed quite a number of times. 
I think the position of the government is well known.  
Mr. Ian Murray (Lanark-Carleton, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the network of centres of excellence is a unique Canadian development. 
Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, Bill C-68 is in a mess. 
Four provinces and two territories are challenging it in court. 
Four provincial governments are refusing to administer the firearms portion of it. 
Will the justice minister simply withdraw the firearms portion of the bill?  
The answer is no.  
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.  
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, we have provided funding for the people's summit. 
How they distribute the money is totally within their mandate and their jurisdiction.  
CLOSURE OF BC MINE 
Mr. Paul Crete (Kamouraska-Riviere-du-Loup-Temiscouata-Les Basques, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
I have not yet seen yesterday's letter. 
I will consider it when I receive it. 
They will see what sort of service they get.  
Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
It will provide additional powers to our customs officers.  
I am very proud of what the government has done.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
The minister has a responsibility regarding this fund.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We have a different and much more responsible approach.  
Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Douglas, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs. 
Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, once again the hon. member's information is wrong. 
We did not abstain. 
We in fact voted for the resolution on China. 
He should correct his history.  
We have raised questions on Tibet in Hong Kong. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
On that note, we will bring question period to a close.  
PRESENCE IN THE GALLERY 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
The two sides did talk about an improved POWA. 
The letter was addressed to the minister, who misled the House.  
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Yes, Mr. Speaker, this is going too far. 
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
That is another matter.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest:
Unanimous consent is being sought. 
On behalf of the members of my party, I offer that consent. 
That would be a complete contradiction.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Rimouski-Mitis is requesting unanimous consent to table a letter. 
Does the member have unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member may table the letter.  
Life will mean life.  
Mr. Speaker, I suggest that all questions be allowed to stand.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The House resumed consideration of the motion:
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
The hon. member for Charlesbourg has about 25 minutes left to finish his speech.  
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
I will continue the debate from where I left off before the brief interruption.  
There is a need for a thorough discussion of this aspect.  
That is the end of my statement.  
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
The government, of course, contends that it does. 
It is close to the deadline. 
This is one of those examples. 
The government has acted with Bill C-16. 
We do not have a full view of the future. 
That being said, we will support this legislation.  
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Many members have spoken concerning this bill. 
There are various perspectives that have significant bearing on the issue.  
Today we are looking at the government's response to the supreme court decision. 
Six months is certainly sufficient time to respond. 
All indications are that this will be moving to the justice committee this week. 
I am encouraged by that.  
That is why I raise the issue of delay. 
A suspension could be requested if required and there is precedent for this. 
It has happened in the past. 
I want to turn briefly to the bill and its objectives. 
What does this bill do and what should it do? 
Does Bill C-16 do all this? 
Does it accomplish this and can it be improved? 
Police officers are called upon daily to intervene in issues of domestic violence. 
Having said that, the principles that underscore the bill are sound. 
This information is not always available. 
This is something the bill does not address effectively.  
This I would suggest is a glaring omission. 
Without the resources it is really nothing more than lip service. 
There is some concern I have in that regard.  
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Dewdney-Alouette.  
It used to be that this placed made the law.  
He often left mere days to pass essential legislation. 
The second point concerns the bureaucracy we are placing upon police officers. 
This legislation at least makes provisions for telewarrants. 
Not all police officers will be smothered by paperwork. 
I would like to hear more evidence of how telewarrants work in practice.  
They quite likely may also have to obtain separate authorization to search those premises. 
Executing the warrant will likely provide notice of police interest toward that individual. 
It will provide notice that the accused should attempt to disappear in many cases. 
It places a heavy burden on all of us in this place.  
In conclusion, I have met with family members of the victim in the Feeney case. 
Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney-Alouette, Ref.):
That is simply not the case.  
The acid test for Canadians is the effectiveness of the justice system. 
In the Feeney case it is obvious that is not the case.  
The travesty here is that Feeney will walk in this case. 
We believe this test should be applicable in all cases.  
One of Olson's victims was a young man of 18. 
He told me about all he had been through. 
His son had been lost. 
His son had been taken from him. 
It has ruined his entire life. 
He is asking for changes to be made to the justice system.  
We cannot lose sight of victims. 
They would not have to relive that pain and anguish. 
It certainly is a sign that there is some trouble with our system.  
We support Bill C-16. 
We support our police. 
It was a terrible act, a heinous crime. 
The individual was convicted of first degree murder. 
He has been through the system to ask for changes. 
I do not see this as irrational. 
We apply the acid test to that case. 
What would we do if we were in Mr. McGillvary's case? 
We would be just as fearful. 
We ask who holds the keys to the criminal justice system. 
Who holds the keys for where he is going to be? 
We need a balance and the victims need to be remembered. 
Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member. 
I appreciated his remarks. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. colleague for Skeena for the question.  
Yes, I would say that there is a definite problem with the system. 
Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):
However, I do want to address a particular issue. 
It should not be a surprise. 
In the interests of brevity, I will get to the issue I want to discuss. 
The person must have been guilty or believed to be guilty of an indictable offence.  
It seems to have worked relatively well.  
I am wondering if the following scenario is proper. 
Let us say an individual is suspected of either a rape or a bank robbery. 
Three weeks later the victim spots the perpetrator. 
The person does not know his or her name but the perpetrator is spotted. 
We will have a chance to address it in due course. 
I am sure colleagues will co-operate as we address it. 
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
It is an isolated community.  
The question I want to ask is about the telewarrants. 
I am glad the member raised the question of warrants. 
People have lived for a long time in these areas. 
Mr. Speaker, the member raises a good question. 
The committee and the stakeholders will be consulting with the police community. 
Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Prevention is the underlying philosophy. 
We have funded a national campaign against family violence. 
Crime is not a simple issue. 
That is why that policy is doomed to fail.  
Let us move to why we are here today. 
It is the same right many people undertake when they wish to make their points. 
I think there is a general consensus in the House on that background.  
Our opponents may feel these claims are not strongly founded. 
Procedures will now be clear. 
We have provided for that. 
For that I am truly thankful.  
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the parliamentary secretary for his comments. 
I have a question that relates directly to Mr. Feeney and the evidence.  
The blood is on his hands. 
Justice is not being served. 
Mr. Speaker, the questions brought forward by the hon. member are sound. 
I think the recommendations are worth while.  
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a question for the hon. member.  
We need to reverse that. 
Does the hon. member have any suggestions on how we might change that?  
Obviously I am not a lawyer and I am not legally trained. 
At the moment I have no instant answers for the member.  
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
I also want to comment on some of the statements made by members opposite.  
It is in committee that we have to address these other issues.  
My experience is that committees are not always open to suggestions. 
I use as an example alternative sentencing. 
Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to say a few things in general on this bill. 
It is very important that we have a justice system that responds to that need.  
We very strongly urge the government to take action. 
Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I would like to say a few words. 
There has been a travesty of justice. 
In this instance the rules have not served justice. 
In this instance it has been. 
We have to go beyond keeping rules. 
We have to keep in mind what is right.  
Justice must be served. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the House ready for the question?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?  
Mr. Bob Kilger (Stormont-Dundas, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
They are proud of the country in which we live. 
However, most of them would agree that the status quo is not acceptable. 
We cannot keep on doing things the way we have always done them. 
Open government means a free flow of information between government and its citizens. 
It means government informs the public, rather than manipulating them. 
We recently witnessed a perfect example of this sort of behaviour. 
It really points to exactly what the bill is all about.  
I will give a bit of background. 
This issue relates to the harmonization of the GST and provincial taxes. 
This was paid for by the Canadian taxpayer. 
The minister then requested that the information be made public.  
This blockage continued for 18 months. 
What did they contain that was so injurious? 
I will quote from the actual poll results: 
Those have just not happened.  
Let us examine the Treasury Board changes which I can go through item by item. 
There are seven major items. 
I can provide that information to anyone who wants it. 
That does not go with the promise by the Liberals of an open government. 
That is the major part of the bill. 
Those are the reasons behind it. 
Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):
The motion before the House today is quite interesting. 
This is fundamental to democracy.  
We all know the role opinion polls play in our society. 
They play an important, some say too important, role. 
It uses them to identify the fears and concerns of Quebeckers. 
That is utterly unacceptable.>These 
We are proud of this. 
What has happened since the Quebec referendum? 
It is perfectly normal for Quebeckers to know what they are paying for. 
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
This is an interesting debate. 
Our caucus is certainly supportive of change in this area. 
We also recognize and realize that we live in the real world. 
This private members' bill seems pretty utopian in its outlook. 
The leader of the official opposition is clearly a student of political history. 
When Peter Lougheed came into Alberta, the Social Credit Party disappeared. 
That is not the way we do it in our caucus and our party. 
In 1993 the Government of Saskatchewan introduced some significant reforms. 
But I could well be mistaken and that is precisely what worries me.  
Now, what would be the effect of Bill C-217? 
This would appear, in my opinion, to be overkill.  
A good proportion of this research would be very limited public interest.  
I am not sure that this amendment would fix a significant problem.  
It is my understanding that the act already provides for access to public opinion polls. 
That is not to say that the issue does not require examination. 
I do not believe there is a need for Bill C-217. 
There is case law which provides guidance to the government on disclosing such polls. 
There is a government policy on disclosing poll results.  
Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo-Alberni, Ref.):
If a poll is commissioned by public money, then there should be public access. 
It is very simple.  
The key issue here is manipulation. 
That is what we are trying to avoid.  
Members of this House, regardless of their political stripe, must agree that this is wrong. 
We want to have free access right across the board. 
There is nothing clandestine about it. 
We are asking for open government. 
This type of thing is creating cynicism among Canadians. 
They do not hold this place in esteem. 
Canadians pay their taxes. 
However, we are not allowed to discover that.  
This government is unwilling to change. 
At the latest count there are four. 
The government also has two bills relating to this subject. 
On both sides of the House there are concerns regarding access to information.  
I believe this to be a very good bill. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
There is not unanimous consent.  
That was in 1994. 
How long can they keep saying that? 
Going into the 21st century it is still going to be under review. 
The government talks the talk. 
Some of the opposition parties talk the talk. 
I do not feel we have moved very far. 
There is nothing wrong with that. 
There were political reasons. 
I see this as a very negative point. 
In conclusion, that is the reason we came down here. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
(The House adjourned at 2.10 p.m.)
