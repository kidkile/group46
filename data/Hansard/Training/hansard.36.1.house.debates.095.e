COLLEGE SAINTE-ANNE IN LACHINE 
Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grace-Lachine, Lib.):
Congratulations to College Sainte-Anne of Lachine, which- 
VICTIMS BILL OF RIGHTS 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
Once again, however, the Liberal government did nothing. 
Is a person's right to know what their rights are rhetoric? 
Is the right to know when plea bargaining is taking place rhetoric?  
I am ashamed to be involved with those who say one thing and do nothing.  
INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FIREFIGHTERS 
Mrs. Judi Longfield (Whitby-Ajax, Lib.):
I support these requests.  
I urge it to implement- 
The hon. member for Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies.  
Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Anjou-Riviere-des-Prairies, Lib.):
This consensus is shared by all levels of government, industry and labour in Canada. 
Mr. Reginald Belair (Timmins-James Bay, Lib.):
This means new jobs and economic opportunities for the area.  
Exploration expenditures are up to $43 million. 
We must never forget- 
The hon. member for Lethbridge.  
Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):
Are we not just as deserving of compensation?  
She ends by saying: 
Are politics and dollars worth more than people and lives?  
Shame on the health minister. 
Mr. David Iftody (Provencher, Lib.):
This is about people who are suffering. 
MEMBER FOR YORK SOUTH-WESTON 
Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):
We know where the independent member stands on these points.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):
MEMBER FOR YORK SOUTH-WESTON 
Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):
The independent member can go whichever way the wind blows, if he so chooses. 
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg-Transcona, NDP):
Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):
I find this remark absolutely shocking and to top it all it is not true. 
In modern society fathers also take care of children.  
They are unworthy of a member of this House.  
MEMBER FOR YORK SOUTH-WESTON 
Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):
Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):
Today Israel is a diverse, vibrant and modern democracy. 
With all their differences they make the desert bloom and democracy work.  
Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):
Mrs. Karen Redman (Kitchener Centre, Lib.):
May Court provides a valuable community service. 
The hon. member for Souris-Moose Mountain.  
Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris-Moose Mountain, Ref.):
Mr. Hec Clouthier (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, Lib.):
Do I need to remind him of the human toll? 
I cannot accept this type of cheap politics. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I hope the Prime Minister is proud of himself today. 
Let us look at what he has done.  
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Was it worth it?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister misses the point as usual.  
Let us consider the situation of the MP for St. Paul's. 
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Apparently the Prime Minister achieved what he wanted to achieve. 
The Prime Minister must be- 
I am sure we all want to hear both the questions and the answers. 
I go back to the hon. Leader of the Opposition.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, an agreement was made with all the provincial governments of Canada. 
But this, in my opinion, is not a political issue. 
This isn't Saskatchewan's opinion only. 
The hon. member for Macleod.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
He did not go out and say he was sorry to the victims. 
He did not even face them. 
He snuck out the side door. 
Then he said ``This file is closed''. 
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
All the ministers of health are facing the same problem. 
The hon. member for Macleod.  
Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):
My question is for the Prime Minister. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
There are therefore very serious consequences.  
That is what a responsible government does.  
The hon. leader of the Bloc Quebecois.  
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
That is something the sports magnates did not talk about.  
That is a political choice. 
That is a socially responsible choice.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is also for the Prime Minister.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Mitis, BQ):
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
The NDP government refused to permit a free vote in that exercise.  
Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):
Hepatitis C victims do not want false hope.  
The hon. Minister of Health.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We have offered compensation to people infected during that period. 
That is the right approach. 
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
We are addressing it and we are working very hard. 
When we are ready we will be making an announcement.  
Mr. Bill Matthews (Burin-St. 
Mr. Speaker, the minister of HRDC should have been ready. 
You have known for three years that this problem was coming to a head.  
Mr. Speaker, the minister should have known.  
The minister has all the control. 
Will he do the honourable thing? 
Because of his gross mismanagement- 
The right hon. Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister chose the vote over the victims.  
I will never forget that young boy up in the gallery. 
I never will forget that 15-year old boy, Joey Hache. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
I will never forget that they want to cut in this case- 
The hon. member for Edmonton North.  
Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):
They would be ashamed to see the behaviour of the government right now. 
Does he want them to just go away?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
It is not what the Reform Party would like to do. 
At the time of retirement they will want to have a pension. 
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
I too have a question. 
Will Lucien Bouchard and Jean Rochon allow a free vote on this motion?  
Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, they should be the ones paying compensation, not the National Assembly. 
They are the ones with the money. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
I ask him to prove his claim. 
Table the documents in this House that show how many are infected.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
The problem is credibility. 
Canadians remember that it is the party that would gut medicare. 
Canadians know that they are the members who would eliminate the Canada pension plan. 
They know if the Reform Party were in power, the victims would get nothing.  
Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I think the minister should read the newspaper. 
Will he put up and shut up?  
Let us quiet down a bit. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will go half way. 
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
The hon. member for Repentigny.  
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, now I can reply to the secrecy charge. 
The hon. member for Fraser Valley.  
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
He has been using figures as high as 60,000. 
Let him show how many hep C victims really deserve that.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, he said he would put up. 
I take it that means he is going to put up the documents. 
He said he would come half way. 
We take the minister at his word on this one, I think.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has not kept his part of the bargain.  
We proceeded on good information in developing this policy.  
Mr. Rene Laurin (Joliette, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Finance.  
The auditor general was very critical of National Defence. 
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
We learn lessons from all these. 
Mr. Claude Drouin (Beauce, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.  
Hon. Sheila Copps (Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
This Canadian francophone college is called College Boreal. 
It too will be in French, here in Canada.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We intend to respect both these responsibilities.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, nobody in the House disagrees that this is a difficult decision. 
The hon. Minister of Health.  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
The minister just said he is prepared to put up. 
I want to know from him what he is prepared to put up. 
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
That surely is the first and most important responsibility of government. 
ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
At that time it was still under investigation.  
Mr. Andre Bachand (Richmond-Arthabaska, PC):
Can the minister still deny his office's involvement? 
Can the House have the real answer this time?  
The case is closed.  
Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
What is Canada doing to ensure it meets the commitment we made in Kyoto?  
Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of the Environment, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
The public does not trust him. 
We do not believe his statistics. 
This minister has lost the confidence of the House. 
He has lost the confidence of the Canadian people.  
There is only one question left to ask him. 
When will he tender his resignation as Minister of Health?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We have confidence in the Minister of Health. 
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  
And under what criteria?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):

Mr. John Cummins (Delta-South Richmond, Ref.):
I would like to know when I can expect an answer. 
I can understand why the minister is reluctant to respond to the question. 
He is again reluctant to answer this very important question.  
We need an answer to the question. 
We want it now. 
We are getting stonewalled on it time after time.  
I ask, Mr. Speaker, that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.

COSTAL FISHERIES PROTECTION ACT 
The agreement was ready for signing in New York on December 4, 1995.  
Both types of stocks have been overfished in the high seas.  
I quote from that report: 
Marine catches subsequently declined as a result of significant overexploitation. 
Another cause is the failure to take the precautionary approach to resource management. 
The agreement will come into force once the required 30 states have ratified it. 
These states will therefore help develop a new legal framework for high sea fisheries. 
A word on the history of Canadian involvement. 
It was not always so. 
I would like to say a few words about the 200 mile limit and NAFO.  
Canada was not the only state to take such action. 
Other coastal states also declared a 200-mile limit. 
I would like to cite two important articles of that convention.  
Then another problem arose. 
At that time we began a major Canadian conservation campaign. 
That draft document basically included the Santiago text, to which I just referred.  
Those actions included fines and removal from the registry.  
Canada had participated actively in negotiating the FAO agreement. 
The agreement required acceptance by 25 nations to come into force. 
So far, 10 acceptances have been received.  
Parliament passed new legislation. 
Their findings were surprising. 
A still greater reduction was detected in the number of large fish. 
Greenland halibut cannot reproduce before they are at least ten years old.  
I now come to the 1995 turbot dispute. 
At a special meeting held from January 30 to February 1, 1995- 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is the hon. member calling for a quorum count?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Do we have a quorum?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
We have a quorum. 
The hon. Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity of getting my voice back.  
These decisions divided the total allowable catch in this way:
However, that was not enough to save the stocks of turbot.  
Hon. members know what happened next. 
September 1995 marked another important step. 
All participants agreed to implement the cautious approach to fisheries management. 
They agreed to manage resources with respect for ecosystems. 
They agreed to restore resources in order to attain optimum yields. 
They agreed to work together in fisheries sciences. 
This arrangement must be renewed in the year 2005. 
This is vital to continue the process of rebuilding these resources. 
Recovery of that stock is good news for Canadian fishers. 
The amendments will enable Canada to implement new high seas enforcement provisions. 
I think there are many good reasons for us to ratify this agreement. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
What is the minister's response to them? 
Why are we going to ratify the UN fisheries agreement, UNFA?  
We are going to talk about this at length.  
I will try to put this in terms they will understand.  
I am going to criticize this legislation because it does not do that. 
Let us go back a little and look at exactly what this legislation does.  
I think there are 16 or 17 countries to date that will have ratified that.  
This is really going to do nothing for a long time. 
We are years away from this ever taking effect. 
Nothing ever became of it. 
Brian Tobin was the minister at the time. 
In fact this is not going to do that. 
It will not be able to enforce it.  
Let us go to the bill. 
There are two sections that are quite troublesome.  
Section 16.2(1) says: 
If we have a Spanish vessel out there in violation, he has to inform Spain.  
Section 16.2(2) says: 
Let us say he gets permission of the flag state. 
Then section 7.01(1) comes into play: 
Let us go back to March 1995. 
This is the scene our fisheries officers were up against.  
It was the other shot that was heard around the world. 
Our enforcement people went to take control of that vessel. 
We were engaging in an ``act of war'', as the book goes on to tell. 
We had the right to do so. 
We had the laws at that time to suggest that we could go out. 
They boarded the vessel and brought the vessel back to port. 
I agree that we do need some international agreements. 
What would happen today is our control boats would go out. 
Their observations would be that the Estai was fishing illegally. 
It took four hours of hot pursuit. 
We would never see it again. 
We would never be able to follow it up.  
We have taken the teeth out of it. 
I find it unbelievable.  
They are listening today. 
We travelled to Newfoundland and we heard these concerns. 
They want somebody to stand up and fight for the fishermen out there.  
We heard the minister for about 40 minutes today. 
He went over a chronology of all the great things. 
I have never seen such a dismal failure.  
There is no confidence from the fishermen. 
There is no confidence from the people of Newfoundland. 
I do not blame them. 
We have heard this over and over again in committee. 
We have heard evidence from scientists who were ordered to be silenced.  
Imagine that a police officer sees a young person committing a crime. 
Bill C-96 died on the Order Paper last April. 
It is exactly the same. 
Let us get to the sections I am talking about. 
This is the same government. 
This enabling legislation is for that very same agreement.  
At that time the current Minister of Veterans Affairs was the minister. 
They are just saying that they can board it. 
Then it goes on to the placing of arrests: 
The minister retains control.  
The government has taken all the teeth out of it. 
They have to ask for permission. 
How long is that going to take? 
Is it really practical?  
The government could actually do something.  
He has been the minister for almost a year. 
Our fisheries on both coasts are in a state of crisis. 
The Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans has tabled reports. 
I can read some of the recommendations. 
I agree that foreign overfishing is a problem. 
We made nine specific recommendations.  
We heard all of these concerns. 
I could read the entire report. 
It is not adopting it.  
The first agreement was back in 1982. 
This is a disgrace. 
There are so many problems out there, starting with the foreign nations. 
An example is tuna. 
One fish is worth $30,000.  
That is what the fishing community is asking for. 
I would ask the government to look at issues like this one.  
This is trying to put the interest of the fishery first.  
This report was written by 16 members of parliament. 
It is absolutely wrong.  
We have to do something about that before we can support the legislation. 
We have to amend it.  
The government has to do a lot more. 
The government has gone against its word. 
It has not come through. 
It is absolutely terrible.  
With respect to the agreement let us go off on another vein. 
What was negotiated was straddling stocks and highly migratory species. 
However the legislation is silent with respect to that.  
I will go out on a limb. 
British Columbia was put somewhere on the back burner.  
Salmon are considered an andromous species. 
The act only applies to highly migratory species and straddling stocks. 
The agreement is silent on that.  
We saw the frustrations last time. 
He worked very hard. 
We have a new negotiator. 
We are back to square one. 
Where is the minister on that? 
I did not hear one word from him on that.  
These definitions were arrived at in the conference on straddling stocks.  
The UN fisheries agreement does not apply to salmon. 
Where is the minister? 
They want something done and the government is not doing anything.  
I ask the minister to start doing something in these other areas. 
First, it has no teeth. 
Is that the best he can do?  
That is what he is telling the Americans when he goes there.  
I have met with these fishermen. 
Fishermen want to go to work. 
That is what they have been telling us. 
We need to move the management of the resource out to the coast. 
We have to instil confidence in DFO. 
We have to get rid of the politicization. 
We have to get rid of the corruption. 
These are all things the people of Newfoundland want to do. 
Why are we not investing in the infrastructure? 
Why are we not finding some way to put these guys back to work? 
Bill C-27 is what we have. 
They are very frustrated. 
There is no confidence in the government.  
Sixteen members of parliament from five political parties are in agreement. 
We have witnessed that in last few days. 
There are good recommendations in there that look at foreign overfishing. 
The minister is just brushing it off.  
I ask the government to take a hard look at the report. 
We need international agreements. 
I am in full support of that. 
However we have to go a long way before we solve the fishing crisis. 
This is not a drop in the bucket.  
I ask the minister to listen to what I have said. 
BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
COMMITTEES OF THE HOUSE 
NATURAL RESOURCES AND GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there unanimous consent for the motion?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is that agreed to?  
COASTAL FISHERIES PROTECTION ACT 
Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure-Gaspe-Iles-de-la-Madeleine-Pabok, BQ):
I will give one example of what is going on in Newfoundland today. 
However, does that really solve their problem?  
However, I should also describe its intent. 
There were no treaties or arrangements between countries. 
I would first like to say that no one opposes the principle. 
The government decided to establish these measures by order-in-council. 
In other words, cabinet decided behind closed doors.  
What is Canada's management policy? 
What does it have as a management policy?  
A strategy implies having an active tool, but is it the case?  
At least, Mr. Tobin had the political courage to give a figure. 
What has happened to that debate? 
Worse still, I do not think it has even started working on the issue. 
This is very serious.  
The Bloc Quebecois does make criticism, but it is constructive criticism. 
My colleague from the Reform Party alluded to it earlier.  
The report includes unanimous recommendations. 
Many members opposite refuse to believe or to hear this.  
We did not blame any one party in particular. 
Why do we not discuss it? 
That is the main point.  
There are lots of avenues to explore.  
I have a lot to say, but I am afraid of running out of time. 
Time is rushing past.  
What are we going to do to get around this? 
Madam Speaker, I would like to call for quorum. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
And the bells having rung: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I indicated my sources with respect to the public.  
We will look at the specific purpose of the bill. 
Does it help us provide better protection for our straddling stocks? 
Bill C-29 already does that. 
That is something he could do. 
It would have a direct, immediate impact. 
This would put bread and butter on the table for many families.  
Life in the regions follows the seasons. 
When the ice starts to melt, it is time to go fishing. 
So, what is the minister waiting for?  
It is fair to say that there is no crab fishery plan. 
What is the minister waiting for to look into it? 
Canada has not yet developed its own policy, as I said earlier.  
What is the department's or the minister's opinion on this? 
Most of all, what is the industry's opinion? 
What is the meaning of this? 
Did anyone ask the industry what this represents? 
This can be interesting.  
It could sign it directly, I tell you. 
Still under ``general principles'', I have another little question. 
It will be a good exercise at the same time. 
Here is another good question. 
So, we no longer have offshore or midshore fishers. 
What is Canada's position on this issue? 
What is the industry's attitude? 
What will fishers think? 
What will the processors who will receive the resource think? 
There is an impact, but we do not talk about it.  
We are told ``Pass this bill and all our problems will be solved. 
That is how we managed to stop that Spanish boat, the Estai ''. 
This has already been done with Bill C-29. 
The minister does not know what he wants.  
These questions will have to be answered. 
We still do not know what this implies.  
Someone must be in charge. 
Processing, once the fish is landed, is a provincial matter. 
There is an impact on the provinces. 
He knows a lot of people are involved. 
This is the sort of debate we need. 
It is their only recourse. 
They say they have no choice.  
That is the start and that is what needs to be done. 
Tomorrow morning I will be back and will carry on. 
That will give us enough to go ahead with. 
I am all for decentralization to the provinces. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
I confess I am not a lawyer. 
In some circles that would be seen as a bonus. 
However, we will leave that one where it sits. 
What was the situation? 
This is a very difficult case. 
I am not trying to tack on to this sentencing by this judge. 
I am not trying to make a mountain out of a mole hill. 
I am simply saying that the judge was right. 
This is as good an indicator as any. 
I read from a news report at the time: 
However, as private members we are thwarted by the system within the House. 
The bill then goes into a lottery. 
I have three bills in this hopper at this time. 
There is a tremendous amount of pressure on the committee. 
That is my direction.  
I ask for unanimous consent.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
This bill has only one clause. 
It is this last limitation which the hon. member proposes parliament remove from the section. 
Section 732.2(1) 
describes when a probation order comes into force: 
A probation order comes into force 
a) on the date on which the order is made; 
Section 732.2(2) 
Section 732.1(2) 
provides a list of optional conditions.  
It might be useful for hon. members to be reminded of some of these conditions: 
(i) the consumption of alcohol or other intoxicating substances, or 
(ii) the consumption of drugs except in accordance with a medical prescription; 
(d) abstain from owning, possessing or carrying a weapon; 
(e) provide for the support or care of dependants; 
I will have more to say about that later.  
Let me give two examples of the span of control that probation can provide. 
There is no federal probation service.  
There are many more. 
Then there is the escorted temporary absence. 
The institutional head may authorize an escorted temporary absence. 
Then there is parole. 
This is followed by statutory release. 
Correctional Service Canada provides the supervision.  
Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney-Victoria, NDP):
I commend him for that.  
I am glad to hear him recognize how busy the justice committee is. 
There is a difference. 
They are all calculations made in the sentencing process.  
The member for Kootenay-Columbia said he is not a lawyer. 
He is, in fact, a lawmaker. 
Those of us who practise law on a regular basis are familiar with them. 
I think that is in favour of the legislation proposed.  
The system is not simply restricted to sentencing him to time.  
This bill will give the judge the option. 
There are some problems with it. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
That may be partly true but at times there are simple answers. 
I will not go into detail on that.  
They would have potentially heard a trial and made rulings of fact. 
I would like to commend the hon. member as well. 
This is a unique and straightforward bill he is bringing before the House.  
I am not going to get into the details of that.  
It is important to note that this bill gives judges more discretion. 
I was interested by his response.  
The director felt that it was not necessary. 
Again I hearken back to my earlier remarks. 
I want to refer quickly to a couple of cases. 
These are factual cases before the committee.  
One involves an individual by the name of Raymond Russell who was a convicted killer. 
We should embrace it.  
There are times when the law could be made simpler. 
It could be made more user friendly. 
He was on parole at the time he committed these heinous crimes. 
Prior to his release the National Parole Board had granted him day parole. 
It highlights again the need for appropriate conditions to be in place. 
Those types of conditions could be diagnosed. 
Perhaps I am using that word inappropriately.  
I am encouraged that all members have spoken favourably on it.  
On behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party, we support this legislation.  
Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):
That is the way it should remain.  
Frankly what would be the point if it is going to confuse the issues?  
There are many more I could give. 
Then there is parole. 
Day parole is normally granted up to a maximum of six months. 
It is the culmination of an offender's gradual structured and controlled release program. 
Next there is statutory release. 
However, not all inmates are entitled to statutory release.  
Correctional Service Canada provides the supervision in these cases.  
Mr. John Maloney (Erie-Lincoln, Lib.):
I compliment this member of the bench for coming forward with constructive comments.  
They are the ones who should also influence probation decisions and conditions.  
It effectively granted discretion to the judiciary. 
What alternatives will be available? 
Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay-Columbia, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it has been interesting to listen to government members today. 
They have talked about this bill in terms of release mechanisms for offenders. 
That was also reflected in the words of the Progressive Conservative member.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
Is there unanimous consent?  
That is all that I have to say.  
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
MULTILATERAL AGREEMENT ON INVESTMENT 
Ms. Louise Hardy (Yukon, NDP):
The Canadian economy has always been global. 
That has never been a question. 
Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for International Trade, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the concern expressed by my colleague across the way. 
My friend should understand that interaction between two countries goes both ways. 
It is a complete two way street.  
My friend talked about consultation. 
In other words this process was initiated by my minister. 
It is well under way. 
The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):
A motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
(The House adjourned at 6.32 p.m.)
