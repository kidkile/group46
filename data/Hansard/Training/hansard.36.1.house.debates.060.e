EDITED HANSARD * NUMBER 60 
Monday, February 16, 1998 
The House met at 11 a.m. 
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC) moved: 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
I am afraid that you have 15 minutes to start with. 
Is that your wish?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
This trade barrier is disguised as a plant protection measure. 
First let me give a summary of the pinewood nematode. 
This information was supplied to the European Union by the Plant Health Committee of Canada.  
The survey was designed to survey the worse case scenario. 
Therefore the survey results had no statistical validity. 
This amounts to an excess of $700 million in trade. 
This brings us to 1997. 
I urge the Canadian government not to give up on this critical issue. 
It has certainly allowed the American market to replace our traditional European market. 
There is still a demand for softwood lumber in Europe. 
Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):
This sector is of vital importance to the Canadian economy. 
In addition, Canada ranks first in the world in terms of forest products exports. 
The Government of Canada wants to help them rise to this challenge.  
Even so, barriers to trade remain. 
That is also the case on the other side of the Atlantic in Europe.  
The work is demanding and time consuming. 
There are no quick and easy answers to these types of issues. 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from South Shore for bringing the motion forward. 
However I would like to bring this debate to the larger picture.  
I thank my hon. friend opposite for his comments. 
He advised us that a study is under way.  
I believe the House is aware of those trade barriers.  
We are moving toward globalized trade. 
Trade barriers are coming down. 
However it may not be that way all the time. 
I am not sure of the answer.  
British Columbia produces a majority of softwood lumber. 
Does this ban also apply there? 
Mr. Benoit Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):
This is, therefore, a market of some $11 million. 
In the Canadian lumber industry, that is a small market. 
The problem, or the query, from the European Community concerns grub larvae. 
We are told, for example, that there is scientific proof. 
We were also told there was scientific proof on asbestos. 
Canada must get involved, as the parliamentary secretary has said. 
We have had no response to this report from the subcommittee. 
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
The Canadian forest industry is one of the most dynamic industries in the country. 
It generates $58.7 billion in revenues every year. 
Protecting Canadian interests is an integral part of this mandate.  
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):
I want to state this once again. 
I will deal with the lumber issue in a minute. 
Christmas trees are a separate issue. 
I am in agreement that the government has instigated a study. 
They feel there is definitely something we should be doing here. 
There are a couple of things we need to understand. 
There is a big difference between heat treating and kiln drying. 
It is much more expensive. 
There is no comparison in the two processes. 
There is no certification of heat. 
There is nothing else there. 
It is strictly a certification of moisture content.  
It has not proven to us that it does not already have the problem. 
If it does, it is not a foreign pest. 
Look at our history of trade with Europe. 
We have exported Christmas trees to Europe for 75 years. 
All of a sudden the door closed. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Does the hon. member have the unanimous consent of the House?  
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West-Nepean, Lib.):
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Is there unanimous consent to suspend the sitting of the House until 12 noon?  
(The sitting of the House was suspended at 11.54 a.m.) 
The House resumed at 12.00 p.m. 
SMALL BUSINESS LOANS ACT 
Small businesses play a vital role in Canada's economy. 
It is for this very reason that the small business loans program exists.  
Virtually all small businesses are eligible to borrow under this program. 
It would extend the SBLA by one year, and would increase the total loan envelope.  
Certainly there is room for additional improvements. 
That is what the review process is all about. 
Those are the sort of questions being asked in the review that is under way. 
However the SBLA is unique. 
Thus it enables the vast majority of SMEs to have access to fixed asset financing. 
That program bears no resemblance to a small business subsidy program. 
Moreover the success rate of the program is quite high. 
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
These changes were introduced to move the SBLA toward full cost recovery. 
The answer to these questions is no.  
Government spending programs do little to create employment. 
The problem is the Liberals simply accept job projections as actual jobs created.  
However, the actual number of jobs created is probably closer to 14,000. 
The auditor general has a great deal more criticism for this program. 
These firms would have received loans from their financial institutions anyway.  
Canadians are fed up with tax and spend governments. 
The minister himself does not even have this information. 
That is why we see such a damning report from the auditor general.  
Why was this review not done earlier? 
I will tell members what he has been doing. 
Unfortunately it is the taxpayer who ends up on the hook for this Liberal complacency.  
They would be asking the finance minister for $1 billion in tax relief.  
It is because the finance minister uses this fund to reduce the deficit. 
Steadily increasing taxes are leaving small businesses with no retained earnings. 
All their funds are going to Ottawa. 
Retained earnings are essential for small businesses to grow.  
The Liberal answer to questions on job creation was more government spending programs. 
Government does not create jobs. 
Redistribution of wealth does not create jobs. 
That encourages spending and prompts firms to hire more employees. 
That is how to lower unemployment.  
It has passed up opportunities to cut taxes. 
Small businesses know that Reform is on their side. 
Accordingly the Reform Party does not support Bill C-21.  
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
The Canadian Small Business Loans Act dates from 1971. 
However, we have many criticisms of it. 
It is not in the business of lending money.  
We readily agree with this objective. 
It is not a matter of life or death. 
I will get back to this, but let me first continue. 
Often, owners of businesses put everything they have into getting a business started. 
The auditor general continues. 
This matter must be looked into, most definitely, as the auditor general says.  
The auditor general reiterated his interest in this question further on.  
What did the auditor general recommend further? 
The auditor general proposes an optimum design for the program. 
This is not a significant proportion. 
The auditor general does indeed ask very important questions. 
These owners pay themselves a smaller salary. 
They risk losing everything they own. 
They work long hours. 
They have a great deal of difficulty obtaining credit. 
The Privy Council is concerned about Canada's low productivity. 
That is one hypothesis.  
What does that tell us? 
I am thinking of my colleagues' concerns for what this would cost the government. 
That is just small potatoes compared to some.  
Let us not forget the role played by banks in bankruptcies. 
This assessment was based on an annual survey. 
This would provide a more accurate picture.  
We were told that these were young businesses, that they were not fully prepared. 
The fact is that, to start a business, one must be very tenacious. 
It is normal to be tenacious and to be prepared. 
They get management advice.  
It is a start. 
The minister should have thought about it before. 
The minister knew the auditor general was reviewing the SMEs. 
SMEs must have access to loans. 
We were also told that in Quebec, at least, things were moving very fast. 
The solidarity fund is well established. 
The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
It is the small and medium size business sector which is driving the Canadian economy. 
Our economy is becoming increasingly globalized. 
Our economy is increasingly affected by competition from overseas.  
The community in which that business operates is ignored in terms of its interest. 
I will come to some of the concerns in a moment. 
It is a program which has proven to be successful and useful to small business.  
I think that would be another way in which the government might assist.  
We are still wrestling with the GST and so on. 
None of those things are useful as elements of this debate. 
We will be supporting the legislation. 
Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
We extend the act for a year. 
We review it in the standing committee. 
I ask the member for his comments.  
I appreciate that has not always been the case.  
We have seen programs galore which actually make matters worse. 
After all, they make profits out of us. 
It is their responsibility to do that. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
It comes as no surprise the government has not decided what to do. 
It has forgotten about the promises it made in the 1993 red book.  
The government often claims to be an advocate and supporter of small business. 
I am not alone in my views. 
I will refer to these documents often during my remarks.  
They are the heart of economic activity and community development. 
In addition they sometimes develop into the large firms of the future. 
Small businesses contribute 43% of Canada's private sector economic output.  
Those are the words of the auditor general, not mine.  
The government could benefit from the old adage that what gets measured gets done. 
The origin of this act dates back to 1961. 
Things have changed since the retail shop and the light manufacturing era. 
The Canadian economy today has greatly evolved since that time. 
These are critical indicators that most SMEs employ within their own operations.  
I would like to ask the government what is the average size loan it guarantees. 
The SBLA is a good program. 
A bigger program does not always make for a better program. 
Bigger programs often make for worse programs. 
A bigger program would not be as responsive. 
The government has a duty to the taxpayer to be able to provide this function. 
Overall economic trends need to be factored into such analysis.  
Canada pension plan premiums have been increased substantially. 
There are other initiatives that must come forth as well. 
Canadians are poorer than they have been in 15 years. 
Disposable income has gone down drastically over the past two decades. 
Canadians need disposable income.  
That would take two million Canadians off the tax rolls overnight. 
Those two million Canadians should not have been there in the first place.  
Canadians need more disposable income. 
They need lower payroll taxes. 
We do support Bill C-21. 
We have made some recommendations which we would like the government to carry forth. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I have been listening to the hon. member. 
I think we all agree that small businesses create jobs in this country. 
The Reform Party is pro small business. 
We know that 98% of businesses in the country are small businesses.  
I remember a short story. 
It is very difficult for small businesses to thrive in this environment. 
He said it is easy. 
That is the kind of situation we are facing in this country. 
Job killing taxes are hard on businesses.  
Why would Canadians support this bill?  
Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
Small and medium enterprises do need access to capital. 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
I detected in his speech some changes from the Mulroney years. 
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Madam Speaker, I would like to correct the hon. member. 
Therefore the hon. member is mistaken.  
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Interest rates are affordable and inflation is also at a very low level.  
Yet it is these very firms which create so many of Canada's jobs.  
All loans are registered with the SBLA administration office of Industry Canada.  
Let me emphasize that the program is not a subsidization of business. 
In 1995 Parliament made changes to the act that moved it toward cost recovery. 
By passing this bill the House will be helping to do just that. 
My colleague, you still have two minutes left in your speaking time. 
Mr. Bryon Wilfert (Oak Ridges, Lib.):
We thank Elvis for persevering and personifying the true Olympic spirit. 
Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills-Grasslands, Ref.):
First, we could give the Trans-Canada highway to Bombardier. 
Then there would be no limit to the availability of federal funding. 
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
ANNIVERSARY OF CHEVALIER DE LORIMIER'S DEATH 
Mr. Stephane Bergeron (Vercheres, BQ):
The night before he was hanged, de Lorimier wrote: 
My friends and my children will see better days; they will know freedom. 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Mr. Mauril Belanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):
Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary-Nose Hill, Ref.):
Instead, they demand real tax relief on February 24.  
Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, today is Heritage Day.  
Canadians know that our nation's diversity is our nation's strength. 
But for all Canadians, our tremendous and unwaivering pride in Canada is the same.  
If we were born here, we inherited it. 
REFERENCE TO SUPREME COURT 
Mr. Paul Mercier (Terrebonne-Blainville, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, here is a poem on the reference to the Supreme Court: 
Nine justices speaking as oracles all, 
In answering as one to Jean Chret-i-en's call, 
Will decide if the Constitution doth give 
Us the right to depart this old country, to leave.  
No doubt, they will tell us with faces not bright, 
That to break with the past, we have no such a right, 
That while freedom at last is the call we might sound, 
Such action cannot in their papers be found.  
And so as will tell us these justices all, 
While most of us wish to give heed to the call 
To freedom for all in this country so right, 
We must hasten away and go off fly a kite.  
Dear Justices there is no need for such fuss.  
Quebec's future rests really and truly with us.  
Though high you may be in your privileged pew, 
Remember the people are higher than you.  
But respect does not yet put us under your spell.  
Shall kowtow all the seven million tuques in the land.  
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
The important thing is not that Canada win more medals than in the last Olympics. 
Mr. Randy White (Langley-Abbotsford, Ref.):
I met a man one sunny day 
An executive, I'm sad to say 
Who lost his job-a downsizing trend 
It's too bad I said to his face 
Because he was capable to manage any place 
What a great job he could really do 
In Canada's Senate for me and you.  
But he wasn't qualified-I'm sad to say 
He wasn't a Liberal in any way.  
In fact, he had no affiliation 
Just an outstanding Executive his only station.  
Why is it Liberals will throw him to the dogs 
Yet turn all their buddies into political hogs?  
Is paying off favours and providing the carrot 
Better than experience, skills, qualifications or merit?  
Some day a new Senate will be the big story 
It won't include some Liberal or Tory 
It will include people like the man I met 
And they will be competent and objective I bet.  
Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):
I would like to congratulate Susan, Miguel and Denis. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Prairie people are no strangers to winter weather. 
We have always said that it builds character. 
Apparently it has also built an incredible generation of Olympic champions:
Nine medals and we still have one week to go.  
Mr. Denis Paradis (Brome-Missisquoi, Lib.):
It is our culture, our traditions, our customs, and the natural environment.  
Canadians have many reasons to be proud. 
We have two official languages, two main cultures, and complementary legal systems. 
That is what our nation and its founding peoples are all about. 
Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou-Antigonish-Guysborough, PC):
Mr. John McKay (Scarborough East, Lib.):
The discipline of party politics grants to the winning party the right to govern. 
In most instances it works with an informed opposition.  
A lawsuit is a very crude instrument. 
There is a winner and there is a loser. 
There is a limited view of the issue.  
The year 1998 should be the year that parliament reviews that doctrine.  
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
The reality is that both have to be respected.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
It is a consultation.  
We made that very clear in the House of Commons and in Quebec. 
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
In other words, they have been led to believe that it is either or. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We have taken a lot of steps to correct the grievances of the past.  
There is one thing that is clear. 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
The majority have passed resolutions. 
We are waiting to see if they all will pass a resolution. 
Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey-White Rock-Langley, Ref.):
What is the problem? 
What is he afraid of?  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, just to send the declaration is not necessarily consultation. 
We also need a mechanism for them to reply. 
The Reform Party did it on its own the other day. 
I do not think it is urgent at this time. 
This declaration has been signed by all the premiers. 
It is being done at the provincial level. 
REFERENCE TO SUPREME COURT 
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):
He keeps on making the same mistakes.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
The court has work to do this week. 
Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):
I understand why the Prime Minister is embarrassed to answer, Mr. Speaker? 
So, the Bloc should respect judicial independence.  
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Industry. 
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon-Rosetown-Biggar, NDP):
Why will he not tell us that it is here to stay?  
Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):
This time it is the auto pact.  
We are going to see that it gets stronger, not weaker.  
REFERENCE TO SUPREME COURT 
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
We prefer to deal with one issue at a time. 
I just listed the issues that we managed to settle.  
Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):
As a result he almost lost the country. 
Has he not learned anything from that referendum?  
Quebeckers and Canadians want the country to work. 
Right Hon. Jean Chretien (Prime Minister, Lib.):
Right Hon. Jean Chretien:
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):

Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, it sounds more like the Bre-X approach to me. 
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
REFERENCE TO SUPREME COURT 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.  
At any rate, Mr. Fortier is now pleading his case before the court. 
Mr. Pierre Brien (Temiscamingue, BQ):
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Such exemptions would invalidate the act.  
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Today the deficit is on the cusp of being eliminated. 
I think we will have to let Canadians judge that result.  
REFERENCE TO SUPREME COURT 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Now we are going to be speaking about independence.  
The prestige of the Supreme Court of Canada is recognized worldwide. 
Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Of the 90,000 people who have been infected half are dead. 
The provinces have already dismissed outright the offer by the federal government. 
What will the minister be bringing to the table tomorrow?  
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
We, along with our provincial counterparts, will be doing our very best to achieve that.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):
Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):

Mr. Speaker, an investigation is under way. 
It is conducted by Mr. Newman, who is an experienced investigator.

Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his extremely relevant question.  
It has dropped very significantly.  
Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie-Bathurst, NDP):
Perhaps he would then be able to understand.  
Are the reality and the facts not enough?  
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Now we are making the right decisions because we understand what is going on. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Our most talented Canadians are leaving Canada to work elsewhere.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
We have brought down the deficit. 
We have brought down interest rates. 
Mr. Scott Brison (Kings-Hants, PC):
Since 1993 this minister has increased income taxes as a per cent of GDP.  
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
I have a whole book about the Tory record.  
Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie-Simcoe-Bradford, Lib.):
Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):
Last week the father of one of them buried his young son. 
Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
He raises a very serious issue.  
SMALL BUSINESS ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS 
Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the President of the Treasury Board.  
The hon. member for Palliser.  
Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence.  
Now other communities appear to be subject to this ASD flu as well.  
Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has the wrong focus on the program. 
I know that concerns have been raised by people in that community. 
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):
Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, it has already started. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):
No information is released. 
We value that confidence which we maintain. 
We do not release the confidential information of taxpayers.  
Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ):
I will allow the parliamentary secretary to answer if he so wishes.  
Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Lib.):
Ms. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):
He did not answer my question.  
Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):
Ms. Diane St-Jacques (Shefford, PC):
Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):
Together with the provinces, we set up a national child benefit system. 
This is a lot more important than indexing the benefits. 
This is a much broader initiative.  
I would hope that we could cut this time down in future.

The date of award of these orders is not known. 
Mr. Speaker, I would ask that the remaining questions be allowed to stand.  
Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi, Lib.):
The 45-day period has expired. 
When can the people of Abitibi-Temiscamingue expect answers to my questions?  
Mr. Speaker, I have made a note of the question. 
I will look into it and get back to the member.  
Shall the remaining questions stand?  
SMALL BUSINESS LOANS ACT 
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I understand where the hon. member is coming from. 
I will put it very simply and very quickly. 
Is the SBLA a subsidy to the banks?  
Yes, we need to review small business loans. 
The auditor general made some comments. 
We will have a comprehensive review. 
I do not believe that should be done.  
I think it is part of making things happen in our country.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
I travelled around the province and met with small business people. 
This program has existed for 37 years. 
All parties that have formed a government in this place have supported it. 
That loan cannot be for purposes of debt consolidation. 
It cannot be for anything where there is no security. 
This is not a slam dunk by any stretch of the imagination. 
With the $200,000 loan the small business will acquire assets. 
Those assets are in many cases manufactured by other small businesses. 
Think about the benefits to women entrepreneurs. 
We all know how the banks operate. 
They will lend you money only when you do not need it. 
We will make sure they have all the data they need.  
If someone wants to start a business they have to buy equipment. 
The member says it is taxes. 
It is to a degree. 
I do not disagree with that. 
Can they do better? 
Can we have lower taxes? 
I have some sympathy for Paul's garage and for small business.  
It is their own personal ideology. 
What is the matter with them? 
This program shows the way governments should operate. 
Indeed it is not a subsidy. 
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
I on the other hand come from the real world. 
I can appreciate that the hon. member had ample security. 
I take some exception to being referred to as an Ottawa politician. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
I wish to ask the member what he thinks about the three following questions:
Does he believe that the merger would benefit small businesses in his riding? 
Does he think the Minister of Finance should say no to the merger right now? 
Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):
Will the member respond?  
It is a highly successful program. 
Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the hon. member for Kelowna.  
In this case it is $210 million. 
We should not be surprised by that. 
We have seen it already in programs like the infrastructure program. 
In fact I heard the treasury board president talking about that today. 
The government has done it again with the Small Business Loans Act. 
I do not see any sense in that. 
I would argue that it is completely contrary to common sense. 
What is the sense in that?  
That does not make any sense. 
We have to get away from that type of thinking. 
It does not work.  
I want to talk for a moment about what does work. 
We do not want to be negative here. 
I do believe that the government has fallen prey to the law of unintended consequences. 
Let us figure out how we can help small business. 
There are a number of things.  
The first thing is we need more competition in the banking industry. 
Hardly and we have seen our dollar fall as a result of that. 
They went to the United States.  
We need to attract those people here. 
When they come here they bring investment. 
We have to start paying down the debt to attract those people. 
That is what is important.  
Let us start to pay down the debt. 
It is a good deal all around.  
But they sure do say ``Let us lower payroll taxes. 
In fact they could literally be taxed out of business. 
Let us get those payroll taxes down.  
We talk about the small business exemption of $200,000 which should be raised. 
My friend from Saskatoon pointed this out earlier. 
Let us look at some other alternatives. 
It is time to embrace market liberalism. 
We believe that it makes sense to offer people incentives to invest. 
Mr. John Maloney (Erie-Lincoln, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the remarks of the member for Medicine Hat. 
I have a question for the member. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his question. 
In other words, we are subsidizing the banks.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I have two quick questions for the member. 
Does he agree with his party leader that the banks should merge? 
Is it okay for foreign banking competition to come into the country carte blanche?  
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his question but his premise is wrong. 
What is important here is how the consumer is served. 
We are certainly standing up for the people of western Canada when we say that. 
That is where we come down on the issue. 
Certainly that cannot be the position of the New Democratic Party.  
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
That seems to be falling on deaf ears on the Liberal side. 
Mr. Speaker, I think that is an excellent question. 
My friend had collateral. 
That does not make any sense.  
I have a rhetorical question for my friends across the way. 
Why do they not address this? 
Everybody knows it is wrong. 
Why do they not do something about it?  
Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):
That is not the point at all. 
There has been a total and complete misrepresentation of what we are talking about.  
The particular program is supposed to increase jobs. 
He asked how many jobs were created. 
These are very significant questions.  
The program is supposed to help small business improve. 
How does the act propose that the business be measured? 
What is the improvement? 
There are no statistical indicators of what constitutes improvement.  
Some obvious measures could be level of sales. 
Is the profitability of the company a little higher? 
Is its productivity higher? 
Is it more competitive? 
How many products were developed? 
What is the net employment impact? 
What is the overall business success? 
These suggestions ought to be made and ought to be included.  
The program was supposed to be there to help small business. 
My colleagues across the way have made a big point about small business. 
I draw attention to a paragraph found in the auditor general's report. 
It is a rather significant one.  
That is a blatant abuse of the provisions of the act. 
Yet there was no indication as to why this was done. 
Why does this act not have that provision? 
It should have done it already. 
It does not need the $1 billion. 
The government wants another $1 billion on top of that. 
That is the gist of that provision.  
It is interesting that there is no change in this regard at all. 
I think that needs to be addressed as well.  
Three-quarters of the defaults are in new enterprises. 
Has that been figured into the risk situation? 
We have no indication that is in fact the case.  
The auditor general's estimate stands at $210 million. 
That says nothing about some other areas that could come into question.  
Another thing really bothers me. 
Does the department have enough information? 
The auditor general makes a rather interesting observation in section 29.64:  
There is some indication that some lending institutions did not. 
These very serious questions have to be addressed. 
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
Their approach is to kill the program.  
They are the ones that are abusing the program. 
You said the banks are allowing these loans to go forward. 
That is not what we said. 
That is not what my hon. colleague said. 
That is not what I said. 
It is not the case at all.  
I want to make that abundantly clear.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
I am curious about the aspect of the lender. 
Mr. Speaker, some very simple things could be done.  
If those things were done, then it would work. 
Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Vaughan-King-Aurora, Lib.):
The sites are located on Strategis, Industry Canada's interactive web site. 
Twenty-two communities across Canada are taking part. 
This site is one of the busiest on Strategis. 
makes available many, many resources. 
What does that mean? 
It gives us a competitive edge as a nation. 
Why is that important? 
It will give them the tools to further their economic and social development. 
For rural communities, technology is their friend. 
My colleagues will continue on stressing some of these points. 
I have touched upon some of the key issues in my 10 minutes. 
Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):
Again I am amazed by the rhetoric of members of the Reform Party. 
I do not know where they have been. 
This program would give needed capital to small business.  
Where have they been? 
We are talking about small businesses with one to twenty employees. 
Maybe that is what big business would do. 
Maybe medium size business would do that. 
Our government dealt with the deficit. 
They were saying that we must decrease taxes. 
We have to make choices and our government is making choices. 
We are dealing with the debt. 
I would like to see income tax reduction in Canada. 
We are dealing with that in a targeted way. 
Does he have a crystal ball? 
I would like to know his methodology. 
How can he make the assertion that these loans would have been made anyway? 
I have talked to small business people who very much like this program. 
I have talked to bankers. 
The bankers say this is an incredibly good program. 
It helps them to package financing. 
I have been critical of the banks. 
I said how are you rewarded? 
But they are also judged on how many bad loans they make. 
We have seen the banks get into the high technology sector. 
They are making progress but we have a long way to go.  
It works on a very simple model called risk and return. 
When there is a higher risk it will charge more interest. 
Why have the Canadian banks here not embraced it? 
What can be more realistic or more reasonable?  
It realizes that the world is changing. 
We have more technology. 
Therefore we are letting it in.  
We are sending some signals that they should be more supportive of small business. 
They are doing things but they have to do a lot more. 
They have to stretch a lot harder.  
It is my idea. 
I put all the work into it. 
I developed the business plan. 
I tell them this bank will sit down with them. 
They know they will then still own their business.  
It cannot cherry pick. 
It has to be with start-up businesses right from day one. 
Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):
Their way to solve a problem is to throw money at it. 
They do not think beyond the first level. 
We have worked very hard toward that.  
That is where the real problem lies.  
Look at the employment insurance provisions and the taxes there. 
Who does it affect the most? 
Their premiums will go up significantly. 
Their idea is to throw money at them and hope that the problem goes away. 
Yes, we have some grave concerns. 
We have seen the Airbus scandal. 
How did they solve that? 
Pull out the cheque book and keep offering more and more until they finally accept. 
Look at the Pacific salmon dispute on the west coast. 
We saw all these lawsuits coming forward and the government trying to broker a deal. 
Our government's solution is to offer them a $2.7 million settlement.  
It has not done anything. 
I will sum up in a few words. 
Talk about the rhetoric of Reformers. 
It looks like they get their speeches by cutting and pasting. 
They talk about subsidies to business. 
Frankly, we cannot afford it any more.  
We should be supporting financing for small business.  
The member opposite also talks about payroll taxes as he calls them. 
I think everybody in this House should support it.  
Mr. Antoine Dube (Levis, BQ):
It is a pretty thin bill.  
Despite the thinness of the bill, we in the Bloc Quebecois are in favour. 
It will not be very hard to make some good suggestions. 
But the government nonetheless reduced the eligible portion from 90% to 85%.  
Is this indicative of a trend? 
It is important to look at his recommendations. 
He found that, in some respects, control was lacking. 
I would now like to address the situation of small business in Quebec in particular. 
In Quebec, 98% of companies are small and medium size businesses. 
This is very important.  
These figures are interesting. 
So, Quebec society is undergoing some changes. 
These are employment sectors to be considered, like the others.  
This is a very significant contribution.  
Does the loan help create or maintain jobs?  
We have to look at priorities.  
We can see that SMBs in Quebec are dynamic and play a major role.  
I do not want my remarks to be interpreted as an attack on large businesses. 
I had one large business in my riding called MIL Davie. 
Nearly 11,600 businesses benefited in one year. 
That is a lot, that is significant. 
That is when businesses are in need. 
There is nothing in this for the working capital. 
There is nothing in this to add true liquidity. 
So, some improvements will have to be made.  
Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I have a few questions for my hon. colleague in the Bloc Quebecois.  
When that study came out it was forced under the carpet. 
If Quebec separates who will be its biggest trading partner? 
It will be English.  
He is asking about the post-sovereignty period. 
First of all, there was the 1995 referendum. 
But the situation is still there. 
Quebec is doing all it can to get by.  
I heard reactions about EI. 
One third of EI benefits go to Quebeckers. 
What you are telling us is we will be worse off if we leave. 
Yes, unlike those provinces, we get equalization payments. 
But, instead of telling us that, you are condescending.  
We are asking for more flexibility, more freedom. 
We are saying ``Give us the means and you will see. 
We will continue to be economic partners, to have economic relations''. 
Then you tell us about the north-south direction of trade. 
It is no different in Quebec. 
That is all we are asking''.  
Mr. Andre Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):
I would like to raise the following point with him. 
There is also the whole aspect of training. 
The hon. member for Levis has the floor for a very brief response.  
I think that will make a substantial difference.  
In that sense, I am rather optimistic.  
Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
I look at the employment figures. 
Some million new jobs have been created. 
That is a net gain. 
The Prime Minister took on the role of Captain Canada, as many have called him. 
Let us not sell short big business. 
It is as important to the country as small business. 
There is no question availability of capital is an absolute must for business.  
It is so vital. 
Small business contributed to 81% of new job creation in 1996. 
We are repaid in many ways.  
Some have called it a subsidy to business. 
The government has taken on that responsibility. 
It is doing a comprehensive review of the small business loans program. 
That is why these adjustments are being introduced in the act today. 
Think of the kind of supports there are. 
Every one of the Reform ridings has thousands of small businesses in it. 
Each one of those small businesses needs the support that is offered through this act. 
That is how important it is.  
I would also suggest that we consider others who are talking about this program. 
The Canadian Federation of Independent Business strongly supports this plan. 
They will allow the communities which require services to have those services. 
These loans will allow entrepreneurs to begin businesses. 
I suggest that the costs are horrendous for someone to get into business today. 
They have to buy equipment. 
They have to buy stock to sell to their customers. 
We need to have financial mechanisms in place to support those businesses. 
They were unable to compete. 
They were unable to turn a profit in the first few years.  
There are many businesses in that position.  
They accessed some $2 billion in financing. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
As we stated earlier, the Progressive Conservative Party will be supporting this legislation. 
Is that the intent? 
Do they want to approve other loans?  
In those financial institutions there are certain criteria. 
Someone can have a tremendously great business plan. 
We know the costs in that program. 
We support that very much.  
Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):
In my riding of Etobicoke-Lakeshore there are over 3,600 businesses. 
Maintaining a strong economy is vital to the success of our economy. 
Access to capital is their number one problem. 
There is a history to the Small Business Loans Act. 
The lender is responsible for the rest. 
The Small Business Loans Act program is not a subsidy to business. 
Lenders pay for the cost of the program through a one time loan registration fee. 
Very few of those loans are in default.  
The $1 billion addition to the program is necessary at this point in time.  
Administrative and default costs are low. 
We have heard about the support this program gives to small businesses. 
I speak of the individuals who look to what we call micro credit. 
Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I find it easy to agree with most of member's remarks. 
What does the member think of the current situation? 
Banks are not meeting the needs of small businesses with the capital that they need. 
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Between 1993 and 1995, taxpayers were on the hook for $210 million in defaulted loans. 
The minister has addressed the auditor general's report. 
The member is fully cognizant of the government's response in this regard.  
Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre, NDP):
The SBLA provides another alternative source of funding for businesses in this country. 
The SBLA is a leveraging program. 
The NDP has supported the Small Business Loans Act program in the past. 
The first and most important engine of our economy is the business community. 
Members of the business community risk the capital. 
We feel this is a very important component of our economy. 
The second engine of our economy is the co-op sector. 
Co-ops are very important, as is the credit union sector. 
We have business as one of the major engines of the economy. 
We have co-ops as another major engine. 
The third engine of our economy is the government sector.  
The government sector is obviously not supported by Reformers. 
They want to see the elimination of police services in our communities. 
They want to see the elimination of fire protection. 
They want to see the degradation of education and health care. 
They want business to run the whole shebang.  
Canadians see through their very transparent policy situation. 
Vote for Reform and we will prove it''.  
Mr. Speaker, I have a question. 
Hon. members sometimes say things that other hon. members disagree with. 
It is not uncommon for that to happen in the Chamber. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on on the same point order. 
All hon. members are taken to be speaking of things they believe to be true. 
That is what we have here.  
They do not want to talk about the truth or things that are accurate. 
There is an important situation in Canada with respect to the SBLA. 
I remind my colleagues in other parties about the importance of small business. 
The NDP is very supportive of small business. 
The small business community in Saskatchewan supports the NDP in a very broad way. 
There are about 1,200 businesses in my constituency. 
About 98% of small businesses in Canada area actually employing 50 people or less. 
That means there is a large number of small businesses in Canada. 
That is a very significant number. 
About 861,000 or 90% of that figure employ 20 people or less. 
This is the type of business that looks for alternative financing in Canada. 
This is where the SBLA is very important.  
In 1995 small business represented 43% of GDP in Canada. 
In 1997 one out of two Canadians were employed by or owned a small business. 
The message is loud and clear''.  
What were they talking about? 
Were they talking about the SBLA or other issues? 
However they are still collecting it. 
They are calling it the BST, the blended sales tax. 
Of course, the government is very heartily cheered on by the Reform Party.  
They need all the help they can get.  
Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Industry, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened to the last message very clearly. 
There have been some comments made about the banks and about lenders. 
I understand my colleague supports the bill. 
Could he expand on items? 
They are part of the SBLA program.  
Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):
Also there was an effect on agriculture.  
For the record, let me make two points. 
They would have to pay back that money. 
It would put tens of thousands of businesses out of business right now. 
There was less tax and fewer jobs in Saskatchewan all right. 
The province is bankrupt because of the bloody policies of the Reform Party.  
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
Many Reform members have a lot of business experience. 
How many businesses has the hon. career politician from Regina-Lumsden-Lake Centre operated?  
I also had a consulting business on two separate occasions. 
Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk-Interlake, Ref.):
I apologize to you, Mr. Speaker, for rising on a point of order. 
As a result, I apologize.  
It would be out of order and so I will not do that.  
Does he stand by those statements?  
Many of those people who were involved with the Reform style government of Grant Devine- 
Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon-Humboldt, Ref.):
He was a member of the party that bankrupted the province. 
The Reform Party does not seem to get it. 
I do not think that is the case. 
Ms. Sarmite Bulte (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for Waterloo-Wellington.  
Small business is the growth engine of our economy. 
But small businesses need access to capital.  
Unfortunately a lot of things have not changed. 
Women still have a difficult time getting access to capital. 
We as a government must do something to help them.  
She had a great idea. 
With my intervention we were able to bring the banks together. 
I am happy to report that my constituent was able to get a loan.  
Let us not underestimate the value of women entrepreneurs in Canada. 
Women own 700,000 businesses in Canada. 
Women entrepreneurs are an economic phenomena to be dealt with and recognized.  
The numbers I heard varied. 
It was not always a $250,000 limit. 
They are stable and they do not take risks that easily. 
They will be there for years. 
It brings investment to this country.  
We as a government are investing in jobs. 
Employees working in small business are getting the benefit of the growth in small businesses. 
It is a complete success story.  
The priority of this government is job creation. 
One of the things this government is trying to do is target youth employment.  
What a success that was.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the member on her speech.  
The people from the Royal Bank who were hosting the event were most co-operative.  
They have departments geared to dealing with the special concerns of women entrepreneurs. 
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, my question will be quite simple and quite plain. 
My wife is an independent business person and works very hard at what she does. 
I just want to ask one simple question. 
It will be dealt with after the task force reports. 
Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):
Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the member on the opposite side. 
I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, I did not understand the question. 
Could I ask the hon. member to repeat it, please.  
Mr. Speaker, women entrepreneurs are simply an economic phenomena in this country. 
They form part of small business in this country. 
Their concerns are also shared by many of the male business owners in my riding. 
They too have the same problems. 
Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo-Wellington, Lib.):
It is sometimes argued that the SBLA represents a subsidy to small business. 
That is very important.  
This simply is not true. 
It is very important to note that this is in support of small businesses. 
They rely on it and they most certainly need it.  
The statistics indicate that the system is working well. 
That is most impressive.  
It is more complicated than that. 
This would have meant lost jobs, which is unacceptable. 
It simply is not right. 
First, banks have introduced a code of conduct. 
The House has heard the proposal of the Minister of Natural Resources. 
There is no consent.  
Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville-Eastern Shore, NDP):
Mr. Speaker, I will be asking this question for the third time today. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for the question. 
It is important to note. 
We should do so expeditiously.  
Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):
I do not know that there was a suggested figure. 
It seemed somewhat arbitrary. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for the point. 
It is an important one. 
Mr. John Herron (Fundy-Royal, PC):
They are not the average loans required by the small business sector.  
It was very convoluted.  
I think we should proceed with that expeditiously.
